No one remembered my birthday... I turned 14 today and not a single one of my friends has wished me. Literally not even my sister remembered, and only my parents wished me happy birthday. So yeah, I donâ€™t wanna admit it but Iâ€™m kinda upset because a kid in my friend groupâ€™s birthday was a few days ago and everyone remembered his birthday. Iâ€™ve never been popular but Iâ€™ve always had a few close friends, so itâ€™s really disappointing that none of them remembered. Hence I come to Reddit to tell yâ€™all my problems. Thanks for reading.
