So uhhh... I had a dream.... I had a dream that i was going around on a rampage killing everything i layed eyes on. It started of as me going hunting for deer. I ended up accidentally shooting a person. In order to hide the body i ate it. All of it. Then i had a sudden lust for blood. After that i went home and killed my wife and child. I then consumed them. I decided to clean myself up and go for a walk, so i did. I took a shower then i went for a walk. I saw a fairly small group of teens so i decided to go after them. Just as i took one down i noticed one was calling the cops. I ran after her but couldn't catch her. It was like one of those neverending hallways. It just kept getting longer and longer, untill i could see her no more.i went back to the others and had a feast. Luckily it was decently close to a forest i could drag the corpses into.  I decoded to start going for smaller children as they cant run fast. So as the days went on, more and more people started to go 'missing'. The cops ignored it at first, but when i took the chiefs child they were on high alert. I hadn't eaten the child yet, for i was planning something. I told them where to find me. They got there in a few minutes. I had his child in my arms and his child was screaming frantically. It was then, that I went too far. I stared him in the eyes as i snapped the head of his kid right in front of him. They were quick to react. Almost as soon as you could hear the wet, cold sound of a neck snapping, the gunfire began. I ended up getting shot in my left shoulder and my right thigh. I had to retreat otherwise id die. So i ran. i didnt make it far. They caught up to me and they took me to the town center to have me tortured. I was to be cut apart as slowly as possible. That was my wildest dream ive ever had.
