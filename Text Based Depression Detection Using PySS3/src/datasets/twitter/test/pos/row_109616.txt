I mean ZERO offense by this, but it's 2 am and i rly want to know, so can someone with a history of self harm answer these questions? First i want to repeat that i mean NO offense, and i'm aware that it's a serious issue. 

second, how did you start harming yourself? did you just do it randomly and decided you liked it or?  

third, why do you keep doing it, doesn't it... hurt?
