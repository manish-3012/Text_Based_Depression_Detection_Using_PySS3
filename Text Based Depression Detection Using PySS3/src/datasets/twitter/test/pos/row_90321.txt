Yeah I got Disney Plus... ... time to watch Ratatoulle for the 50th time this month. Like cmon man. **do not** get disney plus. You get a weeks worth of content and then they dont add it on. And they legit just made a disney plus prime service that just adds on the live action Mulan.  How many times do we have to teach you Disney. We do not want live action remakes. Let alone pay an extra $23 a month just to watch a movie that nobody likes.
