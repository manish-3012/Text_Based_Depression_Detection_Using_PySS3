wanting too much too fast Do you guys ever feel like you stress out bc you really want to make the most of a situation? I was thinking about when it comes to social situations or anything I feel like shit bc Iâ€™m not doing enough like I could be doing all these things rn and my life could be going so much better but Iâ€™m not doing it. It really sucks bc no matter what I do thereâ€™s always a better choice that could have lead me in a better direction if you get what Iâ€™m saying which is why I get upset about past mistakes that I made. I try my hardest to get all this shit done like when Iâ€™m talking to someone Iâ€™m ready to jump in and talk about a 100 different things at once. Because of that Iâ€™m not able to really be close to them bc we couldnâ€™t talk in depth about one thing. Itâ€™s just that at the beginning itâ€™s like I have this checklist of shit I wanna talk about and itâ€™s all gotta get done and then I realize that we should have taken things much slower.
