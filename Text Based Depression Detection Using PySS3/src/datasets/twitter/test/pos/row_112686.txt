Idk about the rest of the world, but the Irish education system is really garbage 
It's made so that only smart people can pass it, and everyone else is stuck and forced to catch up and learn shit we won't ever need, like half the shit we learn in maths, and the fucking Irish language. 
Cause that language has been dead for a long time but students in Ireland are still forced to learn it because it's pArt Of IrISh CuLTuRe. 


Fucking forcing us to learn, then saying having a social life is important for a teenager to have good mental health, but then giving us a fuckton of homework, which in turn, doesn't allow us to go out and have the social life we need.
And then saying they care about our mental health, and bullying, but then not giving a shit if a student is depressed and showing signs of considering suicide, or if a student is getting bullied. 
They don't care.
That's it
They don't fucking care about our mental health as students.

Thank you for coming to my ted talk.
