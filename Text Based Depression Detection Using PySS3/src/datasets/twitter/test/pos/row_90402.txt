My parents have some ass-backwards logic. So I was just at the dinner table right? Finishing my dinner and I talked with my mouth full, which I admit is disgusting, and my step dad says "you're not allowed to call people out on things if you do it yourself." Naturally I ask when I do that. He points to my mom and says I do it to her all the time, which I *sometimes* do because it's disgusting and I'd like her to have manners right? And get this, my step dad does it all the time AND my mother calls him out on it. 


What in the actual *FUCK*.
