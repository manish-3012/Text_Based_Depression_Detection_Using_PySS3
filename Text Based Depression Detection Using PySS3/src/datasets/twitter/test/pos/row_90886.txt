I have lost today. I now have thrown away the husk broken beyond repair that was once my PC. It had a ryzen 5 1600, gtx 1070 and 16gb ddr4 3200mhz. It was thrown down the stairs by none other than my little brother out of a fit of rage and jealousy 
My warranty expired in July 2019. No choice but to move on.

As it stands, from the current state of things, I canâ€™t get a new pc for at least 4 years. Not until I graduate and could get a proper income.
