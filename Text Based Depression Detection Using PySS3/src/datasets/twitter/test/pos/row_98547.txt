I hate being a band kid &amp;#x200B;

A bit of backstory: I play the trumpet in my school's band class. My school has little rooms to store our instruments in during our other classes called instrument storage lockers. Keep in mind that these rooms are very small and cramped, so it could get pretty crowded during a normal school year. Also, my school is on a rotation schedule for online learning and in-person learning, meaning every week a different "cohort" of kids go in person, and the rest are at home. Onto the thing I'm mad about:

So my school has these specialized masks for playing instruments which have these holes on them (not exactly sure how they work yet) and covers for the bells of our instrument where the sound comes out, meaning that we can play at school.

Doesn't sound so bad, right? 

**WRONG.**

Because of this little thing called Coronavirus, we aren't allowed in the instrument storage lockers because we would be too close together, and we could risk transmitting the virus. This means that I have to carry my pretty heavy trumpet up and down MULTIPLE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS since I can't store it in the instrument storage rooms. Not to mention all the notebooks and workbooks along with a laptop in my bookbag and my lunchbox. I haven't even mentioned how weak my short and skinny ass is, making it EVEN MORE exhausting than it would be for someone else. So now I'm dreading next week when I have to go in person and end up breaking my back because of all the weight I'm carrying. And I'm kicking myself for not choosing something light, like percussion  (I'd only be carrying drumsticks) or a woodwind (flutes and clarinet) instrument. I hope I don't come off as entitled or whiny, and I hope you all have a great day. Except you, Trevor. You know who you are.

TL;DR, I have to carry my trumpet up and down multiple flights of stairs during school because my band class has a safe way to play instruments, but not a safe way to store them.
