School sucks ass Like why the hell are we forced upon loads and loads of homework and education with no real effect?? And textbooks too, we buy them, maybe use them one or two times in a year and yeah thats it. Also if a 20 minute long video is better at teaching me trigonometry than a week of classes, then i think we really have to rethink our education systems
