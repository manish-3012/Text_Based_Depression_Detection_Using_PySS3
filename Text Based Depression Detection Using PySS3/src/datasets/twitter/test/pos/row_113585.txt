Quick storytime bc I'm super embarrassed and feel stupid 3 months later So if you skip to 2:50 on this video: https://youtu.be/_5xo_IhAAp8
A viewer asks a question and it was mine. THEY ARE MARRIED. And of course, I didn't realize it was a video until 3 months later due to my friend telling me so yeah.
