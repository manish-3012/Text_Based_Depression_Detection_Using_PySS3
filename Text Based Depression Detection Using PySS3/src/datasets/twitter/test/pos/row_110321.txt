Teenager Created Song! Lyrics Needed! Suggest Lyrics! Yea, its true alright! This will be a TEENAGER CREATED song, YOU will be making this song  You might ask how will this work, well I'll tell you! (If you don't want to read all this go to TL;DR at the bottom. But please make sure to read "!!! IMPORTANT !!!" at the bottom).

Instructions: All you need to do is create 1-3 sentences of lyrics. For example: "Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me, I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed". It can be lyrics from a song you know (If you can't think of anything or you just want to), or lyrics you made up. It can include swear words if you want (You can censor yourself if you want as well), and it can be about anything or anyone, whether its about politics, Barack Obama, school, rappers, emotion, animals, insects, reddit, pencils, George Washington, shoes, airports, stores, 21 Savage, states, planets, Bruce Lee, things your going through, etc. You get the point, literally anything or anyone! It can be SFW and NSFW. You can shorten words if you want (For example: Idk, idc, wyd, wym). You can make your lyrics rhyme or you don't have to, EVERYTHING IS UP TO YOU!

After all this is done I'll be putting lyrics I like from the comments into the song, put it all in order in a way that makes sense, and it'll turn into an entire song! I'll post the whole thing once it's all finished.

TL:DR -
- 1-3 sentences
- It can be lyrics from a song you know (If you can't think of anything or you just want to), or lyrics you made up
- Lyrics can include swearing (You can censor yourself if you want)
- Lyrics can be about anything or anyone, LITERALLY ANYTHING OR ANYONE
- Lyrics can be SFW and NSFW
- Shortened words can be used (For example: Idk, idc, wyd, wym)
- You can make your lyrics rhyme or you don't have to
- After its all done I'll pick and choose lyrics in the comments, put them in order as I see fit, and make it into an entire song, then I'll post it once the whole thing is done

!!! IMPORTANT !!! - If this goes well I might actually continue this and try to make an entire album made by us teenagers. You guys can even decide on the song names, album name, album cover, how many songs the entire album has, and how long each song is!
