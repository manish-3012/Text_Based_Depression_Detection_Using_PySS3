Someone lost the battle Someone at my school lost the battle to a war going on in their mind. And it saddens me while even though I didn't know him personally I've talked to him. And he was the nicest and kindest person I ever met. And when I went home that day I told my mom what happened. And there was one little shit who said he was a pussy for killing himself and that nobody liked him. I told my mom that and she said she agreed. I have never been more disgusted by something my mom has said. And she knows I have depression. (Which dont worry im not suicidal) and to hear her say this made me emotional. So I just got out of the car as fast as possible went to my room and changed. And she said I was disrespectful for acting like that. Then she went on about how the devil took over his mind and shit. And he was religious and so I said you cant say anything because your God failed to save him and when he wasn't saved he took his life. And my mom said to stop being disrespectful and walked out of my room. I have never been more angered and disgusted in my life.
