Just to spite u/B4ND1_1300X here's avacado pie recipe Ingredients:
9" Graham cracker pie crust
2 avacados-peeled, pitted, and pureed (if they are fibrous or stringy, the pie will not turn out well)
1/2 cup of lemon juice
1 can (5oz) sweetened condensed milk


In medium mixing bowl, combine everything except pie crust. Pour mixture into crust. Chill, and top with whipped cream
