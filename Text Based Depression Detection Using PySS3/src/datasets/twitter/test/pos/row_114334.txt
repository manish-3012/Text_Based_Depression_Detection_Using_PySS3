School teaches us how to work but not how to live If I suddenly aged a couple years and was expected to move out, I wouldn't have a single clue how to move forward. I wouldn't know how to navigate the bank, how to pay bills, how to secure an apartment, how to get a job, any of that. I wouldn't know the stuff that's expected for people to suddenly know the day they turn 18. Why don't schools teach you how to live in modern society? Why are they still afraid of change? What's stopping schools from replacing courses like "ancient history" with courses like "how to not just live on ramen for the first decade of your adulthood"? Please! Teach us things we need to know instead of wasting our time and giving us terrible memories of childhood! 

My childhood has been useless. The only things I've learned that I cherish and use (Morse code, Early Modern English, crochet, various political tidbits) have been from Youtube videos. They've all been things that I did *in spite* of school, not assisted by it. School gives people mild trauma (all the adults I know, even my 40-year-old parents) still have nightmares about not turning in papers on time or not getting enough credits to graduate. 

Dear schools; please stop teaching us useless information. Also, please stop trying to suppress our instinct to socialize; it's very necessary to our development and studies have shown that it's damaging to students' mental health to teach them that socializing is wrong.

Thanks for listening ig
