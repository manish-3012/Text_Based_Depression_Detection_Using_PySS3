I was too shy to look at my crush Well, she knew that I love her (she didn't feel the same) and we stopped chatting 2 months ago. We were friends but I messed it all up. So I saw her at school after 7 months or something and I tried to look at her. I tried but I just didn't. I thought that what if she looks at me badly. I got too shy. Now I feel so fucking bad.
