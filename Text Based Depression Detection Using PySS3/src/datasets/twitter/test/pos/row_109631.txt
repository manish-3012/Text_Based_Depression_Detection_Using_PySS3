I think defunding the police is stupid. I hate the idea of defunding the police.
Before I start I want to say that I support BLM and this is my opinion. I want to start by saying that I hate that people are saying that all cops are bad and racist when that is not the case and defunding the police will not solve that. We should actually be giving the police more funding to improve its programs and properly educate and inform police. It also will allow police to be able to upgrade their facilities and recruit more people. :)
