Why has the LGBT community have so much power to "cancel" people. I was wondering about this because anytime(ik not all the time but more often than not) someone mistakes someone's pronouns or assumes their gender they get a hate mob after them. I understand LGBT has been around for a long time but in recent years it has become much more prolific in society with young people. No one seems to be able to stand up to the community after someone else makes a common mistake of misusing pronouns and it baffles me how they've got so much power that they can cancel someone because they don't see the world the same way they do. It has ultimately led up to people being scared to ask common questions and no one can ever say anything against them without being bombarded with insults. So how has the community got so much power in such a short time?
