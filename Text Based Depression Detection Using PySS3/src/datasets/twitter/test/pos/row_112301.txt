I actually did it. I got a girl's number. So you may not really care, but on Monday of last week I came into class late because I was in the nurses office for a cut I had got. As soon as I walked into class, my crush said she was happy to see me and that she missed me over the weekend. Of course, this got my hopes up. No one has ever told me they missed me, and now someone just did. And it was my crush of all people. I thought about this for a while, and I finally gained the courage to ask for her number. And she actually gave it to me. Might not be that big of a deal to you, but for me, this is huge, seeing as I'm normally a pussy and can't even gather the courage to ask the teacher questions like "how do I solve problem 3?" Or "what did we do yesterday?". 


Now next step is to ask her out.
