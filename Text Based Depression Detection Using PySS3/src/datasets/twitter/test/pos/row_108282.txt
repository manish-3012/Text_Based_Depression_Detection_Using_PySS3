What an asthma attack feels like Asthma is a chronic long-term inflammatory complication where the airways (the tube that carries air in and out of your lungs) become inflamed and narrowed at times. An asthma attack is where your airways become inflamed and narrowed. Things that can trigger an asthma attack include but are not excluded to: air quality, a sudden change in temperature, heat, cold, cold air, physical activity, airborne allergens, hyperventilation from laughing or crying, viral infections, emotional stress, medications, and smoke.

Disclaimer: An asthma attack can come on gradually or happen suddenly and may be life-threatening. The way an asthma attack feels depends on the type of the person's asthma. The normal blood oxygen level range for people with asthma is between 100% and 92%, for normal people (those without asthma) the normal range is 100% to 95%. This description is based on my personal experience with asthma attacks over the course of many years. I can not describe what it is like to have a blood oxygen level below 80%, because I heard bad stuff happens the lower your oxygen level goes and didnt want to find out.

Now for what an asthma attack feels like: When the asthma attack gradually beings you will feel your begins chest tighten, as your airways become more inflamed it will feel like there is a noose around your neck that is being slowly tightened, you may start coughing, wheezing, and experiencing shortness of breath. As the asthma attack worsens the tightness in the chest will begin to feel like more and more weight is being placed on top of your chest, the shortness of breath worsens, your wheezing will become louder. It will start to feel as if you are being strangled, and quite frankly that is exactly what the inflammation is doing to you. As the blood oxygen level dips below 90%, you begin to experience, hypoxia as a result of asphyxiation, caused by the inflammation of the airways, which starts to settle in. As a result of the deprivation of oxygen, you become light-headed and eventually develop tunnel vision. As the blood oxygen level goes below 85% cognitive function starts to become affected. Your rescue inhaler might help a little bit, but the corticosteroid is not a high enough dosage to make the inflammation in the airways subside. The most effective treatment at this point is a breathing treatment from a nebulizer, which will deliver a strong enough dosage of the corticosteroid, making the inflammation subside within minutes. The breathing treatment brings the sweet sweet feeling of relief from the shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, and the airways start to open up again back to their normal size. 

If any of my fellow asthmatics (people with asthma) feel like I forgot something please let me know. Once again this is based off of personal experince.
