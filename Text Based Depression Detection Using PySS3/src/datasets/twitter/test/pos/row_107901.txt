So i met a (sorta) Karen this morning. So i was chillin' in the bus to go to school, when this girl just sat down next to me. This was already weird because ever since lockdown everyone just sits alone unless they're with family or friends, so i was already like "Okay that's kinda awkward but maybe her legs hurt or something". And then she put her on her chin wich confirmed she was a Karen. Oh yeah and also my backpack was on the seat next to me and she pushed it off and since i'm introverted i awkwardly just picked it up because there's no way i'll tell someone off.

So yeah that was fucking awkward and for the rest of the way until my stop i was constantly thinking about stuff like: "Okay but what if you got the virus and you just infect me ? Do you not see the problem in your behaviour ? What if i litterally die because you're selfish ?" But again i'm introverted so i kept all that to myself and tried to forget all of that and focus on my music.
