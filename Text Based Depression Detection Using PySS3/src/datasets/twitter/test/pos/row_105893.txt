For those who have been in cyber school, you now know my pain. I've been wanting to talk about this for a while. Most people started online schooling because of Covid, and they started towards the end of last year. I've heard countless complaints about going to zoom calls and the overly difficult work, and have one response:

6 YEARS.

I HAVE BEEN IN CYBER SCHOOL FOR 6 YEARS.

Up until now, I've told people about how classes have more to teach and you can do it at your own pace, and all they seemed to think was that I was home schooled. Now you may ask yourself, "Is this a troll? Who in their right mind would be online schooled since middle school?" The answer is simple. I switched to cyber school because regular school was a worthless mess and a waste of time. Teachers yelled at me on a regular basis, every day I came home hungry and tired, and I felt like I had learned nothing. Now mind you, in 5th grade I was almost at the top of my class, and I spent most of it reading a book called "Rump; the True Story of Rumpelstiltskin" (good book BTW.). On top of all that, the middle school I would have gone to was an hour away, 1 hour being the time to get there. Every. Single. Day. After I went to cyber school, the zoom calls, or live lessons as we call them, started immediately, but instead of using zoom we used Adobe connect, which in my opinion is superior.

Now to give you an idea what my work schedule is like, today I have to work on American Government, Algebra 2, Chemistry, Literature, and Japanese 3 at the same time. Overdue lessons are the bane of my existence, and school for the most part is not fun. But every now and then,, I look back and remember just how worthless my old school was and am kind of glad for my new school. 

Also, the school I go to is Commonwealth Charter Academy, which is based out of PA. Here's a link to their site, to show proof that this isn't a joke; [https://ccaeducate.me/](https://ccaeducate.me/?utm_campaign=mid-year-2020&amp;utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=learn-more&amp;utm_term=swb-top-funnel&amp;utm_content=eta-historical&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAsOmABhAwEiwAEBR0ZtLTySfXB99UNM1Gosot10FQaPIA18mndwZsAgmhEbISTI6eO16FKRoC0doQAvD_BwE) . But that's my rant, time to get back to the sovereignty and voting rights of African Americans post civil war and ã¦ forms!
