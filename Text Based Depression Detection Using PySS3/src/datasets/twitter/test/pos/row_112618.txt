Just found out kid at my school who took PSAT had covid...I took the PSAT today. Luckily I was in a different testing zone, so I don't need to be qurantined yet...BUT THIS IS FUCKING STUPID. 80 PEOPLE NEED TO BE QURANTINED. But no the idiot showed up to the PSAT with a sniffle and thought it was a cold. 

At least my school quarantines people...

But even with this they're still forcing stupid in person hybrid model on us. Because apparently forcing kids to go to school for half the time is a amazing solution for reintegration. When we're unprepared. We've already had a elementary school in our district close because someone tested positive. But no, just quarantine and it's all fine.

The Covid will be all fine if we just lock away everyone that has Covid and continue to make everyone pretend everything is normal. even worse my school opens all the windows and refuses to turn on heater...aka 3 coats on in class.

Oh and instead of training the teachers to use zoom properly, they leave the 80 year old english teacher by herself and she spends the first month of school not knowing how to use zoom. 

They don't even teach teachers how to engage with students properly and everyone just stares at each other.

Fuck this.
