Girls of r/teenagers, I (14F) think I might be ace. I have never looked at anybody and thought "dang, I wanna bang em". I've seen Sex Education and Shameless, and felt absolutely nothing (and those are some pretty sexual shows).

I've heard a lot of people (specifically my mom) say that girls, in general, are less sexually appealed by visual cues, and tend to prefer emotional connections to that person rather than just focusing on their appearance. But like... why would the term "asexual" even exist if that was the case? So here I am, asking my fellow females the validity of that. Do you have sexual feelings towards other people based on their appearance? Do you feel anything when watching sex scenes on tv (or porn ig). I may just be too young to really know if I'm ace, but I really do feel like I am on the spectrum somewhere. I'm probably grey-sexual. I think sex could be nice with somebody I'm really really close with, but not really for the feeling of it, but the intimacy of it, ya know? Let me know if I should tag this nsfw
