Are my parents right? They are blaming the fact I am having trouble sleeping because of a lack of exercise. I have been having trouble sleeping when the semester started, but my parents donâ€™t see a connection between those two things. They flat out said that a physiatrist wouldnâ€™t help/do anything for me. But they can diagnose me with the lazy, and not a trained professional. The second my twin brother said he was having anxiety, they brought him to a physiatrist very quickly. I also feel like they donâ€™t believe me. They will say â€œDid you get good sleepâ€ wait a sec for me to let out like one word and say â€œOh no of course you didnâ€™tâ€ I am constantly getting x&gt;7 hours of sleep. I have tried waking them up and asking them what I should do but there plans never work. So what do you guys think?
