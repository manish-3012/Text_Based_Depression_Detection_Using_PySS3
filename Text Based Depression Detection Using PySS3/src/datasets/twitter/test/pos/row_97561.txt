My life is improving and it feels great. For the last 4 years my life was pretty terrible. 3 years ago I had a depression (bc I had no friends and I had so much homework I lost motivation, grades werenâ€™t great). Then I got friends, but still I had no confidence. 

Now, I decided to change that. I started taking care of myself (I no longer neglect my appearance, I try to be active, no more porn/masturbation, better sleep schedule). Now I feel good, Iâ€™m not awkward socially anymore because I feel capable. I am going to another school but I see this as an opportunity of meeting new people (at least when courses will not be from home anymore). My past self would have hated going outside of my comfort zone like that. My motivation for my studies is higher than ever and now I can concentrate on my homework despite not taking medication for attention anymore.

I just wanted to tell people about my improvement. I feel like the remaining bits of my depression are gone after almost 3 years. I want to meet new people, by the past I would avoid contact with new people.
