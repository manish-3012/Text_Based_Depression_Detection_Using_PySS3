I'm so sick and tired of this. (Maybe I'm entitled, but if I am I think I at least deserve an explanation that's better than, "bEcAUsE i SaID sO!") 1 Hour. That's all I was given, one measly hour to do some gaming today. Why? Because I played "All Day" yesterday according to my mom. Bitch, I'll have you know I spent a good portion of yesterday afternoon when you couldn't hear me doing my weekend homework for Alg 1. And you want to know why I was on for so long even if it wasn't the whole day? BECAUSE I WAS SO FUCKING TIRED AND WINDED FROM ALL THE BIKE RIDING I'VE BEEN DOING THIS PAST WEEK TO AVOID YOU AND YOUR STRICT RULES, BITCH! LIKE, WHO JUST TELLS THEIR KID, "It's okay to get Bs" AND THEN GETS MILDLY CONCERNED AND ANGRY WHEN THEIR'S AN 89 ON THE REPORT CARD? I AVOID YOU BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEEM TO MAKE ANY LOGICAL SENSE!

smh mom.

Yes I know, this is all over the place, but I needed to blow off some steam.
