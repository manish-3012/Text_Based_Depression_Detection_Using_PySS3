What Is With Everyone Having Social Interactions Except Me? Recently, I've been noticing that most of the posts in hot on r/teenagers are talking about their social interactions. For example, post saying 'i asked my crush out. we held hands and hugged', posts talking about going to a party, and mainly stuff about things that happen in school. Am I the only one who is actually staying home during the quarantine, and not socially interacting at all?
