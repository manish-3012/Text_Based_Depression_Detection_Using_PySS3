My Friend Told Me That He Wants To Die My friend lives in a rented room in our city. We study in same college. Due to lockdown colleges are closed. So, heâ€™s in his home, which is really far away from this city. 

My friend was off social media for the whole day and a few minutes ago he messaged me that he wants to die. I messaged him saying that things are going to get well soon. Heâ€™s tensed about not finding anything that interests him and heâ€™s afraid about how he would end up in the future. I tried to call him, heâ€™s not receiving calls and not replying to my messages. Guys, please suggest me what should I do now.
