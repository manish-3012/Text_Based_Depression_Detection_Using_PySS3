So someone referenced my recent (VERY popular) post in my YT comments So I was looking on YouTube, and I get a notification while watching a video. I click on it, and it's someone saying "Why did you download the house?" (Look at my recent post for context) This gave me quite the chuckle, so I decided to heart it.
