Are you single? Well the Princess Bride can help you with that. 
I just thought of this. But if a guy likes a girl heâ€™s already friends with, but doesnâ€™t want to tell her in an upfront way, you can just say â€œas you wishâ€ whenever she says anything remotely requesting something. And if you say it enough, sheâ€™ll realize you mean something else. That sheâ€™s your buttercup. Also, this will test whether sheâ€™s cultured or not so itâ€™s a win win. Let me know if you try it ever lol. 

As a girl, I wish someone did this to me lol it would have been so cute. Woulda melted mah heart.

Have as great a day as possible
