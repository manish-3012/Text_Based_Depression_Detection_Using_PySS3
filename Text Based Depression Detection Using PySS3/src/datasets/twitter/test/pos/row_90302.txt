Day 2 of inviting open minded people to a free speech chat. Title. I've made a Free Speech chat where you can voice your opinions, and the other people will judge them within the margins of respect.

Absolutely not a safe space. Your ideas will be challenged and you'll have to defend them.

Controversial topics are encouraged to be discussed, and any bitchy behavior will result in you being removed, but hopefully that doesn't happen.

If you're interested let me know in thr comments. We're only 9 people so far, and the more diverse ideas we hace the better.

Have a great day, and thanks for reading this!
