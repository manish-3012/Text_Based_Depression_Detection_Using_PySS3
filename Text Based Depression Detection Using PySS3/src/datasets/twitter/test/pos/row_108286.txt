Just need to vent Hey everyone at whatever time it is where you are. It is a Sunday evening for me and I canâ€™t wait for a yet another monotonous week in high school.

Like I get I should be grateful to have access to education, I get that Iâ€™ll â€œlook back at this fondlyâ€ but like.

Iâ€™m gonna wake up in like 6-7 hours, go zone out in my classes because teachers donâ€™t understand how to make material engaging, do homework for the rest of the afternoon plus chores and have a lovely 1 hour where Iâ€™m not â€œasleepâ€ to myself before I go in my room to wait until the next day. Where it all repeats again.

Like whatâ€™s to look forward to? Breaks are just periods between this monotonous routine and inevitably they end and Iâ€™ll have to go back to school. I have friends who all seem to have problems worse than me and I feel guilty even venting to them.

Like idk what the point of any of this is.

Thanks to whoever took the time to read this and sorry if it formats weirdly, am on mobile.
