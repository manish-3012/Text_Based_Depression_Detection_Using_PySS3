Why Must I Sleep So Much? 
Iâ€™ve set a schedule for myself. I go to bed at nine, and wake up a six. Two out of three days, I follow that fine.

On the third day, I always end up sleeping in. Itâ€™s not just an extra hour, itâ€™s usually an additional nine to ten.  

Yeah, every third day I get about nineteen hours of sleep. Itâ€™s insane.

Why am I like this? What can I do about this?
