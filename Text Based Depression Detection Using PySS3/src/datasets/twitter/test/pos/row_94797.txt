A little rant about who I live with I really don't fucking like my family. My parents have so much relationship problems( as well as hard headed personal problems)  that I'm convinced that they even love each other. The way they talk to each other is as if they're just trying to resure that they love each other to their kids. They argue about the most pointless shit. Now about them personally,

One of them is a "loser" to put it simply. And they're also the type of person to believe in flat earth. The other one is just dumb, dumb with her disissions. But the part about them the most is how helicopter protective of me. they suspect that I'm gay (which I am)and of course being the homophobes they're they will make sure to bug me about what I'm looking at and scower through my stuff to see if I'm doing something inappropriate. They're very weird parents.

But my siblings are the more worst. One of them just absolutely hates life and her family. And tbh I hate her as well. Everytime she walks by me she gives me a stank look and curses me out under her breath. And curse her back out under mine. The other one is just annoying and goes out everyday and comes back at 2 in the morning. Either high or drunk.

I'm glad I have this reddit to come tho, to air out this to random people. To put simply in summary, 

FUCK FAMILY
