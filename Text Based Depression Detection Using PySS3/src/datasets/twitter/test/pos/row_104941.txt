My dad watches K.S.I on Facebook... Today I was with my dad and I heared a guy laughing on his phone. I asked him what he was seeing and he said "it's a guy here on Facebook who does laughing videos ".
I gave it a peak and I found out that the "guy" was K.S.I.

I am really confused...

(nothing against K.S.I btw)
