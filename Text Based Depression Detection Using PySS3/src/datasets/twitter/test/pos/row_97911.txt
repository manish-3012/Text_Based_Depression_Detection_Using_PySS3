I dont need anybody to talk to, this is just to relieve myself I dont need to talk. Do not offer me your help. It wont work. These are my thoughts.

Is it normal to hear voices in my head? Are those my thoughts? Are they something else? Water is ice cold, I wanna dive in and never come back up. Bridges! How I love them, the gaze you have when you look down. The deeper a fall, the better enjoyment. **Im ok**. Where could I hide my cuts? On my forearms? Visible, hard to hide with swimming practices. My legs? Will it even give me pleasure of pain? Im fat anyway. **Im happy***.* Starving? Hey, Ill loose some weight. I cant do that. Im weak. Cant bond to my commitments. Burns? Rather freeze to death.

Let animals eat me alive. At least Ill feel *something.* I wanna cry. Scream. Scream in agony or fear. Anything would help. **Im fine.** Dont worry, Im enough of an burden. Hahaha, Im not ok. **Im fine, nothing wrong at all**. I wanna choke someone. I want anyone to suffer. **Definitely normal.** I wanna stab something with knife violently. Shut up. Shut up, shut up, shut up. **Im perfect.** Not healthy, not good, not enough.

**Remember to smile :)**
