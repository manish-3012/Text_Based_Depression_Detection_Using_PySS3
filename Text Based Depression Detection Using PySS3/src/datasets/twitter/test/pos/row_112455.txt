Help me with my relationship please I M[16] get nauseous when I go on food dates with my girlfriend [17].

So I donâ€™t know why. But I get nauseous whenever I go and I eat food with my girlfriend. I was looking at some other reddit posts and a lot of them were like thinking about or being with their SO. But I only feel that way when I go out to eat with her. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the same in a group setting or not, we havenâ€™t been out with a group in a while. Also, itâ€™s only with real food. We can go out for ice cream or something like that no problem. But if we sit down to eat food I canâ€™t. She knows that and understands that luckily. But itâ€™s been happening since about three months into the relationship. 

If you have any comments or have any ideas of what this may be please, let me know I want to figure this out.
