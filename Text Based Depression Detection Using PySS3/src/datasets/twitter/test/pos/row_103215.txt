What is something that really enhances someoneâ€™s attractiveness? What I mean is something thatâ€™s not a physical trait, but like an article of clothing, or a piercing, or something like this. For me, itâ€™s probably jeans. Or hoodies. I also recently discovered that a girl in an oversized baseball Jersey is something that is very attractive.
