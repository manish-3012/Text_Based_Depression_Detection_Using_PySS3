My friend is cursed A few days ago he found out about suicidemouse.avi and we watched it. Then I read the description and found out that blank scene was a scene that was deleted. There was a warning to not watch it all at once. I sent the vid to him and he ignored that warning. Now he told me he feels constant back pain and we both feel watched (I paused the video some times). He even received a massage and applied a cream and the pain isn't gone. Could the creepypasta be true?
