My dad found out I was swearing in the internet My dad found out I was swearing I'm the internet and honestly I just want some advice. So how he found out that I was swearing is because he used my phone while I was sleeping looking at my private chats with my friends and swearing was included. Honestly I get where he is coming from but I'm more pissed that he just took my phone while I was sleeping I need help. I honestly think he cares more about his chickens rather than his children like he bought a weighing machine just for his chickens. Am I useless in his eyes, am I pathetic,  what is my purpose in life.
