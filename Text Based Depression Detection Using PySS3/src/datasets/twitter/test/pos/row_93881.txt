My dad wonâ€™t let me stay up late So today I wanted to stay up with some friends to play 2k21. I got on and the game wasnâ€™t working until about 1:00am. I was able to play 1 game with them and then my dad just disconnects my ps4 from the internet. I asked him to let me stay up and to re connect the internet and he said I had a lot of nerve to even ask him that, even though my friends can stay until like 3am. I do everything my dad ask me to do and he wonâ€™t even let me stay up past 2 when I ask him, and then he disconnects all of my devices from the internet from like 1am to 3pm the next day. What should I do?
