Why am I mess up (M) 16 I have holding off on this for a while bit bow seems appropriate as a teen I'm still trying to figure things out still and my mental health is one of them a few years back I got really depressed and contiplated things that weren't not good and I talked to my mom about and things got better here now and I'm thinking that I am bipolar and its tearing me and my family apart cause I have been switching in and out moods like crazy I have been saying some fucked shit to them that I mean then but regret saying later and it lately has caused alot of issues such as me potentially losing my job friends family and if it doesn't get better my parents separating which would be bad for me

They have called me out and talked to me about these acts that have been happening recently and after each one all I here inside my mind is that I'm a mess up, you serve no purpose and I feel like I might just break down and fall into a Deep depression and I'm wondering if would be smart to talk to my parents or a therapist or get medication to help with my bipolar and how do i apologize to my parents and make things good again.
