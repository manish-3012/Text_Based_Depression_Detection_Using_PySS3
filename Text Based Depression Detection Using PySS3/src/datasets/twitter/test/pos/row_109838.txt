I feel empty inside This feeling is truly horrible. When you love a person so much you centralize them, and they are offline, you just feel very unproductive and unmotivated to do anything. I literally don't wanna do anything at all now but talk to her. I am not even motivated to go to the bathroom ^(and I really gotta pee).
