You know what is is sad? Basically playing singplayer on a multiplayer game...

Active community, but you still waiting in the lobby for players but ending up playing solo. All the friend requests you get, but none of them don't want to play with you... It's really sad, if you think about it.

Your real life friends doesn't have a platform to play on, or has a different platform. And the games they have are games that requires money, and you still stick to free-play games...
