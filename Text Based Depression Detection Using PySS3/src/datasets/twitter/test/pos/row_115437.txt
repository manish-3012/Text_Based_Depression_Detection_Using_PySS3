Fucking up forever Iâ€™ve spent over a year trying to make better of myself. 

Well done me, physically at your peak.

Socially? Iâ€™m still as shit as I was before. Sure, go through my comment and post history and tell me otherwise. Itâ€™s what everyone doesnâ€™t see thatâ€™s just proof of this.

Iâ€™m so conveniently an asshole without attempting to be. I really did fuck up today, and in the two week span Iâ€™ve been talking to her Iâ€™ve fucked up three times.

I donâ€™t know how she manages to tolerate me. I donâ€™t want to hurt her, or anyone for that matter, but I just end up doing it anyways, without realising it until hindsight bites me in the ass.

Some part of me thinks this is how itâ€™s always going to be. I want to be better, and for the most part I think I am, but these momentary lapses in judgement. I canâ€™t shake the hurt that I give to others who are so undeserving of it. Itâ€™s all Iâ€™ve left behind, and no amount of apologising will correct it.

Maybe Iâ€™m just having a hard time accepting that everyone slips up, but three times in two weeks? Thatâ€™s too much. She deserves better of me, maybe better in general. Everyone deserves better of me. Iâ€™m not that monster, I refuse to be.

Donâ€™t DM, I just want to spill out my thoughts with people who might understand.
