How to confess to someone Yâ€™all really donâ€™t know how to confess to someone cuz yâ€™all are anxious about it. Hereâ€™s what you do.

1. When theyâ€™re alone (and theyâ€™re not in some private area donâ€™t be weird) go up to them and tell them how you feel.

1a. Read the room. If theyâ€™re in tears or you know theyâ€™re going through something, donâ€™t confess. Thatâ€™s just a general rule of thumb.

2. Confess your feelings to them. You could pour out your heart to them, or just tell them you like them and wanna be their significant other. Whatever you want.

3a. If they like you back, congrats, you have a lover. Confetti.

3b. If they reject you, tell them â€œOk, thank you for being honest.â€ And go back to your normal life. Be the bigger person. If you wanna cry about it, go somewhere private and cry, thereâ€™s no shame in it.

This can also be performed over text or the like if you skip step 1 (not 1a though).

Thatâ€™s how you confess. Thank me later or donâ€™t, I donâ€™t care.
