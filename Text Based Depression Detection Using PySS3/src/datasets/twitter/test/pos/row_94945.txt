Judas wtf Was doing some research for a pet project I'm working on and apparently Judas betrayed Jesus (resulting in Jesus' death via crucifixion) for thirty silver pieces (a bit less than $200 in modern money).

And I just have to say, Judas wtf you *wanted* to kill Jesus man, there's no way that little amount of money made you betray your boss. Then again, maybe Jesus was a jerk to his apostles.
