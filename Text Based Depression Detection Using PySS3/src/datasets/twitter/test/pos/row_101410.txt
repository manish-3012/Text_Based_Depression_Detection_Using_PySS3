If you want to confess to your crush or ask someone out, how many valentines are you going to wait before you finally do it? And how many valentines will he/she have to wait before they can tell you what they think about you?

"Oh but what happens if they don't like me?"

Then you move on. The result is already determined, it most likely won't change regardless of how much you wait. Plus being alone during valentine isn't the end of the world, everyone will be getting diabetes while you survive. 

In any case, I wish you good luck with your confession. It is scary to wait for the result, but what do you have to lose? This is what confession feels like: Perturbed, anxious, but nonetheless sincere and brave. And it is now your turn to experience it, and remember that whatever the result is, you can archive this experience into some of your most precious memories, so that when you look back at this years later, you will be glad that it happened. Good luck!
