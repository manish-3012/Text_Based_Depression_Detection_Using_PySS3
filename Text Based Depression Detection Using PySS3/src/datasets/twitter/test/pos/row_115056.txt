My remote learning routine In a given class, I either sometimes or always:

* Look up all of the answers on my phone

* Use google translate on every article and set of questions in Spanish class

* Be unprepared to speak and caught off guard (and say uhhh while failing to talk right in Spanish class)

* Check my fantasy football/basketball/hockey/baseball lineup and spend 15 minutes figuring out who to add and drop

* Take NFL or world geography sporcle quizzes

* Browse Reddit

* Take out my headphones and listen to Lofi and slowed and reverb music or random documentaries on YouTube

* Think of solutions to random situations I think of in my head without paying attention

* Lounge back in my chair to the point where you can only see my forehead

* Not really take any notes, just take a picture with my phone of my computer screen (and then never look at the pictures again)

* Pull out my switch and play Animal Crossing

* Get up multiple times in the middle of class to pee, get water, or talk to my mom about unimportant things

* Drink coffee, eat toast and pasta, and chew gum

* Not learn anything

Fuck this shit and fuck ADHD lmao
