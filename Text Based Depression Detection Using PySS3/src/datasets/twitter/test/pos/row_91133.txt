Why does self post weekend last so long Like, I think it's cool and I appreciate its existence but the thing is, the mods don't use the same fucking timezone to determine start and end time. Like, for me, it starts on Thursday afternoon, sometimes a few hours later, so it starts 2 days early. So u think itd end 2 days early, right? No. It doesn't. It lasts 4 fucking days for me. Half of the week is texts posts only for me
