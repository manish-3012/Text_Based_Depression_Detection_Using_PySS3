i really don't like other girls this is not hating on women I just have to say it though. Woman fucking suck.
Im a born female and I grew up where my sister and my mother where around me the most along with other women. I have noted many patterns not only with them but with myself.

Women just are superficial and dont really care about everyone. They're only nice to be nice, and probably will always talk shit about you. Theres only a small group of people a girl will genuinely care about. They'll get upset over a misunderstanding and block people out and assume. I am not saying I'm better than any other girl just to be clear. I notice feminine toxicity within myself all the time and do the same fucking thing. I acknowledge when I'm acting like a woman but like I cant stop acting like a woman. And neither can any other girl. Its feminine nature.  I'm not saying guys dont have these qualities, but I've only seen men who defend women have them so it's up in the air. 
I keep trying to be friends with girls and it always ends up with them getting upset at me or being selfish or vise versa. I cannot understand any man who defends and validates that behavior. men will just like pour their hearts to a girl and she'll just throw them away when she gets bored. and men just keep doing it. I do not think guys are any better than girls but they're at least disciplined when they act like a jerk. Honestly I like guys who are misogynistic more than guys who are feminists.
