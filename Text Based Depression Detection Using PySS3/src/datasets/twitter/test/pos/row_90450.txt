How so you describe the feeling of putting feet in sand? Like I am genuinely asking. In context: I have sensory overload and when I put my feet in sand my heart tends to freak out. The feeling of miniature rocks in my feet is hecka weird.

And I am asking this question to people who don't have sensory overload or who don't freak out by the feeling of sand because I'm curious.
