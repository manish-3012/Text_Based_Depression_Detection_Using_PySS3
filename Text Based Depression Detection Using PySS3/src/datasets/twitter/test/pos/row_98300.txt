uhh ghosted disc friends how do I talk to them again ?? This is kinda silly, I think?
But I've met a wonderful group of people on disc, we were all talking pretty much non'stop for a year, but the past 4 months I've stopped going on there bc of shitty mental health problems. 
I'm feeling better now and I reallyreally want to go back talking to them. I ghost around in our servers but I don't got the balls to start talking again. Like what do I even say? I know they're not mad at me bc they still talk about me once in a while abt how much they miss me. 
But I just feel too awful and awkward. I'm pretty behind w all of them now. Does anyone what I should say ?? I'm just too anxious.
Do I just casually say something? Drop shitty memes? 

Someone help this anxious person out  :(
