My mom keeps staring at me I catch her multiple times a day. Just staring at me. And usually when you get caught staring at someone you turn away right? Not my mom, she just keeps staring and she gets this creepy smile on her face. 
I caught her again this morning and when I asked what was up she said "oh nothing honey, I'm just staring".

What does that mean?? Am I gonna die?
