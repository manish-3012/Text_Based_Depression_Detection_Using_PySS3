I wish we could normalize shitting on the toilet for like 20 minutes. So story time. I just got home from my neighbours for thanksgiving dinner (Iâ€™m Canadian so it would have been this weekend.) and while I was walking home I could feel it. I had to shit. 

So I went immediately to the toilet and have been sitting on it for like five minutes and thatâ€™s when I hear â€œwhat is she doing in there?â€ â€œWhy is it taking so long?â€

I just wish we could normalize girls taking massive shits and just people taking massive shits in general.
