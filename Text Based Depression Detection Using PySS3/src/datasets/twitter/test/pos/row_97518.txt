Internet is weird I love the internet but it is quite weird how everything happens and is forgot about 5 minutes later 

There is too much stuff happening on the internet so remembering it would be hard so you barely remember anything 

I have posted a post here yesterday and got 1.6k upd*ots and i am sure that no one knows me tho

And that's pretty normal yet so sad yet so funny

Everything is just **H A P P E N I N G** everything 

Everything is just existing and ending

No one will ever watch all of YouTube 

No one will ever read all articles 

No one will ever experience more than 0.000001% of the internet 

It's just too big for your brain

It's sad

But cool
