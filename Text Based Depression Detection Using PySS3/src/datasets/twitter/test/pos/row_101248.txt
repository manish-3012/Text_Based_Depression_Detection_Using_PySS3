i donâ€™t know what to do my gf of 5 months just broke up with me because she lost feelings. 

i donâ€™t know what to do, my mind is all over the place right now. i did everything i could to make her happy. i always sent her multiple paragraphs a day, got into her interests, and more but she still lost feelings for me. 

iâ€™m so lost right now. sheâ€™s the only person i talked to besides my family. i have no friends at all, she was pretty much all i had. i donâ€™t know how iâ€™m going to wake up to no texts without seeing her name. i donâ€™t even know what i did before i met her. she was my everything. i really do believe we were meant to be. we shared some interests, we had the same humor, we always laughed at each otherâ€™s corny jokes and more and now itâ€™s all over, like it never happened. 

i have pretty much nothing to distract me, the only thing i have to do that right now is watching atla. i canâ€™t be alone with my thoughts, iâ€™m already on meds because of that. i donâ€™t think i can do this. i put everything i had into the relationship because i was so in love with her. we ended on good terms and she wanted to remain friends but i donâ€™t know. 

iâ€™m so scared for myself because my mind can take me to a very dark place again and i donâ€™t want that. i wish i had friends so i didnâ€™t feel as alone. i donâ€™t know what to do
