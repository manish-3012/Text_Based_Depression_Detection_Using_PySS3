ladies explain this to me I was watching Ali Wong who is a comedian if you didn't know and she made a joke where a she was making out with a guy and told him she was on her periods and he said "Wanna make a mess?" and she said that it was the most romantic shit anyone ever said to her. Here I am confused as fuck that periods are one of the worst thing a girl goes through the cramps and all that shit and now I get to know that you wanna fuck during that time? Please explain why.
