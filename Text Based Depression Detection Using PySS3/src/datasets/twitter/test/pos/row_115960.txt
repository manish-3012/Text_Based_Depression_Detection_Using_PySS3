guys what just happened so here's what happened, I woke up and checked my phone as usual. I had a text from my gf asking if my bird stepped on my keyboard due to my poor spelling in my last message. I didn't remember what my last message was so I checked it and it was supposed to say good night and I love you. it was spelled very bad. this wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that the message was sent an HOUR AFTER I WENT TO SLEEP. 

guys I fucking sleep texted how the fuck did that happen I'm genuinely scared what if i text someone other than my gf or what if I text my gf something bad I dont know what to do ashhwbahsbfahwsfbajkbfrhhjasgfhjaesrgbhjfsgbewjhkrfbgjhe
