I have decided to stop masturbating for a year (probably longer) My friend's birthday is coming up and he told our entire friend group that he wanted to change for real. 

He and I are part of the weebs or "men of culture," as we like to call it, in our group. We did some pretty normal weeb shit like sharing memes or sharing our opinions on a new anime. Of course, we did some immature stuff like talking about doujinshi or hentai. 

He then told us that he wanted to be less immature. He said some pretty motivational things  and we all agreed to tone down the weirdness of our topics and quit masturbation for a year. 

I gave it some thought and noticed how much masturbation has troubled me now before I agreed.

Besides, I might as well stop now before my mom catches me masturbating.

I feel kinda betrayed but I'm also very happy that my he's doing something good for himself.
