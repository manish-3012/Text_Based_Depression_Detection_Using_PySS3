I just was scanning old sheet music and saw notes written in it from my band director who died last year The first time I ever met him was actually long before highschool when I had him as a teacher. I was at a park when I heard him talking about saxophone, and me being a little kid who just started playing that year, I got real excited and was talking for just about an hour with this stranger at the time about music. Then a few years later I was in middle school band and at one of the performances I saw him again. Turns out he was there because his daughter played in the same band as me. And then a few years later I had him as my band teacher, and that was the coolest thing ever. I had this stranger I met at a park when I was little as my band teacher. He was my favorite teacher Freshman and Sophomore year. He wasn't just a good teacher, but he was a great person and really had a huge impact on so many people's lives and the entire band. The notes on the sheet music reminded me of him, and I really miss him.
