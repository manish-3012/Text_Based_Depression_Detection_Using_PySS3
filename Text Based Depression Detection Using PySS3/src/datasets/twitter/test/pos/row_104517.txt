reminder that freedom of speech is also getting criticized by others for your opinion Iâ€™m really baffled by the fact that some people think they are oppressed because the things they say and do have consequences? Freedom of speech just means you are allowed to say what you want without getting imprisoned. You getting bullied for your opinion is just others also using their freedom of speech.
