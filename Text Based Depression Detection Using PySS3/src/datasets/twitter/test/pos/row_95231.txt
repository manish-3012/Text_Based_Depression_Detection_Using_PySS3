I really hate how much my brain has just turned to mush during this pandemic I can talk ad nauseam about all the opportunities Iâ€™ve missed and fun things I havenâ€™t done because of COVID. We all could. Weâ€™d be here all day. But the last month or so Iâ€™m starting to really grip what this has done to my brain. I wouldnâ€™t say Iâ€™ve gotten dumber, but Iâ€™ve just lost any motivation to learn new things. I donâ€™t care anymore. As Iâ€™m writing this, Iâ€™m not paying attention in class (though we are going over something that I already know about) because I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t remember the last time I followed through with learning something new or have challenged myself in school and not done the plain bare minimum. I just give up. And I know a lot of what Iâ€™m saying is the symptoms of the â€œafter giftedâ€ kid, a category that I fit into pretty well, and thatâ€™s part of it, but this all has just made it so much worse. I took the PSAT 8 months ago and took the SAT last month, and between that, my reading score went down 50 points. I guess thatâ€™s what scrolling all day gets me when I barely pick up textbooks anymore. I hate school, but you donâ€™t really realize how stupid you are or can be until you donâ€™t have it anymore.
