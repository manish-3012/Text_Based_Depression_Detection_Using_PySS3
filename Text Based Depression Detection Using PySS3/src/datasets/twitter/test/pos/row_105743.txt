The song "Do They Know It's Christmas" is offensive, ignorant and distasteful For one, the song is specifically about Ethiopia, but they only ever refer to Ethiopia as "Africa." Reassuring the rest of the world that Africa is apparently a single country on its own rather than an entire continent, which there are people ignorant enough to believe who don't care enough to educate themselves. I know people who think Egypt is in the middle east.

Secondly "And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas" well yeah... It's on the equator. It's the middle of Summer in Australia during Christmas, that doesn't make it any less Christmasy for them, because Summer is **their** Christmas, the one they grew up with.

Also, "Do they know it's Christmas time? The dominant religion in Ethiopia is Roman Catholic, so yeah. I'm pretty sure they do. â…“ of Ethiopia are also Muslim so why should they care it's Christmas? Do you care about Ramadan? Does it effect your quality of life not knowing about Ramadan?

Finally, the song depicts the entirety of ~~Ethiopia~~ Africa as a complete shit hole with lyrics like 

&gt;"There's a world outside your window and it's a world of dread and fear. 

&gt;Where the only water flowing Is the bitter sting of tears" 

Have they actually been to Ethiopia? The famine was in the northern part of Ethiopia, Tigray. The whole of ~~Ethiopia~~ Africa is not like this. Rastafarians believe Ethiopia is their holy land.

It paints a whole continent as a shithole where nothing grows and everyone is starving to death when it was one area, Tigray that had a famine in the 80's.
