Are these stats considered a â€œwell-roundedâ€ student applying to decent colleges in the US? Hereâ€™s my school stats and stuff (my parents donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve done enough RIP) 

- 4.5 GPA (3.98 unweighted) 

- 10 honors classes, 6 AP classes (world history, psychology, language, literature, Spanish, calculus) 

- AP scores: AP world - 4, AP psych - 4, AP language - 5

- SAT: 1400 

- 4 years of 2 varsity sports 

- Raised $700 for a charity by tutoring kids 

- 40+ volunteer hours at a resale shop

- 1 year of student government 

- 2 years as a Captain for sports 

- 3 years in two other clubs 

My parents donâ€™t think these are good enough because I donâ€™t have any â€œleadership positionâ€ and I donâ€™t have a job. Iâ€™m trying to prove them wrong (but they could be right).
