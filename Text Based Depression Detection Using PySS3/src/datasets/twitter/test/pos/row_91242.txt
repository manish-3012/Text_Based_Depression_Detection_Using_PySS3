It's already been two years! My first year on reddit I haven't been active neither have I been using reddit that much. But this last year has been apsolutely phenomenal. I feel like that without reddit I wouldn't have been able to discover many things and to stay informed on so many things. As I still will be a teenager for the next two years or so I am looking forward to having two more wonderful years on reddit. I noticed that this sub has worse in the past year and I am looking forward to its improvement.

Once again I would like to thank you all for this amazing two years on reddit.
