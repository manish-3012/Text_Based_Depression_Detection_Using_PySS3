Just your daily reminder that people will cross, lie, cheat, and bullshit you until you remove them from your life. yeah I have a bad history w people and I have big trust issues. Keeping your guard up, donâ€™t let them in so fast, donâ€™t be so vulnerable...      I wish I could have told myself this years ago. now I have trust issues with people I donâ€™t even have issues with. just fuckin meet someone and instantly donâ€™t trust them. literally hate it. idfk what this is, hi people reading this, wanna be friends? we can have trust issues together(or just me, thatâ€™s ok.. but kinda sus...)
