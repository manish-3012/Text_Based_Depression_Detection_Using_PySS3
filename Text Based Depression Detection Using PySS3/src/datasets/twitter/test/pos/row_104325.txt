My kittyâ€™s gone My cat is missing I havenâ€™t seen him inthree days and Iâ€™m starting to fear for the worst. I had a cat who was like 6 years old about and he was so important to me he helped me through a lot of my depression, I live a suburban neighborhood with a field across from it some times he went diapering for a couple days but never this long Iâ€™m just really sad right now.
