Embracing our Insecurities - Acne (and pimples) For My Fellow Teenagers &lt;3
We've all been there. Waking up and finding that one big pimple on ur forehead or having acne all over your cheeks. Unfortunately this isn't some issue we can just easily deal with. But is it really that bad? If u think about it, they're basically *normal* signs of puberty, signs that you're growing up and becoming a man or woman. Since it's such a normal thing, why would we want to hide it so bad? Sometimes our insecurities get in our head so much that we make the problem worse than it is. For example: covering up your acne/pimples with makeup.*'Since acne-prone skin is sensitive, people with acne may find that certain makeup products, such as foundations and concealers, worsen acne or cause new breakouts.'* 
In conclusion: you don't *have to* cover it up. You don't *have to* have a 'clear skin'. Although wanting to cover something up because u don't feel comfortable showing it yet, is *totally understandable and okay!* You just need to realize that it won't make you any less human, if anything, it proves that you are one! Nobody is perfect and we all deal with our own insecurities. If you have any other insecurities that you want me to write about, let me know! 
stay safe &lt;3
