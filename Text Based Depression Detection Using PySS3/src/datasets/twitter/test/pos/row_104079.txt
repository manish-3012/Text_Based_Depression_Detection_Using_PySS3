My dad fulfilled his peak dad-ness today So today after I had a marching band rehearsal at our stadium, I had put up my sousaphone away and texted my dad â€œwhere are you?â€ because I didnâ€™t know. I then called him and then I went and found him. After us doing some stuff for the band, we went back to the car. He goes on his phone to find my message that I sent because I guess he hadnâ€™t looked at it before. Then he deadass just types â€œIn the carâ€ with me sitting right next to him. Maximum dad moment tbh.
