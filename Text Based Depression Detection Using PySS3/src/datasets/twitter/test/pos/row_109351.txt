Anyone else deal with PTSD? I'm sick of it. Nobody can stand in a doorway near me or I flip my shit and freak out. I'm paranoid beyond belief, checking every nook and cranny of my house to make sure nobody's fucking hiding there waiting to kill me, and I can hardly sleep because I'm petrified of someone breaking in to hurt me or my family.





Maybe I'm just being a pussy about it, but its borderline debilitating. I can hardly leave my room if anyone else is up, much less leave the house, and even when I do leave the house, I'm terrified of cars for some fucking reason. I mean, I know the reason, its shit that happened in my past, but its shit that I really didn't think made that much of an impact on me. Any time my dog barks or I hear anything remotely loud I panic and assume the people in my house are arguing about stuff.





Then theres psychosis shit that's probably tied to the PTSD. Delusions that everyone knows my every thought and is secretly planning to kill me, paranoia that I'm being watched by the photos on my wall, I can't watch TV or shit like that because I think I'm picking up on subliminal messages in the shows and shit like that. Hell, sometimes when I close my eyes I swear to god I'm seeing morse code flashing, telling me to kill myself.





Fuck, I just want to get out of my head for even a little bit. I feel ashamed of myself, like I'm a failure, I've tried breaking out of my comfort zone, but it just makes everything worse and I'm left back at square 1. I just feel pathetic. Sorry for the rant, I just needed to write this down and box it up somewhere to hopefully try my damndest to get rid of it.
