My views are wrong so please correct me Earlier today I had posted something very unsavoury in the heat of anger and I had realised that it was a wrong thing for me to do. I will just rephrase what I had written there, and please just correct me where my ideals are wrong.

I strongly condemn the act of rape and harassment, and the fact that rape and toxic male behaviour has suddenly become so widespread is a matter of concern for everyone. But i feel that the common method of 'rip and tear them until they are no more' is highly ineffective. I feel that we must view this as a social and a psychological problem alongwith criminal behaviour.

It is my personal belief that very few people vecome evil on their own and most toxic behaviour can be traced back to social and environmental conditions. I had assumed that toxic male behaviour is due to three factors - a mainstream media strongly hostile to men, poor peer interactions which lead to alienation with females, and a male environment which emphasizes masculinity with how you treat females - particularly sexual activity. I had proposed a solution that women humanise themselves to men, they show that they are just as good and bad as men are. This way men would feel more open to interacting with them and toxic behaviour would be greatly reduced. One thing I forgot to mention in my previous post is to improve positivity among male-male conversations and to reform the definition of masculinity along the lines of feminist reform.

If I am wrong please tell me where I am wrong and how am I wrong. Please dont start witchhunting me. I cried for an hour straight and called myself the biggest scum in the universe. Please convince me with reason and I will be readily convinced.
