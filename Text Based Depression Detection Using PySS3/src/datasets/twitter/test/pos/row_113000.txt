I give up on this subreddit man I have gotten on hot on so many subreddits yet I can't seem to do it here, it's so unpredictable and frustrating. I had this story I made using 4 hours of my life and it only got 3 ppvotes (can't say the goddam word or the bot will block my post), I post some cringy jokes (what posts on hot usually are) and I still can't get on hot. The most I got on this subreddit is about 70 ppvotes, I might retire as a karma whore because of this subreddit bvrvbrhvnhbgtnht4nhb hy8tbhy8 t4bhyt4hbhntrhbhit4ibnhub
