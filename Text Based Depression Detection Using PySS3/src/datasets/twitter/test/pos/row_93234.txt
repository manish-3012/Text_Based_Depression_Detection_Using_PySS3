Omg my crush asked me out Alright now that I have your attention, stop buying awards, they're paid emojis at best and just a money grabbing scheme from reddit at worst.  You should spend your money on something good, give that award money to charity instead of some app.  If any of you can explain how awards are a better use of your money, please do.
