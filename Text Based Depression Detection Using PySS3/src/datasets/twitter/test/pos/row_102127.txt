Posting fun mobile games everyday until I run out of games or forget [Day 1] The point of this is to get people to download less known and more unique mobile games. Most lists have games that everyone already knows about with the same concept.

So since this is the first day Iâ€™m doing this, Iâ€™m gonna start off with probably my *favorite* game. It isnâ€™t very known.

Summary of the game at the last paragraph.

**Mafia Mystery**

This is a great game of strategy. Itâ€™s almost exactly like the irl card game Mafia, where every night a mafia would kill someone then during the day the village has to find out who the mafia is and kill them. It has around 20 different roles (a little less than that). It would take ages to explain the game in its entirety, let alone all the strategies, but itâ€™s a lot like Among Us where you have to find the killers using suspicion. Most of the games will last around 10-30 minutes, but donâ€™t worry, you wonâ€™t have to be active in them. If youâ€™re given a role that can actually do something during the night, you can just select what you want to do then go scroll through Reddit. Turning notifications on will let you know when a game starts/ends or when the game switches from night to day or vice versa. The community is AMAZING with a very active discord and a mildly active Reddit. Thereâ€™s tournament games for people with 300+ wins currently going on. There are no ads unlike most mobile games now. You can add friends and play with them to make it much more fun. I would tell you that you probably need to read the rules fully so you know what youâ€™re doing, but you probably donâ€™t want to and thatâ€™s okay too! If you have any questions, 9 times out of 10, someone in your game will probably answer it. The 1 out of 10 times will be someone calling you a noob and insulting you.

Since I am trying to give as much information as I can supply, I guess I also have to include the bad parts of the game. You can get banned for a lot of things, one of which include bypassing the filter (no swears). There is only one admin, so if youâ€™re wrongfully banned it might take days for your appeal to get checked. There are a lot of people going into a game and just purposely making their own team lose. 

Overall this is a great game, especially if youâ€™ve been wanting a video game version of the Mafia game everyone loves. If you donâ€™t know about the irl Mafia game, then Iâ€™d still advise for you to still download this game. The simple art, strategic gameplay, and active community are what makes this game truly something much more unique than anything Iâ€™ve played before. It is a much more slow-paced and social version of Town of Salem or Werewolf Online (two games that are much more known, but still very similar, than Mafia Mystery but still enjoyable games). Iâ€™m sorry for the lack of explanation of the actual gameplay, itâ€™s just too hard to explain it all without having a 4000 word essay. 10/10 game.
