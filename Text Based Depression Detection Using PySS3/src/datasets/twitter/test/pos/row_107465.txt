My internal screams have become external this week Monday was the only OK day. I ran an errand for my crush but at the same time the fan clutch in my truck shit itself. 
Tuesday I ran around with a broken fan clutch and shattered my cooling fan
Wednesday I sepnt $70 on new fookin parts
Thursday my truck backfired and popped a vacuum line off and made me 30 minutes late for work
Friday my starter failed on my truck for good this time
And today everyone was being an asshole on the road and I spent $200 on more damn car parts

I'm also far behind in most of my classes!

All and all my crush gave me icecream for running that errand for her and that was the only good thing this week.
