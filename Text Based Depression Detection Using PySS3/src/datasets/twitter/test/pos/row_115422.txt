How Do I Get a Boyfriend... I am about to turn 17. I have NEVER been in a relationship. (I go to an all girls school... so perhaps that may be the issue here.) 

Yet, I just feel so lonely. 

Genuinely - other from school - where would a somewhat introverted girl find a decent, cute guy? I feel so corny even typing this out. Itâ€™s just ridiculous at this point.
