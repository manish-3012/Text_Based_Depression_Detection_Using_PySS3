D2: "Heart- cover your tracks, The blood that you spill will wash what you lack, Soul- sew up your wounds, Test out your engine Give it some room, Mind- pick up your pace, Capture the thoughts you always chase, Soul- open your wings, Lift this cage higher than any dream..." "Cover your track, 
Sew up your wounds, 
Pick up your pace, 
Open your wings..."
