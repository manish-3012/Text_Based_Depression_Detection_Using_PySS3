I go to school 5 days a month. I'm part of the waterloo public board, and during covid we're taking quadmesters, so 2 courses at a time for 4 parts of the year. It goes

5 days course 1 online  
5 days course 1 in class  
5 days course 2 online  
5 days course 2 in class

Here's the thing. One of my courses this quad is an e-learning course, meaning even when I'm taking it "in class" I'm at home. So I only go to the school for in-class course 1, for 5 days a month.
