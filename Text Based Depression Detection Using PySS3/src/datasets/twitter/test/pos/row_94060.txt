Sort of a bro code break I'm 16m and a few months ago I told my best friend that I sort of have a crush on a mutual friend of ours who is also my best girl friend but I'm too scared to make real move because she always says that I'm like her brother or cousin (btw everyone says that we should be together including my parents and friends of ours) and recently I found out that my best friend became her boyfriend and honestly I don't know how to react to that because I still have feelings for her but now she's with my best friend and it sucks because I told him I have a crush on her even tho I was scared to tell him.
What tf should I do
