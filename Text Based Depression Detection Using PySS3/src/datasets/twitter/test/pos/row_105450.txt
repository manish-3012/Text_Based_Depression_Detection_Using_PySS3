I need yall's help As weird as it seems, I am not jesting, for I am uneducated in this field of knowledge

So a while back, I learned about the difference between a furry, a zoophile, and the act of bestiality [on this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cringetopia/comments/kyg7f5/as_a_furry_i_cant_find_words_to_describe_how_much/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). It was informative and insightful, yes, but I feel the information to be insufficient. 

I also realized about my ignorance regarding this topic, even though a person my age should be well versed in this kind of stuff. So I am requesting your help, educate me. Shed light into my hollow skull.

1) Furries of this sub, you are cordially invited to my DMs. Do not worry, I will keep your identity a secret, for I do not wish to expose, I only wish to learn

2) I feel it is also crucial to learn of the next biggest kink, the foot fetish. I think I know who I should seek tho. We all know who I'm talking about. 

3) Any single one of you knowledgeable in this field can also contribute and tell me more of what you know

This is K, signing off

^(tldr: I'm dumb. Someone needs to teach me about kinks and fetishes)
