I hate people who are like â€œgrrgggg that game suck ass, you canâ€™t play itâ€ Okay buddy, just because *you* donâ€™t like this game doesnâ€™t mean nobody can play it. Donâ€™t gotta be an annoying little shit.


People have different taste in games. Just because you only play fps games doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m going to hell for playing Super Mario Odyssey. Youâ€™re not quirky for thinking every game is overrated.
