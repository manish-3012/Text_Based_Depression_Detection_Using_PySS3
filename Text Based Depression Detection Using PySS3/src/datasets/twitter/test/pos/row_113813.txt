back to school loneliness so since going back to school Iâ€™ve sort of felt this unwavering loneliness again. Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t talk to anyone or anything I do try. Idk I just never really feel involved and this puts me in the mindset that nobody wants me around and my thoughts have been getting extremely negative since. I decided to start a diary last night just to see what my rawest, unfiltered thoughts look like. It ended with â€œif nobody else wants me around than why should I?â€. I am fucking terrified of myself and my thoughts and I donâ€™t really know how to combat it.
