It's about my Crush So ok i'm 14 years old and go to a Realschule in Germany in the 9th grade. (Pls don't mind about typos or sth) I just became 14 (before like 3 weeks) and just short before it i began to get a Crush on a girl i like. We don't know really eachother, it's just some interactions i have with her, something like that she is the only girl i say hello to if i see her on the floor or if she asks something a bit louder that Someone should answer, i always try to answer right and quickly. And sometimes i think she likes me too but this could be just imagination cause she's really nice.

And there is where the Problem begins, i don't think i am very interesting because im very fat and only playing Video Games or something, and i can't get her in a conversation because there are always min. one friend around and im too shy for that. And if i would try it to Talk with her on the way home, she is with her stepbrother and that would be very awkward because i know him really good.

So if anyone wants to give an advice, feel free to give If anyone wants to make jokes, feel free to joke And i have no idea how to flair this post
