I really fucked up I donâ€™t usually fuck up this bad and now Iâ€™m so fucking worried. Me and my best friend were calling each other and they made a group chat and told me to add some people so I added my other two best friends from my school and before I could check who I actually added, my best friend (Lou) had already added there whole school and they all just started sending weird shit, I only saw a few of the videos but they grossed me out, one man was getting his head chopped off and then there were a bunch of porn videos and then I went to look at who was in the group to only realise that instead of adding just two people, I accidentally added about 7 people and I was about to remove everyone but then i got distracted by the gross videos so then I left but I forgot to remove all of my friends but luckily Lou did that for me and so I apologised to the friends that I accidentally added along with the people who I did mean to add but only two of them replied to my apology, one was weirded out and annoyed at me and the other one was cool with it, he thought it was kinda weird yet funny. The rest left me on read or just havenâ€™t read my messages yet and now Iâ€™m fucking worried my friends hate me now and think Iâ€™m weird because I accidentally added them to a group chat that suddenly got super weird and gross really fast and it took me so long to so many good friends and Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll lose some of my closest friends to some stupid mistakes and Iâ€™m just super anxious about this and I always worry they all secretly hate me but now Iâ€™m sure they do.

I really sorry if this all just sounds like a mess but I just needed to say this and maybe get some help on what to say next or something.
