Dude i just threw a rock at a girls face :( I feel super bad and I can't tell my parents so yeah, basically I meant to throw a rock (pretty small)at this person's back (banter) and I missed and hit this short girls face and I feel super bad dude. She was bleeding and shit and know I wanna hide in a hole. Luckily it didn't hit her eye or else I would be in way deeper shit. She didn't snitch which I was so grateful for but dude I feel so bad :(  I shouldn't have done it and her parents are prolly sus.
