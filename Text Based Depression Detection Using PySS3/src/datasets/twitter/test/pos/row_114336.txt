New friend? New group? Iâ€™m too introverted for that So thereâ€™s this guy I met 2 months ago whoâ€™s been really nice to me. Heâ€™s really funny and I can tell he makes a bunch of friends easily, *me on the other hand :â€™)* 

Sometimes when Iâ€™m walking to my bus heâ€™ll catch up with me to talk, even if heâ€™s already with a few of his friends. I swear heâ€™s so nice.

WELL yesterday we got each others socials and TODAY he said why donâ€™t I join him at lunch with his group. *I usually sit alone so this was sweet eeee* 

But I can already see my self messing something up bc Iâ€™m a ball of nerves heâ€™s a really cool guy- so I just told him Iâ€™ll think abt ;-;

Why canâ€™t I just be more socialllll
