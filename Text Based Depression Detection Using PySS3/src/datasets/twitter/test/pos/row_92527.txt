Showing my Girlfriend that I love her My girlfriend and I have helped eachother with so much for the past couple of months that we've been together and it's been a very loving and healthy relationship. I wanna give her something to show how much I love her so because she's held my hand through so much issues I've been facing and I can't thank her enough for it, but I just don't know what, since we're in a long distance. We made eachother mixtapes for our anniversary which I felt was really cute, but now I just want to do something for her out of the blue. Any ideas?
