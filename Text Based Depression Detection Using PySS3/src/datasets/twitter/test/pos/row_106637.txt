teachers donâ€™t get enough credit i may be kinda bias bc both my parents are teachers but especially right now i feel they donâ€™t get the respect they deserve. they are really putting their health on the line bc they wanna see us and set us up for life and i think thatâ€™s pretty cool of them. thank you for listening to my ted talk
