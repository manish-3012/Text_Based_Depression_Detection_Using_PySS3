I'm going to apolgise to my crush after an argument or something it wasnt rlly a fight, i just kept annoying her if she hated me/her being dry and she lashed out and ig she dropped it. However tho she said this isnt my fault and shes just going through a lot shit.

I gave it a break, 4 days, and today im sending her my apology paragraph i prepared with the help of my female friends

i cant stop thinking of her response (if she responds at all..) and i havent done a single school work thing and im so behind in all my courses cuz this weekend ive done nothing but overthink what shes gonna say

shes just important to me i dont want to lose her :(

i hope she doesnt hate me but im so scared to just send the message like fuck
