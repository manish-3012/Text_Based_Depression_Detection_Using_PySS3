Phone dying is tough I hate it when I'm texting and my phone just suddenly dies and my parents say "you need to get off the phone you're on it too long" like I was doing something extremely bad. I was talking to a friend and then it STOPPED. Imagine if I walked out on someone irl in the middle of a conversation, that would be totally unnecessary and rude! It might worry my friends, it might make them think I don't care enough to continue the conversation, it might make them think they did something wrong that made their conversation so BORING that I left without a trace. Or I might be self-conscious idk. I just had one of these moments:

Friend 1 (5:30): hey do y'all wanna go to the mall with me?

Friend 2 (5:30): yeah I can make it, but can Sarah come?

Me (5:30): Yeah, what time?

Friend 1 (5:31): At around 2, does that sound good?

Friend 2 (5:31): YEAHHHH

Me: --

Friend (5:31): So is that a no...

Me: --

Me: (5:40): Yeah I'm coming, I'll ask my mom.
