Does anyone get demotivated when they are faced with the pressure of failing? Iâ€™m really bad at communication but Iâ€™ll try to explain:

Many of the times I try to take up a hobby or am motivated to get something accomplished I feel that I back out because I either set high expectations for my self or Iâ€™m too scared to do anything because I think I will fail in my goals. I feel that I procrastinate because of this pressure as well. Do others feel the same?

With my SAT in March rolling around, my IB internal assessment due in two days, and the charitable organization that Iâ€™m trying to come up with for my IB project Iâ€™m feeling the pressure real hard. Also, Iâ€™m really out of shape, so when try outs for my sport come around, thereâ€™s a chance I wonâ€™t get into varsity despite the low amount of people trying out this year. Itâ€™s just JV and Varsity. 

Iâ€™ve procrastinated doing hw all day and now Iâ€™m doing it all at 7pm so yeaaaaaaaaa
