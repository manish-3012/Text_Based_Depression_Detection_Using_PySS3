So uhh... I got lectured because of a fork As every Thursday goes I go to by some food (alone), I set the table up (plates, spoons and everything) then I call my parents to come eat. GET THIS I AM 17 AND I TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING IN THE HOUSE AND I GOT FUCKING LECTURED BECAUSE I FORGOT TO PUT FORKS!!! WTF, THEY WENT ON HOW I AM WASTE OF THEIR TIME! HOW THEY RAISED ME AND HOW I BECAME IS SOMETHING WEIRD!
So yeah, thank for listening, you can continue scrolling.
