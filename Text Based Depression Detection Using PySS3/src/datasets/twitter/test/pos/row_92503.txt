Is nnn really canceled? I've seen a lot of memes and heard from friends that nnn is canceled because of covid. Now I am only three days into it but I was hoping this could be the first year I make it. And now I find out that it might all be for nothing.

Please help before I either fail or be participating in something that isnt even happening.
