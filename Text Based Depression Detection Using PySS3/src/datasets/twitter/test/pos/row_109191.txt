Do yâ€™all hairy people get body hair knots? Every couple of weeks Iâ€™d have excruciating, crippling pain in between my legs like past my genitals and my inner thighs. I could spread my legs and I could barely move eventually I get one massive sharp pain and it goes away. I just discovered that itâ€™s about 30 hairs all knitting together after weeks of my thighs rubbing and essentially things my legs together and me trying to move is pulling 30 hairs at once. And the sharp pain is all the hairs getting plucked when I pull hard enough.
