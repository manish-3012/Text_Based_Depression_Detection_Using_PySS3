If you guys want a Jeep here are something you need to know before owning one Know this Jeep wasnâ€™t mine it was my parents but I drove it and did maintenance so I think I know a few things about the car, we had a 4 door 2012 Jeep with the 3.6 engine





1: the car is noisy, because you can remove the doors and roof the car will let in a lot of road noise inside the cabin 




2: of itâ€™s cold outside the car will be cold if itâ€™s hot the car will be hot, this car has terrible insulation so donâ€™t expect to be riding in a perfect temperature 




3: the car will leak, the seals they use are very weak and it will let water in




4: you wonâ€™t take the doors and roof off as much as you think you will, during summer the sun will burn your skin so you probably wonâ€™t take the roof off a lot because of that reason, also the doors are heavy and it takes like 30 minutes to take them off and to store them so itâ€™s not something that you want to do everyday




5: the car ride quality is like crap, the suspension is made for off-road so donâ€™t expect to have a comfortable ride




6: the car doesnâ€™t handle well around corners and if youâ€™re not careful you will flip it 




7: driving in the highway is terrible, the wind shakes the car a lot, and like I said itâ€™s very noisy, and the car doesnâ€™t feel that stable at high speeds




8: the car will hydroplane a lot, specially if you out aftermarket wheels 




9: the steering is really heavy and the car doesnâ€™t respond right away, you have to turn the wheel a lot for the car just to move a little 




Over all jeeps are amazing cars, I loved the one we had but itâ€™s a pain in the ass if you are going to use this car on a daily basis, Iâ€™m not telling you that you shouldnâ€™t buy one but Iâ€™m warning you because itâ€™s really disappointing when you have all this high expectations for a car and it doesnâ€™t live up to your expectations, if you think you an live with all the defects than go for it but it and I hope you enjoy it
