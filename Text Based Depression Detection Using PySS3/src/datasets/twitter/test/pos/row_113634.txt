Apprehensive and scared about turning 18, anyone else? So Iâ€™ll be turning 18 in less than a month. I am **terrified** of becoming a legal adult. Not ready! I canâ€™t even cook independently, besides the basics. 

I havenâ€™t had a job yet. (was planning to get one before the pandemic happened, so, this was out of my control)

Got pretty bad social anxiety, made worse by lack of irl social interaction, so a job just seems so unbearable. 

The boomers were right, our generation were raised to be more introverted and cowardly. I am a coward. 

Knowing the weight of the world comes down on you as soon as youâ€™re a legal adult is haunting. I am so scared.

Does anyone else feel the same way? And if youâ€™re already 18, 19, please share how it is. I need some reassurance maybe itâ€™s not as horrible as I believe it is.
