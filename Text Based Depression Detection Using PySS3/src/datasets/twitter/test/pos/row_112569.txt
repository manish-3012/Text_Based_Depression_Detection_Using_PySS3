A friendly reminder that depression is serious and you need to take care of yourself. I recently had to go through a quarantine. I know that I am very lucky to not have been in quarantine for longer that I had to but I just wanted to make this post because after reflection and thinking about the quarantine that I went through I realized that I was depressed. Anyway I wanted to remind whoever sees this post to self evaluate in hopes that they could cut their depression or other issues short and can get better soon.
