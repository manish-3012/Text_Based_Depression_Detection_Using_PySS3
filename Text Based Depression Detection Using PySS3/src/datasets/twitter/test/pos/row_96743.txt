Any advice on how I can end my life?  

Like I've been trying to kill myself for years and I've never been able to find anything that can do it. Noose? Nope, don't even have one. Plus there's no where to hang it. Stabbing yourself to death? Nah, a bit too painful for me. Tried cutting myself once, hurt like hell. But, besides those two options, I wanted to choke myself to death with the USB cable near me. But, once I searched up how to choke yourself to death with, let's say, a USB cable; Turns out, you can't. It's kind of impossible. So, I'm quite literally out of options. Although I did want to see if I could electrocute myself to death by throwing a toaster in my bathtub. This post isn't a joke btw. Some advice would be good if you guys have any.

Also: inb4 "Don't kill yourselff!!!". Dude I've gotten that response so many times and that shit doesn't help. Just give me the damn advice on how I can end my life.
