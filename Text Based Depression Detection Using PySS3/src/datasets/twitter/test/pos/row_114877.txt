Itâ€™s been a year... Itâ€™s been over a year since I posted about my â€œkarma competitionâ€ with my girlfriend. Little did I know I would be spending the rest of the year running, hiking, and driving with that person, enjoying the bittersweetness of her final year of high school before the inevitable start of college. Thankfully, her university is nearby so we still get lots of time together. Although I am â€œwinningâ€ in the karma competition, Iâ€™ve found there are things many times more important. Iâ€™ll leave you to say spend more time with the people around you â¤ï¸
