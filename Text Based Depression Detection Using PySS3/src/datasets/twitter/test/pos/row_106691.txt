I actually do barely anything worth remembering Whenever i think of the near future my first thoughts often are "but thats still so far away" and when im finally at that point in time it feels like only a few hours have passed. 

for example: i swear that the '90 days until cyberpunk' posts were only a day ago, while we're almost 30 days into the future already. life has been like this for a while now.
