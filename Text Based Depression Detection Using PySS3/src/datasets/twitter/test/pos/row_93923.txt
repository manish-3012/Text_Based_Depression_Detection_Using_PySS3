As an affection starved human, hereâ€™s a list of the best types of affection (Best - worst)
Sleeping with your head in a girls lap (non sexual)
Cuddling and nuzzling your head against a girls neck
Spooning (little spoon is superior)
Making out (non sexual)
Holding hands while walking through public
Kissing (multiple times, short length of kissing)
Resting your head on a girls shoulder
(Anything sexual is bellow all of these but Iâ€™ll say one thing; eating a girl out &gt; anything else thatâ€™s sexual)

Also I havenâ€™t done any of these (unfortunately) so I couldnâ€™t say from experience
