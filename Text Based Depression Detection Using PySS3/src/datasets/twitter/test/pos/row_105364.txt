eventually, danny decided to try again and sleep he left gramp's wine in the kitchen, he threw away all of the things he had written, he left his brother's cigarettes back where he found them, and headed to bed

he slowly stumbled through the kitchen, he silently walked past the cats sleeping on the table and chairs, gently opened the door to his room, and let himself fall into bed

as soon as his head hit the pillow, his memories had come back, and his fears haunted him again. but it was ok, he'll be able to forget everything again tomorrow.

anyway i'm bored and my balls hurt how are you guys
