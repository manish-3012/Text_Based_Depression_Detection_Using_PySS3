I've been 1 year unemployed and guess who's gonna be the next 39+ years as well no more illusive education, no more pretend game, just having fun watching Anime and playing games. Also I can now take relaxing walks outside without having any time on my mind

proof: 

https://myanimelist.net/profile/PReprePep 108.8 days (2600+ hours) watch time Anime

https://steamcommunity.com/id/CNDEGBJPDKSWEFRPLUSAIT/games/?tab=all (CS:GO 3041 hours, Garry's Mod 1220 hours, TF2 445 hours, Speedrunners 424 hours, etc.)
