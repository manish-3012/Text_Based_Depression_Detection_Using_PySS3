What it exactly means to be famous? Today, we see a lot of people have social media (even my PE teacher has insta, twitter and tiktok). Some of them have a lot of followers, and they act like world is revolving around them. 

Not all of them are like that, and, for those who don't act like they are most important person on Earth just because they have bunch of people who like their posts, you've got big respect from me.

Also, there are people who just deserve to be famous like Jimmy Donaldson aka MrBeast and Linus from Linus Tech Tips. Those are people with great content and deserve to be respected for what they do. 

Now, let's get to the point!

I am talking about people who think they are important just because they made some moves with hands, called it dance, posted it on Tik-Tok nad got bunch of likes from 7 year olds who think that is cool. Sadly, biggest parts of today's celebrities are just like that. They didn't do anything good for what they will be remembered, unlike, for example, Leonardo Di Caprio who acted great in various movies, he gave us great meme material and he deserves his fame. But, some girl from OnlyFans with thousands of simps did nothing, except making money from those simps. I've got some more comparations to prove myself right:

Pokimane vs Shroud

Pokimane: cute girl, plays fortnite, is horrible at fortnite, in latest videos she just eats her food while pretending to do reaction stream, is very entitled, if someone rants agnaist her she sends her simp army to talk trash agnaist poor guy who stood up and spitted some facts.

Shroud: average guy, plays more serious and skill  requiring games like RDR2, Watch Dogs, Apex Legends, etc. Rocks at each of these games, he is very friendly and can stand negative comments.

Morgz vs MrBeast

Morgz: rips-off MrBeast's content, his only friend is his mom, if someone is talking bad about him he sends army of 6 year olds to kill-off that guy in comments, tries to be funny even if he is dull af, clickbaits people.

MrBeast: is very original, he has many friends, he ignores negative comments (if there are any) and tries to fix that if comment is realistic, worth of reading, he never manipulates his fans, him and his friends are very funny, he has catchy thumbnails but he makes it up one way or another.

Any tik tok star vs Rick Astley

Any Tik Tok star: does dumb moves and calls it dance, has good look, awful voice with no singing skills, dances on someone else's song, influences dumb 7 year olds who think it's cool.

Rick Astley: Has dancing skills, isn't very pretty, but his dancers are, great dancing skills and great voice, creates his own music, made meme for generations.


Conclusion: 

In my opinion, famous person is person who made/acheived something great and made up his leagcy. It is known for their quality content, not his looks.
