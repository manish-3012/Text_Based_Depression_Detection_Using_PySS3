Everyone muted me on a party Bummed that a bunch of my friends just muted me because one guy who dislikes me has me mute. Don't know if this means there not really as good of friends as I thought. The guy just told them all to mute me and they did in a second. Evan the "close" friend did it. It sucks being the "new guy" of a friend group even tho you've known them for 2 years now. Now I'm just reflecting if my friends consider me a friend.
