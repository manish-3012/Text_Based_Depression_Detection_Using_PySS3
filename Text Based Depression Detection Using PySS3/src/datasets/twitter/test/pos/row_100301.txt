Cereal with milk isn't as good as cereal with water Yeah, I've said it.  Cereal with milk used to be great but like a month ago, our shop has been low on milk and they're yet to restock. So for like 1-2 weeks, my go-to breakfast wasn't possible....or so I thought!

Crazy part of my brain told me to fetch a bottle of water and poured it into my Coco-Pops and I tried it out. Gosh, it was surprisingly good! I've found myself having water with my cereal more and more until I've found myself completely neglecting milk as an option.

See, the difference between milk and water is that although milk gives that creamy taste and softens up the actual cereal, it takes away a bit of the taste and water doesn't do that at all. It also gives a fresh, mineral taste to your bowl of cereal. And on the plus side, you get a free cup of your daily water anyway so it's a definite win :D
