iâ€™m so sick of this pandemic. it just keeps extending and extending i cant take staying in my goddamn house anymore i donâ€™t want to sleep in my bed one more night i want to go away somewhere. sorry i know i may sound spoiled and i know some people never go away overnight anywhere but i havenâ€™t even slept at a friends house for almost a year. cause dumbass frat boys keep having parties. staying inside doing the same shit day after day, i canâ€™t even leave the house for anything non essential or iâ€™ll get ticketed. iâ€™m not saying i wish the rules werenâ€™t there cause itâ€™s for the greater good but i just donâ€™t have the energy to snap my friends and iâ€™ve lost so many and i miss talking with people irl. iâ€™ve lost my love of reading, canâ€™t go buy my instrument, have a effed up sleep schedule cause cause of anxitues and i just canâ€™t take it. i want to go away so bad, obviously i wonâ€™t cause covid but i just needed to get this off my chest
