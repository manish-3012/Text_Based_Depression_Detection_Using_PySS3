What happened in Wisconsin? I saw video on europian news server. 

"Running" guy (Kyle) armed with rifle aimed to ground, woman in light  ?jacket runs to him and hits him, bunch of people starts running toward him.

*cut*
Kyle is getting up from ground ("You, there" in background) loosely encircled by people, 1 man standing next to him, 3 running toward him. One of runners jumps onto him, there are 2 shot fired at him (point blank), short brawl for rifle between Kyle and guy with skateboard, another point blank shot while jumper is limping/running toward camera. Skater collapsed. Guy in black shirt is runs somewhere between Skater and Kyle when another shot is fired. Black shirt runs away, men is green vest raised hands, Kyle gets up and goes away.

*cut* 
Trucks arrive, Kyle surrenders

*cut*
Guy in shirt sits on ground, soldier is talking to him about his ?firearm? (background - He is dead/there). Close up on Black shirt guy, clearly shot in right arm.

After cca half minute cameraman and anyone else nearby is told to backoff, black squad comes in, get guy up and that's end of video.


Am i seeing different video than rest of Reddit? Because i don't see any "17 years old shooting 2 people like it's videogame" type of thing there.

P.S. Im not trying to create warzone. Just looking for more info.
