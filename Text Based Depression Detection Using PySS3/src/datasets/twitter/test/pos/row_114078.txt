How to start a simple conversation with a girl? Yes the question sounds stupid but I mean i wanna try to get to know her, but i dont wanna make it awkward or obvious... and i dont wanna be annoying or something. What is the best way to start a simple conversation or something?! I dont just wanna say hi because she will probably cut me of immediately... and we never see eachother outside class... btw she is all the time with friends...
