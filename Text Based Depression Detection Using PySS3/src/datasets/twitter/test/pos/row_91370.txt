Am I the only one? Okay before I start on this rant, I admit that I haven't been putting in effort to volleyball/piano lessons.  So what I mean mean by not putting in effort is that I do not practice volleyball outside of actual volleyball practice, and then with piano I have not been keeping up with my practicing. So my parents find something to lecture me about in almost everything. Like today my mom had the long talk with me about phones and volleyball and schoolwork. She says I need to study for English, um how the hell am I supposed to do that?? And then with volleyball she says I'm not gonna play next year because I don't try hard enough, I try when I'm in practice/games, not when I'm at home bc nobody wants to help me practice. And then with school our report cards come out next week, my average in English rn is an 84 or something. And if I don't bring it up I'll be grounded for the next nine weeks. Its just not fair in my eyes. She thinks grounding me will help my grades go up. And also with volleyball I have anxiety about it, I always feel that I'm not good enough or that I'm a failure. I'm so tired of them lecturing me about everything!
