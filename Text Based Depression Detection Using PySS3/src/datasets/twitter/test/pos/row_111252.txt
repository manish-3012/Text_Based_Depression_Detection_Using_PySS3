Donâ€™t mind me just breaking down Fair enough, Iâ€™m the fuck up and the reason you left me. Coming up on a year since ya left and Iâ€™m still a fucking mess,youâ€™ve moved on to a friend but itâ€™s fine Iâ€™m getting rid of all of them anyway best to be alone. Iâ€™m better at fixing others when Iâ€™m broken anyway.
