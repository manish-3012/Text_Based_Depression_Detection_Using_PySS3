I need help with music So I have to write a song in my guitar class and I have this really bluesy kinda riff that I think I'm gonna use. One of the parts of the assignments however is to write lyrics and I have no clue whatsoever as to what I should write about. Any one wanna help me? Topic suggestions are accepted.
