I can't do anything and it's making me feel like a failure Disclaimer: i am on mobile and not a native english speaker so there could be many errors or crap like that.

It's like a month and a half if not two that i'm [16M] doing absolutley fucking nothing, i'm not playing guitar, not studying for school or even for my fucking 125cc driving license, i already have the bike and know how to ride i just can't find the will to study the theory FOR A FUCKING 30 QUESTION TEST, all i do is lay in bed or walk around the room waiting for something to happen and it's making me feel worse and worse every day.

I can't even study for schools or do homework, especially if i'm alone, like i can go on and do something i'f i'm talking on discord with a friend at the same time but when i am alone it's just emptines, yesterday started my homework at 16:00 and it's fucking 18:00 and i did ONE PHYSICS PROBLEM and i hate that, i have always been very good at school and in these three weeks my votes flew straight into the ground.
Shit mate i have 2 more tests this week and i have yet studied for not a single one of them, just like i didn't study shit for yesterday's test.

I know i should stop and all that crap but i just cant do anything, i feel useless and the more time it passes the more i feel like a failure, i don't have anybody i feel like i can really talk to except a single friend who is in deeper shit than me and is probably tired of all my nonsense.

Also i feel really really lonely all the time, i can't pass a single hour alone without just getting sad and hoping someone would be there to chat, i can't even enjoy playing my favourite games if i'm alone but at the same time i don't want to be that annoying kid who asks everybody for attention.

I've never had many friends and now that with highschool i've finally managed to get a nice group of friends i just can't do anything while i'm not with them, and that especially sucks since literally 6/10 of them live in another city so it's not like we can just write two messages and hang out somewhere, also if i have to be honest i don't really trust anyone nearly enought to talk about my problems.

all of this is just destroying me mentally, i know i have to do something but i can't, i know i should talk to people but i can't and i hate myself for it, everytime i waste time or don't do something it fills me with regret but it keeps happening over and over again.

I don't know what to do, i probably need help but part of me thinks that nothing would change anyway.

I don't even know if i actually want someone to answer me or if i just want to vent, i don't know shit even about myself.
