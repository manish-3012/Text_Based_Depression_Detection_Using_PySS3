ey ey wassup boys its me, gaymer68 with another poem Shadow and Light:

*The darkness swirls around me as I try to breathe.*

*The light keeps me trapped as I try to leave.*

*The bad offsets the good.*

**I want to leave!** *I should.*

*There are people that need my help.*

*"The shoulder to cry on!" After something heartfelt.*

*I want to leave...*

***But not without you, with me.***
