It's homophobic if you think it's completely normal to talk about girl's sexual parts but then if a guy talks about guys sexual parts and you think it's disgusting Like I've made posts about boobs and pussy and nobody cared

And I've make posts talking about penis and everyone calls me disgusting and hates on me that shit is pure homophobia
