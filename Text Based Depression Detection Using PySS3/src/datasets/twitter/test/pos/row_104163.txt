Is anyone else just tired of being ugly? I was looking at some photos I'd taken from a recent family vacation, and I'm so sick of my face - there are a hundred corrections I want to make, starting with my teeth. Some days I'm okay with my face, but other days I just want to mold like clay into something better. It just sucks how stuff like TikTok and Instagram reinforces beauty standards, 'cause like bitch I can't *afford* to look as hot as you. Does anyone else feel like that sometimes?

Anyways, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
