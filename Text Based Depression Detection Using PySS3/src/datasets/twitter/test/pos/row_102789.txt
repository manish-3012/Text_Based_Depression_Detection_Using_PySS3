Itâ€™s one of those days... Where I miss her and wish we were still friends. But sheâ€™s probably not even thinking about me sadly so yeah. She changed, and I canâ€™t do anything about it nor can we be friends ever again quite possibly. Itâ€™s been several months too. Someone give me advice or help me get better from this lol ty.
