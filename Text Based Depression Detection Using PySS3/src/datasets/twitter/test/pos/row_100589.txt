Does someone know how to make more comfortable a girl that is nervous to go out with u? I just went out with this girl, sheâ€™s really into me, but when we went out together, she was very nervous so I had to start all the conversations and I saw that she was doing her best to speak more but she simply couldnâ€™t keep a genuine conversation going and she looked shy. I tried to be as friendly and goofy as possible but i feel like it wasnâ€™t enough. What should I do next time we go out together?
