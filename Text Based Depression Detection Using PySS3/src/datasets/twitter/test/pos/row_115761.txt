What's the worst thing you have ever lied to your parents about? I lied to my mom about something today and it made me kind of realize just how much I have lied to her or at least kept things from her.  I guess I'm just trying to see that I'm not the only person that feels like they need to lie to their parents sometimes cause I am feeling very guilty.
