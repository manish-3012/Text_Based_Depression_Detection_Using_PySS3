Don't wait to be happy For the longest time I made happines unachieavable for myself, I always tought "when I get X" or "when Y happens" I will be happy, and even if those wishes eventually became true I would try to one up it, like "I just got this 500$ hoodie but if manage to get a 800$ one it would be cooler" that slowly drove me insane, I felt empty, even tough I had everything I never got to enjoy any of it because of that mentality, you don't have to settle for what you have now, but appreaciate it nonetheless.
