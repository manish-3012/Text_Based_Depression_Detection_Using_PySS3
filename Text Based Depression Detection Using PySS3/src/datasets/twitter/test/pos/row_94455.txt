Iâ€™m sad and just a bit annoyed My expectations were probably too high but now I just feel like a burden like Atleast the guy who kinda used me talked to me but now all I get is just â€œawâ€ or â€œgotta go sorryâ€ like itâ€™s not even a conversation but I just donâ€™t wanna be alone anymore hopefully I just pass out soon because this has been a terrible week and I want it to end
