I think I'm in love with my old best friend from 6 years ago I (17M) think I'm in love with my old best friend (19F) let's call her Y. We used to talk basically everyday and ride bikes everyday together but that was like 6 years ago before i moved. When I did see Y everyday we would normally just mess around and do random things or just talk. We were really close and I think if I would of stayed there I probably would of made a move already. But I moved and she made a effort to try and stay in contact with me but I was stupid and let that lapse and we went probably close see to 4/5 years with 0 contact. I recently went back and visited some old friends including her and her family, me, my step sis and Y probably talked in her room for a couple hours before she had to go to work. We had breakfast with her and she was turned and had her feet over on my chair and was kinda turned toward me (yes I one I'm probs reading into this a shot ton more than I should). And we went to lunch later with her mom and my fam and we sta next to each other and made a couple jokes between each other. The next day we went to my step mom's bosses house and I didn't want to do what they were doing so I separated myself and kinda chilled by myself for a couple hours, and I cried thinking about how much I miss her and how idk when I'll see her again and I realized when I cried when I moved 6 years ago it partly because of that same reason. (I like never cry, I had 3 dogs get out down and my parents divorce and sister leave for the navy and I don't think I she's one year because that's how I was raised. But she seems to always make me cry when I leave her and idk when I'm gonna see her again.) It's been close to 3 months since I saw her and I can't seem to get her out of my head I keep thinking about her, and the other day I was looking at her snap story and she was posting some hot selfies and my stomach dropped. I did try to message her but I low-key suck at answering and looking at my phone so between that and the 2/3 hr time difference the messaging didn't last that long. I kinda wanna try to talk to her but I feel like I'm bothering her if I try to talk to her since she's in college and busy, and I just don't want to be annoying since I doubt she wants to talk to me. 

Thanks for reading through that I know it's long. 

TL;DR
I think I'm in love with my (17M) old best friend (19F) who is going to college rn and I can't really see, but we were really good friends 6 years ago, but I failed on keeping in contact and we haven't talked for 5 years but I recently saw her and I realized my feelings for her and know I can't get her out of my head.
