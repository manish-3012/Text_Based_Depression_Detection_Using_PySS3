I was super surprised when I learned that not everyone in my country celebrates chinese new years All my family and almost all my friends are descended from Chinese immigrants so Chinese traditions and holidays are just normal to me. It really surprised me when I talked to someone who wasn't Chinese and they said that they don't celebrate Chinese new years. Looking back well of course not everyone's Chinese so not everyone celebrates it, but in my 11 or 12 years that I've been alive at that point I've never heard of anyone who doesn't celebrate chinese new years.

Also I live in a country where more than 10 percent of the population is chinese.
