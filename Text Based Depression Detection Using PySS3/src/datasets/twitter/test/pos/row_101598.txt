Should I see if sheâ€™s into me too or should I try to get to know her a little more? So basically Iâ€™m a freshman in high school and thereâ€™s this girl Iâ€™m kinda into. Unfortunately though weâ€™re only in one class together which is annoying but we snapchat and are on cross country together. I kinda know her well but I wouldnâ€™t say super well. I also kinda want to see who else is out there. And Iâ€™m also not sure if she feels the same way or not. What do yâ€™all think.
