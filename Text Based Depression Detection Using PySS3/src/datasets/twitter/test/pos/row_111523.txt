Why am I like this Alright so I didnâ€™t really know where to post this so I figured Iâ€™d try it here. Let me know if it doesnâ€™t belong here.

So my mom works in HR for a pizza company, Iâ€™m in the car with her, and she gets a phone call from her boss saying that there was just a fatality accident.

My dumbass thinks to myself, â€œbruh imagine youâ€™re wondering why your pizza is taking so long but then it turns out your delivery driver fucking died.â€ Luckily I didnâ€™t say it out loud.

Why is my humor like this I think I need help
