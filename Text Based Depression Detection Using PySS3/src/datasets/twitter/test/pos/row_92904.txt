when talking about feminism, can you people stop confusing feminists with feminazis? itâ€™s easy to tell when they just hate men (feminazis) or talk about both men and womenâ€™s issues (feminists) instead of putting down feminists, educate them and call them out. teach them what the definition of feminism is. donâ€™t, under any circumstances, group them with feminists. they are feminazis and iâ€™ve had to argue with far too many.
