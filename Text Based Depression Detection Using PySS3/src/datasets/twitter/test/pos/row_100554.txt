Ok females and males alike listen There is a difference between preferences and requirements in partners. For example if someone turns you down due to you being short than they require you to be tall which is the asshole female meanwhile a guy turning down a girl due to weight is them being a asshole as well. But those are both requirements for them. Now I have preferences and requirements too and everyone does like it or not. 

My requirements include.
Female (Iâ€™m straight)
Have good origins (donâ€™t have thug roots and/or be a thug)
And acceptant of the fact that Iâ€™m overweight and like me back.

Now I have many preferences and many my current gf doesnâ€™t meet (although she is perfect in every way)

Shorter than me (my current one is 5â€™8â€™ and Iâ€™m 5â€™5â€™)
Gamer (current one not gamer)

So my point is just because a girl likes yâ€™all guys doesnâ€™t mean she wonâ€™t like you and just because a guy likes thicc or skinny girls doesnâ€™t mean you donâ€™t have a shot I mean Iâ€™m 210 lbs and my gf said she said she preferred skinnier guys when we were just talking so just believe personality beats looks by about 4 times
