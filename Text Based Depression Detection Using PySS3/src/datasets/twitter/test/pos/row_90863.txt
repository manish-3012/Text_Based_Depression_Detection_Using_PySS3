I have an experimental plan for all the girl craving phycos on reddit So. You become great friends with the target, make sure the friendship is completely mutual, then set a fake/real thing up, where you are completely about to commit suicide, and if your target doesn't stop you at all, besides texting " That's selfish ngl" then you know you failed and how you have nothing to live for anyways. But if she does convince you to stop, then you know the Friend is great, and if you get a hug outta it, you can kiss them and if things get awkward, just blame it on how you were boutta die and they were the only ones to stop you.

This may take months, and suicide has to already be a viable option. Dont do suicide if you's not a phyco like i stated in the title.
