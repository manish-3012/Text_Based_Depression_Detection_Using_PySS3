An explanation to the homeless post Hey, a few days ago I posted a photo of me at my new apartment, it got taken down every time I posted it somewhere for â€œfalse informationâ€ that wasnâ€™t false at all. I was staying at my cousins house for quite a bit, and I had to sleep from hotel to hotel, whatever was cheap. I still had shelter, but I didnâ€™t have a house or apartment or anything. Just My cousin and a few cheap hotels. I finally got an apartment a few days ago and no one believes me. Theyâ€™ve been really mean in all my comments and everything. Iâ€™m NOT lying, and Iâ€™m NOT Karma whoring. I just want to connect with people. So stop spamming hateful things in my comments. 

I hope you have a lovely day.
