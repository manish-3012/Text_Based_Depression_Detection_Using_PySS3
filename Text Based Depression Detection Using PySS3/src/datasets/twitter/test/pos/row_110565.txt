This is why swimming trunks suck 
So I was just swimming with my family and we decided to play monkey in the middle with a football. I was jumping around and I suddenly felt a small pain on my testies and dick but itâ€™s small and probably just the chlorine. About 15 minutes later it hurts to move. I excuse myself, go to my room and what I see is horrible 

The webbing inside of my swimming trunks had scraped my genitals like a cheese grater and they were someone bloody. Itâ€™s been days and my dick is still scabbed and it looks like I have some horrible STD now
