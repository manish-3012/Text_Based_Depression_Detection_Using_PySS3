big confession for me Not really a confession as I made a post of this before, but I just wanted to update you guys from my last post where I talked about how I've always felt really miserable (I don't want to say depressed, I never got this diagnosed so I don't want to say anything like that) and that I've been having absolutely terrible dreams about stuff

Dreams about stuff I've never seen before

They started in grade 4 (9 years old) with actually, pretty normal dreams. Just like normal dark hallways and zombies and stuff.

As I got older (13) I really started getting the gorey stuff

A mans genitals getting punctured with a screwdriver

The entire human race commiting suicide from a 10 story high building

people getting crushed and exploding under trucks

a child getting their eye punctured

etc

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to come off as one of those r/im14andthisisedgy kids, but I really don't know what to do

It's been happening every day now for the past 4 years (ALMOST 5) and I really really really hate this kind of stuff

I've never been comfortable around gore for obvious reasons, and me having these dreams aren't helping one bit! I'm having trouble sleeping (not insomnia, not that severe) and some days I even fear the bed, not knowing what kind of dream I'm going to have

r/FiftyFifty is a sub I found out yesterday only, it definitely is not from that as I said, this has been happening for years now

My question? My main question is is this normal, or am I just being really edgy? I don't know about edgy, because this is something I cannot control and just keeps happening off and on, but please let me know if it is.

On my last post, some pretty awesome people (that's a MASSIVE understatement) helped me out a little bit by telling me to go to a therapist and such, but I don't really know about that

My main fear about someone finding this out is my parents. I don't want them thinking I'm a troubled kid, or that I need extra protection, or that I'm simply and plain a scaredy cat. I'm 13 now so I want to act like one, but the problem is these dreams are preventing that from happening :(
