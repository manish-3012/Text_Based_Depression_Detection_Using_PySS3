Black Lives Matter is not just a movement and saying. I think we as a society kinda forget that BLM is talking about real people and their lives. Black people do matter, their lives and they themselves have so much worth. When we say Black Live Matter, I find that it just feels like a motto, not actually talking about REAL PEOPLE. There are people who's lives on a daily basis are seen and talked about like they don't matter.

This is not a debate.
