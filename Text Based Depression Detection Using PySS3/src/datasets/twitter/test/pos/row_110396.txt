My dog is going back to the shelter and i dont think i can handle it. I (16M) had my dog Max for 2 years. He came from a shelter, but at the time he was only about 1.5 months old. I changed schools recently. Now i cant walk him in the morning, only in the evening and noon. Thing is, my mother doesnt want to walk him in the morning, so she decided to just SEND HIM BACK to the shelter. Now i do have three other doggos, but they belong to my step-mom. I adore them. But they just arent the same. I did not raise them, i am not the one who learned them tricks, i am not the one who took care of them for years. They do not like to cuddle as much, they will just lick you to death and throw you on the ground (they are strong, i dont know the exact kind of the dog). Max is different. He will come and sleep with you. Lie on your lap and annoy you till you pet him. I dont know how to cope. I will never see him again. And it really is eating me up
