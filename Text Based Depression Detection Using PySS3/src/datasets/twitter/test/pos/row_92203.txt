Im officially 14 ðŸ˜Ž okay so it's nearly 7:30 philippine standard time and apparently that's when i exited the womb. 

it's funny how time works like how everyday people get old like i saw a handful of people saying goodbye to this subreddit and some who are enjoying themselves and are like newly teenagers. so i guess as much as life sucks rn it's best to enjoy the constant present

anyways have a great day peeps
