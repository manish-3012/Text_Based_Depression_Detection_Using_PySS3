I feel like I want to pursue being a full time singer. But I'm taking my first year of med at 19. I'm not really sure if I'm happy with my choice. Everytime I look at people performing at broadway, on stage, I love seeing popstars and musicians when they sing. Whenever I see them on stage they always feel so euphoric. 

I was always doubtful weather I would make it. But I was always proud that I was one day going to pursue a full on music career. One time, I told an adult in a party about it, and he said "there isn't money in music." And that hit me. What if I don't make it?

I took med as a safety net. And I'm not sure. I told myself that it's fine. And to be honest, I took med because I love skincare and I knew the medical field had a lot of money. I'm also the eldest. So I knew I would be disappointing if I didn't earn money the most.

But I don't feel like I'm enjoying med. Everytime I try to study, I just wind up going back to my piano or singing. 

I'm 19. Is it too late? Should I just stay in med?

I have a talent for singing, but not really a talent for freestyle dancing. I can dance with choreo, but it's not super good.

I'm Chinese filipino, and I've always loved music. It's been a part of my life eversince. 

I feel like I'm running out of time, and I've spent too much time not making a concrete desicion. I turn 20 next year.
