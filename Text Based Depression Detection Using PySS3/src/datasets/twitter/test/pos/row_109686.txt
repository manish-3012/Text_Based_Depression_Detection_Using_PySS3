WHY DOES EVERY TEENAGE BOY ONLINE LOOK THE SAME? Is it just me or does every teen on TikTok and YouTube look the exact fucking same. Not all teenage boys, but the ones you see in videos nowadays.
They have dark hair thatâ€™s curly and is almost never on the sides, just the top. They have big noses and slightly narrow eyes. 
Am I losing it? Is this just me or is this something others have noticed because holy shit.

I see so many videos with people who look like this.
