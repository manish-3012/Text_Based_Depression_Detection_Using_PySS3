Am I the only one realizing this? Like here me out.
We allow people to get away with things because they meet a title correct? So if a man where to say heâ€™s a woman he could walk into a womenâ€™s restroom correct? And if women felt uncomfortable by that theyâ€™d be homophobic or transphobic or whatever?
So letâ€™s say that if a woman wanted to go into a guys restroom and said she was a guy and the other guys said they were okay with it then theyâ€™d be in the right correct? 
Now I know I sound like Ben Shapiro here and donâ€™t mean to but his way of asking a question fit here.

So what Iâ€™ve noticed is, is that if your uncomfortable with something or donâ€™t like something that falls under what (and what seems most accurate to name it) 
â€œthe check boxâ€ because as long as youâ€™ve checked off enough boxes in your social standing then your â€œsocial meterâ€ goes up and it really annoys me because I see it more and more in my every day life!

Yesterday I went to the Walmart with my brother so he could pick up a few items he needed and mid way I needed to go to the restroom so I told him Iâ€™d be right back and went. As I got there though I saw a guy trying to walk in to the womenâ€™s restroom and stopped him without thinking because heâ€™s not allowed in there especially with his photo app open on his phone. He called me transphobic and that I wouldnâ€™t get away with it so I just let him be and went to the restroom and went back to my brother.

That man was literally untouchable because he said he met a certain criteria on his â€œcheck boxâ€ and it really pisses me off because I couldnâ€™t do anything! My â€œsocial valueâ€ didnâ€™t matter as much. And even when I disagree with someone I get flamed because they pull the â€œIâ€™m gay cardâ€ or the â€œIâ€™m trans cardâ€. 

Why canâ€™t people just be okay with letting others be and treating others as human? Because it sucks when our ENTIRE social structure is based on if your gay, black, white, straight, Christian, atheist, whatever it all depends on which category you fit in to and nothing more.
