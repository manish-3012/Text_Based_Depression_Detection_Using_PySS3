What are songs that yâ€™all find criminally underrated? Songs that are actual bops that should get more attention usually with under 1 million views/listens or under.
If you want you can promote your music but itâ€™s up to yâ€™all if you like it or not. Iâ€™ll make a playlist on spotify and YouTube for the top 50 if it gets big enough. Fingers crossed.
