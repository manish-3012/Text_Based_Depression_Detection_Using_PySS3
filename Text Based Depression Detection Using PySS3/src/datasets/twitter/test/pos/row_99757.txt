Got saved by 1 letter I was playing Kahoot in class on Friday and I put my name as Moe J. Lester. I won the game in first place and the teacher asked "Who won?" And I said me then he told me that my name Moe Lester was not a good name. I told him that it was with a J and then he said "Moe Jester?" And I was like " yeah yeah yeah for sure"That was very scary and if I didn't add the J I would've gotten in some stuff that I didn't want. After that happened my friend was like "What a save. That was close."
