Well holy damn... Yesterday while my cousin stayed overnight,i had a dream.I Had this weird dream where i was in this weird mix of my town and Florida and Will Pouter was like the son of the mayor.Then I guess my dream started introducing every other characters until Will Pouter and they all had the issue of, the water ran out!and I dunno why but then Will was like in farm and not in the mayor house saying shit like:"I am (I dont remember the name) and this is the story of how this town fell apart (BECAUSE OF FUCKING WATER SHORTAGE)

The dream then cuts to me and my cousin,and we started trying to resolve this water problem and also apparently there was an electrical cut for some reason. So we went to my cousin's brother house,asked him why the current and water isn't working and I woke up before he could answer.

When I woke up,my mom was in my urging me and my cousin to wake up and also she told me that there was gonna be water shortage from 9 am to 4 PM.(it's almost 9 am,by the time I'm writing this)

Well I can't make this shit up,so yeah when I heard that from my mom,I lost my shit...
