I asked a girl out the other day. She said no, but would like to be friends. A little sad, but, thatâ€™s life.  I expected it, since we didnâ€™t know each other too well, and it was very sudden and unexpected of me. At least she was very gracious about it. A little sad. How do you guys deal with this kinda stuff?
