Advice from a girl, about steamed hams \- Please place the ham and all the poaching ingredients in a solid tray in the steam oven. I know it sounds odd, but it turns out for the best if you steam at 100% for 25 minutes per 500g.

\- You have to take it out of the steam oven when the time is right. Don't be afraid to discard the liquid unless you are a gravy queen, and for the love of God get rid of the soggy skin! Feed it to ur dog or something.

\- Okay stay with me here, the ham will go back into the oven, but it's worth it, it will come out crispy if you do this. Pat the ham dry and score a diamond shaped pattern over the ham.

\- Rub in the MUSTARD. Push the CLOVES into the ham. Sprinkle over SUGAR.

\- And last but not least, you gotta bake on Fan Plus for 15-20 minutes until caramelised.
