I just gotta talk So I go to a small school and there is a girl that just moved here. I really like her because she is calm and seems to actually be one of the few people that actually would be nice to talk to. But the thing is that one of my classmates started snapping her over the summer and they like each other. The thing is that he is the type of person that wants a girlfriend just to say he has one. This is evident by the fact that the girl he dated prior was the girl who got a new boyfriend every like few week and the longest relationship she had was with him. This girl likes him and I just want to rip my brains out because of how sad I get from thinking about it. She knows I like her and I know that she doesnâ€™t like me the same way and I just want someone to talk to about it. Iâ€™m a dude so all my friends donâ€™t really care about my problems and she just seems like someone who would. I get that they like each other and Iâ€™m fine with it but I just I guess want someone to connect with and I thought that she could be the one that I could but sheâ€™s been taken by someone that probabaly just likes her not because of who she is but just because he wants to say he has a girlfriend.
