This girl put me into crutches So this happened on Monday currently Thursday. So on Monday the girls and boys basketball teamâ€™s scrimmaged, when I was going to do a layup this girl pushed me into these bleaches and it hurt my ankle and knee because I slammed them into the bleachers like hell. Then I had an ankle brace and knee brace on, and yesterday (Wednesday) I was playing basketball in a game. (Also this is the same leg) I was playing in the game, and I was running like full speed down the court and went to block the ball (packed the kid) and landed correctly on my left leg then landed on my LEG before my foot did so my foot went like up towards my body and out and like leg bone on the outside (idk human anatomy) hit the ground then I had to get crutches, so not a good week for me.
