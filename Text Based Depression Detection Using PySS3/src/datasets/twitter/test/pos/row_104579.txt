Working at like 3 AM Didn't know where else to ask this so, here I am.

My GF has been recently seeming to stay up at night due to her suddenly finding the motivation to do school work, studying etc. She ends up going to bed at like 4 in the morning even though school starts at 9:15 and frankly I'm just worried about her because I know it's really not healthy to be staying up with your mind so busy, at night.

Also during the day, she will randomly snooze for a few minutes. I'm convinced this is a side effect of being up all night. 

Does anyone have any advice? I just want to help her...
