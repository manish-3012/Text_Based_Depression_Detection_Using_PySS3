Does anyone want stone cups? I went to south sinai a couple months ago and brought back with me a couple of rocks. One of these rocks I split in two, so I thought why not try to make it a cup? And then I did I brought out the old Dremel and got to work on it. Couple of hours later I was done and it was pretty decent.  

Anyhow the point is does anyone want one? Or two or five whatever you need! It doesnâ€™t have to be cups it can be anything just send me a message and we will discuss it!

P.S: I hope I used the correct flair :)
