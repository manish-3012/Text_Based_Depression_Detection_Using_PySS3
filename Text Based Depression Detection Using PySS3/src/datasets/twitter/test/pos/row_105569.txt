My friend blocked me because I wouldn't send him my solution for our homework So here's the story:

So we had to do homework for history class. I already had it done in school so I forgot about it. The day before its due everyone was asking everyone to send it to each other. 

Of course my friend did the same, but I figured he could do it himself, instead of being an lazy a**. After sending him my message he insulted me and blocked me. After that I asked him in a group chat why he did it. No answer. So I started asking him if he is scared of the confrontation and other things. He felt offended and insulted me. Now we both got muted in the group because we were annoying. I wanted to dm him. And I got muted. It's pretty infuriating if you ask me. What do you guys think about it? What should I do?

Edit: I left the group, after asking some of them to unmute me. They refused so I left. No one is getting my homework now! (Lol kinda childish)
