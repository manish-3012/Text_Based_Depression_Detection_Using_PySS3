Why does no one understand that the Indian subcontinent has so many different ethnicities? And people face religious and ethnic persecution there? Iâ€™m from kashmir and for a simple analogy Iâ€™m basically Norwegian as to someone else from the Indian subcontinent being Italian. And just like Quakerâ€™s faced persecution in Europe a long time ago, Muslims face persecution from Hindu nationalists. But almost everyone i meet denies this and always praises the great land that be. They even defend the fact that they have no right over Kashmir just because of their petty rivalry with Pakistan. I really donâ€™t care for either country, I just want independence. But nothing is viable when they just want to conquer because of their pride.
