I am not feeling happy right now... My heart is heavy but I can't explain it. Sometimes I want to die, or at least grab the knife that someone was irresponsible enough to put in the silverware mug and either do a shallow cut along the underside of my forearm, or a deeper cut that doesn't go quite that far. If I could just close my eyes and rise up, to see my deceased friends and family members once again (the most recent was a friend who had been on drugs, but cleaned up, but died of heart failure anyway) I totally would. I'm sick of this fucked-up world. I don't know what to do right now.
