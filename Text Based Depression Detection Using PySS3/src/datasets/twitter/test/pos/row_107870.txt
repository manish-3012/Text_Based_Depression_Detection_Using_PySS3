Saw something horrible I was playing this Minecraft mini-game thats like an endless rotation of various games. Nano Game on Mineplex, Iâ€™m sure someone here plays it. There was a user on who made it very evident they were a woman. **AWOOGA**, right?  
  
So some dude started saying shit like â€œGO &lt;female user&gt;, GO &lt;female user&gt;!â€ and â€œ&lt;female user&gt;, are you still here? YAY!â€ He kept cross teaming with her in games that were multi-team, where sheâ€™d use his help and then kill him at the end.  
  
There was one game called Hot Potato where some people spawn holding TNT thatâ€™s set to detonate in x amount of seconds, and you have to pass it to someone else to not explode and so on. I had the TNT, and I found him in a corner of the map standing there staring at her, crouching and punching. I think she was AFK. I gave him the TNT and he just stood there, kept doing what he was doing, and then exploded.  
  
Eventually another user who she was clearly partying with said â€œdude, sheâ€™s my girl.â€ Quivering pussy in question then shrunk back into his foreskin with a â€œoh oop- i was just being friendly,â€ yeah sure you were dude.  
  
This all culminated in a game of Micro Battle, which is basically Team Deathmatch with four teams, all of which spawn on islands separated by lava. Me and this dude were on the same team, and he built a bridge over to the girls island and then started hopping around inviting her over. I just stood there in shock at what I was seeing, and her and her boyfriend stormed over and killed him, and then me. The dude then left in shame.  
  
Man. How do you get to that point, dude.
