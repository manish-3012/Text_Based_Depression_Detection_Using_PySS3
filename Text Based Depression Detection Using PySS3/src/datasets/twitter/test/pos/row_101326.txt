I want a new PC right now so bad. But like everything is fucked. I think either the 3070 or amd equivalent would be fine for me. Maybe 3080. And then I want the best gaming CPU money can buy, I want to play emulators and the majority of performance is only dependant on CPU. Not sure if the new ryzen CPUs are optimized for it, I've heard Intel is better for that but ryzen is better for regular games, I'm not sure.

And I want it to be water cooled. And my budget is 2k maybe 3k
