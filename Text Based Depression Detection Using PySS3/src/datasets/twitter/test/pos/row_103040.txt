What do you think? Whenever I see teens my age(15) post about drinking, smoking and having sex on social media I always scroll away cringing because I find it extremely trashy. Asked my friends about this and they said they agreed with me. This might be a product of my geography though (Singapore/Asian culture) but I was interested to know what people from other countries think about this
