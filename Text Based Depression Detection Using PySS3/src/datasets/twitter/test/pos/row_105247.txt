Anyone feel uncomfortable around girls because they don't want them to feel uncomfortable?? So I'm 15 years old and I study on a school that used to be an all girls school but now isn't. Before quarantine, I always had to be careful on how I move because if I accidentally touch a girl I'll have to start a long conversation with them or just look like a plain old creep. Like damn bro, do you know how it easy it is for a guy's reputation to get destroyed because some girl called him a creep? ðŸ˜”ðŸ˜”
