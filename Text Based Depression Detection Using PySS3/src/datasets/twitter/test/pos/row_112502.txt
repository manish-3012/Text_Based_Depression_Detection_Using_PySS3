I hate it when people are like â€œgirls are (insert something offensiveâ€) Like, donâ€™t just say that, all girls are different, same with boys, same with all the genders. Nobody is the same god damn it.

Like, Iâ€™m not even a girl but I get offended by that shit and I know you are trying to be funny but I just find it annoying, like, just because one person of the female sex was being a bitch, doesnâ€™t mean all the people of that sex are going to be bitches.
