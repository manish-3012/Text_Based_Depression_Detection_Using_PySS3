Online school is stupid and Iâ€™m really mad I was looking at memes when I get a notification 0/50 on my final for math which I thought I did pretty good on. After scrolling through useless emails I find an email from December 17 saying I never submitted my quiz. But I know I did because the assignment in google class room automatically turns in when you submit the quiz. When I turned off my computer the quiz didnâ€™t save showing my teacher I never did it. I will probably fail this class now.
