My friend (14) is dating a 19 year old My friend is 14 and Iâ€™ve known her online since I was 14 myself. Iâ€™m currently 16 and I care about her. Sheâ€™s like a little sister to me.

Recently, I donâ€™t know what to do. Sheâ€™s dating this 19 year old guy she met on a game and theyâ€™re in an online relationship. I think itâ€™s disgusting because heâ€™s 19 and she barely graduated middle school. Sheâ€™s a little kid. 

So I told her mom, about her boyfriend. I was hoping sheâ€™d take the right actions but I was... kinda disappointed. And she responded â€œThey are only friends, she told me. I think you misunderstood. Sheâ€™s very well behaved at homeâ€. I know this is a lie because theyâ€™ve been video-chatting, stating that theyâ€™re in a relationship. I know 100% they are dating.

My friend messaged me: â€œWhy are you texting my mom?â€ and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m afraid sheâ€™s pissed and I know she is, but this situation is so messed up. Do I correct her mom and sacrifice my friendship?

*Edit: To those saying my friendship is weird, Iâ€™m a 2004 kid and we became instagram mutuals when I was 13-14. She was 11 and i didnâ€™t know that but we followed each other and we both liked kpop so it didnâ€™t bother me. I donâ€™t talk to her like I do with people my age because I have my own friend group ðŸ‘ We only play league on discord together sometimes.
