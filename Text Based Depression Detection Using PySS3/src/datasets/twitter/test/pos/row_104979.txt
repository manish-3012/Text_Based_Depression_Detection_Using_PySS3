I have to go get genetic testing done So they think might have a connective tissue disorder so they're sending me for genetic testing. I'm quite nervous as that means I will get blood drawn and that's never good for me. I have a history of epilepsy and would always have a seizure when getting blood drawn. They have to send me for some other tests too, but I can't remember them all. I'll post an update if it's wanted enough.
