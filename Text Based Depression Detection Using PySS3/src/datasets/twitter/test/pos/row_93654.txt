Iâ€™m so fucking done with this shit My little brother never behaves and Iâ€™m the only one who actually does something about it. My parent s donâ€™t do anything and they all think Iâ€™m crazy for being upset about having to share a room with a fucking animal for six years. He always talks down to us all and none of them give a shit. I ask him to stop and to get out, then he starts mooning me and streaks around the room, I canâ€™t deal with this shit anymore, I fucking hate my life.
