Asking my crush out Do some time ago i decided to ask my crush if she likes. After writing that message she responded witha an "eww,no.you are ugly". It got me upset becsuse i am a bit fat. Maybe thats the reason she didnt like mre. Anyeay fasting forward a month or so, i found out that she was really superficial (idk how to spell. I am not a native english speaker) and was dating two guys in the same time. I was very happy because i got rejected because she clearly wasnt nice.

In conclussion, if you get rejected, maybe its for your own good
