Weâ€™re all getting older... Idk why it never really occurred to me that weâ€™re not always going to be teenagers. Once we hit 20 weâ€™ll be too old to old for the new teens that will join this sub. Weâ€™ll be seeing new memes that we probably wonâ€™t understand because weâ€™re too old. 

So i guess what Iâ€™m realizing now is that being a teenager only lasts for a couple years and then weâ€™ll be adults for the rest of our lives. 

If youâ€™re having a rough time right now as a teen, donâ€™t worry!! Keep your head up high! Itâ€™ll all be over soon and get better. I promise.  

If youâ€™re chilling right now, make it worth it! Go out and have fun (well I guess not right now). Tell your crush you like them! Donâ€™t take everything too seriously right now cause once youâ€™re an adult there wonâ€™t be time to do weird shit anymore!!
