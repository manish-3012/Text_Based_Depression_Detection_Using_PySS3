Does anyone else also feel like this? 
I'm a straight man. I like sucking cock. I find it relaxing and soothing and stress relieving, and when they cum in my mouth it's satisfying. In the same way a baby is relaxed while breast feeding and uses a pacifier because it emulates sucking on a nipple and they keep sucking on it in hopes milk will come out. 

So enjoying sucking cock isn't gay because it is a holdover from when you were a baby, the enjoyment comes from the act of sucking on something like a nipple and the satisfaction when the "milk" comes out, NOT because I like men.
