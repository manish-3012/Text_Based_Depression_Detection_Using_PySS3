I was able to cuddle with my crush!! (This is not another one of those stories with a twist at the end btw)
So I was over at my friends house and unbeknownst to me, she invited the girl I like over. Two thoughts went through my mind, â€œwhy the fuck did you do this?â€ And â€œYES YES YES YESâ€. So since I am the guy friend in a group of girls, I didnâ€™t really have that much to talk about so I lay down on the couch next to them. After like 2 minutes lying there, the girl I like gets up and lies there next to me. Slowly she starts to get closer and eventually she lays her head down on my chest. We laid there for like 10 minutes until she had to leave. Itâ€™s the day after and Iâ€™m pretty fucking happy. I know this will get lost or no one will care. But I just felt like sharing. Sorry about grammar and all that shit.
