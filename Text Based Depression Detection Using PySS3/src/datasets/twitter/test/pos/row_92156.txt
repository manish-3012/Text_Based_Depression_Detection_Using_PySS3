I dont like text post weekend *and why* it starts on friday for me, sometimes its on holidays where i want to wish everyone pleasant holidays. valentines' day is tomorrow and i wanted to brag about my bf but i cant post photos so i have to wait until after. its also gonna snow for the first time in ages where i live (snowed here at 3 and i can't remember cause i was small, snowed here when i was 11 but it was on a school day and my school cleaned all of it around us cause no fun) and i wanna post pictures of my first time actually getting snow but i dont know if ill be able to. i was able to successfully rickroll my teacher and i wanted to post her messages but i cant. ok bye *imo we shouldnt have tpw on holiday weekends*
