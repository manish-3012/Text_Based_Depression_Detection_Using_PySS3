Kinda hurting right now So the other day my friend told my crush I liked her. She said she likes me as a friend.  I was a little hurt but thatâ€™s fine.  Today I told one of my other friends what happened and he said thatâ€™s bullshit and she does like me.  So he called her and said â€œhey I got this friend named (my name) you should date himâ€ she said sheâ€™d rather kill her self.  That really hurt.
