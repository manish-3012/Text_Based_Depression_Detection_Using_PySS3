Goodbye, fellow teens (no Iâ€™m not turning 20 just read) So idk where else to post this but Iâ€™m doing this thing Iâ€™ve been doing for about 2 years, itâ€™s not named or anything but itâ€™s fun, Iâ€™m archiving this account, so donâ€™t award this since this account is gonna be dead by tomorrow

Youâ€™ll find different things on this account, me turning from a bit of a homophobe to a dude whoâ€™s sexually attracted to all genders, and then from a guy who used to like Elon Musk to thinking like a normal person

I do this to show archive each chapter of my life so I can look back and see how Iâ€™ve changed as a person

And itâ€™s cool to stay anonymous lol, so yeah thisâ€™ll be my last post on this account
