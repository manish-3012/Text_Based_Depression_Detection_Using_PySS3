fuck my stupid ass brain dead teammates I was in a writing tournament on an app called amino and i was placed into a team. we had a good plot and everything going, but nooooooo, they just had to fuck everything up. We were supposed to write a portion of the story each. My mates wanted me to write the end so id be last like always. But the brain dead ugly pigs decided it was too hard to communicate and never told me if they had written their part or not and the deadlines here now. Now im gonna get eliminated because some stupid fatass hippos think its too hard to communicate.  


  
if youre reading this, team mates,  
go fuck yourself and go to hell. i hope you loose every relationship you have and get fired from every job you get since you cant fucking communicate
