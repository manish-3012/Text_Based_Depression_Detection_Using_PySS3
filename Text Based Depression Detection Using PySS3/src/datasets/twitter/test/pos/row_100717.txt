The more I think about primary school the more I realize that I hated it. Like every single memory I have is something either horrible, embarrassing, or makes me regret any action I ever did. I swear the only reason I can't make friends or talk to people now is because of teachers trying to embarrass everyone at every moment, or all the stupid shit I said for some reason.
