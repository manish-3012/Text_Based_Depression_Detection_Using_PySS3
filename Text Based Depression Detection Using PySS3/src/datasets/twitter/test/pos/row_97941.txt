boring story about my boring life i took one of my brother's cigarettes so i could take a picture with it

and i was about to return it but he came back so i was forced to steal it

 about an hour later he came complaining to my parents that he suspects i stole one because he knew he had two left and nobody believed him lmao

welp, I can't really return it anymore so i guess I'll just flush it or smth
