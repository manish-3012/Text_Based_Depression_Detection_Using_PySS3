haha, online classes go brr I'm in Honors English, which I didn't want to be, I didn't know if I passed the test it would force me into Honors English. Before I started high school I asked to be taken out of it, but nothing happened, per usual. Now I'm failing it, during today's zoom meeting the teacher said that 8 of us weren't doing our work at the moment, I acted calmly, and responded 'Me and the boys looking for who asked' and left.

that was fun.
