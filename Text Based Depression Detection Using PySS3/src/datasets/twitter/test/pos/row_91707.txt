So the other day I guessed the impostor in like less than a minute and I felt so good lol Basically the games started, and I pretty much headed straight for the cafeteria. So I got there and noticed someone was there before me so I thought they may have vented right. And I called and emergency meeting and explained my reasoning and turns out I was right and ahdjjdjd it felt so good they were all impressed
