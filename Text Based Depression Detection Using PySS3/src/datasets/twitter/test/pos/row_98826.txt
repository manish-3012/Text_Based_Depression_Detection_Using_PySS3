Does anyone else get a weird feeling in their gut when they experience a emotion they werenâ€™t expecting? So like letâ€™s say I get suddenly really happy or nervous or something when I wasnâ€™t expecting it Iâ€™ll have this feeling like deep in my stomach itâ€™s like pressure pushing down on me and I start hyperventilating a little bit but once I take a deep breath it goâ€™s away. Does this happen to anyone else?
