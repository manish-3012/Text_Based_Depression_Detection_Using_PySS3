My friend has recently adopted the pronouns they/them and wish to be called "Kai" So my friend (Not Kai) and I were backstage one day, and we were talking about them, and I said "She- wait- they, I'm talking about Kylie- no, Kai. So she- wait, I'm so sorry."

And she laughed her ass off and said "I'm so happy that you tried so hard" And I awkward-laughed with herðŸ˜‚
