I fucking hate my step mom After 3 1/2 years I got into my first argument with my step mom last night about tinting my front windows. (See previous post for context). 

Well, guess what? I drove by a cop on my way to buy darker tint and he didnâ€™t pull me over for having tinted front windows. Itâ€™s almost like there are worse crimes like rape and murder than the color of your windows.
