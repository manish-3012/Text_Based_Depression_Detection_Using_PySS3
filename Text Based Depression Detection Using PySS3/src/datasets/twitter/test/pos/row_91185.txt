My skincare company locked me into an informal contract Where I had to make at least 3 orders at a minimum of $50 for each one.

Their products werenâ€™t working for me anyway so I cancelled my card and told my bank someone stole it. 

I really hope they donâ€™t send their products out before taking money, cos theyâ€™re not getting any more from me.
