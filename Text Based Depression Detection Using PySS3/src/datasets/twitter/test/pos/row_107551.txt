Another Anime Recommendation So I already asked once for Anime recommendations, but then I especially asked for sad animes. Now after watching Assassination Classroom and Angel Beats, I want Animes with Teenagers with weopons. I know, very special such an criteria, but I kinda like the "feeling" of it. Or uf you don't know one then idk recommend the best Anime you know
