day 1 of giving y'all girl advice until everyone stops posting about how single you are if you're gonna compliment a girl, compliment her on something she has control over. For example, saying she has cool hair, nice makeup, cute clothes, and awesome shoes are all wonderful examples. But try to avoid complimenting her on things she has no control over like her nose, her height, her eyes, and stuff like that. Even though you mean well with those compliments, (some not all) girls would rather be complimented on things they do to themselves, it makes them feel confident in their choices and not just what was given to her by genetics. Of course, a compliment is a compliment and it will make her day no matter what it's on. Good luck boys
