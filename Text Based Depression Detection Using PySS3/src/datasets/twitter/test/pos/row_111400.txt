I have the biggest brain in the entire galaxy So my pc died on friday/thursday, bht the mouse and keyboard still lit up, so today I just unscrewed the little box with the cables that are responsible for getting power to every part, I just moved/adjusted some cables, screwed everything together (not sure if that's a properly made sentence but whatever), and it just magically turned on when I pressed the power button


LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOO
