I'm a 17 yr old self taught recording musician would really appreciate if you gave my music a listen (not rap) I just released my first album, I recorded it in my bedroom and everything is played, arranged, and produced by myself. I guess it falls under the alternative rock genre. I know I mastered it horribly, but maybe you'll like my songs. My inspirations are Elliott Smith, Mac Demarco, Connan Mockasin, Ween, Pavement and Silver Jews just to name a few. PLEASE let me know what you think! hell roast my music I don't care I just want to get it out there. Thank you.
