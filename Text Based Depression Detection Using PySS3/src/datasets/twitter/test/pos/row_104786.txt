Idk where else to put this but I made a really big acomplishment rn Ive been struggling with overeating and after lots of mental back and forth, I decided to put one less serving of food then I would usually put on my plate. I know it probably wont do anything in the long run but I feel super proud of myself for being able to just put less on the plate.

Hope yall have a wonderful day :)
