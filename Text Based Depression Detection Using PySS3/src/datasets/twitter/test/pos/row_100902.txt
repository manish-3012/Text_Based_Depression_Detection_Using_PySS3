I got permanently banned from r/Fatlogic for pointing out that they took bait from a bait account and providing proof What a bunch of triggered losers LOL. All their subreddit is, is a more filtered version of r/fatpeoplehate. 

They regularly post content from ED recovery pages and are like â€œlook at this fat bish!â€ And they all act like they never eat junk food, and seem to glorify being borderline underweight. 

What a bunch of idiots
