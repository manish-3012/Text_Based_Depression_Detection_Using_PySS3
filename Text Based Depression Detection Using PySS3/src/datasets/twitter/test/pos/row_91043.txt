I hate Latvian hospitals So, my dad has covid and now is in a pretty serious condition every day getting 39Â°c all day, sure he may not have breathing problems but heâ€™s with a lot of stomachache and headache all the time. And he is getting worse by the day.

  So he obviously went to the hospital for checking and the nurses decided to not take him in the hospital, ok thatâ€™s pretty stupid but ok. The dumb part is where the fucking nurses didnâ€™t even give him any antibiotics to get better. So they basically said to his face fuck you, you are not getting any antibiotics we donâ€™t care if you stay in the position feeling like shit for a month or a week. 


Btw it has already been a month.
