My crossroads of destiny So recently I found out that my life long friend likes me, but another girl completely confessed her dealings for me. I am good friends with both, but my lifelong friend I personally can't stand to see her hurt since I've known her for so long. And the other girl I've also know, but not as long my life long friend. I really don't know what to do.
