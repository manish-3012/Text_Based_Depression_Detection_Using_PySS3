parents having marriage issues and my mom is sleeping in my room :/ sooo my parents got into a fight and they wont sleep in the same bed anymore. sooo my mom is now sleeping in my room on the top bunk. so now i have literally zero privacy, cuz my room was the only privacy i had considering i live in a super tiny city apartment. i havent jerked off in THREE DAYS bc i have no opportunity to lmao. 

i considered doing it in the bathroom but my mom ALWAYS sleeps later than me so i cant even hide in the bathroom. i feel like shes intentionally trying to stay up late to prevent me from doing it. one night i went to bed at 10pm (yea i know) and she came in like 5 minutes after i went into my bedroom. last night i went to bed at 1am after giving up waiting for my mom to go to bed, hoping that she'd go to bed first and i could do it in the bathroom but noOoo she would not go to bed. i gave up. btw she is home officed and i am on online learning so she's basically a 24hr surveillance camera. this is no nut november all over again. i hate this so so much.

anyone got any advice for me lol
