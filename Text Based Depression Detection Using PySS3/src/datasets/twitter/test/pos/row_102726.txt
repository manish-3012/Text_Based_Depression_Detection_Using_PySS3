maybe i should go away and never try to talk to people again everyone just leaves no matter what i do and it's not like i'm important to them anyway. they have way better people in their lives so why should i? even if i am important to them i'm not really special or different in any way they can replace me with anyone. everyone is always better off without me from what i've seen. all i do is guilt trip people and make them hurt more than what they should and when they eventually leave i will just end up missing another person who doesn't miss me
