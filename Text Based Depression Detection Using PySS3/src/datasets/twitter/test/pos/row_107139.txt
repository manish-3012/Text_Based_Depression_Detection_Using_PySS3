Isnâ€™t it sad that I canâ€™t even kill myself right After everything Iâ€™ve done to people I deserve to die so I tried and it didnâ€™t work. No one knows it was on purpose that I tried to kill myself but me, they donâ€™t even know I feel this way. But itâ€™s like reverse ptsd, Iâ€™m traumatized by everything Iâ€™ve ever done all day and all night, itâ€™s in my nightmares and itâ€™s all I can think about. I know the only way to stop it is to kill myself but after failing already Iâ€™m terrified to try again. Iâ€™m so tired and so sorry, I hate feeling this way. Iâ€™m such a screwup I canâ€™t even kill myself right haha
