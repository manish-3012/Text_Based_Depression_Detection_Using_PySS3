Any tips for a teenager growing out a bread for the first time? I have a beard growing and Iâ€™m only 16 years old

Itâ€™s growing pretty well, about enough month and it will be highly noticeable

So far the bottom and sides of my face are connected but the hair is still growing around the button of my mouth and chin

Any tips or anything I should know about beards for a first timer?
