Any opinions. Well, I just read a cool thing that dolphins would be able to communicate and process info through their high frequency signals even in challenging medium water. 

This might be because of poor visibility in water, so they might be using sound. What do you think we can have a real life mimicry that would be helpful using only sound and not vision?
