The discord server. One of the mods keep muting people and banning people for the littlest shit, I can't even count how many people I've seen it happen to but fucking he'll is it annoying. Never in a discord server have I seen someone be so sensitive and even hypocritical

Another thing, the rules are to not show personal info right? I haven't a problem with that except your irl name, why??? My real name is in the connections and I bet it is for others? And when people do art I bet people put their names at the bottom.
