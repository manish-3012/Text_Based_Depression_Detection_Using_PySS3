I need help Im having some serious trouble rn. I have a crush on this girl that changed my whole world, and I literally cannot stop thinking about her. Shes not the only thing i think about, but its more than normal. I know that this sounds weird, but i think that i love her, and idk if she feels the same way about me. Iâ€™d ask her on a date, but Iâ€™m a pussy and donâ€™t wanna get rejected and fuck up our friendship. Anyone have any advice?
