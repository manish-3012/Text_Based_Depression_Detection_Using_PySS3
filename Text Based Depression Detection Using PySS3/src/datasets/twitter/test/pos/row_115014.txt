Iâ€™m gonna spit fucking facts Chubby people are fucking cute

I donâ€™t care what anybody else says. Now I donâ€™t mean unhealthily obese, I mean just like itâ€™s totally fine to be a bit overweight. This isnâ€™t just some sexist one sided â€œfat women are beautiful ÃºwÃ¹â€ double standard bullshit, chubby boys are cute too, and it needs to be acknowledged. 

Chubby people of any and all genders are adorable, and if you disagree thatâ€™s fine and I totally respect your opinion, but suck my fat schlong.

Anyways if youâ€™ve got a lil chubb itâ€™s okay, and you should love yourself the way you are, cause someone out there finds you adorable. 
(Itâ€™s also totally valid to want to healthily diet and work out, Iâ€™m just saying itâ€™s not necessary for someone to find you attractive)
