I don't know what to do. Everyone keeps saying that life won't get any better than this, but in my view, I don't think it can get any worse.
I was 6, living in a nice town in Toronto when my dad was falsely accused of touching my older sister, and my mom took me away from him, so he tried to run away to ottawa. It worked for a while, after my neglective mother finally let me go back to my dad's after 5 years, we lived happily together for another 3 years, but, because of a broken tail light we were going to fix, the police pulled us over and took him away, its been about a year sinc
