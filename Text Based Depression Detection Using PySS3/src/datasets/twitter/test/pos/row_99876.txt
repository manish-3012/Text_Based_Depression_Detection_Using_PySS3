I think my taste in music is kinda weird So my taste in music is really a mixed bag. Believe it or not, the first song that ever got stuck in my head the the Imagine Dragonsâ€™ â€œRadioactiveâ€ (I was 6 at the time, i think.) I actually kinda like their music (I dont love them tho.) What I DO love is The Beatles. I just absolutely LOVE them (their music was REALLY popular back in the 60s and still is today!) and I adore their movie Yellow Submarine (trippy animated movie made in 1968). I also love Queen. Also I do like only 2 of Maroon 5â€™s songs (â€œSugarâ€ and â€œMemoriesâ€) and only 1 song by One Direction (â€œThatâ€™s What Makes You Beautifulâ€) and I like 80s music (ex: â€œShut Up and Dance With Meâ€) and a bit of Shawn Mindes (â€œStitchesâ€). 

So yeah I think my taste in music is werid. What do you think?
