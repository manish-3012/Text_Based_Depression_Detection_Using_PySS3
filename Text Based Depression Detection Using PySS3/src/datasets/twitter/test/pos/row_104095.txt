Is it illegal So I've been dating this girl for I while and we have sex pretty often, and I'm 15 and she's 16 (that's not the problem) since we are still under 18 is it illegal to have sex and can I or she get arrested for it. (Even if it is illegal I'm still gonna do it I was just curious if I was breaking the law)
