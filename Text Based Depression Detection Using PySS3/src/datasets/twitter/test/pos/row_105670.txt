How to stop cheating in tests and exams? How to not cheat...it's a bad habit I picked up for the first time this year. I have gotten used to cheating in online exams and I don't want to . I even got an anxiety attack type of thing when I cheated too much in maths exam.... because I felt too guilty. 

Please tell me how to stop.  

My subjective exams are coming nearer and am too dependent on cheating. I don't want to.
