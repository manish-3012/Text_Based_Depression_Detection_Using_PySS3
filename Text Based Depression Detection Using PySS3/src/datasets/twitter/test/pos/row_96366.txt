I canâ€™t fell the happy anymore I never actually do this but here I am writing this in tears, for the past 9 months happiness was a really hard source to find, I tried getting religious, studying, to not studying at all, I even tried not giving a shit about anything at all, couldnâ€™t find at least some happiness, I might crack a smile here and there but that was it, and for the past couple of weeks or so I started crying more than usual, Iâ€™m writing this in tears right now, if you tell me to go get help, it wonâ€™t work out, havenâ€™t tried it and probably wonâ€™t, my friends list is empty, zero friends, mostly because I wasnâ€™t allowed to talk to anyone that wasnâ€™t in my school and exactly my grade, strict parenting is something I would never do to my kid (if I even have one in the future) because it really affected me, Iâ€™m still trying new things, cooking, reading but nothing works out, nothing. 

I wish from the bottom of my heart that I was just doing this to get karma but no, happiness? Whatâ€™s that?
