Let's ask a hypothetical question shall we Girl I like

Me

We talk at least once a week, sometimes for several hours. I'm not her best friend, yet, who knows, most of her friends wont be coming back for 6th form so maybe. 

Anyway, what are the chances she has figured out that I like her. I asked her to meet up with me, and I got an unenthusiastic maybe, we'll see. 

Now shes still happy to talk to me after that, so I dont think she figured it out. I dont know if I hope she did or not. Meh. 

So am I friend zoned, does she want me to try harder, or does she have no idea?

And of course, this is reddit, so none of this is real.
