I got a New Year's Resolution for me. I will create a document for each Wikipedia article I can find that starts with the letter c.  I will attempt to refrain from copying off the actual article. Progress has already started with the articles Chicken and Carrot. There will be some parts that will be missing, and a lot of parts that are just slightly edited versions of the article, but I will try. Why am I doing this? Because it is dumb, and if you will compare the progress of my Chicken document to the Wikipedia page on chicken, it just looks similar. Please give me advice if you know how to write a killer article/paper/document!
