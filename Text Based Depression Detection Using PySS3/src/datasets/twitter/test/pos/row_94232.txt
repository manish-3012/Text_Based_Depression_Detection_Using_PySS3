This community toxic Like when one good thing happenes  in my shit life I obviously want to talk to someone about it. So I post here. And get bombarded with a bunch of comments saying that â€œno one askedâ€ and â€œkarmawhoreâ€. I donâ€™t know why people turn it into a competition that apparently everyone is in now. I never asked for anything. And if you really donâ€™t care donâ€™t say anything and scroll away. Sorry Iâ€™m happy something happened in my shit life.
