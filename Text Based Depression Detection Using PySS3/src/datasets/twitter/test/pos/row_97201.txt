A note for us men Listen mates, we have it hard. I don't know what everyone else thinks, but dude just have it hard. I have been socially conditioned to not express any feelings and/or emotions, why you may ask? Simple, gender roles. I as a man cannot rely on another person from thus gender roles. I as a man cannot be expressive. 

And then there's another thing. I as a man, if i am raped by an overage, woman, chances are that woman is going off scott free.

Just pissed off myself thinking about it
