Does anyone else not relate to people being all like â€œoh my god, I hate that everyone is trying to copy meâ€ Is it bad that I donâ€™t even see why thatâ€™s a big deal? If people ever did copy me, I totally didnâ€™t even notice and Iâ€™d honestly be flattered. I can see how it would be annoying but itâ€™s nice to influence people like that u know. I just seriously donâ€™t get how this is a big enough issue to be annoyed by it. Maybe at an extreme level it would be awful but it just comes off as bragging for some reason when people complain about 85
