iâ€™m sad because my best friend lives so far away :( a year ago, i met my best friend on the internet. we facetime everyday for hours on end, we text 24/7. we have so much in common, and theyâ€™re really funny. iâ€™m proud to call them my best friend. 

they live in the next state over, so obviously we canâ€™t hang out frequently. iâ€™m gonna meet up with them when this whole pandemic is over. but i wish they were closer :(

 i wanna run around the streets at night, screaming the words to our favorite songs with them. i wanna take them to the record store. i wanna walk around town with them and be stupid. i wanna make patches and spin records them. i wanna cut up old pairs of jeans and put pins in them with them. 

itâ€™s stupid how far away we are from each other :(
