I was challenged to a fight So today at lunch, I was sitting at a table talking to a group of friends. Then one girl (weâ€™ll call her Claire) asks me what she knows abt her and a guy (weâ€™ll call him Tom). So I told her that Tom told me that they were close to getting together abt 3 months ago and that that was all I knew (which was the truth). Then when I come home and check my phone, Tom texts me saying â€œIâ€™ll kill youâ€ and â€œI know what you didâ€.  So I had no idea what he was talking about. But then like 20 people messaged me asking why I was spreading rumour about Tom. I was confused and tried calling Tom but he didnâ€™t pick up. He was very vague in his texts but he said it was to do with Claire. I didnâ€™t know what to do so I dm Claire asking if she knows what itâ€™s about, and she says itâ€™s about what I said at lunch.

I was constantly calling Tom but he wouldnâ€™t pick up. Then he asks me to fight on Sunday. I respond saying that I wonâ€™t fight over something that I didnâ€™t do, so he says heâ€™ll beat me up on Monday at school. And heâ€™s like 6 foot and way stronger than me.

I need your help guys, please
