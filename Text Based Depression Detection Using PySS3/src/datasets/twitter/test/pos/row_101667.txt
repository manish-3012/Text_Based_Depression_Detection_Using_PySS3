My grandpa gave me a blue lives matter flag, and I really wanna take it down without hurting his feelings, any suggestions? Like he gave it to me because I am apolitical around him because our views are so different, and he equates my silence as support. He gave me the flag with the blue stripe on it and I hung it up cause I love him and I don't wanna hurt his feelings, but I also really don't like it because of my personal beliefs. Any suggestions on how to take it down without hurting his feelings?
