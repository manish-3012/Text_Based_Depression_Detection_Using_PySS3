Everyday I wonder if Iâ€™ll ever find the love of my life Iâ€™m the only one in my circle without a girlfriend. Not surprising how Iâ€™m the only ugly person in the group as well. I wonder if Iâ€™ll ever go on romantic dinners dates at restaurants, proposal, have a wedding etc ðŸ¥º

I just canâ€™t wait till that moment Iâ€™m only 15 I have so long :(
