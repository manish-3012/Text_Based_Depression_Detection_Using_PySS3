I am so damn confused So for background, recently I have been getting realy close with one of my female friends, she later told me that she likes me, but that is a story for another day, anyway, we were sitting in her room, we were watching a video she realy likes and then she had a panic attack, it happens surprisingly often, so I held her hand and hugged her for probably 10 minutes, she later stopped shaking, looked up at me, put her hand on my shoulder and just started kissing me, we made out for probably almost 10 minutes, and for reference that was my first kiss, so that was an experience.

I still have no clue why she would kiss my ugly ass face, but hey, she apparently dosent regret it, so that's good I guess?
