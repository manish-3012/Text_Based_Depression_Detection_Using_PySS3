if a girl in your friend group broke up with one of the guys in your said friend group would you still talk about her 2 years later this shitâ€™s so annoying

iâ€™m hated by an entire friend group 2 years after i broke up with my first boyfriend and for what?? i understood at first cuz ig bro code but like goddamn why would someone keep talking about me 2 years after we have stopped dating. we havenâ€™t spoken in forever and theyâ€™re still obsessed with my name
