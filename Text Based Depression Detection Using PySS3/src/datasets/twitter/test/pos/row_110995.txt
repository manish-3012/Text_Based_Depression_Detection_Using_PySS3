Basically I'm the redbull version of Kyle So imagine Kyle, but instead of monsters it's redbull. Instead of punching holes in the drywall, I like to break into construction sites and explore whatever they've got. I like to climb around with my buddies until somebody catches us. After that we just run for it and so far we haven't been caught (we've had Karen's call the cops on us numerous times). For the record we just explore and hang around. No graffiti or property damage or anything like that, we're not assholes. Also we fucking love redbulls.
