I've made a friend in an Among Us lobby So I was just playing a lot of Among Us and for no reason, I tried to throw and still won as an Impostor. I met a player named Jelly, who chatted a bunch of weird stuff, but a very chill person. We spent a fair amount of time in lobbies. Unfortunately, they didn't have discord so we couldn't chat afterwards and he started a new lobby which I couldn't find. Jelly, if you are on this sub: I'm sorry I couldn't find your lobby.
