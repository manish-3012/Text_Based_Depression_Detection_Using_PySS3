idk what to put as a title but there's two opposing forces in my google meet today lol in my online class one kid has a trump pence sign and a blue lives matter flag in his room and the girl in the square next to him has a lesbian pride flag and a black lives matter flag. they keep looking at each other's squares and it's really amusing lol
