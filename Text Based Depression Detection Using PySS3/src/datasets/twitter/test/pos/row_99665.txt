Please read... When you see a gay bi or lesbian person what is the first thing you think is it "oh cool I think that's completely normal and fine" is it "that's kinda werd but I won't say anything because I don't want to be rude" or is it "they are crazy I don't want to be anywhere near them".  Because From my experience a lot of people think that if someone is gay and you are the same gender as them that they want to date you and want to have sex with everyone that is the same gender as them. In my experience there are many people at my school that feel this way at least it seems like that from my perspective a lot of people act like I am a monster that if they go near me I will do something horrible and they will just appear in hell...And it can have a impact on someones mental health it may make them feel like they don't belong in this society and shouldn't be here. Think about it just because they like the same gender doesn't mean they want to date you they might just want to be your friend. And if if Jim down the street is haven't sex with John whey does it affect you.
