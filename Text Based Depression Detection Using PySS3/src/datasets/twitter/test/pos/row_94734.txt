If you can barely use a computer, donâ€™t take an engineering elective Ã¾at requires you to use a computer My high school is doing a Ã¾ing where some students are fully in person and some are fully online. About 1/3 of my engineering classmates are online, and Ã¾e rest are in person. Iâ€™m one of Ã¾e fully online students. Weâ€™re doing a group project, and each group is 3 people, 1 virtual person and 2 on-site people. We have to reverse engineer a pen Ã¾at only Ã¾e on-site students have. However, my partners are incapable of basic computer functions. Ãžey couldnâ€™t even figure out how to import a photo of Ã¾e pen into a slideshow. Seriously, why Ã¾e hell are you in an engineering class where we primarily use computers if you canâ€™t use a computer? How Ã¾e hell did Ã¾ey even make it Ã¾is far?!? Weâ€™ve been doing 3D modeling most of Ã¾e year, how can you make a 3D model but not a slideshow?!?

Sorry, I just needed to rant.

Edit: and I just explained to Ã¾em exactly what to put in Ã¾e damn boxes and gave an example and Ã¾ey didnâ€™t listen... I canâ€™t wiÃ¾ Ã¾ese people.
