Ee uu I need to talk to my parents I (15M) need to talk to my parents about some stuff and I have no clue how to. I need to tell them that I am not eating a lot (or not at all), they already noticed but I believe they don't think it's serious (I also don't really take it seriously). When I eat more than a little bit I start gagging a bit and when I eat more I get stomach aches and feel like I need to throw up (I never actually throw up tho). I lost a lot of weight and because really skinny, I need help but I don't know how to get it. I'm on a waiting list for a therapist but I'll probably get to talk to her in march at the soonest.

TW SELF HARM
I also made a new friend a few days ago and she blocked me out of nowhere, made me feel really bad and I decided drinking some wine was better than cutting myself, so I kinda got drunk and fell asleep at 7am, got 3 hours of sleep and now I don't know what to do with it, I have her Discord but she blocked me there, she blocked me on snap. I did find her insta so I could send her a message but I don't know what to say to her. I'm worried because she's not mentally stable, luckily her parents locked away all the knives and meds so I hope she's ok.

It's dinner time now so I'll probably not eat and please give me some advice, I really don't know what to do anymore.
