no pronouns, do not refer - now excuse me while I OD on gummy vitamins so now we have:

1. pronouns (she/he/they/ze/xir)
2. neopronouns (doll/rot/flameself)
3. emoji pronouns (ðŸ€/ðŸŒ¸'s, ðŸ¥€self)

My mind is on overload &amp; I cannot understand anything. Please kill me now, I tried asking people about it. They said it was an neurodivegent thing &amp; that they like being called that. I kid you not, they said it was ***common sense.*** My stupid ass is neurodivegent &amp; doesn't understand. 

Does anyone understand this or why people use them or what the fuck is going on?
