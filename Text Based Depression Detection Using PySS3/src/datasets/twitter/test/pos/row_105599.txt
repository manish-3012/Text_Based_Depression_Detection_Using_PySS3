I fucking hate myself Life's been tough lately, I just found out that someone who I've been following online has suicidal issues, School has been a pain in the ass, I can barely smile anymore. I can barely see myself in the mirror. It's not anorexia or something like that it's just a huge pile of insecurities coming back to bite me in the ass again.

I have been doing fitness for the last 3 months or so and can barely see a change, I have been a skinny boy all my life, I have been made fun of for being so skinny. Now that I am actually trying to workout I feel even more pathetic. (I don't need advice on fitness BTW I just need to vent)

And my face. Holy shit my face looks like a fucking squished bug, along with my way too long hair that I can't fix Cuz the Netherlands is in lockdown, and my weird curls that aren't curls, it's just a messy pile of wasted potential.

That was my rant have a good day.
