Not that anyone cares but I just fixed my fucking face Iâ€™ve had this big bump on the bridge of my nose for like, 3 years, I thought it was just a mole or natural bump of some kind, tonight I got bored and tried popping it for like, the 300th time, and it was a fucking zit all along, I had a big nose bump for 3 years cuz I was scared to push it with the tweezers too hard ðŸ˜– anyway tho, thatâ€™s all the good news I have for this year lmfao

On the downside tho I kinda have developed a habit of running my finger up and down my nose and now itâ€™s gonna feel wack without the speed bump.
