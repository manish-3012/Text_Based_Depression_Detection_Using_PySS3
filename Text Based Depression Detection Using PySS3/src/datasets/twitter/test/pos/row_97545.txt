Need help people of reddit. Can you guys just tell me that you are there for me. That's it. Even if i get like 3 or 4 comments.That will make my mood better. 
I feel super lonely these days. I feel alone. I hate this feeling.
I am posting this here because i just like this subreddit. I am one of those people who never post or comment like ever.
Just help me out a bit. Thanks. 

I'll go to sleep now.
