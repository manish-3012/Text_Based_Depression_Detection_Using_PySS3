My boyfriend is sick so I took some Polaroids of me wearing a sexy bunny girl costume for Christmas since he canâ€™t see me wear it in real life If this looks familiar to anyone, I was replying to some comments and somehow accidentally deleted the original post- LOL anyway I know itâ€™s not that big of a deal but that costume was a bitch and a half to both put on and take off because everything is tight for no reason and taking decent pictures on a camera that DOES NOT HAVE A TIMER is also a bitch and 3 quarters. that is all. Thank you.
