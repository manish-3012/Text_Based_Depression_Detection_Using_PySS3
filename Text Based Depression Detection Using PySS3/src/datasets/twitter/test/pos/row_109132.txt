Does anyone else find this creepy? So there is a software my school uses called â€œHaparaâ€. We have laptops the school provides us to do digital work on, but this Hapara app is installed on all of the studentsâ€™ chrome books, and the students canâ€™t turn it off. And to top it all off, and they can literally take over our computer on it and mess with our tabs we have open on Google Chrome. Not only is it very creepy, it is also pointless. If the school doesnâ€™t want us to be looking up certain stuff, they have access to our history already. Not to mention there are some teachers who just watch Hapara all day like security cameras. Iâ€™ve had teachers close out of School work I was doing! I think the whole thing is ridiculous and it infringes us studentsâ€™ privacy. My friend and I were thinking about doing a peaceful protest or petition to get rid of it. What do you guys think?
