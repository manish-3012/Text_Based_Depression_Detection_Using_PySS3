I gotta say, it is real nice seeing these billionaires cry These *mothefuckers* ruined the economy in 2008, and made many people (including many of you I'm sure) lose their homes.

Now that we've finally had enough, and cooridinated an attack to make *them* lose money *for once*, they have the god damn audacity to cry about it.

You wanted unfettered capitalism and you got it, pieces of shit.
