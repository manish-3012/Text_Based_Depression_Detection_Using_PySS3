why does my voice go high when Iâ€™m around adults? There isnâ€™t many places I know of to ask this so I guess Iâ€™ll try here because why not. ever since I was like, 9, I always talked in a much higher voice around family and other adults than when I was with friends. I can talk to teachers normally now, but not parents or close relatives.
When Iâ€™m talking to a friend irl, on the phone etc and Iâ€™m near a parent/a parent walks in, I really just donâ€™t want to speak and stutter and donâ€™t really know what to do.
I donâ€™t do this on purpose at all. In fact sometimes when I have my â€œhigh voiceâ€ I try to speak in my normal voice but it just sounds really unnatural and forced. Why do I speak like this in front of adults? How can I stop this? I feel almost embarrassed when I try to speak in a normal voice around my parents but I canâ€™t force my normal voice. Why does this happen?
