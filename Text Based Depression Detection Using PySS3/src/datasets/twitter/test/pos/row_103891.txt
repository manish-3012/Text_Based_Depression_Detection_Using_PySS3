Bias at my school My school seems to have a problem with kids getting into trouble. Especially if itâ€™s an argument between a guy and a girl. Most of our teachers are female, and a surprising amount of them are biased towards the girl students, particularly in 1st to 8th grades. Iâ€™m not saying all of them are, far from it actually. Even with nice teachers, Iâ€™ll never forget the times as a little kid when a girl hits and kicks me, says I did it and gets me in trouble, or when I need to stay in at break because of a misunderstanding, when our teacher wonâ€™t even listen to one word a crying 8 year old is saying. Some more examples of this is the bathrooms and changing rooms. The girls get a massive room with several stalls in a tucked away corner, while the boys rooms are minuscule in comparison, have 2 urinals and 1 stall, stink to high heaven, and maybe the worst thing is that they are right at the end of a hallway. If someone opens the door, you can see whoever is peeing, with only the privacy of our backs turned to the door. On school trips, when we change to  swim clothes, the girls get the boat house, with plenty of cover, and we get told to run into the forest. The girls get the special houses with Netflix and YouTube, but we get the crappy ones with missing beds and a single news station on an old tv that barely works. Itâ€™s not as much of a problem in the older classes, but Iâ€™ve been at my school for a while, and weâ€™re taught that the way to win an argument is to be female and cry. Donâ€™t mistake this as misogynistic and downvote this to hell. Iâ€™m just stating a problem.
