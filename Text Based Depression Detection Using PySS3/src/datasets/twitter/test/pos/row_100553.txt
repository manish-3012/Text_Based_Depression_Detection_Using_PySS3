My sister is an a-hole She sits over hunched all day, playing roblox, then complains her back hurts. She blasts her videos way too loud for me, and does nothing to address the issue, instead personally attacking me. She completely ignores the existence of my cat, unless she annoys her. She spams me on messenger while i'm in the bathroom (reason: You were texting me (yeah I was, to MAKE YOU STOP) so maybe if you answered my calls (2 of them) I would've stopped). She literally twists my arm every single time I mildly annoy her, and my parents stop me from retaliating. She frequently keeps me up at night by whining about basic issues ("my back hurts," "i am itchy," "give me a huggie and kissie," etc.). And my parents don't give a single damn about what I have to endure.
