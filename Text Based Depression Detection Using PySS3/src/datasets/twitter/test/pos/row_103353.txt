Iâ€™m so tired of TikTok (iâ€™m probably going to delete this later) I see so many TickTock videos in the comments thereâ€™s a whole gender war going on most of the time against men but some of the arguments these girls have are so dumb but if you tell them something you get called to pick me or misogynistic which Iâ€™m just trying to be fair and recognize both genders do horrible things I saw the TikTok once  where this guy he was taking about how he wanted full custody of his  daughter because the mother wasnâ€™t a good mom and people were like youâ€™re just gonna rape3 her and the amount of people that liked the comment and agreed with it was concerning

And another thing that bothers me is girls donâ€™t get the same treatment as the man for example there was this guy he did an experiment he posted a video that said I like a girl where I sit by it and all the comments were hate from the girls but a girl posted this video before him he was just doing it the same to see peopleâ€˜s reaction and all she got was praise and a few guys saying thatâ€™s body shaming but those guys who said it they just got shut down by the girls saying thatâ€™s what you guys do to us all the time and I hate when they try to justify them doing something bad by saying men do to us all the time because one there generalizing into why does it feel like nobody acknowledge that girls can be mean to you because most of the time I was in school it was amazing the boys in the meeting it was the girls who were rating guys and body shaming and doing all of that

Some girls are just hypocrites  it also annoys me how a lot of girls over sexualized guys on like their TikTok like they all have the pregnant emoji and. sayâ€ I would get on my knees for you â€œI just find it so weird and then they go and complain about how guys do it to them  Iâ€™ve seen a guy do that he said under a TikTok that she was pretty she didnâ€™t even need to make up and a bunch of girls were like she doesnâ€™t wear to make up for you stop over sexualizing her which makes no sense I saw it as a compliment though A lot of girls to wear certain outfits and put on make up to impress guys and Iâ€™m pretty sure guys do the same sometimes
