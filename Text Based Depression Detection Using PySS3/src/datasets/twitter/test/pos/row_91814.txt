Where did they all go?? I was scrolling through my insta dms and just saw many people that, I forgot. I messaged them and none reply. I miss them. Some people come back to me, but I can't find them. I miss the weird messages I got from random girls. The older messages have disappeared, my memories. Close friends dissappear after we show our love. How did that happen?? Why did that happen?? I miss it. I miss my old life. Being lonely and an outcast, so when someone spoke, I truly felt attached. Now I have too many friends. Once I came out they all flood to me like I was a national treasure. Where were you before? I was the same person... Where are you now? When I miss you the most...


Jeez did I just write a poem??!!
