OH MY GOD I'M GONNA CRY- So I found this plush I had of this Pac-Man ghost. I think it's Inky. It's the blue one. I had it since I was around 7. And there's this button on his forehead and when you press it, it makes the boop sound that Pac-Man makes. And I used to press that button all the time as a kit, so there's this permanent indent in the fabric where my thumb was. 

And I found this plush a few days ago, and I saw the thumb indent and-

It's the exact size of my thumb today.
