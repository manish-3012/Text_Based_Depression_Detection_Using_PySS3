I kinda wanna fix my family, and I would appreciate it if you guys could help me with it. So here are the problems. My sister constantly makes snarky comments to everything, refuses to do work, insults everyone in the family with words like "b*tch, stupid, asshole, sl*t, idiot, etc. at least a couple of times every 2 days, I think. She says everything is unfair to her, even if the conditions are completely fair. She is 11. My brother constantly whines when he cant get what he wants and makes everyone's ears hurt with his whining. He is 6. My mother- well, my sister and brother tick her off often, which makes her scream at us a lot. Which- I cant really blame her. I love her, shes great. My dad is someone who has a very short temper. Me and him get into fights very often, screaming at eachother and such. I have a suspicion that he definitely doesnt love me as much as my siblings, even though my mother claims otherwise. I can get very violent, and sometimes I desperately just want to be left alone, but that's hard in a house with 2 siblings. I break things unintentionally sometimes, and believe it or not, the person I have most peace with is my brother. My sister- if shes cranky, she makes everyone cranky. I'll ask her the name of the anime shes watching, and if shes cranky she'll say "I'll smack your face if you dont shut the f*ck up."

So yes. I kinda need to make things better because I'm fucking tired of the constant whining and yelling and crying.
