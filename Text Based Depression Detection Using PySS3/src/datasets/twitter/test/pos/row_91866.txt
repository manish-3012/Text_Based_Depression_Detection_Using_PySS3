I made a r/INAT for teens! **INAT** = *I Need A Team.* The original r/INAT subreddit is mostly filled with adults looking to collaborate with projects. 

Well, I made a teen version of that! Are you good at music? Can you draw? How about programming? Do you need to build a team to help with a project? Bring your skills to the table and let's collaborate at r/INATforTeens!

(P.S. Ignore the small number of members, I just made this community. Be the first to post! I'm looking for mods too, but I'll make a second post about it later)
