Finally got a girlfriend!! I've always thought that all this talk about finding a girl when you start high school was bullshit, well, until today. 

So literally only 6 weeks after starting high school I started hanging out with this nice girl, well, two weeks later and I've got myself a gf! 

For the first time in about 8 years I can feel conformable holding a girl, and the last time it was one of those BFF kind of girlfriend relationships, like you usually have when you're 8...

So believe in your selves guys and gals, it may seem stupid, but it just might happen....
