Guys, it actually happened. I think I may have a girlfriend now. Earlier today I found out that two of my best friends told each other they liked eachother, and didn't want to tell me. One of them ended up telling me, and there were a couple of other people who knew. I like one of them, and I messaged them telling them I found out. Some stuff was said, and she said to me that one of the two that had decided to try and set me up with her. 

I asked her what she thought about that, and she made me tell her what I thought first. It took me a couple of minutes to come up with a decent response, but I told her that I liked her, AND SHE LIKES ME TOO! HELL YES!!!
