For real question (anyone can chime in) why don't people have attraction for people who don't look like movie stars (guy here) So for me im not overweight in the slightest, I eat really well, I workout and I'm taking a class to train to be a fire fighter. But I'm not bones and twigs and I'm not all muscles so I have a lil tum so y dont u feel hot or wanted (romantically or sexually) I dont even care if I'm single for ever I just want to feel wanted 
Any tips or share yalls experience and its night time here soooo gnight everyone sleep well it helps alot, for all yall waking up have a great day and strive to make it better than the day before and for the people half way through the day remember your half way there then u can sleep 

Gnight yall
