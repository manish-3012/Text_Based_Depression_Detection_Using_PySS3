I lost twenty minutes of my life writing this bad furry rap and I had to listen to the original TWICE! It's every day bro with that OwO furry flow!
Five mil in fursuits, been six months, never done befo'!
Passed all the other fandoms, yo, weaboos are next!
And I'm nuzzlin' all these necks!
Got a brand new full-bod ref!
And I got the pawsies too!
And I'm boopin' all these snoots!
This is furry fandom, *Yap*,
Who the flip are heckin you?!
