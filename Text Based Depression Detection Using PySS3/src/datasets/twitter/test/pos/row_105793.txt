I just had an absolutely wonderful thought and I donâ€™t want to forget it so Iâ€™m posting it here for some reason When I have kids and they are in middle school Iâ€™m going to buy a Lada and dress up in the most tacky puma track suit and knock off Adidas I can find and get a terrible gold chain necklace and take them to school. Idk why I had this thought but Iâ€™m definitely going to do it. Iâ€™m going to be an embarrassing motherfucker. Donâ€™t judge me this will be golden, I think Iâ€™ll even learn Russian
