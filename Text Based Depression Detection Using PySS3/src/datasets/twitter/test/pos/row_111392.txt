14M down for a talk I must be really lonely to go on here to search for friends but whatever.

So let me introduce myself: I am from eastern Europe, slav (not Russian). My interests are playing games such as CS:GO, Minecraft and whatever is in my Steam library, robotics, IT stuff in general, math,  physics, hiking and martial arts. In addition, I am kind of an encyclopedist so I have things I can talk about, aside from my interests.

That's about it, hmu if you are interested.
