This is an actual serious post by me The thing i hate about life is that it's hard to fix myself, it hard for me to just not care about thing, i have to actively avoid thing just because of my emotions.

Why the fuck are my emotions like this, i get jealous and feel sad a couple of time thinking of my best friends being in a relationship with someone, i get angry how im not good at thing, that ive never been good at anything in my life.

My life has just started, these 19 years have been wasted and there will be more wasted year, i have to work more harder to try and catch up but i cant.

It harder for me to try and be productive, when it come to the point of me  hating myself, i push the idea of helping myself.

I hhate how i can only save myself, that i have to willingly help myself, there's no way i can finally live happy until maybe in 10 years, it'll take ages for me to finally get off my feet.

Im so lazy, i just want  to  die than rather see myself fail and fail and fail again, and even if i succeed, it wont be enough, ive been losing weight for 3 year and i still  hate how i look.

I cant save myself, why cant people just accept that people kill themselve, i just want to  die peacefully but there's no way to ask for help in my death.

I have everything at my disposal yet i dont use them.

I hate myself even more seeing my friends do something with their life.

They got a new car because their old one broke down alot and failed it mot.

Im nothhing but flesh and no brains.

I have no value, im worthless and people need to just bbe like oh ok your useless, fucking die.

They would be able to give the resources i had to someone who can use it far more better than me.
