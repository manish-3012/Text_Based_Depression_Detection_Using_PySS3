My dad is moving out soon Wow, Ive never though I would ever write this but Im bawling my eyes out. Im 16 and a bodybuilder probably the last person youâ€™d expect to bawl there eyes out.
16 years of me being in the same house with my dad he is now moving to another house across my town. I dont know what to do or what holds for me in the future. Does anyone have any tips to help keep me sane? I dont know what to do.
