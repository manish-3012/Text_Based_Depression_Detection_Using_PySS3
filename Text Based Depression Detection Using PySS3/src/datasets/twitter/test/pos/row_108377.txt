To all English teenagers First of all, sorry for my English, I am Spanish.
Second, I am going to tell you some funny shit. Okay, in my school, when we were younger, we it was Christmas, we wrote letters to English kids in UK. And they always ended with â€œFeliz aÃ±o nuevoâ€ but without the little stick above the n. So it was like â€œFeliz ano nuevoâ€ that in Spanish means â€œHappy New Anusâ€. Or when they said their age, was like â€œyo tengo 7 anosâ€ instead of â€œ7 aÃ±osâ€. Seven anus. Lmao. It was hilarious, great times... 

Hugs from Spain.
(I hope u all are save and cozy at home. Thx for reading ^^)
