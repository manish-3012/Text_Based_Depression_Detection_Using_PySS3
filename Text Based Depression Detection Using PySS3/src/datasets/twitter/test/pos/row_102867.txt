So what do you do when you immigrate to a new country in the middle of your high-school years with English being your second language then get depressed and isolate because even if you know English social anxiety makes it worse and get bad grades because most of your assignments are pst due, due the overwhelming feeling  being stupid and a fraud makes you unable to do anything, plus you don't know the level of education of your peers because you never spoke to them so you don't know what you're expected from the school. Also your grades are shit and you're running out of time. You always feel like an idiot and your morale is all time low.


You know, common high-school stuff.
