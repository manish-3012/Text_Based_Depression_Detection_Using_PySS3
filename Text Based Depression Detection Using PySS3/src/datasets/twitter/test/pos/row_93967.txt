How to deal with the big sad I donâ€™t wanna get up.

I found out that depression runs in my family which is very much a joy.

My mom wants me to see if something else works before getting anti depressants (which I could get when Iâ€™m older, but my brain is still developing and stuff so yeah)

Anyone got any tips?
