Tales from my childhood part 1 When I was a young lass, I didnt have many freinds...(not that that's really changed tho tbh) anyway... I had one freind, who was my best friend. That is until we came back from summer break, she doing the popular girls, and when I went up and said hi to her she pretended to not no me, and she looked disturbed that I knew her name. She made me look bat shit crazy ðŸ˜Œ.
