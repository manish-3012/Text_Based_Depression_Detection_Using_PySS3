Can we all salute our parentâ€™s Our parentâ€™s cared for us while we were screaming and crying our lungâ€™s out, cared for us while we didnâ€™t wanâ€™t to go to kindergarten, cared for us while we didnâ€™t have any friendâ€™s in high school, cared for us while we didnâ€™t have a job Etc.

Not salute them okay
