I think Iâ€™m starting to develop a crush for my best friend... Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck. I seriously cannot do this. I know for a fact that she doesnâ€™t like me, and too many times have I had to get over someone who didnâ€™t have feelings for me like I had for them. With my best friend though, Iâ€™m scared this would be in a totally different level and could fuck up our relationship. 

Sheâ€™s just so nice and pretty, and Iâ€™ve had so many good conversations with her. I can be myself around her and she is always there to comfort me. Literally what do I do?
