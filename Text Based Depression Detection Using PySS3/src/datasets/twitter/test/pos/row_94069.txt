just gave my friend advice to ask out my crush we both like the same girl but he doesn't know I like her and I know he likes her and when asked me for advice I kinda gave him very good advice and motivated him to "go get her" and now I feel lonely given the fact im pretty sure she likes my friend and if they start dating then im gonna be the only person in the friend group thats not with anyone and im gonna feel even more lonely and left out than befoee
