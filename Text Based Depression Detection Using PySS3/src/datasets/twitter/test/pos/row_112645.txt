Nick Crowley, Inside a Mind, Nexpo, ScareTheater, Barely Sociable, and Mama Max (Max is 100% the best of em) are all great YouTube channels. Check em out. They all cover relatively similar content, but it's good. 

Inside a Mind isn't as good as he was a couple months ago, but that's because there's like no good args anymore.
