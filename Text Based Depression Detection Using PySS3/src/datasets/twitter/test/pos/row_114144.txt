My 2 friends like the same girl as me Soo u recently started high school, no big deal and I kind of get a semi crush on a girl in my class that I dont know from before(context : I went to a school that does 1 to 10th grade and I know most people from before since I started there in 6th grade, although now some other kids joined from different schools and the classes got switched up). I usually walk to and from school with this one dude, obviously now my best friend and a few weeks ago he said to me that he likes the same girl that I do( he didnt know I liked her at the time) I was like ok, high school be interesting and told him later that day that I kind like her too( we both dont know much about her and he likes how she looks and I like her general vibe). Anyway we handle this like homies and deside we are going to wingman each other, soo one day we are doing some homework at the library( I live in Norway so the library very nice, they got outlets, free wifi and a ps4 and Nintendo switch that you can borrow but not now cuz of the rona , also norway dealed with the rona better than the us so we dont have that strict stay at home rule) anyway we finish and get talking about our crush, we both like amount us so we make a plan.

First get our one friend that I won't name for obvious reasons well call him bi cuz hea bi and we get our gay friend to talk to the girl in question and then we just ask them if they want to play among us later and conveniently also ask the girl in question along with her friend that she always hangs with, if they join then boom we invite them to a snap group simultaneously getting their snaps and hanging with them in among us, the girls are kinda weebs and the gay friend is a super weeb so they talk often.

The next day, today I tell the bi friend the plan( except for the part that I like the girl because he only knows that my best friend likes her) and he agrees and informs the gay friend, later we talk on discord and I tell him that u like her and he tells me that he likes her too so I dont know what to do know.

Tldr : I like a girl, my best friend likes her too and my other friend likes her too.

Btw we are being bros about it and not competing yet, just wingmaning eachother
