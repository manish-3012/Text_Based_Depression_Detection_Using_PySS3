Iâ€™m having a bad anxiety attack so idk talk to me and tell me about your day When I get anxious it spirals into a total shutdown/freakout if I donâ€™t stop it, and right now Iâ€™m in the hard to breath stage, so tell me jokes or about your dog, or literally anything you want. I just like hearing about other people since it takes my mind off of things.
