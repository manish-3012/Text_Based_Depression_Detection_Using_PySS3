SAT Today I have my SAT in 50 minutes any advice or tips. If not please pray to God because this my only chance to get into the college I want my PSAT scores were good enough but this is the real thing. My GPA is shitty and I need a 1300 to get in with my GPA, thanks wish me luck. Sorry if you have an aneurism reading this Iâ€™m typing it as fast as I can while stressed to a max
