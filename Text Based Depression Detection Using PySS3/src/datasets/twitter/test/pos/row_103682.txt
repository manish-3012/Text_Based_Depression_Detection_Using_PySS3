My school gave out abstinence keychains back in 8th grade My friend just reminded me about it. Like what did they think that was gonna do? Did they expect a kid to be on the brink of having sex for the first time and then say â€œNo I made a promise to Mrs. Myers!â€ Did any of your schools also do this?
