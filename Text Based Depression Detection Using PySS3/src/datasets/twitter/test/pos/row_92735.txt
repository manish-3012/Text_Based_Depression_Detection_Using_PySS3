Am I a weirdo? Hey ðŸ‘‹ 

Today I went to a protest and saw a girl I met like 2/3 years ago. We hadnâ€™t have any contact since then, but when I saw her today we had eye contact. I didnâ€˜t know how to react, so I did basically nothing, but smoke a cigarette after out of stress. 
I saw her 2 hours later but hadnâ€™t have any eye contact. She posted about the protest in her Instagram story and I thought â€žwhy not react with a clapping quick reactionâ€œ. Idk I thought, what could go wrong.
Now she has seen the reaction but didnâ€™t react to it.
Does she now think Iâ€™m a weirdo?
