I think I may hate Thanksgiving. This time of year, every year, everyone is so unhappy. The stress of the holidays, the cooking, the planning.


No one that has to cook is ever happy around this time of year, and I hate it. I can hardly enter a family area without feeling like someone is fuming.

Brining the turkey, preparing pie, organizing time for family to visit, doing the dishes. I'd rather order pizza and not go to all these lengths just to be miserable because everyone worked themselves too hard.

It doesn't help that my grandma died really recently, but the amount of anger and depression that lingers in the air sickens me. My mom is constantly grumpy, my dad seems to dump expectations on everyone sometimes. And family is planning to visit, for a family of introverts this is honestly too much.

This is all horrible, everyone member of my family is such a great person, my mom is caring and loving to everyone, my dad is thoughtful and patient (most of the time, he's working on it) my sister's are relatively cheery. As I was just finishing the apple pie I finally thought to myself "I'm miserable right now, everyone is so miserable."

I'm not sure what to do with this line of thinking, maybe i could suggest that we dial back Thanksgiving next year. I'm tired of everyone overworking themselves all because of some dumb holliday, I just want one Thanksgiving where we can actually be thankful and happy instead of grumpy and worn out.

Whatever, have a good day.
