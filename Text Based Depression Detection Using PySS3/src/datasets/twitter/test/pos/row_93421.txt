It's weird and creepy to call a celebrity sexy online. Like this shouldn't be a hot take but like people think it is. It's creepy if a het male does it then it's creepy if anyone does it. I don't care if you're apart of the LGBTQIA+ community I am too if you do it it's not only creepy but wrong. If you do this online please stop. Celebrities are people to y'know they shouldn't be sexualized by ANYONE weather it be a make or female.
