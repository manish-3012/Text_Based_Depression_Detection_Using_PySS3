is it possible shes interested so this girl ik from school hit me up yesterday and we talked for a bit and she said something about how she wished we talked. ive *kinda* liked her for a bit now but never developed like a full crush on her really.

ps - 2021 so far has been treating me a lot better than i anticipated and i hope it has/will for yall too
