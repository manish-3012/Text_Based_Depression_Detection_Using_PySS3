Acceptance is the best feeling in the world Today I accepted that I'm never gonna quit porn after a year of constant trying. I know it's wrong but I feel so much better and accept that capitalism will lead to horrible situations for people in poverty trying to make a living. I'm so sorry to sex workers. Why did I have to start when I was 10. Its ok.
