Choose for me reddit ! I have to choose an English/American author that has made an fantasy / imaginary story for my english class. I have narrowed it down to 2 idea :

-a classic : toy story

-a meme / classic : shrek.

I would have proposed The bee movie but I do not know enough about it to choose it :/

Keep in mind that I know more about Toy story than Shrek but it would be fun either way :)
