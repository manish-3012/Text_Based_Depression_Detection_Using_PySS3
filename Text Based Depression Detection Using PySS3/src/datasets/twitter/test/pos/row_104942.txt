I have the best joke ever that only real ones understand. So me and my girlfriend were driving down I4 and we saw a sign for a place called Boardwalk Burgers. You know, a nice wholesome burger joint, homeless people slapping patties on the foreman. I turned to my girlfriend, and with incredible wits unlike no other mortal, said â€œBoardwalk Burgers? More like BORED burgers, because the burgers arenâ€™t having any fun.â€
