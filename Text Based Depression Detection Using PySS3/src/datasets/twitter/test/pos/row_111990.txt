So basically Iâ€™m fucked I only started school about 3 weeks ago and Iâ€™m already a week behind in homework because Iâ€™m not getting any time alone from my family to do any of my work. We recently got a new house that weâ€™re renovating and I have to help do all the heavy work because Iâ€™m a â€œyoung boyâ€. My family is well aware I have homework, being a HS Senior and all, but right now it just feels like they donâ€™t care, even though theyâ€™re giving me a metric ton of shit for getting a job and going to college and all that. 

TL;DR: I canâ€™t get time to do my homework and my family is aware of that, and probably doesnâ€™t give a shit.
