Teenage girls can't like anything You like sports?You're doing it for male attention.You like X musician?You're basic.You like Y musician?You're edgy.You like make up?You're fake.You like video games?You just want attention.
Why can't teenage girls like anything without being bashed and demonized.It's not girlhood anymore ,it's monsterhood.
