I(13.5M) want to drop out of school and rap  all my homies be rappin n trappin wit me n now I'm tryna come up but I have some problems in my way. to get this out of the way, I have a few original bars such as "Im not a dyke but I keep the strap on" and "Im not a golfer but I stay with my iron" among others. I consider myself a mixture between chief keef and Eminem(because of my skin tone), anyways I need a studio to record in, but its hard to find someone in Southside Chicago who will help me come up.  It don't help that the opps be reachin for my chain n sending shots at my top whenever I'm tryna slide to the stu. Even tho u can't read quindarious imma still give u the whole magazine when I catch u lackin. PS I need an n word pass because imma cracker.

So if u from da rap n tryna help a yb come up hmu, btw give me juiceWRLDs number bc we finna drop a banger when I get in the stu with him.

Ill post again when my soundcloud acc is up my name will be lil cracka 

if anyone makes beats hmu too I need some free fire drill type beats 

btw I'm hot af no cap I need a bitch to spoil in drip
