Offering help I'm just putting this out there to see if anyone needs advice or something to rant at or anything like that.

It doesn't matter what, I'll try to help if I can and at the very least be a listening ear.

I can't say I've gone through everything, or even much, but I can do what I can from what I've seen. Just want to help someone


(Just adding this at the end, I don't know if anyone has noticed but I've been trying to put this up daily to try to help people. So not spam but I am repeating post. Don't know if it has ever had any impact or help, but gonna keep doing it on the low chance it does. Was kind of debating doing it today because of some irl stuff, but decided to anyway, although my response time might be longer than id prefer.)
