Why do kids deface school toilets? I have never understood the thought process behind vandalising school toilets. A couple of years ago at my school someone had a crap in the urinal. Sure, it was funny, but why? That's just disgusting. Who the fuck are they trying to impress by performing such acts? At that time the floors were covered in puddles of piss and the toilets were overflown with full rolls of toilet paper and turds and the water was yellow from people continuing to piss in them. It stank of dehydrated piss left brewing for weeks. Some kids would also break the locks on the cubicles and the floors were covered in litter. But worst of all: there was no soap because kids stole it. This was from when I started in year 7 up until year 9. Fast forward to year 10 and the school got some people in to refurbish the toilets. There were no doors to enter, it was just go straight in. There were only cubicles and no mirrors. First day back, brand new, hundreds spent on refurbishment, squeaky cleanâ€¦ By the end of the day it was a tip. Floors covered in litter, puddles of piss on the floor, the locks broken. School was pissed off, had to spend more money to repair the damage. Coming into year 11 each year has to use different toilets at break time because of the restrictions due to the pandemic.  Our year has to use the Sixth Form toilets. Locks broken (admittedly they were already broken from when I was in year 10), litter on the floor. And in addition, kids have started blocking the sinks and filling them with water and soap to make bubbles. *Bubbles*. *Year fucking 11*. So, to round it all up, why le fuck do kids deface school toilets?
