R.I.P. My characters from the Oregon Trail Billy Bob, Jimmy John, Timmy Tom, Rimmy Rob, and Simmy Sob were all on a save file at a school computer that I'll never be able to access again

Rimmy Rob died of dehydration a day away from an oasis, and now *none* of them will ever get to Oregon. I had a backstory for them and everything and now they'll just be in Colorado forever, with nothing to their name but a wagon wheel, 47 dollars, 23 bullets, and 879 pounds of venison.
