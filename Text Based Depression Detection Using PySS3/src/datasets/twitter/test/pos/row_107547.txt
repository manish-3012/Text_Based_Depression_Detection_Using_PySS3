Alert *Karen encounter* I know you guys probably donâ€™t care but hereâ€™s the story. So me and my dad went for a run together and he can run way further than me so we split off he kept running an I started to go home.
Because I was exercising and I have asthma so I wasnâ€™t wearing a mask.where I am you only have to wear a mask if ur shopping or on public transport. You can see where this is going. So ummm casually running home and this lady wearing a mask comes up to me like kinda close and asks why u not wearing a mask and I say what I said at the start and sheâ€™s like â€˜and? Thereâ€™s a global pandemic you should wear a mask anywhere even if it could make you have a fucking asthma attack. And this lady pulls out her phone and calls the police. On a fucking 13 yo going for a run 
Like wtf
