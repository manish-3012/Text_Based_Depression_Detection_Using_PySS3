This site is going to hell I posted a picture of my bucket list to r/mademesmile and immediately people are saying that my dreams are impossible, blaming me when I fought back at them. Not only that, someone told me that she was disgusted by the fact that I want to get married and travel Europe. After that she just looked for pictures of me saying that I looked disgusting so I have no idea if there are any wholesome subs on here anymore.
