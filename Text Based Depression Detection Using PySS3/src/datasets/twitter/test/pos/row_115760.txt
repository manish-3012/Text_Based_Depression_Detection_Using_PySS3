Fuck covid Welp, covid has really fucked me. So, my girlfriend (F17) and me (M16) have been dating for 8 months and covid came along and have really fucked things up. When school had ended, it was announced on like the same day that school was closing and me and my girlfriend only had a brief hug since we just thought that we would see each other again the next day. But as you guessed it, covid happened and really fucked things up. We couldn't go out anymore since neither of us wanted to really get covid and nor wanted to inconvenience other people or wanted to get the other sick even though we both weren't sick. I really regret that decision since her parents wanted to go back to their home country until covid had settled down but now was you know it it's been a super long time and like a good 6 months of our relationship has been purely long distance just due to covid. But to get to the point, her parents have decided to switch schools which is so fucking terrible for me. I won't really get to see her anymore and who knows if this relationship will survive. Like low-key I don't even know what to do anymore. Part of me wants to cry my brains out but part of me just wants to tell her it's fine and it's much better for her cause the schools prolly a better school anyways. Like I low-key love her and she's been the person that I have been the most communicative with and open with out of all of my relationships. And she's like the nicest most understanding person ever so yeah. I just don't know what to do anymore. Should I break up with her and let her go on with her life? Or should I just keep things as it is. I don't even know what I'm saying anymore and what to do. By the way sorry for swearing so much, I usually keep it on the down low.
