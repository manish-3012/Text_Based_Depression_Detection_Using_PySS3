Who would have thought that a subreddit I started as a joke because I was bored one night and was annoyed at the roaches would grow into a little community of 700 members... Iâ€™ve got to admit itâ€™s not as busy as the early days, but itâ€™s still slowly growing. r/Mantisgang will be an interesting memory of mine...
