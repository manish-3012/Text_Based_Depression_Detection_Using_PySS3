Need new friends Hi guys. Itâ€™s really hard to make new friends during quarantine (American here... yay) so I wanted to try and make some new ones. 

I like music, cooking, dumb videos, and memes 

I watch a lot of pewdiepie (ik cringe) penguinz0, and anything on YouTube under a minute (best life tip) 

I promise Iâ€™m more interesting than this but this feels like a dating profile honestly.
