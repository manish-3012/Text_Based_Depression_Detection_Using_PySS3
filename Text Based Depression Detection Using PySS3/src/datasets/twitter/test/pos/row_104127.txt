I feel like a "close friend" of mine is using me. so basically one of my friends and one of my other friends have a 3 person gc on instagram (we're all females btw) and a lot of times we send photo replies to each other and like she dumps us w a lot of info about her life but whenever we talk about ourselves she doesn't really care, most of the time putting us on read, and she doesn't text me at all and only does when she needs help on assignments or needs to rant... she calls me a close friend and all but I don't know she leaves my dms on read, my friend on read, and mostly only come to me for help on hw. I feel like my efforts toward this friendship are not being reciprocated at all.. thoughts or advice..?
