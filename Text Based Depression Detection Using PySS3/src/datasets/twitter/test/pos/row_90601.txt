Guess what just happened I'm bi. I think. I was texting a friend and made a joke about hiding in their closet. I was NOT trying to come out. But then they starting asking questions and I just decided to confess. I found out that a lot more of my friends are also part of the LGBTQ community and it feels good to know that I'm not alone.
