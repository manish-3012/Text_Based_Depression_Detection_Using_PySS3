I felt alive after a long time So I met some of my friends who I haven't met in a long time and no I don't contact them through social media or stuff like that. We met after like 1-2 years and our dads went to the same college that's why we know each other and we have known each other since we were very young. They were very friendly and affectionate that I was confused because I haven't got that much love of affection in a long time and I'm socially awkward but still enjoyed the day and I can say that this was the best day for me in 2020. I literally feel like a new person. I'm a little sad that the day is over and we will only meet after a long time but still it was good. Also this is my first post here
