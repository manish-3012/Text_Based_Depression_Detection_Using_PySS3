Hey, I'd wanna some opinion on this So basically I have a homework to analyze a poem, and write what I think is the meaning, and I dunno, it just seems as losing yourself in love and then realization of loneliness to me. So did the other poem, while everyone thought about nightly nature, I thought of death (sun coming down, falling into deep sleep, grey meadows...).

As I was ranting to my mum about it she asked me if I would wanna see a psychologist. Honestly I think I am quite normal, nothing too serious. But please, just tell me if I'm overthinking or not.
