I have lost all respect for human beings So i was having an argument with my mom earlier today. We were arguing if the lunar landing was real or not, I was on real, and she was against it. We kept on arguing back and forth, it felt like a debate tournament. The only thing that she had was the flag moving in the video, but I'm a good debater, so I just kept on going with actual facts to prove her wrong, then she'd just come back with the flag. Well eventually she had nothing she just kept on saying "how do YOU even know it was real?" Finally about 15 minutes later she just went on how the moon isn't even real, like what. Then she went on, for another 2 minutes, but I said nothing, because I was still thinking about the how she doesn't think the moon exists. I then asked her if she was serious, but no, she really thinks that the moon isn't real. I don't even know what to say, sorry for my rant.

TLDR; My mom and I got into an argument, and now I realized that she doesn't think the moon exists.
