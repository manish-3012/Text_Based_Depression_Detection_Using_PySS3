What should I do? The first time I biked through a red light after I was sure it was clear (I didn't even know that was illegal until the guy told me). Today I was walking home looking at my phone and I heard yelling in a house. I slowed down to listen and when I passed it some scary guy came out in a wifebeater and was yelling at me and shit. I just ignored him and continued walking home but then a cop pulled me over and thought I took a picture of the dudes house for whatever reason. He asked to see my pictures and it was sort of awkward cause my camera roll is mostly dirty memes but then he let me go. I go back to in person school on monday and now I'm gonna have to take a different route. I go every other week to school so my second week I'll go the normal way cause it should be warm enough to wear a sweater instead of a coat so I'll look different but man I'm worried that guy will beat my ass if I pass his house on the way to school
