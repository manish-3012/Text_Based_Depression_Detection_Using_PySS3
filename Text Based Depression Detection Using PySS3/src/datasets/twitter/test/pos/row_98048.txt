How can you tell, via text/call, if a guy has friendzoned you vs if he's interested? Title really. I have a friend who I've been texting with almost everyday. Recently, however, he's been texting first less and less, and I don't know the reason, so I assumed it's because he's busy.

Some signs I've picked up on;

- he has asked me (multiple times) whether or not I romantically am interested in our mutual friends.

- he has asked me if I'm feeling okay when I seemed down and comforted me/given me helpful advice

- he frequently sends me YouTube videos or song recommendations he thinks I'll like. However he has been doing this less recently.

- he likes to tease me a lot and has said before he enjoys doing this.

Anything is appreciated. Thanks
