Im depressed. im 13, but feel 70. Im so frusterated at my age. I see a bunch of cringey 16 year olds making fools of themeselves, and realize theyre litterly 3 years older than me. I hate this life. Why couldn't God just put me in they 1940s? By now, i could be Mr. rich retiree, driving around a shiny little red corvette. I feel like im trapped in 4 walls that have "13" painted in big red letters on each of them. I dislike basiccly everything of this modern era. all i do for entertainment, is watch (conservative) politics, and Dave ramsey talk finance. If i watch tv which is rare, its old cowboy shows from the 60s-70s. My music playlist consists of old country songs from the 50s-70s. See? If i told all this to you without context, you would think your talking to a 76 year old. Sometimes i lay in bed thinking, Your 13. Just a year ago you were a little kid. Whats your thoughts?
