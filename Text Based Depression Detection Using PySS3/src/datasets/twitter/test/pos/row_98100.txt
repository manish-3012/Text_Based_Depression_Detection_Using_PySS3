So that happened and it scared the shit out of me When we were doing "practice days" or whatever at secondary school when I was still in primary (just means that we had a couple of days at secondary school whilst still in primary). There were over 100 kids there and they had to call attendance and then you had to walk up to the front and get a name tag or whatever. So my introverted ass just thought,  "I hope I'm in the middle I don't want any attention". So they start attendence. And because I was the only kid from my school going to this one, I was called up first. And my name is really weird. So I had to stand up in front of everyone, walk to the front, get a nametag and go back to my seat. In front of over 100 other kids.

Anyway that was one of the worst experiences of my life lol.
