just spent half an hour thinking about how to text "hi" in a groupchat im about to start taking online art classes and the teacher added me to the main groupchat. i spent like half an hour thinking about what to say, and honestly I want to die. eventually i said good morning ðŸ¤ ðŸ¤ ðŸ¤  and i still feel like i didn't do it right, FUCKKKK i hate myself sometimes
