What are your thoughts on the Canada rollback party or CRP I'm seriously considering forming a political party and I'm thinking of naming it the Canadan rollback party. Canada's laws are like a tangled up ball of string there full of contradictions and BS. But my plan is to simplify and roll back as many laws and restrictions as possible within reason and make Canada a truly free country. But to keep it that way I'd implement dozens of sturdy constitutions plus I'd lower government spending, make Canada a even bigger exporter (except to China) , try to bring back canadian business to Canada, make the voting power in valuable provinces like Alberta, Saskatchewan and newfoundland stronger. I really think all this would be popular and last but not least I'd speak with facts and logic Rather than mind games and I'd answer truthfully no matter the question.
