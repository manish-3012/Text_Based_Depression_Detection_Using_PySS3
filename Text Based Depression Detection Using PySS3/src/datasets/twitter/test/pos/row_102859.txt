My crush wants me to choose their sexual orientation I was chatting with my crush (we are both guys)
And I asked about his sexual orientation, since he had been very unclear about it, and he answered â€œIdk but itâ€™s not my choice if I am gay or not , itâ€™s your choice â€œ what should I do?!
Iâ€™m panicking now because I feel like i have a chance to get together with him, but I dont know if that is morally right.
