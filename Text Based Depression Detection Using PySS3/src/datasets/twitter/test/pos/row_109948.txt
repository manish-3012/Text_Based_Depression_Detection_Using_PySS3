WE ARE LIVING IN A SIMULATION (I have proof) How come you can hold a shit in? If humans really needed to poop then why can we hold it? Some people go like 3 days w/o leting it out.

I think that poop is like useless information for the Ailiens who made the simulation. And whenever ur holding it in the ailiens are like: hmm should we keep this?

And then when u feel the sudden urge to poop itâ€™s because the ailiens have gotten a sudden piece of information or sum.

This is what I think about before I go to sleep:) wow amazing
