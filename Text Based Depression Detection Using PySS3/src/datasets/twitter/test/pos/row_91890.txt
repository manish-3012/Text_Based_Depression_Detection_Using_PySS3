Fuck r/sex I posted something saying I donâ€™t get why people think itâ€™s wrong to not suck dick/eat pussy. 

My post got taken down by the mods and everyone was basically shaming my girlfriend for not wanting to give head, and calling me stupid for being ok with her decision and still thinking sheâ€™s the love of my life.

Iâ€™m probably getting banned from the sub because someone insulted my girlfriend, so I called them a ho for posting nudes online.

Fuck them. Itâ€™s supposedly sex positive but apparently thatâ€™s only if youâ€™re a whore/fuck boy who has sex with 500 people before you get married, or if you post nudes. Fucking cunts
