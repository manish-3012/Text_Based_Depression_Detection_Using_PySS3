I need help with family issues TLDR: My dad is trying to rip off my mom from his life and I don't know what to do.

So my parents divorced about seven or eight years ago and everything was fine. My dad and my mom both had partners and both where fine with it. They both live half a km apart. But since my dad's new girlfriend arrived, things have been changing.

First, off, his girlfriend convinced my dad to get a dog for the house, and when we started taking the dog to my mom's house, he one day abruptly decided not to let us do that anymore. He didn't even tell me why concisely. He said some BS about the dog being for the house and whatnot, but I don't buy it. 

Then he told my mom sge was not allowed to go to his mother's house, that she could no longer go to a sportclub (it's a sexist club so she could only go as a wife), and that he would no longer financially support my mom in any way. So my mom told me but she said we were not allowed to tell him that she told us. 

Then one month later it's my sister's BD tomorrow and my sister wanted my mom and my dad to go, but my dad said, and I quote "I don't want to see you". He said that in spanish and via chat to my mom, and we didn't see the text, but still. My mom, again, told me this but didn't let me even mention it to my dad.

I want everything to be happy, but I don't know what to do. Help. Please

Edit: My mom did nothing wrong, she never interacted with my dad. He is the one causing the trouble. Also my dad said nothing about the issue whatsoever, not a single thing.
