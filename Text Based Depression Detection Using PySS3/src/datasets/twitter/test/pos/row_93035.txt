why do parents hate long hair on guys? hi iâ€™m a girl myself but my boyfriend is always getting shit for having long hair. people call him maam like he doesnâ€™t have a full beard and mustache. but the best part is that parents all had long hair when they were younger too!!! 

they only started hating it when they couldnâ€™t grow it anymore :(
