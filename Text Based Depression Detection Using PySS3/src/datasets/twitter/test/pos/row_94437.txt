i cant stand when people make everything about race i sae this video on twitter where these two african americans scared people by lunging towards them and dancing. 

and hella comments were like â€œoMg wHiTe pEoPlE aRe sO sCaReD oF bLaCk pEoPlEâ€ If you jump at any human being alive, their natural human instinct is so flinch. 

Apparently people cant even do that without being called a racist
