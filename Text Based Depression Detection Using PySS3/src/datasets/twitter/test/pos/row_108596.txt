MY MOM FINALLY UNDERSTANDS so my mom was making dinner and couldnâ€™t find the vegetable peeler and so she called me into the room (I do the dishes) and the following conversation happens:

me: whats going on?

mom: I canâ€™t find the damn peeler

me: *searching drawer*

mom: I already checked there

me: *finds it*

she finally feels my pain
