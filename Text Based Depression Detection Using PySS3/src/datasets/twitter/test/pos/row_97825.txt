I donâ€™t wanna be around my mom or my dad anymore. i posted a story a few hours ago of how my parents are very strict and it goes on. Since that story Iâ€™m still experiencing stomach pain and according to my parents Iâ€™m the cause of the stomach pain because I donâ€™t digest the fucking food. I get such bad stomach aches i canâ€™t sit up. I donâ€™t wanna live with them anymore I live in the country and might run soon Iâ€™m just stressed and tired of them Iâ€™m giving up. I might leave this world forever. **If anyone can help plz I wanna get away from them** I donâ€™t have a phone I use reddit on the school iPad.
