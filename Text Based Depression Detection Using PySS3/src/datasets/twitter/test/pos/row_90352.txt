Does anybody want to be internet friends with me? (: I might be a big traktor in reddit but in real life I am actually a black egg with very realistic legs, lol. But to be honest, I kinda want to have some internet friends, you know? I just see a lot of people talk about them and how it is cool to have one. I don't really interact with soical medias but I want to try this out.   
My Instagram: blackeggwithrealisticlegs  
My Twitter (I don't sit here as much as Instagram but if you want we could talk here too P: ) @ Traktor\_no\_Big; Ð¯Ð¹Ñ†Ð¾, cool ÑÐ¹Ñ†Ð¾ &lt;---- (this one is my account name)

Please, I am feeling really lonely right now, PLEASE. I BEG YOU. OR I WILL COME TO YOUR HOUSE AND KICK YOUR BALLS WITH MY STRANGELY REALISTIC LEGS. 

I am sorry if I seem quite aggressive, it's just 1 a.m in my timezone and I don't really know what I am doing, lol  


Also, just wanted to say that I'm 15 and it would be kinda cool if we were the same age. It's not that big of a deal, I just think it would be cool, that's it
