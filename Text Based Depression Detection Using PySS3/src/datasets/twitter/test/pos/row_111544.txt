My Dad Owes Me 100$ Because He Thought Dolphins Were A Fish Everyone knows 3 main things in life: rat poison is also human poison, human poison will probably work on rats, and DOLPHINS ARE FUCKING MAMMALS.

So me and my dad were talking about how I have an irrational fear of fish. He tries to scare me or something, I'm not sure what he was doing, and started talking about if a fish came by and rubbed its its nose on my shoulder. That fish he was talking about, was a dolphin. So I tell him "hey dad, dolphins arent fish," and he acts all confused. He says "no, whales are the ones that are mammals, dolphins are the ones that are fish." So he says "100 bucks says I'm right." So we shake on it because I know I'M right.

One google search later and his dumbass is surprised to hear that dolphins, are in fact, MAMMALS, and not fucking FISH.

Stay in school kids, or you might lose 100$ to your son because of how much of a dumbass you are. Now I just gotta hope he keeps his end of the promise and actually gives me the 100$.

TL;Dr: My dumbass dad wanted to bet 100$ that dolphins were fish. One google search later and he owes me 100$.
