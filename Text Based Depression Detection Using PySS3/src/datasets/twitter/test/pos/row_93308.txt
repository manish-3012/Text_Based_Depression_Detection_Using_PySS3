What would you do if you got sexually assaulted by your parent? TL;DR: my mommy touch me in no no area and cop says I can put her on trial. But the question is, is it worth it


So I apparently got sexually assaulted and I didnâ€™t even know it was sexual assault till a year ago when an investigator came to my school and asked if I wanted to press charges or something like that and if I wanted to close the case. Before the investigator came I was in a situation with cps where I told them that my mom touched my male genitalia area in claims of checking if I was wearing underwear and I guess that was wrong and then they opened a court case (I literally didnâ€™t know anything about it till the investigator spoke to me at school). When the investor asked if I wanted to close the case and said that I could reopen it anytime if I change my mind I just said sure to close it and signed a paper since I didnâ€™t have any evidence and I didnâ€™t think it would really solve anything (since if I lost then being at home is going to be super weird). But now I changed my mind since I realized I can easily get her to confess it in a conversation and record it and I keep thinking about it whenever Iâ€™m near here (since I live in the same house as her) but the question is, is it a good idea to try to put your mom on trial in hopes of no longer having to constantly be reminded of the pain and having to literally live with the person that did it (Iâ€™m 16 btw and was 15 when she did all that stuff) 

Side question: does anyone happen to actually know how to get your parent to confess then touching you in the no no area in a casual conversation?
