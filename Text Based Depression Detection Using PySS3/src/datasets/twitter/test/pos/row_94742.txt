I hate how easily I get attached Ok so, this has always been a problem. With friends, girls, coaches, almost anyone who cares. And it doesn't happen a lot tbh, but when it does I know right away. Even just when they don't respond for a few hours, or they cant hang, I just miss them so bad. Its worse when I just meet random people on the internet, bc I know there's a small chance we actually stay friends.
