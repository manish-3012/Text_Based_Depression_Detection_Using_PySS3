deep intellectual rant ok so honestly, i feel like ppl are born selfish, like have u met a single person who isn't semi passive-aggressive? also anyone know that thing called moral realism? its rlly fucking scary thinking abt that? anyway this philosopher once said, "ppl only do good things to feel good abt themselves" which i kind of agree with. So I'm doing history hw rn and just take a look at the fucking world wars. Proof that humanity as a whole is lowkey selfish?
