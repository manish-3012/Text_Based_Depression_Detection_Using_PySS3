Do you support existing quotas for Black Americans in American colleges? It's a well known fact that US colleges favour Black Americans while making their admission decisions, thus discriminating White and Asian Americans (not mention internationals). For the great majority of applicants, Asian Americans and Whites have a very low likelihood of admission as African American applicants with comparable academic credentials. Colleges reject Asian American and White applicants each year based on their race, whom it otherwise would admit. The reason behind this is simple â€“ colleges need to fill some 13% of their classes with Blacks. So, do you support the fact that the hard work of thousands of White and Asian American teens is ruined because colleges need to favour Blacks?
