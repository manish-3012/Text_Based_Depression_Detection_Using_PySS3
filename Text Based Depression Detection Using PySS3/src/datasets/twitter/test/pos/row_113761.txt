It hurts so much Iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts recently and have been getting major support. (Therapy, meds (Iâ€™m already on antidepressants but they werenâ€™t working), and a but load of other things) just a few days ago I was constantly having suicidal thoughts. Now itâ€™s once or twice a day. I canâ€™t begin to describe my agony that happens sometimes. But Iâ€™ll put it in some way, a extremely painful headache that isnâ€™t physical but Iâ€™m guessing mental. It hurts so much....I canâ€™t stand it. I just clutch my head and go to the floor crying. As far as a remember no one else knows this. I canâ€™t stand this and from what my physiatrist said â€œyour depression is like hardware in your brain, all we can change is your software (thoughts and feelings)â€ so that basically means Iâ€™m fighting depression my whole life. Iâ€™ve had it nearly my whole life anyway. Not planing on suicide but I donâ€™t know if I can stand this for a whole lifetime.
