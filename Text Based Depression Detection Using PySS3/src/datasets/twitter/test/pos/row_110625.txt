Yo thess new girls in my grade are super short One of them is like 4'10 and the other one's head is eye level on her.

They're so short it's fucking ridiculous.

I saw the second girl for the first time in a while (she was my partner back at debate camp in 6th grade) and she was standing next to this girl who's 5'5ish. The dichotomy is hilarious z especially cause wwe also have dudes in our grade who are like 6'+
