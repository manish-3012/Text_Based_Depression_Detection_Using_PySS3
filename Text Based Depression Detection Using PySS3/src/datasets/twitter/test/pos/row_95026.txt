what is it with teenagers and dating Most teenager relationships only last 1 month or less, and they donâ€™t even do anything. They just talk sometimes and donâ€™t actually hang out outside of school. And when they start â€œdatingâ€, they feel the need to tell everyone they know and then when the relationship is over after 2 weeks they pretend to be sad. The only time Iâ€™d say you should start dating is when youâ€™re like 16+. If youâ€™re any age younger than that you shouldnâ€™t even think about dating. I understand if people can say theyâ€™re lonely but thatâ€™s just because puberty is a rough time in everyoneâ€™s life.

These are just my opinions. Donâ€™t go in my comments spamming me because youâ€™re angry I donâ€™t agree with you.
