I feel like I just care about others more than myself. Look i like helping others. Like with advice and stuff. Support and shit. And it hurts when I don't know what the hell to do. Like in u/xQzca post about the relationship. Really want to help, but i don't know what to say. Cause idk how it is to be in a situation like that. 

But, i feel like i sacrifice too much or something. Like self care is just dead to me or something. I don't know why. Always feel selfish and scum of the earth if i try to help myself. 

I don't know man, i just feel the obligation to help other people but not myself. 

Sorry if this comes off corny or something.
