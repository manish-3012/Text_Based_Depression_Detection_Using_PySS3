Honestly as much as I hate to say it. The rest of this generation can kiss a normal high school experience goodbye. Shit ain't ever going to be the same for at least 10 years. And with shit like this, some things we're doing now are here to stay. Fuck this shit. I'm afraid my school ain't ever going to be as free as it was my freshman year ever again.
