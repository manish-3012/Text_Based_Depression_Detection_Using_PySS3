New dog but I canâ€™t help but miss our old dog The second day of March this year my old dog had passed away from certain complications which eventually deteriorated her to much. I wonâ€™t get into that though. She had an entirely new personality once she got sick, and this lasted for close to half a year. Anyway once she passed I feel that I handled her passing the best amongst my family members, even though I am the youngest. I was no longer sad for her but instead grateful for the memories after about a week. However now 10 months later once we got our new dog I canâ€™t help but miss her so much. I do not resent our new dog in anyway but I just feel so upset about our old dog. I had not felt this sadness for around 9 months. Can anyone help me with some advice?
