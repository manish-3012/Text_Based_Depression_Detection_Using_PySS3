Holy fuck these 2 things piss me off so much I know Iâ€™m gonna sound like a â€œUMM, ACTUALLYâ€ person but holy fuck does this shit piss me off.

1. Those stupid as MONKE memes never show actual monkeys

Monkeys are extremely small and arenâ€™t that much related to chimpanzees that much. That sniper monkey meme? Thatâ€™s a chimp. Sometimes the monkeys are bonobos because the two are pretty similar. It also pisses me off when people call gorillas and orangutans monkeys. Also fun fact, chimpanzees are known to hunt monkeys. Basically great apes (bonobos, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans) arenâ€™t monkeys.

2. Stop calling SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) coronavirus

Imagine someone asking you what ice cream is that and you say â€œice creamâ€. Coronavirus is a family of viruses, the family consists of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, 2003 outbreak), MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, 2012 outbreak), and COVID-19. If you asked a virologist how bad coronavirus was they would ask you â€œWhich oneâ€. 

Alright Iâ€™m done being annoying to everyone reading this, thanks for reading my rant if youâ€™ve made it here.
