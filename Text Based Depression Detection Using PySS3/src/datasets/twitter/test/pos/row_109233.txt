Today is my first day as a teenager and I don't know what to post so I'll just tell a story. I was in homeroom with my classmates and they were spreading rumors about Ryan ToysReview retiring and stuff. Then suddenly, I made a joke and said,"Even if Ryan retires now, he will definitely come back when he is older and doing toy reviews. But...he'll definitely be reviewing *a different type of toy*". I got the whole class laughing and was lucky enough to not let the teacher hear the joke properly.
