Apparently the city of Fresno has a GDP higher than two US stated and 106 countries I think that tells you more about those countries than Fresno. Fresno had a GDP of about $50 billion in 2019

I know Wyoming doesnâ€™t exist but the void where it is said to exist deposits roughly $34 billion worth of goods into South Dakota every year so Iâ€™m counting it. The other one is Vermont 

LA has a gdp of almost a trillion dollars, thatâ€™s about 20 times higher than Fresno. How does one city have a gdp that big, Tokyo has a GDP of $1.8 trillion but it has 10 times the population
