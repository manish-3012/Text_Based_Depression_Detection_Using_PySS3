What iâ€™ve noticed in relationships where oneâ€™s love language is touch: hugs, kisses, cuddling, etc. and oneâ€™s love language isnâ€™t physical touch and they tend to stay away from it. In order to be compatible, you will need to learn each otherâ€™s love language. The one who doesnâ€™t express love by physical touch will obviously need more work though. You canâ€™t have two people with two different love languages and let one express their love language without letting the other expressing theirs. In this type of relationship itâ€™s usually the one who doesnâ€™t express love through physical touch that gets their love language across, while not letting the other who loves through physical touch express their language.

You have to try to work into the otherâ€™s language though if you truly love them, or it probably wonâ€™t be a functional relationship.
