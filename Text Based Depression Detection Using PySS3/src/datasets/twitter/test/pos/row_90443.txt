I just took my first Covid testðŸ˜¬ So I sit next to this girl in geometry and weâ€™ve been friends since 6th grade (im in 9th right now) and so I was helping her with homework because I found it easy and she didnâ€™t and she just told me she tested positive for â€˜rona soooo. We have block schedule so periods 1-4 are in day one and 5-8 are ok day two, Thursday of last week (10/8) was the last time we like made contact because we had hurricane delta hit, so now Iâ€™m just sitting in my room waiting for the results because i just now took the test. It wasnâ€™t that bad but the worst part was when I wanted to cringe because I guess felt gross, but I couldnâ€™t so my face looked like I was **enjoying** it omlðŸ¤¦ðŸ½â€â™€ï¸

So uh yeah, thatâ€™s just my rant, I donâ€™t really expect anyone to comment or anything but yeahðŸ¤™ðŸ½
