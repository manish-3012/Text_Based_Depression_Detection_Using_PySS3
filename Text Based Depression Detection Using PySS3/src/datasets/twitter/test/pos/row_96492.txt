I feel as if I should be dating but I barely take to girls, is this bad? Iâ€™m 15 and most of my friends have girlfriends and I feel kind of jealous. I go to an only boys school so I can only really meet girls outside of school but I donâ€™t really have any hobbies or sports which I can do outside of school. So I feel like I donâ€™t have a chance.
