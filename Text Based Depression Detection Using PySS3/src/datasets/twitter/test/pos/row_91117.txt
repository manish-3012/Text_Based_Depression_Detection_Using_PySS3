Numb feeling in hands and face when in a stressful situation This has never happened to me before in all my life, but I started hanging out with a girl and Iâ€™ll get this numb feeling in my hands and face when talking to her sometimes while in the car with her. 

Itâ€™s only happened 2-3 times, when she asked me if were just friends or more, and first kissed and stuff like that. 

Why does this happen, this has never happened to me. My face gets numb and itâ€™s hard to talk, my hands and legs get numb and tense up, and I get light headed and itâ€™s hard to make talk normal.
