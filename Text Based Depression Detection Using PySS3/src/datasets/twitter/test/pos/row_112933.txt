My uncle is getting surgery 
I havenâ€™t really posted on this subreddit before, but I trust that all of you are good people and will understand. My uncle living in New Jersey just got diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in his jaw and heâ€™s going for surgery on September 8th. I just want those who are kind enough to take some time to pray for him. Doesnâ€™t matter what your religion is. If youâ€™re an atheist just spare a thought for him. Thatâ€™s all. Thanks and please be safe.

Note: If you think this is fake, then you are open to criticise me all you want, I donâ€™t care
