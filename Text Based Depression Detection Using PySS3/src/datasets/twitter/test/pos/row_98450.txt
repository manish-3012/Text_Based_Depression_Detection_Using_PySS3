I finally did the thing i was plannig since school started. I hate it when people bite their nail, i just don't like it, its like some people are irritated by smoking. So, i decided to keep a nail clipper on me at all times during the first day of school. And yesterday (Sept 21.) i finally got to say to my classmate this: "Do you need this? It's better then your teeth." and put the nailclipper in front of them. To say that they were embarassed, is an understatement.
