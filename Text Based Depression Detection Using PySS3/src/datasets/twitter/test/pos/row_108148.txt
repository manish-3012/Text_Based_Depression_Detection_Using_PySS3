Hey ppl who tell each other who the impostor is in Among Us, I know it's a video game but don't. Just don't do it. It ruins the fun for everyone. Recently I had an experience with three players named lexa, smd, and Skip4now who did cheat. They told each other who the impostor was and just ruined the game. The other impostor dude brown (forgot their player name) was called a pussy by the three (even tho they were cheating ironic). Probably should've stopped but I just got pissed and kinda told them off for that. They all just ganged up on me the next round and got me voted off by telling the others I vented (which i didn't). Since the original lobby maker left and I gained control of the lobby and I just kicked and banned the ppl that kept causing trouble. I believe Skip4now told me to "harden up" because "I was acting as a fortnite kid". Bro, you are cheating the game, what do u expect my reaction to be, not pissed off? I'm still kinda pissed but I've gotten over it. I'm just using this reddit post to rant about this crap. 

Seriously, don't ruin other people's fun, especially by cheating. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.
