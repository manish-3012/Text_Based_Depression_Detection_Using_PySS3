The general populace seems to be blissfully unaware of this problem I should state first and foremost that I am in no ways someone who has a degree in anything so I have no credentials at all but I still spend a lot of my time getting to know and being involved with youth in my community. I will ask this question straight up with no beating around the bush. Is the drug addiction and alcoholism among minors as bad everywhere as it is in my city? I'm working with one of my city councilmen who work directly with the mayor to try and see what we can do to curb this issue as I'm a single man with a dream of helping others but honestly there is only so much I can do and to be honest? Helping has caused more harm on my end than good, e.g. death threats.  


How do I address this problem? How do I make the adults in your lives more aware of the problems going on in your lives since they all seem so blissfully ignorant to the horrible truth that they all seem to want to sweep under the rug?
