I donâ€™t understand So Iâ€™m in language arts and weâ€™re reading the catcher in the rye right now and we get an exit ticket asking what type of modern day slang the narrator would use if the book was written now. All I do is play on hypixel so I donâ€™t know what slang is used now. I donâ€™t understand anything the only things I understood were things ironically used on subs like okbr and comedy necrophilia such as sus and drip. Am I just that anti social or do you guys find modern day slang weird too?
