Why the â€œHey Girl, Are you?â€ format wonâ€™t work for actual girls Iâ€™ve been seeing a lot of â€œHey girl, are you blank? Because blankâ€ shit, and if these are your actual pickup lines, theyâ€™re god awful. 

To keep it short and brief, the format is bland and doesnâ€™t add any smoothness or anything. Youâ€™re just boring us, try some originality and some creativity.
