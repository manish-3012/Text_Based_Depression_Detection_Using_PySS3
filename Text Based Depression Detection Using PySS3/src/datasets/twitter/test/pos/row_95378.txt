What's your opinion on preteens and children learning about politics? I've been talking to randos in R6S group posts and I've been noticing that people who say they're even younger than me have extremist right or left wing views, for example twelve and thirteen year olds saying how they have libertarian views or communist views (not Stalinist views). Now I'm not going to disclose my political views as to stay biased but both of the views have extreme problems that come with them and these twelve year olds are telling me that I'm wrong for wanting a government when most of their education is on guns and how anyone who wants stricter gun laws is a terrorist. But I also despise it went some posh ass tells me how all our problems will be solved with communism because then no one will be rich even thought they've lived an upper class life up until they rebelled from their parents for not giving them free wifi. Basically the point is I'm really against people learning politics until they're old enough to make their own decisions as to keep them from just gaining their parents views, now I just want to know what other people think?
