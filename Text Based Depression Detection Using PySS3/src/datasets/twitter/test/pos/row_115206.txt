guys Iâ€™m not even able to come up with a cohesive thought rn like my head hurts and Iâ€™m so incredibly tired actually this is me all the time but I just wanna sit down and say things that Iâ€™m thinking and know thatâ€™s actually what I wanted to say u know

Like most of the time I say shit I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m saying what I mean or Iâ€™m just talking for the sake of talking
