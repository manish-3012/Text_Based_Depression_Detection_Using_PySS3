Two paths. What do you think would make me happier?

  Study programming: I feel that I would be very good at this, I could do useful things and work in companies or start a business.  I would not go to university, I would learn on my own, which does not bother me, it attracts me.

 Study medicine to specialize in psychiatry: The day-to-day life of the psychiatrist working with psychologists makes me very interesting, I would love to work on that.  Drug addictions also attract a lot of attention to me.  The problem is that it is very long, 6 years of medicine and 4 of psychiatry studying.
