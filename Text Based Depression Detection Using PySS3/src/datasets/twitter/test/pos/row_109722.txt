A year of things Iâ€™m grateful for until I move out from my parents house #1-3/365 #1 - My pillow. I know most people might not get this but I have the most perfect pillow. All other pillows just arenâ€™t as comfy. 

#2 - My stepdad. Heâ€™s been around since I was 5 and heâ€™s actually a really solid guy. 

#3 - My sense of humour. Bit selfish, but I think life is a little bit more enjoyable because I kind find the funny side of almost anything. 

Tune in tomorrow for #4.
