I swear, Feburary is the perfect month to spend with my boyfriend. Feburary 7th - Our Anniversary

February 14th - Valentines Day

February 21st - His Birthday

I can't wait til February! I really hope that me and my first boyfriend make it through a year!

Edit: Just found out all of those days are a Sunday which means no school! The whole day we can be together!
