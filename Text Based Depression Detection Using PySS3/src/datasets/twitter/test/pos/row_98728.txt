Hey high schoolers, quick question. How much free time do you have? I just started high school virtually and I have pretty much no free time. It sucks and Iâ€™m barely keeping myself together. Just writing this Iâ€™m putting off two assignments and I donâ€™t even have any classes today. Is this what my life will be like now?
