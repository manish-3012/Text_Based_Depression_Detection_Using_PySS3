Racism isn't one about the colour You can be discriminated by your birthplace as well.
Like in my current school I just get bullied because I'm a foreign student will can't properly speak in a British accent. Yes I can speak English pretty fluently but just because I'm a born Indian they just bully the shit out of me. They're are many students with Indian origin but born here and they just say 'We aren't racist, we are basically the same colour.'

Now there could be an another term for this but I really don't know. Feel free to tell me if any term like this exists.
