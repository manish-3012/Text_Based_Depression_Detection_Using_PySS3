Why is my bio teacher so bad for test Like i like her but when it comes to test hell no. We have 50 questions to do for just 1 class period (around 50 minutes) like it's so dumb, like sure for algebra it would be easier to do but for bio you actually have to think and 1 minute per question just isn't enough
