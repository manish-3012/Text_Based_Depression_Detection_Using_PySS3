Respect peopleâ€™s political opinions I stg some of you guys think youâ€™re so edgy when you insult people for being leftist or a â€˜libtardâ€™ or just any political opinion that doesnâ€™t sit well with your narrow view of the world.

People have different opinions, and insulting them for it just makes you look like a dumbass. By all means, have a debate with somebody about their opinions, but if you start insulting them because of their beliefs then youâ€™ve automatically lost the argument.

I know this is a subreddit for teens, but would it kill you guys to show a little bit of maturity? Probably. I know majority of the comments are just going to be calling me a libtard or something lol
