Can you please help me by filling out my survey? Hi! My name is Daniela, and I'm a doctoral student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Iâ€™m working on a research study about teens and social media use, and this will be used for my dissertation (which allows me to graduate and get my Ph.D.). If youâ€™re willing to help and fill out the survey, I'd really appreciate it! 

The survey is online, fully anonymous, and should take roughly 10 minutes to complete. There's a consent form at the beginning of it, and it has been approved by my university's institutional review board.
