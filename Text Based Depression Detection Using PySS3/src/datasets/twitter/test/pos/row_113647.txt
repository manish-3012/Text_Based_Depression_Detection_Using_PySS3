My little sad gay story be me

met someone

become friends with that person

become best friends

hit puberty

develop feelings for him

tries to hide it

Fuck!, im really bad at hiding feelings

Fuck!, he is growing apart from me

Quick! drop some hints

He acknowledges and reciprocates :)

He starts manipulating me :)

Fuck ,he is manipulating me

time passes by as i grew more hurt

I decided it would better if i cut contact with him

regret my decision every day and cry myself to sleep

cry

cry some more

starts feeling numb and empty

realizes itâ€™s all my fault to ghost him and he is equally hurt too

too awkward and full of emotions to say anything to him

decides itâ€™s better to ignore those feelings

became cynical and cold but feels guilt deep inside

exists like a empty ghost crying for help in silence the rest of time

-might post season 2 later-
