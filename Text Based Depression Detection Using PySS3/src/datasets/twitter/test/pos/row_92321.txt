guess what happened yesterday so yesterday I had to work the whole day. I was supposed to hang out with my boyfriend after my normal hours. so i wasnâ€™t gonna go over bc it was late but he insisted I came over. I was beyond tired so I walked in and he was sitting on the couch so I just sat down layed on his chest and fell right asleep. we said hi before that and that was it. then I woke up early and he was up and it made me really happy that he just didnâ€™t move and let me sleep. I kinda felt bad that I made him just sit there so debating whether I should apologize or not. yeah thatâ€™s the story lemme know if you think I should apologize or not lol
