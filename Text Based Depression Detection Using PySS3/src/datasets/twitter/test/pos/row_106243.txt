My friend collapsed and it told me a lot about people My friend collapsed today and it taught me a lot about people

#Long post ahead

Anyway, me and my friends were supposed to go to another school but the minibus was full so we were waiting for another one to come

A couple minutes of waiting and we see our friend with his head in a bush and slumped over

Bit weird but we laughed and presumed he was having a piss in the bush

20 seconds later he falls over and kind of froze on the floor

We walked over still a bit suspicious asking if he was ok. He didnâ€™t respond and then he started to make the noise right before you throw up 

I put him in the recovery position although he kept leaning back so it was difficult 

I put him in the recovery position because if he threw up or started choking on his tongue, heâ€™s be a lot better on his side

My 2 friends were going to reception but were slow AF so I sprinted past them

People at reception came with me at a snails pace and then a couple minutes later an ambulance arrived

The thing this taught me is that there were about 10 people around us but none helped, they all just stood there

I sprung into action (donâ€™t worry I kept calm) and helped him but almost everybody there didnâ€™t 

I mean Iâ€™m psychology Iâ€™m learning about the bystander effect and itâ€™s really interesting, I guess it relays here
