I just needa get this off my chest... (Warning: this contains politics) If you look back in my profile youâ€™ll see a picture of me.

Iâ€™m wearing Biden merchandise in the picture. Now I realize I donâ€™t like Biden all that much, I just thoroughly dislike Trump.

Just let it be known that I still support the democratic party more than the republican party.

Donâ€™t get mad at me. Just had to get that out. Thank you!
