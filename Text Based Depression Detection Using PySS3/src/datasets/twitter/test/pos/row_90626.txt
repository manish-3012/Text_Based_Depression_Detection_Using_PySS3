I fucking hate my dysphoria Every time I walk down the hallway I feel like others eyes are shredding my body to pieces. Every limb feels like it's burning.  Every "she", "her", "miss" feels like a slap across the face. It's so painful knowing that in a few days I'll feel like a girl again, but I just have to deal with these fucking emotions for today. I hate everything, and I honestly just don't want to be talked to. I don't want to be looked at. I literally want to cry rn.
