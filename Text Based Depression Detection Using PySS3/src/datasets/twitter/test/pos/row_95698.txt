What do i do? I don't know what I'm going to do for a career, i need to do so many things before I turn 20, so I'm freaking the fuck out. I'm so fucked. Grade 11 and and I dont know what in the flying fuck to do with my life. I just want to be successful doing something. And I have the highest expectations from my parents even though I'm the youngest. At least my pool league is starting up again this Saturday. But still. I'm going to die.
