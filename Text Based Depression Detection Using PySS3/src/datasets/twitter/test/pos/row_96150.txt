AAAAAAAA IM SO MAD RIGHT NOW So basically I have these two teeth 
that hurts like a bitch, sometimes the hurting  emerges and sometimes it doesnâ€™t. Even dentists confirmed it wasnâ€™t no cavity or nothing serious, I was busy eating hot Cheetos and then the hurting on one tooth started. I went to the other side and it hurted too so I canâ€™t eat my chips now ðŸ¤¬
