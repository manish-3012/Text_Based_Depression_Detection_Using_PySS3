Why is talking to the other gender so damn HARD?! Why? Just plain why? I have done it before, millions of times. I can still do it but why is it so hard?

Whenever I approach a girl, I think I am talking properly but my friends say that I am blabbering and saying shit that doesn't make sense and sometimes flirting.

I don't mean to, seriously, I don't mean to, but this has made me subconscious about it and now I have to think twice before speaking to girls.

So what else is new?
