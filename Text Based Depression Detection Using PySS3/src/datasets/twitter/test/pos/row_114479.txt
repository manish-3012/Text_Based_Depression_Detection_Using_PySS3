Im gonna rant a little I dont know if im depressed or faking it for attention even if i keep my mouth shut about it to everyone

Anyways i was planning on taking too many pills next monday so to say and yesterday would be a test day where i would do everything except taking the pills to make sure i dont fuck up since i only have one shot to get this right

They changed the coronaregulations yesterday so now its a lot more difficult and risky to pull off
Really fucking fittng

I really dont know what to do now

I fucking hate it
