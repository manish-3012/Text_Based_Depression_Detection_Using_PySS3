My mom tried to wake me up in my room... while I was in the kitchen eating cereal In her defense, the hallway in my house is kinda small, and I was in the seat furthest away from it, itâ€™s the only one that isnâ€™t broken or taken up by my moms cup making stuff. So, she got out of the shower, and decided to wake my siblings and I up for church in an hour or so.  Our puppy was following her, so she decided that it would be funny to use her to wake us up by me realizing the puppy is in my room (I have an elevated bed), and my siblings, out puppy just licking them (they gave the same beds, they donâ€™t use them). So I hear my mom going roughly, â€œget â€˜im Louise (our puppy)! [OP], get up! Church is in an hour.â€ She goes to wake up the other two, and I peer into the hallway. She sees me and goes â€œoh, I knew you were awake.â€ Not the trying to make them not seem stupid way, in the â€œoh, I knew it was weird for you to not be up by now,â€ way.
