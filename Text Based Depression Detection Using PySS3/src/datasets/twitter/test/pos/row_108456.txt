How can I deal with going back to school? On tuesday, I can finally go back to school again. I can't wait since my grades have been really bad due to homeschooling, but I'm still dealing with the typical back to school anxiety. Any advice how to honestly deal with that? Monday will be a pain because of constant stomachache and bad feelings because of going back to school
