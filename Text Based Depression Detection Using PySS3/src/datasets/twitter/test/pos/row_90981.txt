What do I put here Iâ€™ve been having some.. questionable thoughts. Mostly to do with some form of drug use or alcohol use. Now, I understand the alcohol use because I am currently fighting alcohol. But the drug abuse is a different thing. I have done a lot of research on drugs and the brain, the effects on the adolescent brain, first hand experience on how it tears people apart etc. But my mind still wanders there. I donâ€™t really understand why. I feel happy. I like my day to day life, a blessing I am definitely taking for granted. But it just feels like itâ€™s nothing serious. Just having a good time with a friend or two. I no longer want to use it as a coping mechanism, just for recreation. For the record I mean non addictive drugs. Like weed or lsd. I hope I am never stupid enough to use addictive substances like coke. 

Also, 23 days sober. But I donâ€™t feel like alcohol is that big of a deal as long as itâ€™s only occasional. And not getting black out drunk (which I have never done). Just something to make everything a bit sweeter.

Anyway, am I in the right about these things? And for the drugs part, I probably couldnâ€™t even get any if I tried, so nothing to worry there.

Thanks for reading
