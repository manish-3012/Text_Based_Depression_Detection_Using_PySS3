Hey guys, I need someone to talk to I've been having these really weird disconnects for the past week or two

It's like I feel disconnected from reality, and I loose my train of thought and I feel like nothing is really real

It makes my heart rate go up and fills me with adrenaline

Anyways its been happening a lot for like the last few hours and I just want someone to talk to so I'm distracted and don't start disconnecting.
