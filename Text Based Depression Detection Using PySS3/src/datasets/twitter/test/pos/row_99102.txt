How can i help my friend? Life has just been shit towards him. His parents didnâ€™t want him and they donâ€™t try hide it. He is very depressed and keeps on telling me he doesnâ€™t know what to do. He has dyslexia. I love my life and I just feel guilty that he hasnâ€™t had the same opportunities as me. He does pretty well socially but sometimes he can be a bit transgressive. He picked up his moms phone one time and found a message to his dad saying â€œletâ€™s just get this over with and get divorcedâ€. Even though his life is a little shit he somehow managed to get the best possible scenario but he deserves better. Iâ€™m afraid that heâ€™ll just give up. 

TL;DR 
My friend is very depressed and needs help but has no where to get it. How can I help him?
