I got drunk yesterday for the first time and guys... the drunkenness sucks Since there are a lot of people there who never got drunk, I feel like I have to tell you it's not cool. Sure, it's funny and everything, but the drunkenness guys...
I don't even know what the fuck im posting rn, I just feel so bad.
