Idk why I keep doing this I keep wanting to get a gf but I know it always ends the same way. I know who I am and what I do and how it always plays out but I still keep trying and failing. Now that I think about it my life is a collection of knowing I should stop doing something but still doing it anyway. Idk I'm just some kid complaining about things being too hard move along.
