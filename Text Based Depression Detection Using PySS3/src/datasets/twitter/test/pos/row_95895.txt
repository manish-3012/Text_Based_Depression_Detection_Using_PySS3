Are your parents like this? My mom is behind me to get good marks even though I come second in class and for this reason she has restricted all my electronics for 20 days cuz my exams are from 12 March to 20 March so I canâ€™t play any games or scroll Reddit or watch the until my exams end this is the last hour that I will be using my electronics (donâ€™t mind my English it is my second language)
