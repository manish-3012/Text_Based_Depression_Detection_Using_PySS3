The trauma Iâ€™m gonna add to my list is my ex breaking up with me for 2+ times before breaking up with me finally Iâ€™m going have nightmares about this, I wonâ€™t stop thinking about how this happened. I feel guilty of myself.

not a good person. Thinking things will be fine when people say itâ€™ll be fine. leave me alone like what they did to me during school. not let me be friends with anyone because Iâ€™m different. a mentally ill disturbed freak the students call me again. 

I am alone. 

made her break up with me because of myself. I thought weâ€™d marry each other when I asked her to marry each other. one of the only people that weâ€™d talk to each other every day. 

Just wanted to vent.
