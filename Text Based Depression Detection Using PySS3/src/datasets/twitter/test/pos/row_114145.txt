My voice kinda sounds like one of a fat person?!? a litle backstory: Im a girl with a slightly deeper voice than average and today i was on a voice call on discord and a guy that claims to look masculine af said somthing that made me feel kinda strange. The whole convo:

My cousin: You are fat

me (getting the joke): You too

My cousin: ok guys how do you think (my name) looks irl?

masculine claimer: I feel like shes fat and eats cookies everyday

Ok dont get me wrong but im 169 cm tall and i weight 55-58 kg and i have (not the best but still) abs and im a soccer player and ive already talked with masculine claimer abt my hobbies and myself. I kinda feel weird what do you think abt this whole thing? Should I feel weird or is it just me being a brat?

Edit: a typo
