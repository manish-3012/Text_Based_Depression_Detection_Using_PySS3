i severely dislike you, no not you reading this girl who is friends with my friends and is incredibly pretty and every guy she meets basically falls in love with her (happened several times) 

got with my really toxic/ borderline abusing bf last year right after we broke up and i thought i was friends with her but then she lied to me about it to my face and persuaded all my other friends not to tell me about it and it went on for several months. 

and thereâ€™s this song thats really meaningful to me and everyone knows i love it because it described how i felt then because it was like no one had my back and i wasnâ€™t good enough yeno teenage things

she has recently sang this specific song on her insta and absolutely murdered it like itâ€™s terrible and now all my friends are telling me how great she is at singing and how that song must be so meaning full to her when sheâ€™s the person who made me feel like shit and introduce her to it in the first place 

no sheâ€™s just pretty it wasnâ€™t even in key shut up shut up shut up
