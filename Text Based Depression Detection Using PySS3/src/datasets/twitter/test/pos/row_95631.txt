For when you see this. I saw it. And I wanted to reply, but you know I can't. Just know the things, OK? and remember to be patient. Life is hard. But it will change. People are horrible, but they will change, or you let them go. I waited 24 hours, and now we wait 24 more. Such is life and the complex we occupy. I care about you so much. And I hope you have an amazing day. All my love,
