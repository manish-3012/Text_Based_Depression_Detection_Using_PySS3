My preteen brother is a pain in the ass. Hello dear redditors, please let me take you into a journey in where you will see how my brother causes constant headaches to our family.

So, let's start; my brother, 13 yrs old, is mentally taxing to deal with. Sometimes when we play games, let's say, an FPS, he starts talking and talking about what do i do wrong and how i'm stupid for doing X and Y. But he doesn't like it when I do the same thing.

And when I call him out on it, he starts to argue and when I bring up a solid point, he just ignores it/gets back in/does something to not hear me.

Next, outside of video games. It's the same, i do something, he calls me dumb or stupid, i say I don't like being told that, we start to argue.

And no, it's not me. Both my Father and Sister (don't live with mom) have talked to me about this too. He refuses to listen, change, he's apathetic, he acts like a child, oh and when they serve him something he doesn't like (or even not the "right way"!) , prepare for  hell.

It's so tiring to live with him. I feel like we've tried everything, talking, psycology, therapy... I don't know at this point. Is there something we can do to make him realize what he's doing? That we can stop how he's acting? Any help would be appreciated.
