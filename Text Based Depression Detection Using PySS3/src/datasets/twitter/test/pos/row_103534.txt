Trying to decide if going to boarding school was a mistake or not Academically Iâ€™m not doing as well as I think I could but thatâ€™s also because weâ€™re still having online classes. But socially Iâ€™m really not having a great time, I mean Iâ€™ve got people I know but rn Iâ€™m spending like 99% of my time alone and when Iâ€™m not I canâ€™t shake the feeling that I donâ€™t belong or Iâ€™m just bothering the people Iâ€™m with. Iâ€™ve only been on campus for two weeks so I know things are gonna take time but Iâ€™m just not having fun rn. Itâ€™s looking like Iâ€™m gonna be on campus for the whole of December break and Idk how Iâ€™m gonna cope cause that means no classes or homework to fill up my time and Iâ€™m fine being on my own, like I was litteraly in self quarantine and I was fine but being with people but still being on my own is somehow way worse. And Iâ€™m realising Iâ€™m probably gonna have to stay at this school for at least two years since next year is year 11 and not many school take students on exam years and right now I really donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m gonna be able to make it that long
