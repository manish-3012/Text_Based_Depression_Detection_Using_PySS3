Rants hehe This is a little bit of a rant but hereâ€™s some context: Iâ€™m a 16 year old girl and I work as a waitress/cashier at a pizza place. I want to send a message. I absolutely hate my job because of the people I have to constantly deal with.

I understand how you might be agitated or annoyed when I mess up your order but guess what, Iâ€™m a human, it happens. What some people donâ€™t realize is that when you get mad at me, I over think it that night, I feel awful and it ruins my day. Of course itâ€™s your right to be mad. It would make sense if you were hungry and you canâ€™t eat now because I screwed up. 

What I just want to point out is that if everyone was just a little bit nicer and maybe just put themselves in others shoes, life would be SO much easier. I always thought of myself as a people person until this job. Now Iâ€™m not so sure. People can be so cruel and it really just makes you want to curl up in a dark hole and cry. 

I know I might get hate like â€œyour the one who screwed up, they should be mad at youâ€. True but think about it. Your one order from a low class pizza place will not effect you in 5 years. However, I will remember that experience of hatred for a longgg time. It could legit change what career I go into, no matter how much I love working with people, maybe Iâ€™m just too scared to work in a people filled environment because Iâ€™m scared of people who will break me apart. So anyway, thanks for reading, hope u have a good day.
