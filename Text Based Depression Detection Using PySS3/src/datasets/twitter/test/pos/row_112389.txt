I need help Hey everyone,
so I have a girlfriend. She's my first relationship, &amp; we've been together for a little over a year. But my depression &amp; anxiety keep making me feel like she's not attracted to me &amp; that I don't desrve her. Do any of y'all have advice to help with my situation? Thank you.
