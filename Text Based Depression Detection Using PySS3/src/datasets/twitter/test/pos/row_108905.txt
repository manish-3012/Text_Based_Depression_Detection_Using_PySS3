Why just why Maybe a bit of a political question : 

Why is â€œpro lifeâ€ a thing? Its so stupid. Abortion solves so many problems, overpopulation, unwanted children, parents that cant financially support them...

Pro life is like â€œA bAbY iS sTiLl AlIvEâ€ I mean shut up I bet you dont think twice when you swat a mosquito.

Pro life people seem to have some sort of high and mighty â€œmoral standardâ€ without spending a single brain cell to think about it.
