I found an earlier version and itâ€™s even worse So I posted here a couple weeks ago with a quote from one of my dnd characters profiles, well I found an even earlier Iâ€™d mostly forgot about. This version of itâ€™s from late 2018 - early 2019 and should be the earliest manuscript.

&gt; It was a miracle the governments even approved of itâ€™s release on September 2, 2020 given the already horrid state of the world (a disease was going around and thereâ€™d been bad rioting and general civil unrest, on top of this shit like murder insects and places being burned then flooded). Though if they thought they were already in the apocalypse, it wouldnâ€™t start for another 25 days.

I was allowed to come up with how Earth got into itâ€™s current state (a continents worth of floating islands above a destroyed US), who the gods were and who the traitor was.

My guy would be the only human survivor who was found frozen in ice and he was the catalyst for the apocalypse. He technically made magic and it all spiraled downhill.
