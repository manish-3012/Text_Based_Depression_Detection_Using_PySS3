I can't tell if my friend was being serious or just trying to fuck with me. Okay. So, my friend Greg was waiting for me to get out of class at the end off school yesterday. (Schools are still open in Scotland). This was about the time he told me some very interesting news.

Apparently he overheard girls in his class discussing boys, I was mentioned in the girls discussion. Not one, but all three agreed that I'm cute and one of them admitted that they had a crush on me. So naturally I'm ecstatic to hear this.

But I have a sneaking suspicion that he's trying to fuck with me and trying to get my hopes up. He doesn't want to say names and another friend called Duncan who was in that class cannot verify if what that they said that. (They were doing group tasks and Duncan and Greg were in different groups, hence why Duncan can't verify). Anyone had anything similar happen to them?
