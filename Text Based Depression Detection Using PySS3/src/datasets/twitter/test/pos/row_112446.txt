first christmas gifts exchange night with my boyfriend weâ€™re gonna be doing it at my house, and since i wasnâ€™t born here, iâ€™ve never celebrated christmas the way ppl do here in canada, iâ€™m from europe and we celebrate our christmas completely different so how can i make our night special? weâ€™re doing it tmrw because we canâ€™t see each other for a bit after, so yeah. iâ€™m thinking of baking cookies and stuff. and well watch a christmas movie but like what else?
