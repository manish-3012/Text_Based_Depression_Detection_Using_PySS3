I wanna be heartbroken All my relationships failed but in the end i either moved on quickly or developed an intense hatred for them so like iâ€™ve never cried over an entire gallon of ice cream which means iâ€™ve never been in love i guess, even though i thought i was at some point. kinda wanna know what thatâ€™s like but kinda think relationships are gross at the same time

I think youâ€™re supposed to love yourself or sumn first, sounds gross. guess i can break my own heart ðŸ’”
