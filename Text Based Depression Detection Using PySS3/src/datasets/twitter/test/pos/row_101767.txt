GUYS I REALISED SOMETHING I just realised that the games we see on ads that we all think is trash will be the same games that people born in the 2020s will grow up with.In stead of playing cut the rope and subway surfers, theyâ€™re gonna play a trash mobile game.I feel so sad now.I canâ€™t IMAGINE how hard it to be to grow up with only those games.I will pay my respects to the people born in 2020s
