Clothes can be offensive apparently So a year ago I had a mean teacher. Just the worst. She arrived late, made gagging noises when she entered our classroom (yes, she literally indicated we smell), lost her focus easily, wore clothes that only look good on 20 year olds even though she is 60 (seriously, I don't want to see you in tight pants and t shirts, you're an old woman, have some respect!), started discussions that lasted at least half an hour, and then wondered why the time went by so fast. Also, she was annoyed by everything. And I mean everything. You couldn't even bring a pen with you without her getting mad. Example:
Student:'accidentally brings pen to board without realising'
Teacher: What are you doing with that?
Student: Oh, I forgot to leave it on my desk. I'll go put it back.
Teacher: No, no, answer my question.... What were you doing with that?..
And at this point, you're dead. But here is the worst I have seen of her. It was Winter so.... It was cold. She arrived late as always and saw one of my classmates wearing an orange hoodie. "Take off that shirt, it's hurting my eyes.". He was cold so he asked if he could keep it on. "Take it off, I said... ". He refused. So he got a quiz and answered all the questions perfectly, but teach over here didn't give him an A. I'm pretty sure if he caught him not knowing she would have blasted him with an F.
 So, nobody liked her. And I mean no one. None of the classes she taught. Even the ones who were good at her subject hated her. She put Andrew in a contest and gave him so much homework, he slept 1 hour a day. He was absent for an entire week after he participated in the contest! And even then he seemed tired all the time! Just so she could brag about teaching an elitist, even though he knew all of those things long before she became our teacher.
She told us a story one time. She met one of her old students on the street, greeted him and he replied with: "Fuck off, you old hag!". She said she wondered why he said that, and we all tried to hold our laughter in.
So, in conclusion, some teachers suck.
