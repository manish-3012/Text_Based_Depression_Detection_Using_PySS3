Just broke up with my gf and I regret it I(17M) just broke up with my gf(17) of six months a couple days ago and I kind of regret it. When we were dating it was great but there were always these little things that she did, or I guess didnâ€™t do that hurt me throughout our relationship. Like I would always be the one to say good morning and I would always tell her I loved her and that I appreciated her so much but she would never tell me those first. I would have to be the one to initiate those things. I just wanted some random affirmation sometimes, ya know? And whenever I would tell her those things and how I was hurting from the lack of effort she would just fall silent and not say anything at all. Anyways she recently got a job at a restaurant where she works with this guy. Now right away he started being weird with her. He would talk about how heâ€™s a virgin and how he smokes weed all the time and crap like that. Later on one of my gfs coworkers asked him if he likes my gf and he said he thought she was cute. A couple days later I noticed that they had added each other on Snapchat and have been talking a lot. I told her that I thought it was a little disrespectful that she had added someone who she knows likes her and is talking to him and she got super defensive and started to argue. Because of this argument and all the things I mentioned before I just kinda lost it and broke up with her. She was heartbroken about it. Iâ€™m just not really sure what to do. I miss her a lot and I feel like I made a huge mistake by just jumping the gun and breaking up with her. Sorry this was so long but I had to get it all out there.
