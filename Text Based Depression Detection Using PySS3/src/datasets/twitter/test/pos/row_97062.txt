Anybody else barely even alive anymore ðŸ˜Ž I literally just lay in bed all day because I have no motivation or willpower to get up because I know thereâ€™s nothing there for me. College went online and now Iâ€™m stuck at home with my mom and she wonâ€™t let me move out which means fighting and no seeing friends for the next like three months which are about to suck ass. I really donâ€™t have anything to look forward to or going on in my life I kinda just keep falling down and collapsing into myself and getting smaller and smaller. I can feel my brain going back to the dark place I used to be in but my body just keeps walking around like a zombie. I donâ€™t feel alive or like a human being I just want everything to end and make the pain go away 


I donâ€™t even feel like a teenager. I never did. I never had those experiences and itâ€™s too late now. I donâ€™t feel anything and I just want to FEEL I want to feel alive I want to laugh and have fun and do what I want I just donâ€™t want to be afraid all the time anymore please just let me feel something
