I really want to cry but I canâ€™t I never been the emotional type. Not even kidding in the last 2 years I probably only cried 3 times. Once from a mixture of stress and sadness, and the rest all anger. I really want to cry, but I canâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to get back into bad coping habits, but I have no one I trust. I feel like crying will make me feel better, but I just canâ€™t cry. 

I donâ€™t know why I am typing this to be honest. I kinda just want to share this with some people I have no connection with I guess.
