WHAT DO I FUXKING DO AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA IS IT FINALLY THE TIME I GET A GF OR DO I MAKE A FOOL OUT OF MYSELF IN A PACKED TRAM WHAT DO I DO

edit: we got off on the same stop, looked at me once again quite nicely (I mean she didn't mean any negative) and our ways parted. fml ill never get a gf with such social anxiety, that I have to ask strangers on Reddit if I should start up a conv and never do it in the end
