Should we just leave? This is the absolute worst sub I'm subbed to rn. Idk why I'm still here, maybe we should all just leave this sub? This can't be good for us guys, maybe we'll make better life decisions without having to read a dumb one-liner every 45 seconds. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.
