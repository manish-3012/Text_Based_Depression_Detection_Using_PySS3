Is this a normal thing to do? Backstory: my family went their separate ways 10+ years ago. I reside with my father but visit my mother monthly.

I've realized after a few months of getting this uneasy feeling everytime I do something with my mom that this may not be a normal thing my father does.
My father does seem to care about what I do while I'm with him. It's usually a yes or no answer to everything. Until I'm with my mother. My mother is a respectable women, has a job, husband and a house. She's got her life together. When ever I'm with her, my dad adds rules to what I can and can't do. I have to ask him before I do anything. I want to hangout with my aunt since she moved closer to my mom and it's a perfect idea. My mother tells me yes since I'm with her but when my dad finds out, he calls me ungrateful and a disrespectful brat. Since I didn't ask him first. Then he won't talk to me for most of the time I'm away, and when we do, he pretends like nothing ever happened. Which happens a lot with him, when he says hurtful things to me. He makes it seem like I'm making stuff up for attention. I feel like this is a normal thing to do but it's normal in my family.
