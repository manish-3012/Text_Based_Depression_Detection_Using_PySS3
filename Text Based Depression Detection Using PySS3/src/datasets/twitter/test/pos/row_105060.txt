I fucking hate geography If i had to choose 1 subject to delete it would be geography,why do we even need it.FUCKING GPS EXIST WHY DO I HAVE TO LOOK AT A FUCKING MAP FIND SOME FUCKING MOUNTAINS REGIONS AND SHIT AND KNOW A STUPID AMOUNT OF USELESS FACTS ABOUT SOME REGION.ITS A STUPID SUBJECT AND EVEN MUSIC CLASS IS MORE USEFULL.Tbh i dont want to see that subject in my life but you know schools suck,and we said that for decades but it hasnt changed a bit.I hope future generations dont have geography its usefull as much as being able to twerk and more boring than watching paint dry.
