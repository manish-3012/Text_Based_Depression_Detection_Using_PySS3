Does anybody feel the same way Hi to everyone reading this. Well actually gay teens reading this, since that's going to be somewhat of the topic here. And minorities.
I've been active on this sub but in not all familiar with it yet. But enough of that, I'd like to talk about something here amongst other people my age. You all know the stuff that's going on right? Well sometimes I like to look on twitter about, well.....
Gay stuff lol. But I also look at the problems in the LGBT community. Well look, I don't know how to say this exactly so I'll just come right out with it. So to all the minorities of the LGBT community reading this, do you guys feel that straight minorities only band together with us when it suits them? I've been getting that vibe lately, with all the stuff thats going on right now. And actually years before this. I feel like straight minorities will say they support the LGBT community, but.......never actually support it if that makes any sense. Like I rarely ever hear stories of straight minorities going to pride parades. Nor will I see them  really sticking up for us. With that, I actually mean I don't see them bringing light to gay/trans deaths. Which have been happening alot lately, and sadly. But people don't want to speak on it because.... it's about gay people. This can actually go towards white gay/trans people to. Do you guys get this same vibe as well? I just felt like I had to make a post about this here and see if there are other people sharing the same feelings as me, because this has really been eating me up and making me a little angry.
