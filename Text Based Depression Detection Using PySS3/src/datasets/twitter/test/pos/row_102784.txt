Iâ€™m feeling :) It feels good to be happy. Iâ€™m diagnosed w depression and it SUCKS, but yeah I have passed through a rly depressing past couple of weeks and Iâ€™m feeling good again!! It gets hard dudes, it rly does. I even thought of going back to suicidal thoughts. It was not a good mindset at all. But now Iâ€™m feeling good, my mood is up! Iâ€™m going to work hard in school (itâ€™s my second week back). Iâ€™m feeling really good at the gym. Everything is looking good. Hopefully this feeling lasts my boys:)
