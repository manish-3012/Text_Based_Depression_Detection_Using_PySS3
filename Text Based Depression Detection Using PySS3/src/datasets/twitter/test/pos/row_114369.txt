My mother found my vibe and is screaming at me for not talking about it I can't deal with this anymore. I bought an adult toy recently because my libido is quite high for a teenager and because I'm really stressed because of my mother. She gets angry at the stupidest things possible at me and dad. Today she was acting kinda mean and I didn't understand why. When I was at the mall, she changed my sheets even though she knows how much I hate when she enters my room without permission for anything  (I'm scared of her finding things that she wouldn't like and screaming at me), and found my vibrator. She called me and told me about it in a nit picking way, and kept asking me weird stuff about it. I told her that I'm super uncomfortable and stressed talking about this, and she said that we'll talk home. I told her I don't wanna talk at all about this with her, and she got super pissed, saying that "I'm your mother and I deserve to know because I do so many things for you ", and "you're obligated to tell me about this". I burst out in tears at the mall telling her that I don't wanna do this, and she kept asking "why are you crying now? I didn't even shout at you". I ended the call, and she later called me and started the conversation by saying  "did you finish already"? (Here we have a word which is super mean to say to a child) which made me burst into tears even more. I texted her saying that I did not like what she said, and she said sorry numerous times. 
      When I got home:
I went to my bedroom waiting in fear of dad coming in my room wanting to talk about it or my mom coming home from gym.  When mom came they both came in my room and started interrogating me about it. Now, my dad is pretty chill,  unlike my mother, but I wasn't prepared for the conversation so I told them numerous times that I don't wanna talk about it. None of them understood and kept trying to ask, so i raised my voice to leave me alone and my mother started shouting that "you're obligated to tell me" "I'm your mother " so many times and I told both of them to get out of my room. Dad kept trying to pamper me but I was annoyed at the both of them, so I kept repeating that i want them out of my room. They finally left after I started crying, with mom rolling her eyes, and I told them that I didn't wanna see any of them today, but my mother kept trying to find a reason to talk to me.

Why am I obligated  to do this? Is this normal? I don't wanna talk at all about this! I feel ashamed of myself and disgusted with her behaviour. Do I have to tell her about it? They're expecting that I'll tell them tomorrow.  Tomorrow I'm going on a trip with my cousin.  I don't wanna talk to anyone about this f2f or phone call. I know I'm overreacting,  but I cried so much today because of her. I can't deal with this bullshit anymore.
