Idk a trashy poem or something its 2 am My advice would be to not take life too seriously, for every person has an expiry date and no matter how many great things youâ€™ve done in life you canâ€™t escape the cold hands of death. Like Every story has a last line and every magic trick a prestige youâ€™ll be gone someday, so might as well have some fun while youâ€™re still breathing air.
You donâ€™t have to be the next Elon musk or be remembered through the giant ticking clock of time as long as you are kind, as long as every person you hand a smile will treasure it like it was the last of its kind, because it is.
Theres only one you and you are an oddity, not a freak or a beast youâ€™re a rare occurrence, like red Northern lights people might never see you, but theyâ€™ll know about those of your kind though theyâ€™ll never meet you.                      You are a treasure, a precious piece of a larger puzzle, a nanosecond on a cosmic calendar filled with unsteady pieces of rubble. I donâ€™t know you, i never will, but you matter, and you will win, you donâ€™t have to mean something to everyone, you just have to keep trying, be skin and bone. And prove that fun is all that really matters, its not like weâ€™re getting out alive anyways.
