To all the girls To all the girl who have feeling, please dont just wait because the guys MUST do the first move because it's what a man do. If he is lonely, having someone telling you that they have feelings for you can make the difference between a bad and a good MONTH sometime. 

I know what I'm talking about, it has been a whole year (and two days) since i'm with my girlfriend, and she asked me out, she made the first move. 

So, please, if you have maybe a boy that you think is kind, or/and cute, ask if he like you, and a worst you tried your best !


Thanks for coming to my ted talk
