Hereâ€™s the sitch So I dropped my school chromebook and the screen got all messed up. Itâ€™s cracked and thereâ€™s colors everywhere. But the computer is just fine, only issue is the screen. After some research another laptop I have that doesnâ€™t work well and I donâ€™t need has a compatible screen. With just a few tools I could swap the screens and have the chromebook good as new. I tried looking up my schoolâ€™s policy on broken tech and I searched their whole site but found nothing. What should I do here? I could fix the screen but Iâ€™m worried if they somehow found out when I give it back that the screen is different I could possibly get in trouble for tampering. Could they even figure out itâ€™s a different screen? Assuming all goes well and looks good, I doubt theyâ€™d be opening up every chromebook they get back at the end of the year. And if they did somehow find out, I could just say â€œHuh, weird. I donâ€™t know how that got like that.â€ since they donâ€™t really have a way of pinning it on me without proof. Thoughts?
