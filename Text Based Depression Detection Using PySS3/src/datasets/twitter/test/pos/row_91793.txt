why would mom ever think this was a good idea? this morning my mom asked me what i wanted from mcdonalds, i tell her a sausage biscuit and she leaves. while gone (presumably at mcdonalds), she texts me and says they don't serve breakfast all day and then ask me what i want for lunch. without giving me time to respond she says nevermind and then comes home with grocery store frozen waffles. why the fuck would you not think i would want chicken nuggies over microwave waffles. to clarify we are on a family trip so we didn't know they don't serve breakfast all day like the mcdonalds we're used to but just why frozen waffles over chicken nuggies. with the presumption she was at mcdonalds to get the information that they don't serve breakfast all day, she could've easily gotten chicken nuggies but she instead wastes time, effort, and gas to go to the grocery store to get frozen waffles and not much else.
