I told my Crush that i love her. She told me she loves me too.

Could be because we are together for more than two years now. Well, who knows?


No, i do not just want to flex a bit, but i want to tell All of you: Maybe you aren't in a happy relationship right now, but if will propably change. So, just wait toll it happens.

Oh, and, also, Just talk to the girl you like, the worst Thing to Happen is that she run's away. But when you talk to her the second time, maybe it will go better, like with me an my sweet angle.

So, well, love you all fellas.
