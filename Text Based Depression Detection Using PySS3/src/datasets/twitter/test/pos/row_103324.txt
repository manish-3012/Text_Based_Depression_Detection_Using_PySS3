My dad is driving me into depression and maybe suicide. He yells at me all the time and is verbally abusive to me and my mother. He makes fun of me for having very few friends and bullies me. I canâ€™t even fight back or I will get in worse trouble. It is to the point where I genuinely am cutting all contact when I turn 18. I hate him and the rest of my fucking family.
