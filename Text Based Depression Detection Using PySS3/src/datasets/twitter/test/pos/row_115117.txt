My dad jus told me to â€œdo something in the real worldâ€ How am I supposed to do that! Weâ€™re in the middle of a pandemic here! This is all because I was playing with the puppy and it bit me, he then proceeded to blame me listening to music on it. I donâ€™t think my parents understand that I can do something and listen to something else.
