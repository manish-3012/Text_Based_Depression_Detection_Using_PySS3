I thought I posted some of these poems. The cost of ignorance

Always dwells in my mind

I think of it everyday

It plays back to remind

-
-
-

It wears me out

I swear it fucking wears me out

But when in doubt

I swear I'm always in fucking doubt

-
-
-

I'm out my mind because I think of things I never asked

I'm out my mind because I keep doing things, I'll never last

I'm out of breath because it all just seems to pass

My heart of glass seems to fracture with just a tap

-
-
-

My knees give out

I'm feeling light headed again

It's been 28 seconds since I last wished I was dead

But my mouth won't open, I can't even leave my bed

-
-
-

I just decay away in bed so stay away, afraid

I'll never see the day
That will take away the pain that I've sustained.
