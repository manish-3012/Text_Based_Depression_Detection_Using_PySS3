Goodbye sleep So I was browsing the fall guys subreddit (hopefully you know what that is) and I came across this post -  [Enigma Of Fall Mountain](https://www.reddit.com/r/FallGuysGame/comments/i9o7tj/enigma_of_fall_mountain/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
I read some comments because I had no idea what it was referring to and then I saw a link to the comic by Junji Ito. Yeah. Now I canâ€™t sleep. Any advice to get over the creepy feeling?
