Don't pick a circumcised penis if you're a male It locks you out of romance options and characters will mock you in the game. I can't believe this is even a thing, but it's true. It's truly bizarre CPDR would let such a seemingly minor choice (for a game) to play a role in the narrative.
Pretty low by CPDR IMO.
