u/Megathiccc Iâ€™m sorry Didnâ€™t ever mean to say.                                             Everything I said to hurt you, baby.                             Wish I could take it all away.                                       Make all the hurtful words desert you, baby.               One do overs all I needed.                                           Take it back, I swear.                                                   Iâ€™d never even repeat it!                                                I never meant to be mean to or hurt you, baby.         -Alvin and the Chipmunks.                                            (Ps): Iâ€™m still watching you
