"come join our gaming club" I have parents and teachers who expect way too much of me, I am recovering from a concussion due to going head first into the boards at a hockey game, and I have to think about how everyone I know is in a relationship but me, So why the fuck would you ever think I would have time for some stupid ass game club.
