White sheets, you and me used to lay close

Blue summer sittin' high in the window

Phone calls every night had a new glow

My clique running through my mind like a rainbow

We were so in love, so we let go

Took it in our lungs, then we all choked

Long drives, so divine when the sun showed

My clique running through my mind like a rainbow


I miss them every night

I miss them by my side

Catch my tears when I cry

My clique on me for life

Driving 'round at dawn, look at you, lip bite

Something in my chest til' the tension breaks

Want to stand still, won't forget this time

I miss them, I miss them, I miss them

White sheets, you and me used to lay close

Blue summer sittin' high in the window

Phone calls every night had a new glow

My clique running through my mind like a rainbow

We were so in love, so we let go

Took it in our lungs, then we all choked

Long drives, so divine when the sun showed

My clique running through my mind like a rainbow
