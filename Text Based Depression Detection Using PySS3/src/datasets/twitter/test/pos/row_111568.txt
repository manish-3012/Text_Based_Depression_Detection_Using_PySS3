Anyone Iâ€™m looking for help Sooo maybe Iâ€™m just an idiot or overthinking. But me and this girl were not dating but Iâ€™m kinda a side thing for her. When we were making out and grabs me and pulls herself on top of me. And says â€œIâ€™m ready when you areâ€ like what does that mean bro. Help me please Iâ€™m really confused and donâ€™t want to assume anything, also just so yâ€™all know Iâ€™m a boy.
