i'm sorry sorry everyone but i just can't take it anymore

i'm sick of feeling like shit

i'm sick of my thoughts

i'm sick of everyone i care about leaving me

there's no hope left in me

there's no point

i don't want to keep feeling pain

i don't care how my family will react

they're the ones who made me like this

they're the ones who took everything away from me

i'm fucking tired of everyone else taking away the people i care about

i know i already said this but i'm gonna do it

fuck overdosing i'm fucking stabbing myself this time
