Are all my friends manipulating me? I am the most powerful person out of my friend group but not out of being anyone good I just own the discord and minecraft server we play on. Recently I've thought a horrible thought. All my friends are manipulating me for power. Theres one person in my friend group who always gets called out for not having a life. I have even less of a life than him why are they not calling me out? Theres one person who is a bit more obvious they spent a couple weeks pretending to care about me(getting me to go asleep at a better time) to get discord admin. I know that that's just manipulation. She knows I get barely any attention and that would nearly instantly win me over. Another girl who is known for "marrying" to get power in mc servers tried to marry me(luckily I wasnt dumb or desperate enough to agree). Makes me wonder how much of my other friends playing games with me are just attempts at keeping positive relations so they can invoke my power. 
    
    
Theres only 7 people that I can actually trust. That's less than a third of my friends.
