I accidentally stepped on my cat and it almost gave me a bloody heart attack (not literally) I went to sit on the lounge, then I got up, then I stepped on the blanket which was on the floor, then I heard a screech, then I got my foot off it, then I unwrapped the blanket only to find my cat underneath it. Iâ€™ve taken the blanket off the floor since. I think sheâ€™s okay. She didnâ€™t make any noises after that one screech, but I am very concerned that I hurt her seriously. She seems to be fine now, but again, Iâ€™m really concerned that I hurt her.
