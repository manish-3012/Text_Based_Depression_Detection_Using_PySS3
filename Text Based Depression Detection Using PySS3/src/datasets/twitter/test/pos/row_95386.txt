Relationship/crush advice I like this guy and I think he likes me. He is sweet and funny. The problem is this guy is not a very good texter. I am getting mixed feelings due to this. I have no idea what to do any advice is welcome. I am also starting to think he is loosing feelings for me which would suck.
