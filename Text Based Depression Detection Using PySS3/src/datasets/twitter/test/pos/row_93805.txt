Just found out that my mother and her boyfriend, Asswipe tested positive for covid tw//drugs/abuse/general depressiveness For context, my mother and asswipe are both manipulative and abusive. 

Mother came home, with groceries, and told me she tested positive. Both her, and asswipe. I spend most of my time with my mother, because she's always sick because of a shitty immune system, and a life of torment health wise. Her kidney failing three times, the same one twice. With that, came sickness, but recently she got a new kidney and the whole mess was over. She just needed to worry about her diabetes. And then the abuse started, about three years ago now. 

Well, now I have to quarantine with them for ten days. I also can't go over to my tutors house, and end school early this year like I wanted too. (I'm a sophmore, and I wanted to end school by early july so I could take up a job offer and pay for a van, and convert it.) That also means that I have to deal with Asswipe telling me what to do, most likley his withdrawals (he's a coke addict) and then him trashing the fucking house with (ironically) Corona beer bottles.
