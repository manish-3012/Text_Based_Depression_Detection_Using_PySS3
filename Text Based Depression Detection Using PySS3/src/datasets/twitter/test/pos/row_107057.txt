She broke my heart.... A couple of days ago I found out my girlfriend(now ex-girlfriend) was cheating on me with one of my friends. We had been dating for 7 months. We where just talking and she started crying and confessed to cheating on me, I didnâ€™t find out about who with until last night. Am just feeling really depressed and lonely right now. One of my only friends in the world and the woman I love betrayed me. I donâ€™t know what to do because I still have feelings for her.
