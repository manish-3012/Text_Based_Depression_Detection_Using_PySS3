Tips to make a fleshlight in the case of not being able to buy one due to being underage I saw the dildo post, and thought I'd share some tips for us guys. (unless you intend to use a fleshlight as a female somehow.) 

Now, this is very simple, and you only need a few things. 

***Materials*** 

-Can of Pringles (whichever flavour is your favourite, mine is BBQ) 

-Latex glove or condom (alternatives work just as well if you're allergic to latex)

-A large sponge (think the kind you'd use to wash a car?) 

-rubber bands (optional) 

***Assembly*** 

First, take your can of Pringles and eat them. They're fucking delicious. After doing that, wipe out the inside of the can win pale towels 

Take a pencil, or a screwdriver, or whatever and poke a small hole near the bottom of the can (prevents suction issues) 

Next, take your sponge and cut that bitch in half. Now, take your glove or condom and place it in between the two sponge halves. If you're using a glove, make sure no fingers are sticking out on the sides, they need to be sticking out the bottom tho. 

Take the halves and squeeze em into the can. Then, simply stretch the glove or condom over the top of the sponges and onto the can. If you have rubber bands, place a few around the can to ensure it stays in place. 

Now, take some lotion, icy hot, whatever you use, and lube that bitch up. Now it's ready for use. Hopefully I don't have to explain how to use it. 

And boom! Enjoy, fellow horny teens!
