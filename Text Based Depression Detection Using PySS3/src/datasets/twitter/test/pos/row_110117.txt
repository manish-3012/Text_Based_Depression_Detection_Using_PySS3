Any older teens in the uk who did an art GCSE or know someone who did it please help I know itâ€™s only October but I have to pick my GCSEs at the end of this school year and Iâ€™ve been told I should do an art GCSE. Iâ€™m not sure if I want to though cuz I heard it takes all the fun out of art cuz you have to do a lot of writing and have to over analyse everything and itâ€™s really stressful. Anyone any insight on this. Sorry if this is stupid but Iâ€™m really curious
