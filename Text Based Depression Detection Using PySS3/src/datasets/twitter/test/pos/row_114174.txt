Alright. I Am About to Hand in an Application/Resume for a Job. 
Nothing much. Just going to hand in my resume/application form.

I donâ€™t have any fancy clothes. I have a suit, but Iâ€™m not wearing that to a grocery store. 

What do you think. Iâ€™m currently wearing really nice shoes, black jeans, and a black hoodie. 

Does it matter?
