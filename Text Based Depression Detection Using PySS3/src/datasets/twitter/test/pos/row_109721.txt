Is my first relationship ever seriously going to be long distance?? Sheâ€™s open to start a relationship, but weâ€™re sooo sooooo unsure. We kind of rushed into things too fast and weâ€™re already talking like weâ€™re a couple when weâ€™re not. Also I probably wonâ€™t be able to visit her until January so... aghh this is so stressful
