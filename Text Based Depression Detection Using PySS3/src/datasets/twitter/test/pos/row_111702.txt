Help Please 18 almost 19M here. Iâ€™ve never really had any friends in school. I developed social anxiety around high school, because of SA Iâ€™ve never even kissed a girl let alone had a girlfriend itâ€™s even given me a fear of girls my age. Iâ€™ve never hung out at the mall with friends, basically Iâ€™ve never done anything social after 8th grade. I want to know how I can stop this and be normal before itâ€™s to late. Itâ€™s so lonely being like thisðŸ˜¢ I almost canâ€™t take it anymore. I forgot to add that Iâ€™m done with high school and working as a mechanic.


Sorry for my punctuation, wording and formatting, I know itâ€™s terrible.
