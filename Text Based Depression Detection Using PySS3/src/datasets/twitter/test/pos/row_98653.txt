Is there a person or online site with people or anything that you know that can give advice on what on a school task? This may sound pretty weird but this is just me being desperate. I have a school task where a partner and I has to make a recorded infomercial as a project (a topic was given to us). I'm at a dead end since we can't think of anything to do. Is there maybe some person that I can chat with for some help? Or maybe some kind of site where I can ask for help about stuff like these. I know that it's pretty unlikely for there to be one but, again, I'm getting pretty desperate.
