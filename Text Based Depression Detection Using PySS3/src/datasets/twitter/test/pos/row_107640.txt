My mom NEVER blames the teachers So I have a biology teacher, and whenever he posts grades, he keeps them as 0 points, then changes it later. And it has been 3 WEEKS SINCE HE HAS POSTED ANOTHER GRADE. Even when my older brother, who had the same teacher, explained that, she doesn't listen. She just says "Well you got a bad grade". Like b**** I didn't know a teacher could be so f***ing lazy. That little **** gonna *****. ******* **** *****. So basically, I have like 7 zeros. Thanks for listening.
