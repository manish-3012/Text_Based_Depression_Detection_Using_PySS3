Teachers wonder why we bring energy drinks to school. And when you say you're tired their like 'you should have gone to bed earlier'. Bitch, the reason I didn't go to bed earlier because I had one day to complete the history homework I was given the day before, I have to revise for a Welsh mock exam, I have Biology, Chemistry and maths homework to be in on the same day, I have to practise for music, catch up on the work I missed when I was too ill to do anything but sleep and help out around the house and that probably miniscule compared to year 11s and 6th form, so let me drink my monster in peace.
