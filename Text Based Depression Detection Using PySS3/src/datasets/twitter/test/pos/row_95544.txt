Crying over my elementary school memories right mow Feeling like Pele during recess, cafeteria food that was either the best thing or the most gross thing you've ever seen, Rainbow Loom, finally punching the kid who bullied me for years. Damn I miss it all.

Ever since 7th grade, things just fell apart.
