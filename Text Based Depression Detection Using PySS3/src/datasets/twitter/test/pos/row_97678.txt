Iâ€™m having a bit of a gender issue and I have no idea what to do Now, yes Iâ€™m aware Iâ€™m still growing, and my body is still changing. But, Iâ€™m stuck at the point where I have the ass, thighs, and hips of a woman. Yet Iâ€™m a man.

Iâ€™m pansexual, and very very bottom. I enjoy being as feminine as I am, but I would still consider myself cis since I donâ€™t plan on becoming a female.

If Iâ€™m still not happy with my body after I do this routine I may consider hormones, again, staying male. 

Iâ€™m dearly sorry if this was hard to read, Iâ€™m high right now and this took multiple tries as I kept ending up face down on my keyboard.
