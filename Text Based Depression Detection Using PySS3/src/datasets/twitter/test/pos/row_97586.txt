This is kind of a question I don't want to ask but I need help My dad gets pissed at me for small things. Then gives the stupidest punishment. The punishment is I'm not allowed to eat untill he allows. He usually doesn't allow it until after 2-3 days after. 
Anyway the question is if this is normal or not?
