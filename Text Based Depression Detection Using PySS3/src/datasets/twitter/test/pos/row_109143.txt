I'm finally gonna be a femboy I've decided to finally but the femboy clothes I've been obsessing over for a while.



I wanted to thank anyone who supported me in my last posts become it's much appreciated and this subreddit has helped me have the courage to go through with this, and be who I want to be. 

I still don't have the courage to tell my parents about this but that's not important right now.

Id still like to hear any opinions or advice on anything. Or if anyone wants to ask me something or talk about it, go for it!

Thanks again for everything guys :)
