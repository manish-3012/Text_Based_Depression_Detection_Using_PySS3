I love my relative, what should i do? Im 14, she is 15 and if it counts i had my first kiss when i was 2 years old with her (actual kiss), i had the photo which took our moms when we kissed, but i can't find it because we moved to another house, i love her since i was 10 or smth, before lockdown we were chilling in my room, hugging eachother, eating pizza and watching avatar. What should i do if i can't stop thinking of her? It's not easy to say that i love her because i can lose my best friend/the person i love much. can i tell her something that will tell her how do i feel but don't ruin our relationship? she is actually very important in my life, also she is my relative.
