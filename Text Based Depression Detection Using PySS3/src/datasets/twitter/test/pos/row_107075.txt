why tf are south-east asians not socially accepted? im sri lankan, but ive lived in australia all my life. One thing ive realised is that it is not easy to get friends. Starting conversations is difficult because people ignore me most of the time.and also ive never ever in my life seen a southeast asian in a relationship with anyone of a different race, which sucks cuz its almost impossible to get a relationship.
