My male best friend has an unbelievably hot voice and idk how to feel about that Bruh I'm probably lesbian but his voice literally makes me question my sexuality everytime I hear it. We usually text so I rarely ever hear him speak....but when I do......oof. He makes me really nervous. But he's like a friend to me so ughhh. How do I deal with this?
