Is this normal (0.7 brain cell alert) Why can i express my feelings better on english than my own language 

If i want to confess to a girl on english for a reason i know i can do it but if i want to in my own language i wouldnt , or maybe cuz i never asked anyone out , idk but the real question is how do i get less shy or at least talk to people without my words not coming out of me 

Thanks have a good day/night
