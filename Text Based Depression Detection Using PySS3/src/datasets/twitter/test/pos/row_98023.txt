Anyone else just burst out crying or laughing at random moments? Sometimes I'll just suddenly get sad for absolutely no reason and just start bawling my eyes out. Usually it helps if I'm not alone. Sometimes I work the night shift and I'm left alone and I'll just immediately panic and cry. Sometimes when I'm with someone and I'm extremely sad or devastated I'll start to laugh for no reason. I try not to scare them if I do it, I can't help it. I try to remind them that I don't mean to laugh.
