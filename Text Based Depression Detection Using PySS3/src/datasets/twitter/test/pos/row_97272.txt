change.org/BanConscience (I didn't know where else to post this) Abighya Anand and his parents have started a channel called "Conscience" on a mission to bring the world's attention to the "truth" of modern medicine and practices, as well as advocate astrology. However, the stuff Abighya Anand (and his family) are advocating are potentially dangerous, and they are spreading much misinformation on topics such as health and the future. Examples of this are: Not vaccinating, not taking proper medicines, and not trusting anything the WHO and CDC says. Now, Conscience is starting to reach almost 1 million subscribers after "predicting" corona virus in his most popular upload. His content blatantly goes against the YouTube terms of service and COVID-19 guidelines, but they still haven't taken him down. This is an ever growing problem and he needs to be stopped as he is starting a revolution on modern medicine and creating more and more anti-vaxers everyday using pseudoscience. This can affect the entire world and the lives of many. (The channel is moderated by his parents, who hide behind Abighya and his sister Abidheya's faces.) They have also started another channel called "Awaken Conscience" as they know their first channel is going to be taken down soon. Please sign this petition to get both of the channels taken down and to take a big step towards ending misinformation.
