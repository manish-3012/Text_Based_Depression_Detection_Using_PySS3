sooooooo i need some help with my arm span i'm turning 14 in like about a week and i'm going into highchool (*cries)* and i thought "why not learn how to defend myself, i'll try boxing" because i'm pretty insecure. last i measured myself i was 179 cms tall, and then measured my arm span (which is important in boxing) and i got 184-185 cms. but i still dont know what the average is in my height and age range, this is pretty imprtant since the school i'm going to has a lot of big guys (ranging 185-175 in the 10-12th grades is easily an average), so what's the arm span average for my height and age? because i don't understand how these things work and i'm too lazy to read through all of wikipedia for this
