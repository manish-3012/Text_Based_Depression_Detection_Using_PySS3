Do grades really matter? Iâ€™ve always been pressured to have straight Aâ€™s and get into a good college and stuff like that. I donâ€™t usually, I get one or 2 Bâ€™s unless I overwork myself and get stressed out. But with online school I got a couple Câ€™s and my family always made it seem like that meant I wouldnâ€™t get into a good college. But to be honest I probably wouldnâ€™t even go to college if it werenâ€™t for my family, I plan on just getting into an ok college and majoring in psychology. So does it really matter if I get a couple of Câ€™s?
