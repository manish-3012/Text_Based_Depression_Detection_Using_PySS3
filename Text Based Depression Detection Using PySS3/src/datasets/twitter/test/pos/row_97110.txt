I didn't kill myself today I was in a horrible place last year (before Covid) and I decided that if nothing got better I would kill myself on September fifteenth. I thought no one loved me, and that no one would ever love me. Today, I decided I would change my decision to kill myself, I have good friends now, and a safe place to get help. I put in so much effort to be happy, and I just wanted to celebrate it with you guys.
