Who has parents that when they make decisions they use the "I'm the parent" excuses? I have seen my parents pull the "I'm the parent" excuse when they make decisions that make no sense. They wanted me to leave the glass door that is see through in the office open so "They could see what I'm doing." I made valid points during the argument but my parents said "We are the parents, we get to make the decisions." Like wtf.
