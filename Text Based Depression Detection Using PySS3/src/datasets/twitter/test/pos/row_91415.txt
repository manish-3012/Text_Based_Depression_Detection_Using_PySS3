a little rant on SOME - not all - parts of the lgbt+ community, as a trans person. alright. before i start: this is not about people talking about gay all the time, or expressing themselves, etc., like some rants i've seen. fuck those, let people express themselves. 

now that's said-- the transphobia within some parts of the community is insane. its not fun. i'm sick of cis lgb people wanting to "drop the t", saying trans people shouldn't be accepted in lgbt spaces, etc. some cis lgb people have been more transphobic than cishet people. 
for clarification, i haven't seen TOO much of this-- but it definitely exists and its not fun. i just want to exist and have a safe space. this is supposed to be that. please. 

tldr; can cis lgb people stop being transphobic i'm so tired
