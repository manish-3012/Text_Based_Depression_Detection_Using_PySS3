Depression issues Any tips for mental health Iâ€™ve been depressed for about 5 years trying to take my life at 9 for the first time and the second and last at 10 after that I havenâ€™t tried to do it but have thought about it. I donâ€™t want to tell my parents Iâ€™m sad because it will ruin my personality the fun happy person and I feel like I would disappoint my parents by not sharing it with them. Iâ€™ve never publicly spoken about this but itâ€™s about time. If anyone has tips for me to tell them or just overall life advice please do tell me I donâ€™t know what to do some days.
