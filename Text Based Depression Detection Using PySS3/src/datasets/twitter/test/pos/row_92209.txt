Alright guys... just opened up my PRE calculus book for the first time after receiving it from school today, Gotta say, for a book thats this old and has been used for years it still has the new book smell, but this ones different... it smells more like sweat and tears. It's been severely folded, though I guess those are important parts of the book. And it is surprisingly heavy! it's a 1000 pages and it weighs about a kg. Well I guess I'm next to adding more to the smell of sweat and tears! Wish me luck and I hope you fucking succeed on whatever life choices you're making!
