I am in an intense amount of trouble. So I have had since october to do my online driver's ed. I have procrastinated. I had to get it done by midnight march 31st. it hit midnight when I had not even one lesson left and I was working on it. Since I didn't finish, I have to retake the whole coarse and pay my mom the $400 retake fee. hahahahahahahahaha fuck. I will learn nothing from this.
