could someone read the start of my short story and give me some feedback please? I turn the corner and run headfirst into someone. They are cold. I donâ€™t have time to see their face before they bite my arm and run away. â€œWhat the-â€ I say before realising Iâ€™ve dropped the dog leash. I run to catch up with the brown retriever I named Lancelot. I look around for the weirdo that left imprints on my arm, but the street is empty. I hear shouting of something indistinguishable and decide itâ€™s time to get out of here. â€œwhat is with people today?â€ I think as I beeline to my second floor flat. The wound on my arm bleeds slightly so I donâ€™t think anything of it. I do feel dizzy though, so I decide to take a lie down. But the dog wonâ€™t stop barking, disrupting any sleep I hoped to get. My wound starts to bleed some more so I enter the bathroom in attempt to clean it. I feel lightheaded as I fall, smacking my head on the sink as I go down. The last thing I remember is that bloody dog barking._x000D_

I wake with a pounding headache. Iâ€™m no longer in the bathroom but instead sprawled out on the living room floor. The TV is on. â€œstrangeâ€ I think. I donâ€™t remember turning it on. I donâ€™t even remember leaving the bathroom. My eyes focus in on the woman on the TV. She's speaking funny, rambling on about staying inside and avoiding everyone. I try change the channel. She's still there. I try again. Still there. I turn it off and on again. Still there. I get up, feeling an intense head rush follow. I wonder where Lancelot is.  As I go to find him, I notice something on the couch, pieces of paper with horrendous handwriting on it:_x000D_

â€œ26/01/21: Dear diary my skin is so, so itchy, like thereâ€™s bugs in it. There's a woman on the TV saying the world has ended. I'm going to stay put to see what happens. Lancelot is my only friend. I'm quite hungry though._x000D_

29/01/21: I canâ€™t remember who I am. I only know my name, Arthur. My veins are black, my teeth sharp. Dog stopped barking, probably cause I ate his face in. What the hell is happening?â€
