The game crashed and all progress has gone to waste. Yours truly. Is frustrated. I was playing ma star wars game as every normal mentally sane person does. And then my progress hasith gone to waste. Because I died. When spawned back in. I cannot equip any of my stuff. And my character was good guy but game decided to make all the points go to the dark side. Might also be worth mentioning I get one hit by anything because I can't equip anything. Fun. Fun.

**FUN**
