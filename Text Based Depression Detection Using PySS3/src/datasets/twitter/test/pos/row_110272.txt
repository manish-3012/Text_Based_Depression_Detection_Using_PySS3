I need some urgent help in the form of advice Yeah so I want a golden retriever pup as badly as u want the thing u want the most in your life. I will devote myself but there are some cons. I have to go to school and my mom too(teacher) dads out of station. I can get help from granny but Iâ€™m not sure she will be able to give her(pup) the time as she is a really busy oldie. I am damn sure Iâ€™ll get a pup and so I want a few tips for her care. Any help will be loved. U can also give me novice training tips, health tips, naming ideas, etc. I will post her pics as soon as I get her. Hope u stay tuned to enjoy it! ( sorry it sounds youtuber!) U can also DM me. I thought this will be the best sub as u guys are the most helpful on Reddit,so yeah. Thanks a lot!
