I nearly just stole my best friends girlfriend I'm Norwegian so sorry for the not so good English 

I'm a scout and when I say scout you probably think we are boring people who do nothing cool, but everyone who is a scout is really just pyromaniacs who need a hobby to use their flame abilities.Â  The Norwegian scouts are very different from the English.Â  On a trip we hada trip some English scouts who came to Norway and it was so wierd because everyone wore the same uniform all the time and no one were allowed to have a knife or any matches.
If our scout group was like that then I would not have been a scout in the first place.Â  the reason I messed up is because on one of our many trips everyone were sitting around a campfire and each patrol is going to do a show or a game or something like that. A patrol is a group of people that have to do everything together. Of course, our scout group chose to have a relationship game.Â  The game works as such, a volunteer is chosen and everyone in the audience gets up.Â  The volunteer should then say yes or no to the questions that is said and depending on who you are, you would sit down or not.Â  So if the question is "do you want the person to have blonde hair" if the volunteer says yes then everyone who does not have blonde hair sits down.Â  Eventually there will be one person left and that person you will be forced to have a date Or just hang out with for a good amountÂ  of time.Â  When my patrol was going to have this game, of course those from my patrol said that I had chosen myself voluntarily even though I had not done so.Â  I said yes to blonde hair, yes to earrings, yes to lower than me and yes to the same age as me.Â  We did this with many other scouts so I thought there was zero chance I got one I knew.Â  I turned around and there stood my friend's girlfriend.Â  My friend is very mad at me now and I do not know what to do.Â  That's why I'm sitting here writing this because I have no one to talk to.
