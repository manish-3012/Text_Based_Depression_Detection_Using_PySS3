I am so proud of my dad. I needed to share this because it means a lot to me. So, my dad has always had a bit of a temper and made some poor choices when I was younger. At some point I screamed at him that I don't trust him, and he doesn't deserve my trust, and much worse things. This was me beginning to process what happened, and as I got help with my mental health I calmed down and realized he was trying to change, to make up for it, but I wasn't giving him a chance, and was probably hurting him quite a bit. I paid attention a bit more and saw him actively trying to control his temper, and he's made a ton of progress.

What led me to completely forgiving him was when a sibling exploded on my parents and insulting them in the worst ways imaginable, and my dad screamed at him to not talk to his mother like that, took the door, grounded him, and left to calm down and make sure our mom was okay. Then he checked in on me, because I was in the room next door and struggle with cptsd, being triggered every time an adult yells. He hugged me and apologized for yelling, and I just told him most people wouldn't have been able to keep so much control in that situation, I certainly wouldn't have.

For the last several years he's worked so hard to get us everything we need and want, spent thousands of dollars on vacation for us, we've gotten to try so many new things and had so much fun. He very rarely yells at all, even when he's angry, and if he is too mad he will walk away and wait to talk. He also joined BACA (Bikers Against Child Abuse) to help kids who've been abused. He loves it, and everyone there is so nice and he fits in so well in it. He looks big and tough but will stop everything to help someone. 

Changing so much takes an exorbitant amount of work, most people wouldn't be able to change the way he did, especially not in a few years. Some people close to me wonder how I can forgive him but I don't think he was ever a bad person, I think he was just really lost, but he pulled himself back together. He really deserves so much and I'm so grateful.

It makes me really optimistic, more hopeful that other people can improve if they're only given the chance, which means working with them, pushing through the times they fall back and things get bad, but they have to want to improve.
