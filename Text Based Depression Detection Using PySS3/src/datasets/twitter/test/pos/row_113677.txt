New Lego, POG I went to the Lego store with my mom today because she was shopping for Christmas Gifts for friends and family, and I had noticed that the James Bond Aston Martin was available in store but not on Shop at Home for Lego. I don't know how, I don't know why, but when I saw it and pointed it out, she told me I could buy it. All I could say was, "Wait, Seriously?", and she replied with an "If you want it." I'm so happy about this. Have a great rest of your day!
