Can I have some advise So my best friend (we will nickname them Karla) from like a year ago texted me and we FaceTimed each other. Like Karla invited another person (nickname= Jessica)I knew that was a pretty good friend and then Karla was talking about who they liked and they said that they liked someone in this call and Idk if itâ€™s Jessica or me cause Karla and me kinda liked each other when we saw each other a lot. But idk please tell me what to do.
