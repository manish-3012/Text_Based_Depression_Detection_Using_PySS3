Can someone help me I need genuine responses For the past 5 months I would say and it might have even been longer, Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression at least thatâ€™s what I think I should classify myself but I donâ€™t even think that, Iâ€™ve been saying no Iâ€™m not 

5 months ago my ex girlfriend broke up with me on my birthday and Iâ€™ve just been a mess ever since, And these last two nights was the first time in like a month I cracked I cried again last night and thought about ending it all but I donâ€™t feel like I would kill myself but I feel like I could at the same time.

I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me and these last two days Iâ€™ve just been struggling a lot more with my physical appearance and I just donâ€™t know what to do I donâ€™t feel like anyone cares about me and Iâ€™m better off gone and Iâ€™m just scared and lost and confused and i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on with me anymore
