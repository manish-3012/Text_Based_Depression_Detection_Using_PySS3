I am very scared of sickness Whenever I drink a sweet drink, I always think to myself "what if i get seizure here? What if I have diabetes and doctors have to cut my leg? What if suddenly i cough blood? What if I get heart attack?"

This fear started when my father told me that my  generation has higher risk of diabetes. It has caused me to have anxiety attack if my drink is too sweet or my food is too greasy. Did anyone has the same fear as me?
