Who else likes to make up insanely horrific scenarios for no reason? I am your typical 16 year old. Kinda happy while kinda depressed at the same time, listens to hours upon hours of music every day and somewhat of a studier...

If you meet me IRL youâ€™ll probably think of me as the most harmless creature on earth (and in practice, I am) but there is a dark side to my mind that few know about: The Absolutely Horrific Murder Scenarios section...

For some reason, randomly at some random times throughout a month I decide to think of insanely horrific and gruesome ways that one could be murdered. These scenarios are  honestly cruel enough to give even the zodiac killer nightmares. Ones so harsh that I actually am scared to tell them to some of my friends because Iâ€™m genuinely scared they might not be able to handle it...

Am I the only one? Is it just me? Or are you guys the same as well?

***Note: if any of you are actually interested in hearing one of these scenarios please DM me. Iâ€™m not going to put them up on the post or as comments as the rules of this sub ban NSFW content and these scenarios are extremely NSFW***
