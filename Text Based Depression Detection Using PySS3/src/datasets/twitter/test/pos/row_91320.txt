Am I weird for being online too much So I'am probably an introvert, idk, but it doesn't mean I don't want friends, I'd love to have more friends but I just can't but I'm ok with it. I spent most of my time on Reddit or YouTube or some other forum somewhere but I don't make any online friends either, but it's ok. Looking at the few friends I do have I feel like they are all extroverts having fun with others doing stuff, and I'm the one here spending hours online. I've introduced my friends to Reddit and stuff and they use it and all but I feel like they have a more active or happier life than me. So I'm thinking is it because  I spend my time online like this or is be it because people just dont like me in person.
