Sometimes I hate being a guy So growing up I did dance as a guy, no I am not gay. But anyways I grew up around a bunch of girls that I was friends with, and looking back I realize that sometimes I would walk in a room and the girls would be like leave we are talking about girl stuff, and well this continued for a long time growing up. My bestest friend was from dance and I have known her for like over 10 years and I feel like I know less about her then a friend she made 3 years ago that is a girl. Like it's so hard to be close to a girl as a guy I was friends with everyone but like they never told me anything ever I was in no group chats which they had many. I got a girlfriend from the dance studio and well I still feel like I don't even know her completely like there is a side to her that only girls know and I really want to know that side... But I mean I am a guy so I guess I never will...
