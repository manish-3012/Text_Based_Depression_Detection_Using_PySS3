Iâ€™ve been thinking about this a lot...  every ninja in naruto would be a super good lumberjack. Like most Shinobi are able to punch a tree down with one punch, thatâ€™s much faster than a chain saw canâ€™t cut it down. Also some abilities could cut down a whole forest with one move. Also like when naruto has the 4 tales and created that crater, theyâ€™d be great excavators, probably not miners cause thereâ€™s no trace of any of the material that were in the crater but if you needed a hole naruto could do it pretty easily.

Feel free to argue with this id like to hear other peoples opinions too!
