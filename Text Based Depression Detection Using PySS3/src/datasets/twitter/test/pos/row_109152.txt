Does anyone know a laptop that can play games fairly well for under 400? I specifically ask for a laptop cause my parents wont let me get a pc because my room is "too small", and "it's not what I'm looking for", and I'm pretty sure that my parents wont buy me a 500 dollar laptop for christmas. if anyone can find a laptop that has specs good enough to play a couple of games, dm me or put it in the comments I need to be able to play another game other than fortnite
