Is this a rant? Or something that I want to talk about to people? Anyways here's my life story. #ABOUT THE BASTARD WHO WILL TELL HIS LIFE STORY TO SOME RANDOM STRANGERS

DMs open.

So, I'm 15M (actually 14 and 359 days old but who gives a fuck my birthday is next Saturday, in my home country we rather say the age that we're the closest to, per example: if it's the 16th of June 2020 and your birth date is on the 22nd of July 2004, you're treated as 16, not 15)

I'm from Romania, the shithole I call home. Ik some people would give a lot to live here, but it isn't necessarily the best place in the world.

In 173 cm tall or about 5'8'' and maybe a little chubby. 

I enjoy stuff like reading, (history (stuff about the past) or horror (SCP) or both (MAUS If you've read it) and playing video games. (SCP SL, Fallout, Minecraft.)

I'm a bit enthusiastic when telling people about myself, so that will be a disclaimer for the rest of this post. Also English is not my native language. 

I have mood swings like any other human of my age. And I always sound grumpy, apparently.

#AGAINST A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

I used to be hella awkward, and kinda depressed. I was that quiet or weird kid in class, and downplayed my emotions often. Maybe I'm a little bisexual too but idk tbh. Did a lot of strange stuff for attention, but I just made myself look like a 3 year old. 

I've then changed a lot for the better, people say. I cut my hair (used to be the second longest anyone had in class, only behind another dude, not a girl lol). I've also changed my views on relationships, realising that I do need them. Maybe. Sometimes tho I feel like old me who played fortnite a lot and did stupid shit for attention speaks instead of normal me. 


#THE GOOD OLD DAYS

In 2019, I've started to think I should change and not just play fortnite all day. It has been kinda hard, since I used to be both the weird kid and quiet kid. I started losing weight, (which I'm still proud of) and speaking to some people. (I also started jacking off then, and that's not a good thing. 

In June of that year, I went for the first time to eat with my friends after school. When I returned home, I thought to myself: ***"I heard people say that you won't know you were living on the good old days until they become the good old days, but I think I know that these days will become the good old days".***

That summer I spent a lot of time in France and Greece. (That is also when I created this account. I had a previous one with over 41k karma at deletion, from Jan 2019)

When the next year began (8th grade, Exam year), I was quite optimistic and not worried about the exam. Still went out with friends, but ***I still had a fear of talking to girls, and even in 2020 I said that "in 10 years I see myself alone, as it's better, with the only pleasure being my right hand" to one of my friends. (Very appropriate, right?)

In November 2019, I discovered NoFap, and by discovering that, I got myself into a rabbit hole of alt-right subreddits that I didn't get out until the mass-ban this summer. Some ideas stuck with me, like the idea that porn isn't good. That still affects my life to this day, and I kinda wish I didn't discover it. 

Then, life carried out as usual. We heard about "That Chinese Corona Virus", but people didn't care. Until the 26th of February, when the first case appeared. And then more. ***Schools closed in March (cancelling midterms), and total quarantine was declared one week later. Nice, wasn't it?***

#CORONA'S TIME 

During Quarantine, I didn't do a lot. Played video games (Fallout 4, as I got a GPU upgrade to a GTX 970 4GB from a GeForce 9500 GT 1GB VRAM) and didn't work on any of my skills, and barely learning for the exams. Some reflecting on life took place, but that's it.

#GRADES DON'T MATTER

But, the quarantine was lifted in May. That meant exams will take place. In June, I (since I was a terminal year) returned to school in extraordinary conditions. Some exam prep later, some stressful nights and a surprisingly easy exam, I got in where I wanted to. In my school where I studied for the past 8 years.

As for the rest of my class, only about half of the old mates would remain. That meant some good things and a bit of a confidence boost.

I discovered SCP, and i was hooked from the start. Some great writing and stories. (Some of my favourites are SCP-4999, SCP-978 and [[Quiet Days]]. u/the-paranoid-android, or Marv, the bot that fetches SCPs from the wiki will probably link the original articles)

As for the 2020 summer, Corona didn't do a lot. I still visited family, went to the beach and tried to climb a mountain (that was 2 months ago? Holy cow does time fly fast)

Then September came. I started High School. (And I deleted my oldest account and moved to this one, the great u/sentient_deathclaw)

#NOW

I'm getting along well with my new mates. As I said before (actually after because I'm writing this before a complete introduction), I used to be socially awkward and not get along with a lot of people, especially with girls, so this was a bit of a shock to me.

Then, it happened. I started crushing on a girl. I didn't know how to deal with that, since I wasn't the most interested in members of the opposite gender. I started talking to her after a while, and ***yesterday*** I thought again about this. I realized that I was so inexperienced that I didn't realize I can be friends with girls just like with guys. And we arrive to this day, where I'm writing this for the Self-Introduce weekend and to get this off my chest to some strangers on the internet instead of a psychologist. Also stopped beating my meat again. And started to play video games less.

So, did I make a good impression of myself? Or a bad one? ask me anything you want.
