Headspace can help you Iâ€™m not sponsored by Headspace in any way. Meditating helps to relieve the pressures in your life and comes with benefits. Such as mindfulness, increase patience, and overall a positive impact on your well-being. It doesnâ€™t have to be that long either. Like 3 minutes a day will do, itâ€™s just the persistence that helps

Anyway, that was all. Hope someone finds this useful, and gives it a shot. And itâ€™s true that meditation isnâ€™t for everyone, but youâ€™ll never know unless you try it :)
