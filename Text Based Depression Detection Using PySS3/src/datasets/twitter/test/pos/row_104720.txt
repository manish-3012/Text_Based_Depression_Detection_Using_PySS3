I am dissapointed,mad,and have been betrayed,however,I'm not surprised. I'm talking about my brother,prob will delete this soon bcs he'll probably stalk my account or smtg idk

Anyways,he is pure dog shit.

Like what in the actual fuck?I cant deal with my family members.I wanna move out so badly.

What do you call that behaviour when someone promises you something and the next day they act dumb and tell you that they dont remember themselves saying those words to you?

I am quite baffled and find this hilarious but it also makes me mad at the same time.

see this is why I have trust issues,people lie to me,they break their promises,I literally cannot trust my brother anymore as he's lied to me so many times that i can't even count,he's like the shepherd boy.

And he even said "Do you have evidence that I said that?" Like he didn't just say it last night,and when I keep telling him that I clearly remember what he said he just acts like he has amnesia or smtg what the fuck.

And he's 3 years younger than me but he treats me like I'm below him and doesnt respect me at all.

This was fucking why I told my parents to teach him manners and not to baby him,tell him to respect others,but guess what?They spoiled him and babied him until now,he's 12 years old,have no manners at all,treats people like shit,take advantage of other people,is so fucking lazy,is on his phone all the time,throws tantrums,doesnt do anything but laze around all day.

I fucking just want to get out of this house and live somewhere I wont have to deal with the same shit every day.I dont trust anyone.

I hate this place.
