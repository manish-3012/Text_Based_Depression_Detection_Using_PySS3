tell your mom that you love her last month my mom passed away in an accident. the news hit me like a truck and i still canâ€™t believe it. not a day goes by where i donâ€™t think about her. and the worst part is, the last time i saw her was about 3 weeks before the accident. so i didnâ€™t get to say goodbye or even that i loved her. In fact, I would give anything just to tell her that i love her one last time. and because of this, i want whomever that reads this that still has a mom, that you love her. you never know when what you love the most gets taken away from you.
