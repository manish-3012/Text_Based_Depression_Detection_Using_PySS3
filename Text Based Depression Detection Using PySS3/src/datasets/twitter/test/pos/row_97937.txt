I want a boyfriend yâ€™all :( I refuse to settle for less but itâ€™s so annoying everyday I think about wanting to be in a relationship (Iâ€™m not asking for reddit relationships)

I can never seem to find someone thatâ€™s similar enough to me that doesnâ€™t make suggestions about my looks when I didnâ€™t ask, is encouraging, has aspirations in life, and is respectful to the people around them :(
