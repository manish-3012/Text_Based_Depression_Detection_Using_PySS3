I was just broken up with yesterday... 9 days before our 6th month anniversary So earlier in the year, I made a post that I got a girlfriend and that I was super happy and yadda yadda blah blah blah. Her parents don't allow her to have a phone, so she was only able to talk to me a little bit over quarantine. Well, her parents found out she had a secret phone so she hasn't been able to talk to me In months. Well, the first time I heard from her in months, she says, hey, it's me, ________ we need to talk. I get super nervous because that's really nerve-racking to hear. She says stuff like having a long-distance relationship isn't healthy, it's just best if we're friends for now, and at this point, I'm in tears. I'd just been broken up with over text, not hearing from her in months. I was really hurt. I got sent to the counselor because my 1st-period teacher is a really nice lady and got worried about me when she saw me crying the entire time through the class. She later said something like I've never felt this way towards anyone before, I still love you, but when I go to high school maybe we can date again (because I'm a freshman she's in 8th grade. I started dating her when I was an 8th grade she was 7th. Don't think I'm a weird dude) but this hurts a lot. I really liked her, and she was one of the few people I thought I could count on for a long time, but she really hurt me. Sorry for such a long read, I just have a lot to get off my chest.
