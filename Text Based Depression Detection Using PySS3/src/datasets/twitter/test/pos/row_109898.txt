i feel so devastated and i miss them its always hard for me when a friendship ends, or at least i think that is what is happening. i thought he cared. i always cared. i thought we were close. i mean i was the one that did the unadding but fuck if he didnt act cold as shit. i dont know what i did. he says itd been rocky but i hadnt noticed it. i thought we were doing good. hes all i can think about. not in a weird way or anything. but im obsessing over it. i cant cope im just smoking and cutting myself i forget to eat. hes the only one left who knew how bad i could be. and now i have no one like that. im so alone and isolated
