Am I the only one who realizes people talk EXACTLY the same on the internet? And they probably say "unironically", "objectively", "straw man", "agenda", "normalize" and way more words than I can remember over and and over and over and over...

I feel I'm reading the same dude talking to himself. It's like the internet turns you into a robot dude
