My professor agrees that men can be raped, and she supports survivors. Iâ€™ve been seeing a lot of posts talking about how peopleâ€™s teachers say that â€œmen canâ€™t be rapedâ€, and as a male who was raped by a female some time ago, I can understand the frustration this statement causes.

I know itâ€™s nothing special, but I want everyone to know that not everyone thinks that way, and there are people who understand that even though men are usually the perpetrators, there are still men who are good and not all men behave as the others, and that we can be sexually assaulted too, as intercourse with the opposite or same sex is not always desired.

To all my fellow survivors, donâ€™t be afraid to stand up for yourself, donâ€™t hide your experience in fear of societyâ€™s views, not everyone is bad. But donâ€™t make false accusations. Thatâ€™s a crime.
