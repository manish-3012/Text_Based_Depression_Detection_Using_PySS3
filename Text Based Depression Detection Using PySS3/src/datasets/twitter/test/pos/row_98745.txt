I have disappointed all of you... One month ago... I started playing Fortnite with my little bro.

Honestly, I liked the game, it's OK. The community SUCKS ASS, but the game is VERY overrated. It's like a 7/10 game, and people treated it like a 50/10 game. It's OK, but not too great. It's a bit fun when you get into it, but it's not too good.

Anyway, thanks for reading my confession. I just said this because everybody hates the game in this sub.
