I feel like crap!! I'm a student election worker and, I legit did not make it today. I woke up around 10 am when I was supposed to be there at 9 am. It was the first time I overslept. I've been hella stressed and waking up early to study for my ACT. I really forgot that today was the day. I got the mail and an email last night, but I didn't check. I feel so irresponsible and, I feel like crap. I've really been going through a lot and, the last thing I had in mind was the election work thing. I'm 100% showing up for the other days, but I just feel like shit for not showing up today. 

Omg, I just reread this whole thing, I'm literally beating myself up for the smallest inconvenience.
