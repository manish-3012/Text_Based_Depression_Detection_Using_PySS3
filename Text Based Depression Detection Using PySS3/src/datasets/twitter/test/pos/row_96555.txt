I think I finally have friends Idk but I was in some car driving lessons, just today, the girl who I talked to in a group was gathering phone numbers so she can make a group chat for us. I honestly feel like nothing wouldâ€™ve happened on the last day, but it made me feel shocked but happy. I just hope she abides by her word and makes the group chat as promised. Anyway, I feel very happy now because Iâ€™m accepted with people, they are probably going to be good friends with me. Also, some girls were waving at me and I felt pretty shy but I waved back. I feel like life is going to get better from this moment. I thank god for this blessing. Thank you guys. I feel better now. Things are going to get better now.
