Quitting smoking. Ok so imma log my progress over here. Here s some context: I'm an 18 yes old guy that has been smoking for 6 yrs and now being that I have a car and other stuff to put money in I have decided that it's time I lay off the cancer sticks. This is the second day(I wanted to pass the first day so I know I can do it, as I was a pretty heavy, one pack a day smoker) and yeah, I'm making progress, painfully but surely.
