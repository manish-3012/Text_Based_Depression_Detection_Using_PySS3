My dad may go to jail because of something I said. No, he didn't do anything before you ask, my mom faked him him hitting and choking her and got him kicked out for "domestic violence", she has a CPO and a PO (civil protection order and protection order) against him. 

Now he wasn't allowed to contact her but her being the manipulative narciscist she is she called him and got in contact with him, and now if he does something she doesn't like they'll fucking take him.

Now when I was 13, my mom offered me weed and I smoked it, the last time I did was the last time I saw her, which was 2-3 months ago.

Thanks to online support communities I finally told my counselor and my dad, and of course, the counselor is a mandatory reporter so she has to report to CPS.

Now my mom is paranoid from all of the drugs she been high on constantly and she may think my dad called but it was counselor, now my dad might go to jail because of me and it's my fault, fucking christ what have I done with myself.  


If he goes to jail it's my fault, fuck me.
