How to approach shy guys(or people in general)? I'm moderately shy myself, I don't go out of my way to talk to people unless I have some sort of connection to them (e.g: we dont have to be friends but if they study the same shit i'd probably be able to talk to em) so this has always been a question of mine. I tend to attract/like the guys on the more introverted end but can never make it work (e.g: last time there was a dude i liked but since we both skipped the friendship step and went straight into confession it didnt end well). Even now there's a kid I'd like to befriend since he seems pretty chill and smart, but I think he has really bad social anxiety as his face goes crazy red whenever someone he doesn't know talks to him. 

But yeah, any advice guys and gals?
