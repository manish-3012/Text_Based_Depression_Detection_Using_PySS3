My ultimate cringe moment So like 5 years ago i had a super crush on a girl (we ended up dating but it was pity, im happy in a different relationship now) and my way of flirting with her one day in band class was to pretend to sleep on her shoulder while watching a movie in class. I cringe physically just thinking about it, and i regret ever doing it. Saying that, i totally would do it to my girlfriend right now.
