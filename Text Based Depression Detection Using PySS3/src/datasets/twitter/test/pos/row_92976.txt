When I was in the 6th grade, I used to rat out any classmates that were cheating while also cheating myself Whenever we had an exam, some kids would always cheat and ask each other what the answers to the questions were. Whenever I saw them doing that, I would always tell the teacher in front of everyone that they were cheating.
This would not have been that bad if it werenâ€™t for the fact that I would also cheat during every exam.
I donâ€™t know what was wrong with me back then.
