What I want and don't want in a relationship In a relationship, I want to be worshipped (at my feet possibly) and worship them in return (at their toe fingers). I want them to nail polish my toes and kiss them as well. On a funny note, I want them to be funny and caring. Also, they must destroy the government for me (SO I CAN RULE ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ).

What I don't want: Being disobeyed ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜¡
