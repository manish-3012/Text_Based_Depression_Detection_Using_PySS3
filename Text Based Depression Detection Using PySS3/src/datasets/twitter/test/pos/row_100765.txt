I had a tennis tournament today I know no one cares about tennis but I just feel like sharing my day. I play on the high school tennis team and we have tournaments usually every Friday. I played doubles at first, then I got moved to singles because I had a bad serve, and now I'm playing mixed doubles (boy and g i r l). I've never played mixed doubles with this g i r l or just mixed doubles in general so it was definitely a new experience for me. Anyways we kinda lost everything. Lost 2-8 first round, got a bye in first round consolation which puts us in the semis, and then lost that 6-8. We started at 11 and ended at 2. Idk how I feel about all of this but I think they're going to make me keep playing mixed doubles for the rest of the school year. Also I really hope the girl I played with does not have Reddit and sees this because this would be very embarrassing. No one snitch on me please
