I got my sisterâ€™s phone taken away indefinitely So the other night, my sister came into my room wanting to use my phone number to make a second tik tok account. I donâ€™t like tik tok or what itâ€™s about, so I said no. She kept pleading with me before using my number anyways. Then she said that if I didnâ€™t tell her the activation code then she wouldnâ€™t leave me alone, so I reluctantly gave it to her. She left and I was pretty pissed, but kept my cool. Fast forward a few days and I have brought it up several times. Her reaction each time was just to shrug and say ok. She did it again today and I finally got tired of it. I went to my dad and told him what happened, and he wasnâ€™t happy to say the least. He went and confronted my sister about it and made her delete tik tok and took her phone. Now that I had done something, I wasnâ€™t sure if it was right or not. I often get stuff taken away, but I have other things that I do. My sister, on the other hand, uses tik tok more than anything. Her friends are on it, she spends hours learning dances from it, and she scrolls for hours. It is like her life, so now Iâ€™m not sure if it was the right move. Was I in the right for getting tik tok deleted? I donâ€™t know. Sorry for the paragraph.
