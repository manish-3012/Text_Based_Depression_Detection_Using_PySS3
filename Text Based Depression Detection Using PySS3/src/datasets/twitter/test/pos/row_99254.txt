The stupid my parents got angry about today. Me not fully buttoning up my shirt, inside, in my own room. I am a male btw. Apparently it is a sign of laziness and lack of attention to detail. I really can't be asked to argue so I just buttoned it up. I mean, that's what I get for leaving the sanctuary that is my room.
