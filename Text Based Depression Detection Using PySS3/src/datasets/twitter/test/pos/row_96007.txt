And now I feel happy I just had the best hangout with a bunch of friends. Donâ€™t worry it was following guidelines. And we went swimming, and for the first time in I was complimented on my physical physique. And that made me feel amazing. And later, my crush, said â€œthe woman that youâ€™re with will be super luckyâ€. Aaahhh I feel happy. And even one of the boys said â€œdoes anybody else agree that [me]â€™s jokes are really funny?â€ And everyone agreed. Iâ€™ve havenâ€™t been this happy in a long time. :))))
