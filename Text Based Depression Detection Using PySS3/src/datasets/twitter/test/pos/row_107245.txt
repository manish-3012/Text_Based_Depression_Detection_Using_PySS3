Well, fuck my life, I told my crush I still have feelings for him. This was a bad idea. This was a bad idea. Holy shit. I hope it goes well. My heart is pounding at the speed of light I'm not even gonna lie. I essentially asked him out too, kind of. Fuck's sake. I texted it to him. Was like ya I still have feelings for you. I'm so sorry about that. But for God's sake. Holy shit.
