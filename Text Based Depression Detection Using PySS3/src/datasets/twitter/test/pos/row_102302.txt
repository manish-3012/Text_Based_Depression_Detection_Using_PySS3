Im so fucking tired of my social anxiety, life and â€œfriendsâ€ 
Basically i am sitting alone in my room the whole day... always just alone listening to music and having no contact with anyone, no messages no calls no nothing 

The same thing in school, im just the awkward introverted guy sitting alone in class... even when i choose a tactical place to sit i always sit alone. 

I lost my â€œfriendsâ€ in school and my â€œfriendsâ€ from sport are not into doing stuff together and they all have different way better friends. I never have parties and if I suggest we go to a theme park they will immediately say no 

I mean can you just fuckig say you donâ€™t like me or something, canâ€™t they just say i need to fucking die?! 

Even when i talked to my crush once she seemed really uncomfortable or something even tho i didnt screw up talking 

And all this fucking shit because social anxiety, and it makes it even worse... presentations and standing in front of the class is absolute hell 

Fuck i wanna be social but somehow i just canâ€™t 

And now my mom is angry at me because she thinks i do it on purpose i am alone...always alone 

I wanna have friends, where i can have fun with and donâ€™t have to talk about math with, i want to have fun and be fucking happy

And then I havenâ€™t talked about the rest of whats going on in my life rn
