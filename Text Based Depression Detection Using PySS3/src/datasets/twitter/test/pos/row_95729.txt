Daily rant bc yes I donâ€™t know who am I 
I have nothing , no friends ,no drive
No hope , no interest , no feelings
All I feel is emptiness and disappointment 
Toward myself, i always let myself down 
Only person I ever let judge me is the one in the mirror
And lately he ainâ€™t saying good things
He saying that I should kill my fear
But my fear is both my ceiling and my roof
I wish everything would be like in my dreams
Hard work paid off , but all the work I put on something 
Goes to an end ,  writing rap , I donâ€™t know how to make beats
So being able to rap without being able to make beats 
Is worth nothing, I can sing and write but I canâ€™t play nothing
How am I gonna make music if I canâ€™t make melodies or beats
Get a friend? I donâ€™t have any 
I also donâ€™t want a friend , I want a best friend
Ye i cant be happy with less 
But everyone already has a best friend so when I try to socialize 
I just feel like Iâ€™m disturbing others

TLDR: I am a useless lost piece of crap
