Attentions teen struggling with ACNE! I have been struggling with acne for the past few years and have finally found out the trick to it. Try to find a company or routine based on your specific needs and face conditions, such as if your face oily or dry, or is your face have cysts or small blackheads, etc. If you find items and products that work well for these conditions it helps a surprising amount. Even better is finding a company such as Lumin for men that can personalize a routine for you and send a free trial. But always try to stay away from the dermatologist office if possible. I personally went to the office for months and saw little to no results in my acne treatment. Most clinics will try to give you products that are expensive and make you keep coming back, some of these even have harsh chemicals that make you very vulnerable to burns! As soon as I stopped going to these clinics and found a new routine I had already a significantly clearer face! Donâ€™t be afraid to ask me some questions you may have either, I hope I helped some of you!
