Do you guys also agree that if a teacher's asking a question and nobody answers just say something even if it's wrong before they do something stupid like make everyone keep their cameras on or give another assignment? A lot of ppl in my class put their name for attendance and leave it on mute the entire class and only come back to sign out. It's fucking stupid bc the teacher calls on random ppl and now he's catching on and he's probably gonna make the rules stricter or give us more shit to do. Just put it in the background in case they call on you
