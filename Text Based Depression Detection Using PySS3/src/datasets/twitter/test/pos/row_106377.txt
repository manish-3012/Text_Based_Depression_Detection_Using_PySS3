How do I become friends with an introverted girl I know this sound very weird, but introverted people, please help me.

So Iâ€™m friends with this girl. Iâ€™ve known her for about 4 years, but we rarely hang out and always in groups. 

I really want to become closer with her. I wonâ€™t force anything, if we donâ€™t vibe thatâ€™s cool, but I would love to get to know her better. 

I do consider us friends. Iâ€™m in her private story, sheâ€™s in mine.

We just never really talk. Not when weâ€™re in groups and we never hangout with just the 2 of us. That would even be considered odd I guess.

Iâ€™m really extroverted and can be a lot for people. Iâ€™m easily loud or over excited and just really â€˜noticeableâ€™ I guess. I donâ€™t really know how else to explain it. (I sound really full of myself sorry!!)

Anyways. How do I give her the space to kind of open up to me I guess? Or just become friends or something.

I think she is amazingggg and super cool and really want to get to know her better. Sheâ€™s just so quiet and â€˜akwardâ€™ and just introverted.
