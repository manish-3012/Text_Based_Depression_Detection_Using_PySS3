I watched Schindler's List twice Not because I wanted to, but because my school forced me to.

This was a few years ago, before online school was the norm, but I watched it first in my English class, because my English teacher was also the Cinema teacher. The second time was in my History class. I couldn't opt out. My Jewish friend had both classes with me too.

Fuck school
