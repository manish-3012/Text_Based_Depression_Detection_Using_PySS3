People are so overly sensitive nowadays I saw this post of this one parent and they taught their child that the inside of the watermelon was called the flesh of the fruit so when the kid wanted watermelon heâ€™d call it flesh. 

And there were a whole bunch of comments like â€œsuch bad parentingâ€ â€œtaking advantage of an underdeveloped mindâ€ â€œthis is gaslightingâ€ and a whole bunch of other stupid shit. 

And I think itâ€™s so frustrating that some parents are forcing being LGBTQ+ on their children. Like is it okay to like the same gender or be which gender you feel most comfortable in...yes its perfectly okay. But donâ€™t force your 4 year old son into dresses and only buy Barbies or whatever for him because you want to force him to be a certain way to prove that youâ€™re a â€œwokeâ€ parent. 

And Iâ€™m just so tired of the judging. The shaming. The gate keeping. Like the difference between cultural appropriation and appreciation. Get the fuck out of here with that. I understand if someone is making fun of your culture, but say if someone genuinely wants to understand more about that culture and they like integrating it into their lives then let them be. Just let people be people. Iâ€™m so tired of people being sensitive assholes and trying to play savior out here. Fuck off.
