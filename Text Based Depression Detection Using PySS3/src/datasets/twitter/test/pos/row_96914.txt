why is writing news so painful so my school is a funky vocational school focused on media and so we have some mandatory electives

one of them is radio. but since we had mass media (basically journalism), my radio teacher expects us to write news

but my brain can somehow not comprehend how to write news. itâ€™s literally just rewriting information but I just canâ€™t

ok back to doing my final project :â€™))))
