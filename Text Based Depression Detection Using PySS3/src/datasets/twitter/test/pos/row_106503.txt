I think someone is lying to my girlfriend so a few weeks ago today, my girlfriend went into the city with a friend that she hadn't seen for a while. My girlfriend goes to another school to me, but her friend goes to the same school as me. Anyway, when she gets back we're hanging out the next day, and I can tell shes upset. My girlfriend says its nothing, and I know most of the time its best not to push her unless she wants to talk about something. Later on I can tell its really bugging her so I confront her about it. She finally tells me that the 'friend' she went out with the day before said some things about me. 'Apparently' I've been asking out all the girls in my grade and just being a general pervert. I confirm to my girlfriend that what she was told wasn't true, and she seemed happier. Since that day I know that my girlfriend and her friend have been texting, especially in the last week. Now we get to the problem. Today, I was texting her like normal, but she was acting a bit upset and i could tell. I asked her what was wrong and she said it was nothing. i can tell when shes upset, and when shes upset at me specifically. In this situation, I'm fairly sure shes upset with me, but she wont tell me why. Shes been demonstrating the same behaviors as when she was being lied to. I  don't know what to do, because I know its not my girlfriends fault because shes just too nice to people, and shes known her friend for a long time and trusts her. I don't know if I should talk to her friend in person because I don't have any proof shes really done anything this time. if you guys have any suggestions id really appreciate it
