I'm scared to be happy. I wasn't sure where else to post this so here I am.

I feel like I'm finally getting happy again... But every time I get happy, something (usually the same thing) comes to mess it up. I feel like I'm in a good place right now, sure some parts could be better but overall I'm alright... I really don't want that one thing to come back and ruin it again...
