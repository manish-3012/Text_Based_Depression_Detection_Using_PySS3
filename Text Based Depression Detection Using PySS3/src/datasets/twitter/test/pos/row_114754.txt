Memories of my friends Tis my final year in school (not my education) and my and my friends are so different and we all going to different schools. I have less the 5 months with them and I can't even study for tests and all I think is that in less than 5 months they are going to be memories nothing more, and that's sad. For last 8 years they where like family to me and if someone of my friend is reading this. 

that was hell of a journey my old friend. So long
