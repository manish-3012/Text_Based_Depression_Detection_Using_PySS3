I'm starting to strongly dislike my new PE teacher Where i live in we're not allowed to have PE indoors. So we have to go outside to do stuff.

Now, here is winter. It's kinda cold, and snow is here. So it's probably not the best idea to play football in these conditions right? 

Nah, we played football. And u know what's best? We can't go to the changing room. So we have to wear clothes we normally wear to school. 
So most of us played in clothes, in which we can't almost move, and if we did move too much we would probably rip our jeans. 

We played football, a running game, in -3Â°C, with snow everywhere, and with shitty clothes. Also we had to wear masks bcs of the virus. 

My head hurt so much after this. And it's probably not healthy right? Especially for my friend with asthma(sry if misspelled). 

Before you tell me that you had it worse, i don't care. 
But this isn't normal and i had to vent. 

This day was really shitty for me. Bad grades, a lot of exams. And after that i had to freeze my ass of while playing football. Screw this.
