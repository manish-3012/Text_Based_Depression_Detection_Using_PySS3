Relationship Entry 11 This is a diary like series where I talk about the times I spend with my wonderful girlfriend.

I got to go back over her house last weekend. It was so great to see her again. I was starting to get really sad and depressed without being able to see her more often. When I saw her again my smile came right back on my face. I reminded her a lot of how much I loved her while I was there, she seemed to like that. We played some games, watched the Addams Family because I hadn't seen it until then.

And that's pretty much it, so I guess there isn't really any super duper related information to give here, so I'll try and give advice.

Trust is like a line, you just can't jump to the top of it.
