My mom doesn't care about me. I've spent the last three years of my life learning programming, 3D modeling, animation, sound design, all by myself so I can become a programmer or computer scientist. All while taking dual-credit college courses (As a high-schooler).  


Today my grade dropped to a 93% because I forgot about an assignment, I had already resubmitted it an it would be graded by tomorrow. My mom came into my room mad, yelling at me for spending too much time "Building stupid stuff with code" and not enough time "Doing school."

She doesn't care about me, or what I want to do, she never has. She doesn't understand. This isn't teenage angst, this is my life, and she doesn't care.

I just want to cry.
