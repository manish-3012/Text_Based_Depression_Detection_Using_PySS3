Any tips on forgetting an ex I broke up with my ex a while ago during summer because she was being a bit of a pp face and I couldnâ€™t deal with that and my life at the time on top of it so we broke up but the stupidest things remind me of her for no reason. My text notifications, my twin sister and her have the same name so every time I hear my sisters name I remember her, random things that she wore and I see I just remember her. I donâ€™t have bad memories of her itâ€™s just impossible to escape and I just want to move on, any tips?
