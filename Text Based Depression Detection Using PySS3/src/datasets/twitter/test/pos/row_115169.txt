Iâ€™ve got anxiety meds prescribed and they do help but sometimes I need just a couple beers to calm me down Iâ€™m fit and healthy and never have enough to get drunk. It really calms me down and stops any shaking and just relaxes my mind so I can actually focus on what Iâ€™m doing. Is it really that bad of a solution?
