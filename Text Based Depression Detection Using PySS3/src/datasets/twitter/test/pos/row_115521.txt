So, I just fingered myself for the first time. I'm a guy I feel really confused and scared. I'm attracted to girls but lately I've been thinking about guys. I won't go to into details, but basically i did what the title says.

I know I probably sound like every other karma whore on this sub but I'm serious. I'm asking for answers or any ways for me to understand what's going on. Idc how many help me im grateful for anything.
