I'm having a tough time I just feel empty, it started a very long time ago but lockdown has amplified it. Staying in my house for months, even though I've had my family, is the manifestation of this depression. I cant even fully express to people how I feel because there is no feeling, no cause for this hollowness. It sounds ridiculous and I know everyone has had a difficult time, far too many are far worse off than me. Yet I feel like I need an outlet just to express myself with. I talked to my dad today about how life seems somewhat futile to me, which is just the tip of the iceberg, and he basically said to do what fulfills you; but how do I do that when nothing means anything? When I have no love or passion and no motivation to move forward, what then? Its made even worse by this girl I was talking to, I'm sure we had mutual feelings but now she is just straight up ghosting me and it makes me feel unwanted. Not just that, but I'm questioning my entire friendship with her. How will I know if anyone feels anything for me if she faked it so easily and then discarded me completely. I care more that her friendship wasn't real than anything else. It just adds to this weight on my mind and body, I'm so stressed and anxious, I've had to start doing quiet breathing exercises to calm myself out of panic attacks and none of it will go away, none of these horrible, condemning feelings will leave me alone and I dont feel like anyone can help me. I don't want to go on medication and I dont want therapy but I'm getting to a point where i dont want to even live and i cant bear it. 

Sorry I wrote a paragraph, if you made it here, congratulations. I'm not sure what I hope to achieve here, a strangers words feel even more empty than anyone else's but maybe you can relate and we can find contentment in life together. I wish you well, whoever's you are.
