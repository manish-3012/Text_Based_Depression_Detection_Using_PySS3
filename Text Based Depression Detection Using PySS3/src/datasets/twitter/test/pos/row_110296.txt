AIGHT R/TEENAGERS, I HAVE A MISSION So my crush just texted me after I told her that if I try hard enough, I might win her over.

She said "trust me, it works"

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck

Life is now a tightrope. No mistakes. I need this!

Does anyone know any ways that I can make subtle signs or anything?

Some good ways to start a conversation?

Anything really?!

Because. I might be overreacting. I think I'm on cloud 9.
