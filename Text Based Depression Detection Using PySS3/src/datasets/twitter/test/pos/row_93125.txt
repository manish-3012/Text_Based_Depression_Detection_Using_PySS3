i have a crush omg he's a dude in my grade. we started working on a group project together. we started texted. we stayed up into the wee hours of the night discussing life, our emotions, and the uncertainty of the future. he sends me classical music. i send him jazz classics. he loves the ballet russes. he sent me lever du jour from daphnis et chloe. i sent him a thelonius monk album. we study together. we "accidentally bump into each other between classes". i can't stop thinking about him.

what do i do?
