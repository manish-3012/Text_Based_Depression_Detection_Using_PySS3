My cat is murdering the fuck out of a random bug Sheâ€™s tryna eat it lol. Iâ€™m unsure if I should stop her. And oh fuck itâ€™s now dead and itâ€™s jumping towards my feet. Itâ€™s huge by the way, it has like 6 legs, itâ€™s like a centimeter tall, and maybe an inch and a half long And like an inch wide. I donâ€™t understand how this is enjoyable to my cat lol. I guess it makes sense as to why itâ€™s in my house though, itâ€™s pretty cold outside, but HOW did this thing get into my house, and up the stairs to my room. I should have been asleep an hour and a half ago : ).
