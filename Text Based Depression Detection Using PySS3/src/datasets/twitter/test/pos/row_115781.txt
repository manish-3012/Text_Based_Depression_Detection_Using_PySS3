what was the weirdest way you've made friend? mine was probably this one time in I think 1st or 2nd grade and I fell off the monkey bars on the playground, and I was kind of in pain but you know I was a 2nd grade idiot and didn't want to seem "weak" because there were a shit ton of people around, so instead I just kind of rolled to the side and lay there until this one kid came along and said I don't remember exactly but something along the lines of "this is how you do it" and he started, made it to about the same spot I did and fell off and did the same thing as me and then we just kind of lay there trying not to cry because at that point tons of people were there.
