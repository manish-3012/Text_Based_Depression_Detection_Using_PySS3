My sister is getting married tomorrow I am just feeling so weird

My sister whom i have lived with for 16 years of my life is leaving 

She will leave to Canada....

She will leave to go across the world

I just feel so weird 

We're 7

My father, my mother, 4 sisters and me

My father died and one sister is leaving so we will be 5

From 7 to 5

5...

I will miss her

Just losing someone i talk to every day 

I will probably just see her once a year in a holiday of hers

I don't know what will happen

I don't think we will talk much

Texting is weird you know

I just feel so bad 

I will go sleep and wake up tomorrow to get ready for it

I think 2 friends will which will be awkward 

I am glad i will have my mask on

I will go wear my suit and hide my face

Just stand and try not to talk to people

I don't know what will i do with photos and videos 

Probably nothing because they hired a professional photographer 

I will just take photos and use reddit and hope no one notices

Try to make new friends to replace my sister 

Try not to think about it 

Later we will have dinner

Our family and his family 

Then they will go to their honeymoon 

Then 2 weeks later will come back for 4 hours 

They will take their stuff and leave

12 hours on a plane 

To go to Canada 

From Egypt to Canada 

Then next day i will do my math homework and forget about everything 

Just move on

Thanks

I love you 

bye bye don't die
