I'm so fkn tired of being single dude there's honestly no reason for it. i think im pretty attractive and i look like i go with some the girl's standards and im passionate about what i do and my interests, unlike most guys that go to my school dont pass and have no life. i don't get it, i do the bare minimum and im friends with a lot of ppl at my school. ig i can say im a bit popular. the only thing i can imagine for being the reason why i been single for forever is either the fact that i don't have a job, or that im not the best at talking to girls. but i talk to girls better than other guys do plus im good with talking to girls who live further away from me. but its wtv ig
