my loneliness is killing me iâ€™m so sick of being alone. i donâ€™t have a single friend that isnâ€™t more than 400 miles away. iâ€™ve tried to talk to people in this town and they just laughed in my face. they all hate me here. they think iâ€™m weird, they think iâ€™m a freak. iâ€™m so sick of it. it hurts, physically. i wish i had something in common with at least one person in this small shithole of a town. i donâ€™t. i just want someone to walk the streets with while singing along to our favorite songs, someone to go to the pizza shop with at 9 at night and eat a whole pizza with, someone to connect with, someone to have fun with. i hate it. it hurts.
