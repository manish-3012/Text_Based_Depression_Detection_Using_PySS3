Dudes be like â€œDonâ€™t lead boys on, if you donâ€™t like him then tell him!â€ 

Then you get into a situation where you think somebody who you arenâ€™t interested in likes you, but you donâ€™t want to seem big headed from saying u donâ€™t like him because even if he did like you, heâ€™s gonna say he didnâ€™t. 

And then if you say nothing and continue to be normal, he asks u out or tries to make a move then gets mad saying you lead him on. And then probable calls u a slut or something just to top it all off. 

This is very specific Ik but if I had a dollar for every time this had happened to me, I would have $3, which isnâ€™t a lot but itâ€™s strange it happens three times.
