If you want to go out and live your life, go out. If you want to quarantine, then quarantine. But donâ€™t be a dick about it If you want to go out and live your life then go out and do that while being safe about it. If you want to quarantine and help prevent the spread then do that. Just if you want to go out WHERE  YOUR GODDAMN Mask and donâ€™t protest it. And if your at home donâ€™t come plain about people wanting to live there lives. To Sumerise donâ€™t be a asshole.
