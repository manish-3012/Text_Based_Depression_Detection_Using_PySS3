To the tweens/kids who haven't fucked their life up yet: Please don't go down the way of a straight A sutdent.

**I do not discourage you from getting good grades, but purposefully overstressing yourself beyond your abilities just for A grades is a mistake that I made which led me down the** ***wrong*** **path.**

 I will now hate myself if there is anything other that A's on my report card. Once you start it, it's like a drug. Not only do you get addicted to it, in some, way, but it also becomes a normal thing to you, and all the B's and the C's become like a moral weapon beacuse of the tolerance you have developed.

My parents also criticize me. I once got a C on a test, and they made a bigger-than-normal fuss about it. 

There is very little going back

Gosh. I could keep this going, but this is too long already.
