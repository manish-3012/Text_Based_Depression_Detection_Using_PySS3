Just curious I was wanting some feedback. Am I the only one who gets slightly annoyed when people use generations as an argument. I understand jokes and stereotypes, but I am slightly annoyed when people are like, "all you gen Z are soft and not tough enough." (This is probably a poor example but you get the point.) This goes for all generations. Don't center your argument around when you were born, it doesn't make sense.
