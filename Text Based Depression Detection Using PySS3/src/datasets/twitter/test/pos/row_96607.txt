I'm a fucking piece of shit For new year's I went to a party that was being organised by my best friend's crush. Long story short, he was the first to pass out and what with the large amount of alcohol in our blood I ended up sleeping with her and now he won't speak to me and I'm afraid that I've lost my best friend for a night with a girl who I didn't know beforehand. 

I just had to tell someone.
