Why do I wanna die ? I have never felt proper happiness since I was 14, it has been almost 4 years since then and my life has just started going downhill from there. Tbh I really don't feel like myself anymore now, it's like my soul is trapped inside this physical body of mine, I just wanna let go and never return again.

I never had proper friends, nobody whom I could trust, not even my parents. So I started looking for some company but I never found that either, nobody to atleast show even a little bit of affection towards me. Literally everyone whom I've met or called my " *friends* " took me for granted and were only with me so that I don't kill myself and put their names in my suicidal note.

People just have pity on me when they are around me. I've been judged, ghosted and what not because I trusted them and told them my actual mental state which I've had since I was 14. 

I am not good at studies or anything to be precise, the only reason I wanted to keep living used to be this one person whom I used to adore 2 years back but now I'm just a fake depressed creep for her. I hate myself, I hate my life and I fucking hate all these thoughts inside my head. 

I just want to let go that's it. I never wanted anyone's attention, I never wanted to be the most good looking or the smartest etc. I just wanted some company, just a little bit, just someone whom I could trust, whom I never felt left out with, someone who could check on me daily and say that they were proud of me.

But now I just cry myself to sleep every night knowing that I'm just a liability for my parents and a burden to this godforsaken world.

Thanks for coming to my Sad talk
