We made it! Long story short:

My grandpa recently got diagnosed with cancer, my cousin has been taking care of him but is super tired, my mom and dad and I decided to road trip down to his state to help out and Iâ€™m super worried about him but we finally made it even though I hate my rv bed itâ€™s super uncomfortable and 2 inches from the ceiling
