Remember, you are like a phone You may change but youâ€™ll eventually become old as the new models (babies) get created

Your personality, interest, hobbies (apps) May change or have new ones added or some might be forgotten

Even if you think you are immortal, remember the heart (battery) that ticks will soon break down
