Pure joy The best feeling in the world is revisiting dreams from way back in your child hood. Things change constantly in this world but memorable dreams will stay forever. I can still remember the details of old dreams. The other night I was in a zombie survival setting in a leveled city. Still had the same house. Though it wasn't the same as last time I was there it still had a lot of familiarity. I just love having repeating dreams.
