Why am I being hated everywhere because Iâ€™m chinese Hello, Iâ€™m a 14 year old boy that was born in uk and lived uk my whole life and my parents are chinese. Iâ€™ve had some rasict remarks about me before when I was younger but not very often but recently especially due to covid 19 it seems that a lot of chinese people are being hated by including me. I have been told in my school that I should go back to China with my bat soup and all that which Iâ€™m very much confused. I know that some people in China eat dogs and stuff but everyone I know from China donâ€™t actually eat those kind of stuff. At first I thought it was only white people that didnâ€™t really like chinese people but now I discovered south loader and japan didnâ€™t like chinese people which makes me very sad. This may sound very stupid but now I feel like I wish I wasnâ€™t chinese.
