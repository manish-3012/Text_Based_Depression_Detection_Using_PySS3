Fuck I just realized something I'm 13 years old, I have the best years of my life ahead of me and so far I'm spending em alone, depressed, and friendless. I keep so many secrets from people because every time I open up I get hurt, and I don't have a single deep meaningful relationship with someone, not even my own family. I've been struggling with depression and suicide since I was 10 years old and I kept telling myself it will get better, and sometimes it does for a little bit, and when depression comes back it hits harder every time. I'm in my prime and I'm wasting my life doing nothing.
