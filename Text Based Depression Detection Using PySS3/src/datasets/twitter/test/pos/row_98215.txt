Have to face discrimination daily.

---Tricked ya! 
You are amazing, valid, and you do NOT deserve any of the fucking crap people give you.


"There comes a time when you have to stand up and shout 'This is me, damn it! I look the way I look, I think the way I think, feel the way I feel, love the way I love! I am a whole complex package. Take me...or leave me. Accept me- or walk away! Do NOT make me feel less of a person, just because I don't fit your idea of who I should be, and don't try to change me to fit your mould! If I need to change, I alone will make that decision.'"    

- Gerard Way. (of MyChemicalRomance, UmbrellaAcademy, his own music {HesitantAlien}, and various comic books! Overall, an amazing person!)



Never hurt yourself. Stay alive. Stay safe. Stay beautiful. Keep it ugly.
