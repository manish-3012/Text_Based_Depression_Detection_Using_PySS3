Should i leave tiktok? I really like tiktok and i would love to use it because i follow a lot of people who help me out sometimes but the kids on tiktok are getting annoying asf now. Like they cry over anything and the only people i like on tiktok now is the real alternative people and the people who take their time to educate others on like Poc history and stuff.

I want to stay on tiktok but i think i might just limit my time on there because i cant with everyone thinking its cute to romanticize mental health issue or just crying over real alternative ppl telling the posers and e-kids they are not actually alternative, theyre just posers.
