I just want a best friend. Whom I can trust. Iâ€™ve friends but Iâ€™ve also trust issues. The more anti-social I am, the more crazy I become. And I mean â€œfinding out that youâ€™re the messiah in saving humanity from the face of extinction from an incoming alien invasion from another alternative universeâ€ crazy. I really donâ€™t give a damn about dating. Having a best friend would suffice. Though I would still want her to be caring, cute (literally or figuratively? Both), understanding, and strong (emotionally).

But yeah, I figured I should post here because thereâ€™s a lot of you who just wants that forever partner to either â€œdo itâ€ with or cuddle. But for me, I just want a friend, a best friend, whom I can trust. And yeah, Iâ€™m a bit of a tsundere and the type to friendzone myself.
