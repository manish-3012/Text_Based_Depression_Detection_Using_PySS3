My theory on why girls periods are so bad Basically natural selection.
Consider caveman Ines ok? Now I teorise that back than there were woman's that had really rare periods and not nearly as painful, and some that are like the ones today.

The ones with the bad periods would get pregnant more often (as they would have a bigger window for it) and would have an extra reason for it, so they got way more children than the ones with rare periods, and now that is the norm.

I don't know I might be high from my neighbors smoke or something, but that sounds dumb, but dumb enough to be plausible
