Tutor thinks he is more important than grandma Hello, my name is Konstantin.  I'm 16, I live in Russia.  Time 11 a.m.  Today is a holiday in Russia.  We are not learning.  Today at 10:20 a.m.  I HAD to go to my grandmother.  Therefore, I wrote to the tutor about the cancellation of the lesson.  She, in turn, wanted to abandon me.  Like.  What?  In her opinion.  Is she more important to my grandmother?  "Ð”Ð° Ð¸Ð´Ð¸ Ñ‚Ñ‹ Ð½Ð°Ñ…ÑƒÐ¹" I would say, if not for my mom.  The whole situation is very dumb.  A holiday, everyone is resting.  And I'm fucking doing math.  As a result, I gave it up
