Why the fuck do so many people here have a problem with Abe Lincoln? I saw people here trying to cancel Abe Lincoln for being a racist. He never owned slaves, preached against it, AND FUCKING FREED THEM. HOW ARE PEOPLE TRYING TO CANCEL HIM. â€œHe was a racistâ€ yeah no shit he probably had some feelings towards black people that wouldnâ€™t be tolerated today BUT HE FREED THEM. Compared with people who killed them and put slaveâ€™s bodies on display Lincoln was a gem of his time.
