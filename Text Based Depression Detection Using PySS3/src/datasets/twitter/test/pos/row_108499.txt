This is the end of my freedom Tomorrow Iâ€™m going to a psychiatric clinic for 2 months :( technically Iâ€™m going of my own freewill but if I didnâ€™t do that theyâ€™d force me to go :/ Iâ€™m absolutely terrified about leaving home, and meeting my new roommate. I hope sheâ€™s nice... I wonâ€™t be allowed on my phone a lot, and there will be a LOT of therapy. Just saying goodbye, you probably wonâ€™t see much on me around after tomorrow (except Iâ€™m allowed to go home at the weekends)
