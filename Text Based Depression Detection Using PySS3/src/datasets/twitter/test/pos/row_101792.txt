To people who are in 10th Grade, What subjects do you have? Can you choose your subject? Just askin.  


**We have:**  


English   
Math  
Chemistry   
Physics  
Biology  
Research  
(Home Language)  
P.E  
Music  
Health  
Computer Science  
Social Science  


  
And we cannot choose our subject. We have to take them all. It's literally hellish.   


Teachers are just Wow.   
For Example our Chemistry Teacher is a Real Chemical Engineer, our Computer Science Teacher is a Former 'Hacker' (But he doesn't teach hacking stuff because it's 'bad'), our Health Teacher is a Real Nurse, our Social Science Teacher is a Philosopher with degrees in History and Political Science. And etc.  


It's literally hell. Except for some subjects.  


We can only choose Some Subjects in 11th and 12th Grade.
