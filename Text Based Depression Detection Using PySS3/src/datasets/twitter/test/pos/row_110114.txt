Why are most teens so stupid tho uk u should prolly relax first cuz I might not even be talkin about you. I'm not even talking about the 14 and 15 year olds, their brains aren't even developed well. But the older teens? The kids at my school, on reddit, on every social media platform, jus dissapoint. messages all over have grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, and sometimes aren't even coherent. Like these dumb mfs don't even do nthing in school, because they're "depressed". shut ur lazy ass and see how much you have. "school is a scam"ðŸ’€. Then there are those with the strong ass opinions that make noo sense, and those with opinions that sound "right" but they can't even explain why they right. Not to mention everyone is anxious af too. all these self deprecating jokes and insecurities jus..maybe...

maybe they correlate to why u so dumb? like u dk how to have a conversation so you can't see why others think the way they do? this post was all over the place but im trynna share why the internet makes this generation of teens... ðŸ’€
