I hate this guy so much Heâ€™s been giving me hell since a young age and he treats everyone like theyâ€™re so inferior I bet he thinks he could be the equivalent to Superman (donâ€™t quote me on that).

Where to fucking begin. So this kid is just a grade A asshole. He treats everyone like shit and dear god, heâ€™s so goddamn annoying! Iâ€™ll admit Iâ€™m hated by a lot of people at my school (but those people I want nothing to do with so Iâ€™m good at this point). But this kid to even the people who I donâ€™t like, they hate him, more than me. This dude acts like heâ€™s the only perfect person on the campus and he tries to call people out (most notably me). He acts like everyone just has this flaw and that theyâ€™re a terrible person and heâ€™s the guardian angel but in reality he just makes things worse.

For example he tried to sell me something the other day and I originally said yes but then I back out (I will not clarify what he sold me it wasnâ€™t drugs or anything but I donâ€™t want him to find me (and backing out was a dick move on my part)). But then he just railed into me the other day and he banned me from a club and called me a terrible person and how Iâ€™m the worst person to ever grace the planet earth. At the end I wasnâ€™t even mad at what he said, Iâ€™ve been hurt so much by this piece of shit I donâ€™t feel anything anymore. And the club he banned me from (he was a high ranking person) and his words were â€œwe donâ€™t like dicks in our clubâ€ well if he doesnâ€™t like dicks in that club then he shouldnâ€™t be president. (Iâ€™ll bring up what he said later).

But this guy just doesnâ€™t know when to catch a break. Freshman year was by far the worst year of school Iâ€™ve had period. I was struggling with identity and was that cringy guy who was an edgy attention seeker, I made threats, I did stupid things. (and looking back on it A. Iâ€™ve come a long way, B. Iâ€™m so glad Iâ€™m not that person anymore, and C. Iâ€™m very embarrassed by it and nobodyâ€™s gonna let me forget it). I also lost my grandmother that year and my social life was a giant mess. But this fucker just doesnâ€™t let up, heâ€™s making fun of me, bullying me and I just wanted it to stop and he wouldnâ€™t stop. It was pure agony, I just begged and just wanted him to stop but he just wouldnâ€™t shut his fucking mouth.

So now where here back to what he sent me. He sent me a discord DM about how shitty of person I was and that I should feel ashamed of just existing. So my rebuttal was about 60% of this rant, I told him what was happening and how heâ€™s the root cause of it all (tbh he was). And he didnâ€™t believe a word of what I said, which led me to realize something: heâ€™s the fucking moron the entire time. He plays the person whoâ€™s enforcing all this hatred on people like itâ€™s his god given mission. And he doesnâ€™t realize thatâ€™s heâ€™s the problem. What I told him was genuinely true. I know drama, Iâ€™m a theater kid for crying out loud. And he was saying that everything I do is worthless (thatâ€™s how I interpreted it). 

And tbh Iâ€™m finally content with myself, Iâ€™ve accepted myself (kinda thereâ€™s one loose end). And Iâ€™m not going to let some piece of shit, sorry and embarrassing excuse of a human being out me down. I hope that satan has a seat with his name on it. I have a feeling this rant will fall on deaf ears and blind eyes but I owe it to myself to say this.
