I really need help I need help because I want to tell the guy I like that I love him, I'm not sure if he is gay/pan/bi, so I'm a little afraid of being rejected, I don't know what to do, because every now and then I say something like flirting with him, but I think he thinks that it is a joke, so, does anyone know what should I do? Rn he is my best friend, I don't know if I should tell him or not
