Should I call off Itâ€™s 3am, I work at 7am. I havenâ€™t slept. I have had on and off chest pain for the past 50 days, and they are aware of this at my job. Should I just call at 6 and say my chest hurts? (It doesnâ€™t actually hurt rn) Iâ€™m not sure if I want to because who are they gonna call in at 7am yknow
