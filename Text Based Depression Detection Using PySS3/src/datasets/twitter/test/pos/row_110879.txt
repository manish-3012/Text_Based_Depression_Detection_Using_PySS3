Gacha Rolls So I'm part of this discord server that has this thing where you can roll for anime and video game characters. Every hour I make sure to come back to get all of my rolls in. I feel as if it is slowly eating away at my soul. I have begun to measure time on when I can roll for my next waifu. Its to the point where I even organize my day on when I do my rolls. There's even a pokemon slot machine that you can roll every two hours. As I go on, day by day,  I will be consumed more and more by the gacha.
