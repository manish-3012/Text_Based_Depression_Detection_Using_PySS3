Having alters is... interesting I have three alters, pretty sure it's DID

2011? First is George (7 male) who I guess has been like a childhood friend in a way. Very childish, trouble maker, enjoys doing stupid stuff

Summer 2020: Then, Alex, (17 female) a new alter who I feel has helped me in a way, she cares a lot about people and tends to fight my cutting habit

Summer 2020: And Shadow, also a new alter (17? male). A dark person, pro hacker, like hurting others, likes darkness and gangs

I feel in a way like Alex and Shadow are brother and sister...

All this is really confusing tbh
