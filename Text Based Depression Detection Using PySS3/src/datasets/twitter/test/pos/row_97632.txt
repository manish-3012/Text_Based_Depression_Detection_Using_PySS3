How's your year so far? So how's your year? Mine is very crappy as well, i mean 2 hard disks with all my homework files lay dead on my shelf, plus i feel online classes emotionally drain you sometimes. My family's in debt and we don't even know if we'll be able to keep the house we literally bought and lived in within the year. I'm hardly learning anything from online classes and i feel so disorganized. How's your experience this year?
