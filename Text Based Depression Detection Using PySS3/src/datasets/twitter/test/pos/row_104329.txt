Itâ€™s been an hour since I made a post trying to help people solve their problems, and I feel like Iâ€™ve achieved something. Yes, it only got 3 upv*tes, but thatâ€™s not what Iâ€™m after. I wanted to help people, and I did. I feel good about myself and I think Iâ€™ll be doing this more often in the future. 

My DMs are open, and you can reply to my last post if you have any problems, but donâ€™t expect me to reply now, cause Iâ€™m gonna get some schoolwork done after procrastinating a bit more.
