I think I'm becoming alt-right I might get banned for this , but I don't have anyone else to talk to about it. My only friends are some people I met online and they all have very strong right wing views. I've always been right wing but their views go beyond what I (used to) think. Lately they've been sending me videos and essays about stuff and it's opened my eyes; I agree with a lot of it. 

It is kind of changing the way I think. I'm not really sure what to think anymore so I thought I'd talk to you guys about it. Feel free to discuss or ask questions in the comments. You can also message me if you want.
