Iâ€™m so rude ðŸ‘ I got off my phone right after sending someone a message and didnâ€™t think about it. I was going to take a little break and just read and draw and take a nap (it was really boring I hated it but itâ€™s whatever)

I forgot that the person I messaged kinda thinks nobody cares for them and I went ahead and ignored them for three hours. Now I feel terrible about it because I knew that. I just hadnâ€™t thought about it.
