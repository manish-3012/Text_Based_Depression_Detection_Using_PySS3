My friend decided to quit school and now he doesn't reply to any messages or call I don't hear anything from him for the past 5 days, he basically disappeared. He won't go to school and he stopped hang out with us. Texting or call him is useless. I don't know what to do maybe he fell into depression. Am really not good in this stuff i feel uncomfortable every time that i try to cheer up someone am really the worst when it comes to emotional support but i still want to let it know that we are still here for him. We thought about ring at jis door but i don't know if it's a good idea. Maybe we should try to speak with his mother to undestand the situation.
