Iâ€™m in a tough spot For a little while now, Iâ€™ve been talking to this girl I met through a friend of mine, and weâ€™ve gotten kind of close, and I really want her to be my gf. However, at the same time, another one of my friends has also gotten close to her, and I know for a fact sheâ€™s more interested in him, but I donâ€™t think heâ€™s as interested as her as she is. The thing is, if I tell my friend how I feel he would happily back off and let me try and date her, however she vented to both of us last night that she has anxiety issues and depression issues, and my friend seemed to relate to her more, and I feel like if he backs off for me then sheâ€™ll be sad, which is not what I want.     
The thing is, something like this has happened to me twice (different friend and girl), and the first time I did nothing.
