I love my mom ðŸ¥° I just got a date for the first time in like 3 years and my mom is totally supportive of me. 

I know itâ€™s hard for her to be the way she is, her father was a violent alcoholic and her mom was manic depressive or whatever but she doesnâ€™t let that affect her. 

I know a lot of you are going through a lot with your parents rn with the whole pandemic and lockdowns, but try to look forward and see how you will be with your kids.
