Please read Hello, just recently, there was an extremely triggering live video on tiktok (or some people have said it was initially on Facebook and reposted onto tiktok). I ask that if you see a video showing a Caucasian bearded man with glasses that you do not watch it. I'm not trying to create random fear and panic. This video could very well be fake, however, real or not, it is very graphic and can be damaging. I thought this subreddit would be the best place to get the warning out quickly. If this is against community rules, mods feel free to take it down and/or if you would like more detail on the issue, please let me know. Information regarding this just came out on Twitter and I just wanted to let everyone know to be careful as soon as I could. The content of the video is serious so I hope no one jokes about it or says smth like "the things people do for likes" ðŸ˜’. If you don't care, please move on.
