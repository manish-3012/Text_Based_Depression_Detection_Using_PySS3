Question for the other artists out there Anyone else like to look back at their old pieces to cringe/see how much they've grown? But, then there's also the ones where you're really proud of them no matter how much time has passed and that you can spot everything that you can improve on the piece. I'm obviously not the only one who does this with my drawings.
