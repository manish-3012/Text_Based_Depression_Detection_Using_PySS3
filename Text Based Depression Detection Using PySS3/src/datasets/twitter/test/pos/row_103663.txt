I feel completely alone Yesterday I found out that my dad has cancer and I realized that I dont have any friends to talk about serious stuff with. I mean i have friends that i joke and play games with but we dont really talk. I have only one person that I can vent to and it's my therapist who i see every other week. I'm just incredibly lonely and I'm really stressed out from my dad's cancer. Idk i figured i might as well vent to the internet cause i dont have anyone else to.
