some shitty lore for something I decided to make A long long time ago, well, technically in the 1980s, music culture had become a rising trend, with that trend, 8 beings came into existence, the blacklights, they came in many colors but were all beings based purely on the power of music. No mortal human could see the blacklights, they partied at clubs and sometimes pulled pranks on the humans. But as time passed, the 8 blacklights chose the types of music they liked, they had very specific tastes, and by the passing of the millennium, they had formed colors, blacklight pink, blacklight orange, blacklight blue, blacklight purple, blacklight red, blacklight yellow, blacklight pastel, and blacklight green. one day, all the blacklights aside from green found 7 young women, most of them were around 12 years old, they decided these girls would be the first to learn about the beings. the girls and the blacklights got along well, but blacklight purple decided to have much more sinister intentions and rather than easing into a symbiotic relationship, blacklight purple forced their human into a parasitic relationship, using the girl to have a mortal body rather than to assist the girl like the other blacklights did.

in their pure form, the blacklights are humanoid creatures that have neon lights for outlines, they do not have many unique features aside from all of them having a skull mask. when the girls are united with the blacklights, they wear clothes that have neon lights lining them, sometimes with gloves, and they all also wear masks of the blacklight's color, except with decorations, for an example, blacklight Orange's human host has an orange hair bow, so their united form's skull mask has an orange hair bow.

I am planning on making playlists based on each blacklight's music taste
