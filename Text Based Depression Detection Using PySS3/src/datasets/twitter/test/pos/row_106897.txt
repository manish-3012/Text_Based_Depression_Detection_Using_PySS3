Is it wholesome if I stayed up until 12 am to wish my (new) friend happy birthday? We only know each other for a few months but they have been a really nice friend and they made me feel comfortable and likeable which is something i've never felt in a long time

but unfortunately due to some shit that happened between some other friends from my past, i tend to overthink the small things i do for them (such as this one) and think they might not like it or something, lmao
