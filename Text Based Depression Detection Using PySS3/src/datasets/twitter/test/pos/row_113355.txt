Questions for the boys Aight Iâ€™m dummy simping for this fella, and I need to know if he likes me back. We text basically everyday, and sometimes heâ€™ll text me multiple times in a day. We send cat photos (actual pics of our cats ya filthy animals) to each other, and have this unwritten rule that if one person sends a cat pic then the other person has to send one. We see each other sometimes during the school day, and have a class together. About 70% of the time when I look at him, heâ€™s looking at me too. Maybe thatâ€™s coincidence? Seems so but I like to think not. We talk about politics, music, and just anything in general. Once we ended up texting for a full hour, and I hadnâ€™t even noticed. The other day in a text conversation he kept calling me short while I tried to explain that Iâ€™m not short. Idk why but him calling me short was really cute. We have good discussions, and I really like his personality and just everything about him. We agree on some things, and when we donâ€™t agree on things heâ€™s not mean about it. What do you people think? Does he feel romantically about me?? This is such a pathetic post but man I want to marry this kid, I cannot stop thinking about him. Any advice please and thank you â˜ºï¸
