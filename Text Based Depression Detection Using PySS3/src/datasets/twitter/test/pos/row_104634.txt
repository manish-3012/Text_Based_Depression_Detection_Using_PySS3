How can I be a good friend to an LGBT? Iâ€™ve recently become friends with this guy who is gay, Iâ€™ve never had a gay friend before. Heâ€™s really funny and stuff but Iâ€™m scared to say something wrong and make him hate me. Iâ€™m a conservative male so I donâ€™t know many gay people personally. Any of you LGBT+ or ally folks wanna give be some advice so I can be a good friend?
