Just a question who would win in a fight(my characters i made vs goku) Dasher:runs at the speed of light

Fire powers, like fire balls

Fire blast, creating circles of fire to spread throughout the city

A ultimate form in which Dasher can shoot multiple shots at once

Bullet: ice powers like a ice ball

Ice age, freezing everything in a certain radius 

Speed of sound, but can run faster to keep up with Dasher

V.s.

Goku
