Capital punishment is wrong I could talk about how itâ€™s wrong to kill people regardless of circumstances as long as there not actively trying to harm others in that moment (it is) but Iâ€™m not going to because I thought of another reason. A lot of people who commit murder have a mental illness like psychosis thatâ€™s compelling them to do that and I hope we can all agree that we shouldnâ€™t kill people who are killing people not because they want to but because voice in there head are competing them to and only stops when they do it, we should help them not kill them, Iâ€™m not saying there innocent, Iâ€™m just saying it was kinda out of there control
