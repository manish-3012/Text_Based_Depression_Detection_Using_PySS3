Iâ€™ve just been really fucking stressed end everythingâ€™s been fucked I just want to let out some of my thoughts and just talk Ever since winter break ended everything for meâ€™s been going down hill (or even farther down hill). Before winter break even ended I got several school assignments graded poorly. That made me want to work even harder but now i just feel like Iâ€™ve been failing really hard. Today some decisions I made a while ago came to bite me in the ass and now I canâ€™t sleep because all the shit on my mind. I actually canâ€™t remember the last time I had a good night sleep. I keep on telling me itâ€™s all gonna be ok but if I donâ€™t shape up soon this could affect my entire life. After all this Iâ€™ve been doing some reflecting and Iâ€™ve realized how alone I am. Iâ€™ve always know this and Iâ€™ve always passed it off as jokes so what not but Iâ€™m really alone. I have 3 good friends and 2 of them I only get to hang out with over Xbox. The 3rd one I havenâ€™t seen for like a month because of virtual school even though we still talk a lot over discord. Iâ€™m really getting worried about my social life because Iâ€™m 15 and donâ€™t have any real close ties and I wonâ€™t even start on talking to girls cuz Iâ€™m completely hopeless especially because my greatest skill is bottling up my emotions. I think my bottling of emotions comes from me dealing with my mom. Sheâ€™s got a lot of her own shit but basically whenever she gets really mad at me, my brother or dad she just really tries to hurt us. Like REALLY hurt us. Iâ€™m the only one in the family who she doesnâ€™t know anything about and Iâ€™m aware that that protects me so I donâ€™t tell anyone anything. I also fell really bad about this but I absolutely hate my brother and I canâ€™t deny it anymore even though I know how unfair it is to him. Heâ€™s never done anything wrong but the fact that heâ€™s naturally stronger, has a promised future, has plenty of friends and can do basically anything I can do but better just makes me of course super jealous even though heâ€™s barely done anything to deserve me hating him. On top of all these things Iâ€™ve been having essential crisisâ€™. The stress, hatred and sadness have left me wanting to just end it all and give up but I think the only thing keeping me from doing so is that Iâ€™m too scared of whatâ€™s beyond. Also the fact that Iâ€™m aware of all these things makes me think I can and should be able to better myself, but I just canâ€™t and that makes me hate myself even more. This is the first time in my life Iâ€™ve felt totally helpless and this seems to be the only place I can turn to. Thanks to anyone who read this far.
