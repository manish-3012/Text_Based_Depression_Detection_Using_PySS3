Holy Moly, What even is online class!? So I'm in Drama class and my teacher is talking about camera angles, sets and all of that stuff, so she asks "What shows are you watching right now?" to relate it to what we are watching and make a comparison and I shit you not, one of the drop kicks (dickheads) in the class just blurts out "Brazzers" and everyone went silent. The teacher just stutters, after like 20 seconds she asks the kid to stay in after class and continues teaching.
