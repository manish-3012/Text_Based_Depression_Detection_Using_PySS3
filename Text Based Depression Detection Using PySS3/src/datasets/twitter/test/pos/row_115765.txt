Something that girls might not know about us When we have problems with each other, we'll full on fight and then move on. I don't mean just pushing and arguing, I mean fighting. Not all boys do this but its not all that uncommon. It's sorta a way of settling an argument but in a way that will likely cause future habits that can get some men into lots of trouble later in life. It's not healthy at all but we still do it. Young boys can still rib each other and rough house, but as they get older they need to learn that you can't settle arguments with your girlfriend the same way you settle arguments with your homies. Anyways thanks for coming to my Ted talk
