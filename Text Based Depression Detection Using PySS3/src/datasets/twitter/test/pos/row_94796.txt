AITA for telling my wife (34F) that reddit agrees with me (37M) So i made a post on r/AmITheAsshole about a fight we had, telling many intimate details of our lives and painting myself as the perfect husband (which i obviously am) 

After I had so many redditors tell me I'm completely in the right, I decided to show her the post to rub it in her face how im a better person and she's obviously stupid and in the wrong

Now she's mad at me?! I mean what'd i do wrong? All i did was win! 

Anyway, give me validation that if i dont tell the whole story then i am always in thw right
