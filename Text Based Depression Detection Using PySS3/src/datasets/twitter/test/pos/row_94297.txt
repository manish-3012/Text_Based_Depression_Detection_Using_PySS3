I made this petition because my mom works at American Airlines as a customer service agent and she has to stand for 10 hours a day it really puts a strain on her. Her coworkers have to stand for a long period of time as well. The petition is pretty much just asking that American Airlines give them chairs. Thanks for reading ðŸ™ðŸ½ and please share with your friends
