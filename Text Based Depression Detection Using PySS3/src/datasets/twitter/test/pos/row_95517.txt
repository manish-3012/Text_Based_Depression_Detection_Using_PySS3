Does saying "do you want to..." sound demanding? i'm asking a friend if they want to play this game for the very first time together with me and i said, "do you want to play * game's name*?"

I feel like it's demanding and maybe I should have gone for "are you free to play * game's name*?" but damn i don't know

or am I just overthinking again?
