well hereâ€™s some helpful advice from an ex ugly chonky boi. 



Play a sport in Highschool



I can not tell you how good this is for you, you make so many friends, people like you more, and you get fit. Which are all things girls/guys love. If you suck at sports thatâ€™s alright, there are many many no cut sports most HS offer. 

I was big so I tried out for the football team even though Iâ€™ve never played before and because it was no cut was able to get a lot better and even make a spot on the jv team this year. 

My friend also sucked at sports but he decided to try out for the swim team (a lot of schools have these even if they donâ€™t have a pool) and he loves it even though heâ€™s the second slowest on the team. Swimming is great if you donâ€™t like competition, because the only person your trying to beat is yourself, itâ€™s great for you kids who arenâ€™t big on competing. 

If you donâ€™t want to play sports or you just hate them thatâ€™s alright. I donâ€™t want to tell you what to do. But especially with Covid we all need something to do, and getting in the weight room is a great way to pass time and stay healthy. 

Hope yâ€™all have a wonderful day and stay safe out there. 


P.S. Ik that a lot of schools are closed due to Covid, but they wonâ€™t be closed forever, you can use this time to start working on a sport by yourself so you donâ€™t walk in on the first day and have no idea what you are doing.
