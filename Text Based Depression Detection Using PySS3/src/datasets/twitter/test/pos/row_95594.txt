Pancakes are better than waffles you lackeys Pancakes are the perfect desert breakfast item. You just need a pan and some syrup and you got pancakes. Not to mention all the delicious stuff you can put in them. Chocolate chips, bananas, blueberries, almost anything! You can also use oil to crisp the edges to make them nice and crispy on the outer rim and soft on the inside. What can you do with waffles? Put them in a machine and then spill the mix because you put too much in and then wipe the machine while simultaneously burning your hand because you forgot the outside was too hot.
