Anyone else have my problem? I have never had a real crush, itâ€™s only ever been fictional guys, thereâ€™s been two real guys but they were both long distance so I never knew them, only over the internet. I have never ever had a crush on a real boy in my whole life. And itâ€™s not like I just donâ€™t get crushes, the fictional guys I like are like, reallyyyyyy big, and imo kinda weirdly big, like, comfort characters and character crushes in one. Iâ€™ve had boyfriends, irl, but I really only dated them because they were nice and fairly attractive but not really crushes, I judged dated them because I had no real reason not to and they asked me out. 
Anyone else have this issue?
