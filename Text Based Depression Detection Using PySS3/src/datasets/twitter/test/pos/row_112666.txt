Is it normal for a parent to never say sorry? I grew up in a normal household, with the usual hiccups. But my mum has never in all my 19 years of life said sorry to me. 
The topic came up in class, we were talking about the different types of abuse in a household and the teacher said parents not saying sorry can be considered a sort of mental abuse. 
I thought it was normal though. On some occasions Iâ€™ve begged my mum to take back some things she said (such as: â€œyour dad is right, you are the most horrible person in the worldâ€ followed then by a slap in the face). Sheâ€™s always stood her ground, never taking back her actions and words. 
But this is normal, right?
