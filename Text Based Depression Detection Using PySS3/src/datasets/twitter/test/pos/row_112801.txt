Restore the Republic, get a Silver. It would be a shared oligarchy, governed by offices of varying degrees of power by Leaders nomimated by the population. Select members of r/teenagers would form the Senate, who would be in charge of writing and passing laws. 3 consuls would hold the highest office in all of the Subreddit, with the power to make major decisions for this Republic, each holding the power to veto the other consuls in order to maintain the balance of power. Oh and the Senators get to write their own constitution.

Silver award to whoever volunteers to be the founder of a hypothetical government inspired by the ideals of the Roman Republic. You'll be in charge of:

1.Inviting and/or recruiting citizens.

2. Organising the creation of our constitution(heavily influenced by our citizens) 

3. The appointing of political offices, the creation of the Senate and nominating the Consuls. 

4. Making laws(whatever you want, must get input from population and approval of the Senate) 

5. Finding a cool name for whatever this is. 

6. Other stuff associated with running this. 

We on behalf of (insert name here) thank you in advance for your service to our great society.

Edit: The award expires in 22 hours. I'll give it to a random when I wake up when this dies in new.
