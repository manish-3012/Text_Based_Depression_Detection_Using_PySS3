I don't want to sound entitled, but I become really sad when I spend hours and hours trying to make a fun video and it gets 4 views. No sneaky self advertising here by me. I just needed a place to vent a bit.

I make gaming and cooking video's on my YouTube channel. I play  games like From the depths and War thunder. I record something and then edit it into, if I say so myself, a enjoyable video. Some of them take at least 12 hours to make. It just makes me sad to see absolutely no growth.

The reason I made my channel is because I like making video's. I don't do it for the fame or money. But it would be nice to grow a bit and get a little bit more views and subs (currently 45 which are mostly my moms friends). Does anyone have some advice on how to grow?
