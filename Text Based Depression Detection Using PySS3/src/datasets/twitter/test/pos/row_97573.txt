Fireworks chocolate or whatever There exists this mini egg chocolate in Sweden(maybe not only) but when you eat it.

It starts popping in your mouth and like 5 minutes after swallowing it. It's so uncomfortable cause it gets worse when you swallow and open your mouth. You can feel the popping all the way up to your Brain it feels like.

I hate it
