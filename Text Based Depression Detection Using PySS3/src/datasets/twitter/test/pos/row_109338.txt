Please stop telling guys to stop mansplaining and manspreading they are stupid sexist terms to give feminazis an excuse to mistreat men Seriously just because you don't like the fact we exist does not mean you can be assholes to us, its true that women have been through oppression but its not OUR GENERATION'S FAULT those were our ancestors that did that and our generation is not like those people, so stop coming up with new "problems" like "mansplaining" and "manspreading"


Oh yeah about manspreading, we have this thing called a "penis" which is the most sensitive part of our bodies, now if you would just ask us to move our legs in instead of making a big deal about it that would be fine but there are people POURING FUCKING BLEACH ON OUR DICKS BECAUSE THEY APPARENTLY DON'T KNOW HOW TO ASK POLITELY.

I've just had enough of this shit, thanks for listening to my rant
