PSA: Be mindful of what you put on your school accounts. It is NOT private. The Admins in charge of the account can see your chats, your google docs, your emails, all of it. I work for a company that scans through kid's accounts which some school districts use to offload the work. I see a frankly shocking amount of people that don't seem to know they're being watched. I decided to remedy that, at least in some small way.

So here's the deal. **If you have a school Google account, and use it for shit other than school, stop.**

Unless you want your private life combed through by strangers you dont know, keep all your private things (chats, fanfiction, family photos, etc) on a different account. Same story if you have a school Office 365 account. Do not log into ANYTHING non-school related with your school Google account, either. Don't buy anything through it, don't watch youtube videos on it, just don't touch it outside of assignments or mandatory use. **ALL of your activity on that account is subject to review by anyone with access.** 

This is doubly important If you're doing something the school board won't approve of; vaping, sexual intimacy, knife fighting with the bois, whatever. If you post anything related to that on your school account, it WILL get flagged, and you could wind up in a very uncomfortable conversation with your counselor (or worse). Please, just be careful what you put on your school accounts. I see a *lot* of fanfiction or intimate chat conversations that were never intended to see the light of day, and certainly not on these terms. You all deserve privacy. Take a few minutes and make sure you have it.
