How do you make Minecraft fun? So I'm not a huge fan of Minecraft because I played it waaaaay too much when I was younger, and I find it boring. I'm not saying it's a bad game, just that I find it boring. I've tried servers and mods but they just don't grab my attention. I love open world survival games and Minecraft is just that but I just can't play it. Does anyone know how to make it fun?
