OPERATION TRIUNE MC      Because of the fact that dream stans and people with subtropical room temperature iq voted overwhelmingly for a fucking squid that glows, it won the mob vote. But we need justice, we can't just let that slide like that. 
     So that's where **OPERATION** **TRIUNE** **MC** comes in: the objective is to make it so that *all* *3* *of* *the* *mobs*, not only the glowsquid, get added eventually in the game (even if it has to be in later updates). 
     How? By spreading the message. Why? Because the more people that are in favour of this idea, the easier it is for the mojang devs to notice it and, most importantly, to take it... seriously? Idk but at least so that they might decide to do it.

Yea basically that's it
