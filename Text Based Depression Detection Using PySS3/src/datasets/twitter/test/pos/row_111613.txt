I have a question for everyone who grew up and lives in a mountainous region For all my life, I've lived in places where you can clearly see mountains all around, or at least big hills.

I've been on big big plains only a few times, and I don't know why, but having a flat horizon 360 degrees all around just makes me really uneasy, it gives me a weird anxiety, it's pretty strange.

Even weirder is that I don't get that sensation with the sea, whenever I'm at a beach even if I can only see water I feel ok with it. 

Anyone else has similar experiences?
