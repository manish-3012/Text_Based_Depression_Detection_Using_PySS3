I simply cannot wait to get cosmetic surgery 
Iâ€™ve tried all the indoctrination about loving yourself at every size, every shape, but all of those words ricochet off the walls of my brain, never really sticking anywhere. 


God really said, âœ¨flat everywhereâœ¨ and âœ¨0 hipsâœ¨ except for my rib cage which sticks out like a kid who forgot it was pajama day at elementary school, making me look fat if I gain so much as one pound. Seeing people my age on tiktok with the perfect petite figure has decimated my self esteem even more, and as I roam the halls of my high school I see people with the exact same figure, and you canâ€™t exactly photoshop real life, so it makes it feel like that goal is so far yet so close.  


Iâ€™ve received â€œpositiveâ€ comments on my figure by creepy ass old dudes at my dads workplace, and I could have done without them to be honest. It hurt my self esteem even more. 


For five years I have been keeping a checklist of cosmetic procedures Iâ€™d like to do once Iâ€™m of age and have the finances, and the list has only grown since itâ€™s conception. 


It feels pathetically superficial but it even weighs on my mind as I do my school work like damn homie lemme do these differential equations without worrying that I donâ€™t have anime tiddies tf? Punk ass brain I swear


(Oh yeah if you couldnâ€™t already tell I have body dysmorphia~)


Rant over my dudes, I hope you all have a wonderful day
