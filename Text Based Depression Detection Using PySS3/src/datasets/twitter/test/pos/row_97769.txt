Well boys, I have a new one for you. I happen to play Call Of Duty pretty much daily. I have been in my clan ever since the game came out. Now the leader of said clan (letâ€™s just call her Girl) happens to have an attractive voice, amazing personality and in fact actually cares about me and everyone else. We have been friends for months, talking everyday about what bothers us. Last night, we were in a private lobby when all of a sudden she mumbled under her breath, â€˜We should dateâ€™. When I asked her what she said, she said, â€˜Oh nothing I had to coughâ€™. Iâ€™m gonna ask her out boys. Thank you for reading this, I am having trouble writing it because Iâ€™m too happy but AHHHH.
