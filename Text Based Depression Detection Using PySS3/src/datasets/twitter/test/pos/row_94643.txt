whats better gonna delete this post later, i need help

first is that I don't care about anyone's feelings or how they think about me, which has led me to enjoy hurting other people (physically, mentally) and i have no guilt. i'll do what i want and it doesn't matter if it's immoral, i'll just execute everything in a way that it won't cause significant damage to me or my life

or should I hate everything about my self, acknowledge all the stuff I've done and have been doing, be depressed, isolate myself, hurt myself. regret waking up and feel tired all the time, wait for the day to end every day.

Those are the only 2 options I have, there's no such thing as an alternative for me. I'm already a terrible person, I can never change that but I won't hurt people closest to me, so I will never have kids or have a partner, not that I can anyway. please help
