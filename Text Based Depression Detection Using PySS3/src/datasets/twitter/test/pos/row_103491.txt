Am I a Redditor if I only come here like once or twice a week Like, what're the bounds of belonging to a people

I made a Tumblr account last year, never touched it since, therefore I am not a Tumblr user (idek the word)

But I haven't touched Reddit in like a week and a half, am I part of the Reddit community even though all this time has passed

Not tryna be serious or whatever but I was thinkin' about it earlier
