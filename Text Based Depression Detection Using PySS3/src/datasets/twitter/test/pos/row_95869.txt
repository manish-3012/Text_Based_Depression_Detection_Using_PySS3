I feel bad I got a 35 on the ACT At first I was really excited because I know it's a good score but after thinking about it a little more I just feel like standardized testing is so unfair to people. I didn't study at all for this test, and my peers are working their assets off. They got good scores yeah, but I feel like they deserve this more than I do. Also, I have no drive at all. I have no idea what I want to do in college or where I want to go. I may have good grades and good scores but I don't have anything else to put on my resume and applications. I haven't put any effort into being a leader or any passion projects. I also have no good work habits, I feel super unprepared for life and college. Basically all I have going for me is good academics, which makes me fee super pressured to go to a high level university, but I just want an easy life with an easy job. I guess I should ask, do you guys have any recommendations for how to use good test scores? Like are there any scholarships I should do? I feel like I could waste a lot of potential money by being lazy in my senior year.
