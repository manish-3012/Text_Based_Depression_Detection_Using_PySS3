i don't want to go to school anymore. it's not that school itself is bad, no no, it's actually pretty cool.

my problem lies within my classmates. they are a bunch of cunts.

we have: lukas 1 and 2. (2 currently is sick or something) 1 ais the most hate-filles person i've ever met. he bullies me, does that hole thing with his hands and if you look into that thing he'll punch you *really* fuckin hard. we have timurs, (it's pronounced timur.) who is his buddy, and this. fucking. guy. he is pretty bad too. then we have ruslan, who is best friends with timurs, who is just worse than timurs. IN ADDITION, we have julia. who is just a bad personall around, but only if she is 'activated' (basically she is neutral/passive)

i think lukas 1 is the worst of the bunch. he also spamms the group chat with stickers of my face (from a class photo where i made dumn faces on purpose) and hebullies me for it. also, if i ever say onthing about a conversational topic, lukas 1 or adrian (who is slightly better than julia. he is my semi-friend) just goes 'who asked you? **NOBODY.'** which i find to be extremely hostile.

the teachers do something about it every green moon and even if they do, it doesn't help at all. maybe just in that one lesson. some other passive classmates like julia include mia, annalena (although she is somewhat cool with me. just still hostile towards others) and some others. like about half of my class.

i honestly am thinking about skipping school or saving up for pepper spray/a tazer. (although probably more the pepper spray than a tazer.)
