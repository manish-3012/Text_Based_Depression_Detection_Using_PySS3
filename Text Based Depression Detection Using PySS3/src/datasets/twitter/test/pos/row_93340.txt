Iâ€™M SO HAPPY! I NEED A PLACE TO SHARE THIS BADLY So last night my EP â€œHead in the Cloudsâ€ dropped and oh my lord the support from my friends and family is so amazing. I literally was at a loss for words and was even brought so close to tears, it honestly is amazing. Itâ€™s crazy thinking back on how a couple months back I wasnâ€™t even going to attempt making music. All it took was bad mental health and a crazy heartbreak for me to start lmao but in all seriousness I never couldâ€™ve imagined myself doing this. It truly is outside of my comfort zone, and Iâ€™m all about stepping outside of it. 

I also wanted to take the time to let you guys know that mental health really is important. Having been in an extremely dark place due to numerous reasons in my personal life, I can gladly say that Iâ€™m getting better with time. You just need to have some faith and realize that itâ€™s not always going to be as bad as it seems. Tough times donâ€™t last, tough people do. 

Please donâ€™t be afraid to reach out to someone for help. For me I asked my parents about therapy and although they were unsure at first they helped me go. Iâ€™ve also gone to my friends and other family members as well. I promise that YOU ARE NOT ALONE! YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, YOU ARE WONDERFUL, YOU ARE SO WORTH IT AND OH SO AMAZING! I mean that with every bone in my body. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this :) I hope yâ€™all have a wonderful day.
