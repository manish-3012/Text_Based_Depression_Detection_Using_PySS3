Today we played Kahoot in class And the teacher said "I'm glad I don't have to deal with stupid nicknames, because you're 12 graders and you're mature"

Upon hearing it, I had to do it, I had to spite her. So this girl entered as Mike Oxlong.

The joke was bad since I don't live in an English speaking country, so I had to reveal it was me just to explain the joke.
