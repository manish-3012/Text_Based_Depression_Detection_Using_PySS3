I had a strange dream So I had a very strange dream one night. Some of you peeps will read this and say "Jesus what did this guy smoke before he slept?" And i get that alot. But ima tell it anyways  


So I wake up in a forest, wondering where I was. Then out of nowhere I hear callmecarson with a megaphone announcing that he was hosting a battle royale in the forest i was in. The contestants were(hear me out) characters from cartoons and games and some kids from my childhood school who were suddenly grown ups.  


The only thing i remembered from that dream was when I was feeling scared and alone walking through the acres of trees with a sniper rifle with no scope in my hands, then in the distance I see a watchtower made of stone(the tower looked similar to those watch towers in apex legends, specifically the kings canyon map) and I See luigi standing on the tower doing his popular pose.(remember when i said that there were characters from games as contestants?) I cautiously walked up to him and thought, "wait, maybe this is a decoy" Then i hear a bullet hit the floor next to me, so i took cover and saw that mario was trying to snipe me, luckily he was a terrible aim and I shot him instead. Then i walked to luigi and tried to do that finishing move Kreuger does in warzone.  


The last thing i remember from the dream was when I was fighting the last person alive, I ran out of bullets, couldn't find any weapons, and the only thing I had was a screwdriver. The person i was fighting was a person from my old school, he tried to put a knife in my chest so I quickly shoved my screwdriver up his throat. Then carson went up to me and was like "Yooo, you just shoved that nail hammer down his throat, that was awesome!!!" Then i looked at him weird and was like "Yeaah, a hammer... What the hell just happened?"  


I then woke up in real life, and I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth, and found a screwdriver in the sink. I Don't know HOW that got there, but I just grabbed it and put it next to my tv as an accomplishment for winning carson's battle royale.
