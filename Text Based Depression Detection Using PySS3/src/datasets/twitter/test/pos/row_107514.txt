Is this normal for siblings? Ok my whole life me and my brother have had this relationship where we get along, fight some times. Normal sibling things. But whatâ€™s weird is that he will punch, kick and pull me down. Now Iâ€™m not sure if punching is normal for siblings during verbal fights. Is this abuse or is this normal?
