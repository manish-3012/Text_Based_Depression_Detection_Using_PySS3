Alright, this is an idea for people who are (or having the urge to) cutting themselves I donâ€™t know if it will help or not, but just try it!
I have cut myself one time and it became a â€œdrugâ€. I did it for 5 months when I felt like cutting. It just felt satisfying. But then, I learned that instead of cutting myself, I could draw on my arm. And believe me, it worked. I stopped cutting my arm, and when I did, it wasnâ€™t so satisfying anymore. So, for the people cutting themselves, try drawing instead. :)
