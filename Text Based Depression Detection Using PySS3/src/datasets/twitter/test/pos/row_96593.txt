Message to guys beginning to get into exercise and lifting: do not lift for women. No amount of exercise will make you substantially better with women (but you should do it anyway) 1. Being ripped doesn't matter with women as we as a society wear clothes. A tall man with broad shoulders who is weak and untrained will look stronger in clothes than a trained person with less favorable features.

2. The primary attributes that lead to attraction (height, frame, facial features such as jaw, eyes etc.) cannot be changes through exercise. There is no gym for your face, there is no lift to increase your height. (Being fat is different, fat can hide features like a sharp jawline etc. If you are fat become not fat ASAP)

But here is why you should work out hard anyway

1. Maintaining physical fitness is great for your health. You will have more energy, more strength, and it will add years to your life. Your only regret will be not getting into it earlier.

2. Possessing physical strength can give you more confidence and earn you the respect of fellow men. It can also obviously make you better at sports if you play one. It's also just fun to surprise people with strength. I once beat one of my older brother's friends, who had wicked bigger arms than me, at arm wrestling and it is still talked about.

Strength is good and you should have it. But don't expect women to come after you. This mindset will lead to discouragement.
