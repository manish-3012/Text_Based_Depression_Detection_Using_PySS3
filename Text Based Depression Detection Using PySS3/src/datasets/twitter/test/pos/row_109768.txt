Plssss advice or some shit needed. So,there is this girl in my friend group,she is nice and frankly quite hot,lately I find that she obviously tries to stand or sit next to me, and we were talking about something and she said that she wants to make her ex Jealous,so she said that if she randomly walks up to me and hugs me or something that I should play along. Is she low key shooting signs or something?
