STOP TELLING ME TO GET THERAPY You people are delusional. Yeah what I'm doing is kinda stalkerish, but I'm not hurting anybody. Liking someone and doing things a little differently doesn't mean I'm some crazy kid that needs therapy.

Therapy isn't even good for you. It's also really pathetic. You're paying someone to listen to your problems because nobody else wants to hear you speak. These people only want your money. I'd be extremely embarrassed if I had to talk about payment methods or whatever bs just so I can talk to another person. You're a weak victim of the system. 

Do you truly think they're sitting there listening to your problems? They're thinking about what they're gonna make for dinner or they're thinking about how you look. As soon as you leave they probably laugh at your pathetic ramblings. 

Here's what I learned from being alive:

NOBODY wants to hear your problems. They only want to make assumptions about who you are. I asked for advice of getting a GF and everyone just assumed that I was a horrible person that doesn't take care of their body. 

I'm not crazy. I'm sane and I see what you people are trying to do to me. You people don't give a shit. You people want me to be sad
