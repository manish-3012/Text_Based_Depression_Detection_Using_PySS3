How do I get more female friends? Iâ€™m not trying to simp, Iâ€™m just lonely and I happen to be a guy that gets along better with ladies and would like to start new real-world friendships with the potential for evolution.

So of course thereâ€™s school. However, due to the fact that said school is rather small and all the girls there I get along with are either lesbians (nothing wrong with that), hillbillies, or religious nutjobs. So Iâ€™m screwed there.

Letâ€™s seeâ€¦oh! Iâ€™ve got a few hobbies, those could help! Actually, no, it wouldnâ€™t. In addition to being in the middle of a global pandemic, girls playing Warhammer 40k is heresy /s. I donâ€™t know anyone else, male, female, or other, whoâ€™s endlessly fascinated by anatomy and physiology or is into writing.

In conclusion, I feel like a jerk for complaining about this. What the heck do I do?
