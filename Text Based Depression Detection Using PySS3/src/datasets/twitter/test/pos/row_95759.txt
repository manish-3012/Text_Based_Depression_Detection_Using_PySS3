There is a high chance that Elon Musk is the person behind Cicada 3301. If you don't know about cicada 3301 then here's an explanation-
It's some sort of organization that created internet's biggest puzzle. They posted a picture on 4chan in 2012 introducing themselves to the world and saying that there was a hidden code in the picture. It led to an imgur which led to a book which led to a phone number which led to a website with a countdown. After the countdown ended the site was updated and gave GPS coordinates where posters with their symbols and some sort of code was found which led to a reddit page or a Twitter account I don't remember correctly but shit like that again went online again in 2014 and in 2016. People have even made vlogs finding those posters.

Well back to what I was saying. Elon Musk is probably the person behind this because he has the money, power and reach to organize this. And he is also crazy enough to pull off shit like this.
