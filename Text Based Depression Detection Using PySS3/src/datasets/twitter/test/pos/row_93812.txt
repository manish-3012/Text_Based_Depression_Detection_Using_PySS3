My math teachers don't understand technology and it's hilarious So we are taking a test today and to make sure we don't cheat they asked us to have our cameras on our paper work. Issue is we are using Chrome books so for the whole test we had to sit in awkward positions and bend in weird ways so we could see the test while having it show our paper. 

So I turned off my camera to take pictures of my test with my chrome book to submit it  (they demand we use the chrome book) but they also demanded I leave my camera on until I submit it so I'm like "alright". And the whole class could see my test answers while I'm trying to take pictures of it.
