Anybody wanna help me with school? I'm doing online school and this is my last assignment of the week.

What are some of the negative side effects of smoking? I already got the basics like it makes you prone to disease. I also thought people who didn't smoke are happier but I couldn't find many sources for that that my teacher would accept.

Help, I just wanna be done with school.
