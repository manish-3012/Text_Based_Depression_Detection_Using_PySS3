Iâ€™m a senior in highschool who recently turned 18 and I have a crush on a girl I work with whoâ€™s in college. So Iâ€™ve been working at this restaurant for about 8 months and about a month ago this new girl started waiting tables (I work in the kitchen) I introduced myself the second time I saw her because she was busy with training her first day and I try to strike up a conversation whenever weâ€™re not busy. We have fun conversations and its all nice and stuff. She seemed impressed because I had a 4.5 gpa and gave me some tips about picking a college and a major and that stuff. The issue is I lowkey started liking her but sheâ€™s also like 20 so Iâ€™m pretty sure sheâ€™s definitely not feeling the same way about me. What do you guys think? Am I just second guessing myself or am I just a friend?
