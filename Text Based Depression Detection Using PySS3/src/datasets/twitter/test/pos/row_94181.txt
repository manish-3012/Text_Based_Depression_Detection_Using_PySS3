Things that happened while I was in 8th grade: A list tw: possible triggers? iâ€™m ranting about my eight grade experiences, so sorry about all the spelling mistakes. very very short tldr at the end


â€¢ came out to both my sisters and my brother, who all accept me

â€¢ came out as lesbian to a girl, two weeks later she attempted to sit in my lap and kept calling me â€œdaddy (my name)â€
    - i was extremely uncomfortable but it took my friend intervening to actually get her to listen and get off
    - she pouted and immediately went to do the *exact* *same* *thing* to another girl

â€¢ realized how much people stereotyped everyone as either â€˜bottomsâ€™ or â€˜topsâ€™ and how many 8th graders made extremely dirty jokes
    - the person who made the most dirty jokes was the girl previously mentioned in point 2, shocker

â€¢ the soccer boys were going around the entire lunch table asking people on a date, they got to me (sadly) and i was going to just ignore them until my â€˜friendâ€™ *very* *loudly* said â€œsheâ€™s gayâ€
   - i just awkwardly laughed and kept eating
   - that was when i decided i was no longer going to come out to any classmates, they didnâ€™t need to know
   - that same â€˜friendâ€™ (who will now be referred to as â€˜bradâ€™, a fake name) outed me another time later on in the year *in* *class*

â€¢ brad wrote a story about a gay couple as an assignment we had, i told him not to as we didnâ€™t know if our teacher was homophobic or not
   -i realize now that it was just classic âœ¨ *internalized* *homophobia* âœ¨

â€¢ brad was always transphobic to my friend (who, at the time, went by he/him before realizing they preferred they/them) that they would â€˜never be a *real* boyâ€™

â€¢ my friend (who will now be referred to as â€˜bugâ€™, they like bugs) was diagnosed with anxiety and had multiple panic attacks throughout the year, the next few points will be talking about these instances 

â€¢ they had one afterschool, i handled it poorly and had to them alone with my science teacher or else i wouldâ€™ve been late to the bus
    -afterwards i realized i had to learn how to be able to help bug and spent the next few nights researching and finding out how to help with panic attacks
    - this resulted in me actually being able to properly calm them down the next few times a was near them during a panic attack

â€¢ bug had one that was also after school during dance practice
    -our english teacher called us up to the classroom as everyone else packed up while they were calming down
    - asked why they had a panic attack and when bug started to hyperventilate, she kept asking but more forcefully
    - i mostly spoke for them as they started shaking and couldnâ€™t speak properly
    -she couldnâ€™t understand that anxiety attacks can happen even if the person felt safe and didnâ€™t know what caused it
    - we told her about brad and other possible reason but she kept looking at bug weirdly 
    - she confiscated bugs ds, which they were holding and messing with to prevent them from scratching themselves because she assumed they were â€˜playingâ€™
    -i had to hold bugs hands to prevent them from starching themselves as they kept shaking
    - we almost missed the bus and i was concerned for them as we left in different buses

â€¢ we were on a 3 day field trip for the gate (gifted and talented) students and they had one while we were coming back from a 3 hour (i think?) cayaking trip 
    - i tried to calm them down but they started panicking and hyperventilating while telling me they had to get off the boat immediately
    - i yelled out to our guide, who was already on land, that we had to get off right at that moment and he swam to us, bringing us to the dock
    - we sat down on nearby tree logs that were used as a fence and stayed there while bug calmed down
    - this incident made me much more thankful that our science teacher, who was on the trip with us, recognized that this couldâ€™ve happened and put us on the same team as partners

â€¢ that ends the panic attack section, but onto more things that happened

â€¢ found out that the seventh graders were buying drugs from highschoolers in the school nextdoor 

â€¢ got newfound respect to my science teacher who stayed organized the whole year and had a schedule planned out all through the year 
    - the schedule had been planned out through the whole school year, and as a result, the covid outbreak didnâ€™t change her schedule
    - we always knew what we were learning and what the homework was before it was even assigned 

â€¢ newfound dislike for my english teacher, as well as  my 7th grade science teacher 
    -surprise surprise, they were best friends
    - my 7th grade teacher got mad at me for asking her a question which was â€˜i thought you didnâ€™t have class today?â€™ on school holiday
    - she called me disrespectful and said â€˜i donâ€™t need your opinionâ€™ and mentioned me to another student, even having the nerve to tag me in the comment to â€˜call me outâ€™
    - i wasnâ€™t even in her class
    - my english teacher sided with her and i lost all respect for them
    - as a result, i learned that i donâ€™t need to care about them, and moved on
    - i blocked them both as soon as the year ended and only keep up with my science teacher
    - also found out that the 7th grade teacher called a good friend of mine a b*tch for also asking her a question 

â€¢ i regret staying friends with brad for as long as i did, as i kept talking to him despite bug telling me not to
    -iâ€™ve cut all contact and recognize him as a horrible person now

i think thatâ€™s all for now. please tell me if iâ€™ve violated any rules or anything, iâ€™ll delete this immediately if so

TL;DR: found out i was lesbian, hated one of my teachers, and that the seventh graders that year sucked
