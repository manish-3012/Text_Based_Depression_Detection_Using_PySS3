Who else here hates final projects that make you answer really vague questions? Teach just revealed our final project for Grade 12 Chemistry. The questions are as follows, albeit re-worded in case someone from my school comes across this.

Investigate a topic of your choice that's related to whatever science you're learning (In my case, chemistry). This can include reviewing scientific research, or researching a career path that interests you that is connected in some way to your course.

1. Summarize your chosen topic.
2. Why is this particular topic important to you? How do you 
**P E R S O N A L L Y C O N N E C Tâ„¢** to this topic? Back your answers up using **P E R S O N A L E X P E R I E N C E S** as opposed to general statements. (Fuck these questions in particular)
3. Why is your topic relevant to the real world? Or, what is the importance of the career that you have chosen in regards to its role in society or the scientific community?  
4. How is this relevant to our course?
5. What are the possible moral or ethical problems involving your topic/career choice?

These sorts of projects always just feel like a total cop-out.
