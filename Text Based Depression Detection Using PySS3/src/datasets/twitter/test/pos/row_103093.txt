cringe characters in shows that are supposed to be funny literally make me uncomfortable Iâ€™m watching Community and Pierce annoys the shit out of me. I know heâ€™s cringe in the show and itâ€™s supposed to be funny to the audience or whatever but all it does is make me uncomfortable. It was the same with the Office, I just didnâ€™t like Dwight or Erin. Theyâ€™re supposed to somehow be love able characters. I know I need a life lol
