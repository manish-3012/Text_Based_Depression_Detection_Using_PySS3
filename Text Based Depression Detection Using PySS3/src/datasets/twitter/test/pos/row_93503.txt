What has happened? BTW sorry for the bad English its not my first language. I have been noticing my mom is not being and caring as before and has stopped giving me hugs and compliments and she has also been trying to make me feel guilty you know when she says that you do whatever you want and stuff and it only started this year I mean as far as I can remember nobody has hugged me this year ik you guys have the same state 

But it's just too hard for me because I am the older brother and I have an annoying little brother and whenever he troubles me my mom just expects me to ignore him I mean that guy I such an ******* ***** and he's so unoriginal everytime I roast him he makes a stupid voice and repeats what I said I have been hanging on to my patience with a price of thread so I just told my mom to keep him away from me he also lies to win arguments

Little siblings can manipulate parents so easily and because my parents praise him his ego has gone over the roof and one of the times I looked into one of his chats ( we share the same phone) and he actually pretends to be cool infront of his "friends" and he says the friends we have (which originally I had first and has become our main group of friends) like him more than me 

I mean they obviously don't they always since whenever we go to walk they only say my name first and whenever I say I can't come they ask his and most of the times they don't even ask and they obviously have had a lot of fights with my brother and YET he still says they like him better

I just don't think I can do this anymore I've had suicidal thoughts almost every week and I even pray to to releive me from this world which is troubling because I usually don't pray to god ever

I'm just tired of fucking well.. everything
