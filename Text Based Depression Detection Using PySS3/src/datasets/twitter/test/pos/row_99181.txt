My parents think i shouldnâ€™t be online bc itâ€™s dangerous I swear to god they recently caught me being online on discord and texting people online and now they keep bringing up something that happend when i was fucking 12. Now iâ€™m 15 i understand better now and iâ€™m not a idiot anymore like when i was younger. They legit tell me â€œWhat happens if there bad peopleâ€ i told them that nothing what am i gonna do As long as they donâ€™t know my adress iâ€™m fine. Iâ€™m old enough to be on the damn internet iâ€™m not fucking 4
