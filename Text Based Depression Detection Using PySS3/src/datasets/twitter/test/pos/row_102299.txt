Live Motion Games - tell us your ideas/feedback for our projects and earn yourself a free game! Hello everyone! 

We are **Live Motion Games** \- a game developer from Poland based in Warsaw.

As we try to reach out as many people with our projects as we can we decided to post here (after getting a permission from mods - thank you) and say hello! 

That's not the only thing though - as we work on several projects we are always on the lookout for two main things: **ideas** that we could implement in our games and **feedback** regarding what we have already achieved. 

We would love to hear your opinions and ideas for games that we are currently developing: **Chernobyl Liquidators Simulator**, **Builder Simulator**, **Builders of China** and **Supermarket Manager**.  

You can check all our games [right here](https://store.steampowered.com/developer/livemotiongames) \- scroll down and select upcoming releases to see games that we are currently working on. We recommend checking their devlogs to see what we already have and check trailers for the games. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any idea (for example what would you like to see in the game), feedback or remark (something should be changed, perhaps) regarding our games - we would love to hear them! 

What is more - we have a little treat for you too! **Four of you** with ideas/suggestions or feedback that we deem to be the most valuable for us will receive a free Steam key for our **Train Station Renovation** \- a relaxing game about repairing and renovating train stations, bringing them back to their former glory. 

Thank you very much for the chance! If you have any questions we are also very open and would gladly answer them. Cheers!
