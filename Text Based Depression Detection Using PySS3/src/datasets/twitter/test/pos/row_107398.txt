Donâ€™t mind this, just me excited about the past week and the next week or so :) Today has been pretty great! I finally finalized the character design for my twitch profile, now just gotta do art! my friends and i have been brainstorming, practicing, and i finally changed my username cross platform and grabbed the names i need :) just need to do the art for emotes, profile, etc etc. just happy to have this much done though!!
