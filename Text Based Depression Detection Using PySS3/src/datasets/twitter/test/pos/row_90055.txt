The Rick Astley paradox Let me explain, Rick Astley in his song "Never gonna give you up" states that he will never give you up but he also states that he will also never let you down. So if you ask for the Disney movie "Up" he cannot give it to you thus letting you down yet he claims that he will never give you up or let you down.
