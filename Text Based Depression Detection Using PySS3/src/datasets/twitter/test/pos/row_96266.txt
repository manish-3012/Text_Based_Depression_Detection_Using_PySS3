2 frostys in 2 minutes my teacher just said that he once bet a student he couldn't eat 2 frostys in 2 minutes and if he could he would get him a new one, he tried and got brain freeze and had to go to the nurse, I said "why would he do that that is literally impossible" and he said "yeah that's why it was funny"
