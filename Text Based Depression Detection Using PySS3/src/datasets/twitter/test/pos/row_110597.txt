Question for you guys Do you ever have to pee, but you don't think you have to shit, so you go to the bathroom and start peeing but then you feel it and you're like "fuck I actually do have to shit" so then you have to stop peeing (which is it's own challenge) and then you shit? And it's it's such and inconvenience
