Just had a fucking panic attack in the shower. Do not recommend. So there I was, taking a hot shower in the middle of a hot Sunday. I start to think about the feeling of loneliness that I've had for a long while (you can guess how much social distancing helped).
Nothing extraordinary: 18 years old, never kissed a girl(very afraid to talk to new people, but I'm working on it in therapy), haven't talked to friends in a while, haven't felt joy in over a year, etc.

Suddenly I realize that my heart was beating fast. Too fast for someone just standing under the shower. It wasn't the first time it happened, but I never got used to it. So I start to focus on my breathing and, after I while, my heart goes to a less desperate rhythm.

Gotta say man, I don't think my depresso pills are doing their job. I just wish I could stop feeling like this all the time.

(Don't worry, I don't intend to the Carbonara Sayonara)
