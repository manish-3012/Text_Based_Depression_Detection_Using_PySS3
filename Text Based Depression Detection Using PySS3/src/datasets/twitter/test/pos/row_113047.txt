Some advice to people who use wattpad Always look at the chapter names. 

If it has marriage or proposal shit, thatâ€™s a no

If it has a pregnancy thing, thatâ€™s a no

If the writer shows you a picture of a random anime style drawn girl saying â€œthatâ€™s how you look likeâ€, thatâ€™s a very big big no

Unless youâ€™re into the two first things then I guess thatâ€™s fine but Iâ€™m going to tell you that the story probably is going to be absolute shit. 

Also, if the writer just â€œy/n has blonde hair and blue eyesâ€ click the fuck away, for obvious reasons.

If the book is 70% author notes, click away, itâ€™s not worth it.

If the author uses â€œauthor chanâ€, click away.

You can always try to read the first chapter to see how many grammatical errors there are, the book is most likely bad if there are many of those.

You can look trough the comments and see how many people are roasting the writer, but it also depends on the fandom. 

I tried reading a MHA shigaraki fic and just now a NaJ AU (school thingy) Nightmare fic.

Since both MHA and Undertale fandom are mostly teens the response would be the same right? Nope.

In the MHA one the writer tried to draw the reader, which thankfully wasnâ€™t blonde hair blue eyes but still pretty bad. The comments were half roasting while some other were giving advice.

Then the Undertale one it was fucking hell, the writer really just searched up loli art and was like â€œyeah thatâ€™s youâ€, and honestly I was expecting the comments to be roasting the shit out of the author, but uh, the Undertale fandom has extremely low standards. So um, yeah I think you know already what the comments were.

Anyways, donâ€™t use wattpad. Unless youâ€™re desperate. If you want to I know a few good Undertale AU writers on wattpad but thatâ€™s it.
