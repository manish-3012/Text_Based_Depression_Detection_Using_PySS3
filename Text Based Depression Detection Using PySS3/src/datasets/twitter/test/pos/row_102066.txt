Social media vent It makes me feel terrible about myself when people post useless, unoriginal, and effortless crap on the internet and get all the likes while I used to put hard work and creativity into my posts, and they get nothing. Then I tried posting the same crap that they did, and still nothing. It was extremely crushing, and eventually, I ended up quitting most social media for months. What's the point in sharing your creativity with others if no one values it?
