3 people in my life all might die soon and I don't know how to feel about it I don't really know who else to tell. Currently, my aunt and my great uncle are in the hospital they have COVID and are both on ventilators. They aren't anti-maskers or anything they just live with doctors that deal with COVID patients. I know that I have the possibility of losing both of them and I also know that due to restrictions I won't even be able to fly to say goodbye or go to their funerals. On top of this, I learned my piano teacher of 10 years had suffered moderate heart failure. He's old and according to his family, he's doing better but not great. I don't think he knows how much he means to me. Yet, somehow despite the fact that all these people could die relatively soon, I feel fine. I think I'm in denial and I'm trying to cover it in optimism. I'm a very sensitive and emotional person, I've lost people before, and it's destroyed me. I don't know why I'm not more worried or freaking out.  Thanks for reading my rant.
