I need serious help. I live in a shitty household. I gotta deal with alcoholic smokers. I've been surpressing myself for too long to the point my mental health is going down the drain. I've been begging my mom to get counselling, but she just ignores it. I've been reaching out to my bio dad, but my mom shuts me out from him. I try my siblings, but it's hard for me as it is to them. I just wish for a better environment and someome who cares for me.
