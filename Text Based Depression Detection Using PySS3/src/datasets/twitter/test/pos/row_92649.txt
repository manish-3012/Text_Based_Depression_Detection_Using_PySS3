Reminder for asian males All though some girls are attracted to anime characters, that doesnâ€™t mean they like asian guys in real life. In fact, it is more likely to mean they like white guys since anime characters generally look racially ambiguous/have white features. So yeah. Donâ€™t get your hopes up.
