Road trip ... Venice, Rome, Salzburg, Munich, or Paris I fancy a road trip, weâ€™ll train ride.  Need to get some time to myself for a few weeks so where should I go?  

Venice is empty atm and the Jewish quarter has nicest people in Europe
Rome without crowds sound fun
I could sing do ray me in Salzburg 
Or tango in Paris if someone will join me 

Where should I escape to.
