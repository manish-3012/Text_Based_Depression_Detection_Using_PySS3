Is this normal? Okay, so I was in an SCP: Secret Lab server and a couple of morons kept spamming earrape and teamkilling, so I was a little down that I couldn't enjoy it. I started browsing reddit and found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cursedcomments/comments/iqwnk5/cursed_scorpoin/) post and began laughing uncontrollably for 2 minutes straight, then I started to feel like I was crying, then the laughter went on for a few more minutes and back to crying. The process just kept repeating. I'm a guy, so it isn't my period. What's going on rn?
