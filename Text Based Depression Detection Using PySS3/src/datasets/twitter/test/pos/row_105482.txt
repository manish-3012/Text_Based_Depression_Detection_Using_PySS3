Iâ€™m joining the army Iâ€™ve decided that once I am out of high school Iâ€™m joining the army. I have it all planned out, Iâ€™m in a trades school currently and Iâ€™m going to become a combat engineer.
Iâ€™ve been training for a while but Iâ€™ve finally figured it out.
Itâ€™s weird because not many people with A- grades and many college opportunities want to join the military but hey why not?
