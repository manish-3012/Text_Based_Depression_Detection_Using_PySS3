PLEASE SIGN THIS PETITION TO HELP ME WATCH GNOMEO AND JULIET IN CLASS [http://chng.it/qYD8NdfG5b](http://chng.it/qYD8NdfG5b)

THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT  
I am learning about Romeo and Juliet in class, and I think that I can convince my teacher to play that monstrosity of a movie in class. Any support would be appreciated :)  
edit: clarification
