Now you have your milkshake!If your blender is around the size of a blender ,then you can serve up to 4 to 5 people with decent medium cups.


Keep in mind you can add more strawberries and bananas but more would make it too thick and its just a weird texture i personally dont like.But its cho choice!



The milkshake should look a bit thick,like syrup or nacho cheese which is normal,and should be pink with red dots.Enjoy!
