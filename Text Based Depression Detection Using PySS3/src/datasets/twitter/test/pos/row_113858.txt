Day 7 of posting my fav Twenty Ã¸ne pilÃ¸ts quotes in order Twenty Ã˜ne PilÃ¸ts-johnny boy-from the album (self titled) 


Quote:No one really knows his mind
And no one knows behind his eyes
The man deserves a medal
But he's never really won a prize, before
He goes to lock the door
He has fallen in love
He knows it's enough
And the world looks down and frowns
-Tyler Joseph 2009
