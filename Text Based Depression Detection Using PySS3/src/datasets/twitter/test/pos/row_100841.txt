Share to me the secret of paying attention Seriously tho paying attention is hard man. Paying attention in school (unless its a class that's somewhat interesting) is basically impossible, everything the teachers say or do just gets tuned out as useless noise. In one instance i had to keep myself from falling asleep in class. I can read whole paragraphs about anything but i wont register any of it, it'll just be random noise. The ability to pay attention i way underrated smh....
