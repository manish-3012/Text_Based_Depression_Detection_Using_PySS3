so i have a classmate, right tl;dr what can i do to make this guy stop touching me ? (iâ€™m a guy)

thereâ€™s nothing special about our relationship except for the fact that randomly throughout the day heâ€™ll sort of grind on me and try to touch me. i act like this with one other friend with the main difference being that she plays back, even in text. i try being dry and not into what he does but he still does it.
