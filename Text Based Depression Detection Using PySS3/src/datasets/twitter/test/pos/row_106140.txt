Yâ€™all please brush your teeth Iâ€™m not joking when I say this, *please brush your teeth.* Not only does it make your breath not smell like raw ass, it keeps you healthy too. 

You guys already know this, but you donâ€™t really *know.* I learned this shit the hard way and now I have to get 14 cavity fillings. 

TL;DR: *Brush your goddamn teeth. Please.*
