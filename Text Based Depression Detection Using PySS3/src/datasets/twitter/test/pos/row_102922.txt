A girl asked me out...? So the other day I was in a "virtual lunch" group at my school, which is basically a way to talk with students at lunch through google meet since everything is online this year (which sucks). Anyway, I joined one of the groups that had around 10 people or so... and with 5 mins. to go or so most people had finished their lunch and their conversations and left. There was only me and this one girl who were still there.

Anyway, we started talking about how 2020 has been a bad year, how we miss seeing our classmates in person, etc. There was a *long* pause, like 20 seconds, and she said "\[my real name\]... do you have a girlfriend?"

I did a double take and said "uh... no, I've never dated anyone before"

There was another long, awkward pause and she said "Do you want one?"

I explained that I did like her as a friend but I wasn't ready for that. She looked kind of embarrassed but I told her that I looked forward to talking with her on Monday at lunch. She kind of blushed and said ok and left.

I feel kind of bad for making her so embarrassed. I didn't mean to.
