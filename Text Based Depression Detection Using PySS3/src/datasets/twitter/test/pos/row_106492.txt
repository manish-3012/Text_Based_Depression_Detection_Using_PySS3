why are people making adhd seem like a good thing As someone with ADHD I can confidently say YOU REALLY DO NOT WANT THIS. You might think that since I constantly have something to obsessively talk about that you would love to be friends with me but in actuality it's because I literally always forget that I got a notification from you because I was doing something and I take a few hours to respond and so that makes it so that I dont exhaust all my conversation topics at once. GOD FUCKING DAMNIT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A RANT ABOUT WHY ADHD SUCKS. I think the way I wrote this speaks for itself. ADHD IS NOT A GOOD THING
