Would you consider cutting someone specials name into yourself toxic? My ex and I both cut, and I was at a time I was clean, and he wasn't, and he cut my initial into his thigh, he broke up with me which kinda caused me to relapse but I got a new bf and I really wanna carve his name into my arm but I'm scared he'll think I'm gonna be a toxic boyfriend.. advice pls &lt;3
