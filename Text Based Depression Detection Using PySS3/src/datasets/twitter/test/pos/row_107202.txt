ya know, sometimes My mom just makes me just wanna ðŸ˜€ðŸ”« Helppp My mom wont listen


So for the past 3 weeks ive been doing PT for JROTC in the mornings, i missed ONE day because i was exhausted, especially since school JUST started back up, and of course my mom got mad at me and made me feel guilty. And i havent done any workouts all quarantine, even before quarantine i wasnt active, and now im trying and its hard. But now ive had it. School is draining me mentally but im trying, PT is draining my physically and im trying so hard. She always complains and says â€œyOu dO nOtHiNg aLl dAy dO sOmeThIng fOr OnCe.â€ like im sorry, i get up at 5:00 am to go to pt for an hour, then i get back and do school for 7 hours, then i do homework for 3 hours, its no fucking wonder i want to relax, alone, in my bed. i have adhd so its already hard enough to get things done. On top of this she expects me to get all my chores done then she gets all mad when i dont wash one pot. i understand shes busy too but why cant she understand that even though i might not seem like iâ€™ve done much, too me Iâ€™ve done a lot and im drained. 

And so back on topic, for the past day my calves have been superrr sore and iâ€™ve been trying to relax. So i asked if i could miss PT tomorrow since currently my calves are still in extreme pain, i cant even walk or go up and down stairs without being in horrible pain. And she just goes â€œno, you already missed Monday and Tuesday (school was closed those days).â€ so i tell her that itâ€™s literally basic science that you should take a break if your sore because pushing through actually makes you weaker and she just cuts me off and says â€œno, i dont wanna hear it, you need to get stronger, this is what you get for not doing anything for 6 months. (once again making me feel bad about myself) When i was working out to loose weight i pushed through being sore.â€ but she doesnâ€™t realize im 20 something years younger than her AND im not used to doing ALL of this. Sorry for ranting but it just gets me so angry that she wont listen. What should i do?
