I need to talk to someone I'm so stressed out I feel like I'm about to cry at any moment and I feel so lonely and I'm not sure if I feel more lonely when I'm around people or when I'm alone and when people ask me how I'm doing I say I'm doing good or I'm doing alright and I feel like I'm about to cry when ever I get a hug I'm really pathetic aren't I
