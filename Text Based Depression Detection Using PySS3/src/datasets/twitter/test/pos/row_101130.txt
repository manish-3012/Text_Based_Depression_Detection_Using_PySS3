Let's consider: late 1990's, 2000's and early 2010's was the best years for living ever in our world Think about It - Internet was more simplier and goodly naive. The best TV shows, games and films was started in this time period and, how I experienced, everyone was kindlier for each other. Censorship wasn't even a thing and everything was calmer that it happen today. Too bad that good things end so fast

I'm very grateful for myself to born in 2002 and experienced more interesting things than other younger kids. But I'm clearly understand, that living in the past isn't actually good, so I'll hope that everything will be ok at the future, I guess so
