Does anyone still use "gay" as an insult? Back when I was in primary school we always used to say "gay" as an insult for pretty much everything, mostly as a sarcastic insult mind you. Now it makes literally no sense, since being gay isn't wrong in the slightest, but do people still use it impetuously?
