Does anyone else have a minimalist room Most of my friends hate on me because my room is â€œboringâ€ but honestly i have too many ideas that i just leave it plain. all i have is a tv, a desk, my bed, and my dogâ€™s cage. and i donâ€™t have anything on my walls except a mirror with led lights around it so my room is really just grey walls with grey flooring

Itâ€™s weird because i always thought someoneâ€™s room was a great indicator of their personality but i donâ€™t put any effort, I just like having it clean and open I guess but I love going to other peopleâ€™s houses and them having stuff everywhere
