Three words to describe myself?? FFS I have a beginning of the school year assignment to describe myself in three words. Tf am I supposed to do? Like lonely fat and lazy lmaoooo.


Anyone have any suggestions?? Some modest and boring adjectives ig, but not completely self deprecating cause thatâ€™d seem weird. Itâ€™s a fucking flip grid also so the whole class sees yours ugh
