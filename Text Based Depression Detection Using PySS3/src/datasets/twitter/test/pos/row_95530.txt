My dumbass thoughts: Day #1 Ok Elephants. Elephants are fucking cool, and they got a 39 incher on average (donâ€™t pretend like you donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m talking about) but like relative to their body mass of around 13,000lb (assume Iâ€™m talking about African Elephants) their thingy is tiny asf. Like thatâ€™s one inch for every 333lb for every inch. Humans have it as 31 lb for every inch, meaning if elephants got it like humans, theirs would be 420 inches (haha nice). CAN YALL FUCKIN IMAGINE THAT? Like Iâ€™m 71 inches tall, meaning that if elephant shlong was relative to humans, then that shit wuoood be packin almost 6 times my fuckin height. 

Thatâ€™s all for today
