A little advice for yâ€™all YOU are the most important character in your story you should not try to get into a relationship because you will never find â€œthe oneâ€ you will find each other for now you should focus on yourself find something you love doing whether itâ€™s some sort of art, learning to play a musical instrument or pursuing a sport but it has to be something you love doing focus on that and I know school is starting for most people but try and find any free time and doing that thing and start eating healthy it just will make you way more positive try to polish out any insecurities you have a good way to do that is either finding a solution (like working out if ur overweight) or if you canâ€™t do that just stare into a mirror and say â€œIâ€™m *insert insecurity* but itâ€™s ok and no one caresâ€ this only works if ur The Who doesnâ€™t like it not if ur getting mocked for it Iâ€™ll make another post about that.

The reason I really wanted to say this is cuz I was at a very low point and when I found something I loved doing (martial arts) it helped a lot.
