Why dopamine and adrenaline why? So I was having a fight with a guy in my school and I was trying to ignore the fight but then my crush and her friends started watching us fighting and they started laughing at me and yeah I did the boy thing we started fighting and I ripped his shirt off and then my crush and their friends started cheering for me bruh teenage fights always cringe.
