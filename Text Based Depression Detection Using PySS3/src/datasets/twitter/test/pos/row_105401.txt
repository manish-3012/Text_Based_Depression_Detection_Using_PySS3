Drivers License Help? so iâ€™ve been trying to reach the dmv for days now and no one will pick up the phone or respond to messages either on the website or reddit so i thought iâ€™d see if my question could be answered here.

i had a few question about apply for a license with the road test suspended in NC. iâ€™m currently 18 years old and i wasnâ€™t able to finish drivers ed during school and have never had my permit before but iâ€™ve had the 60 hours driving with my mom. i believe pre covid an 18 year old could apply for a license in nc without drivers ed or a permit but because of the road test suspension iâ€™m not sure if that is true? so my questions are. 

1. Can i still apply for either a license or permit over the age of 18 now that road test are suspended and i have not received a drivers education certificate? 
2. how do i apply for a road test waiver if i need one?
