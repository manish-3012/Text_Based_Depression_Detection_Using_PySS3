Iâ€™m confused and need help... I still talk to my ex-girlfriend that i broke up a year ago and we are good friends. We talked about our breakup and how it was really unfair. I wont go into details however i told her i still have feelings for her yet i do not expect anything and im fine with how things are. She said she would love to return my feelings but cant due to her internal struggles. However shortly after talking about all this i found us openly flirting again. I dont understand her intentions and cant bring myself to ask her myself. Any help is appreciated and thank you everyone for listening to me.
