A friend has peer pressured me to consume alcohol as an adult multiple times by calling me boring if I don't And even though I've been with other friends at those moments nobody gave a shit. Not too long ago a friend of mine said they got "tipsy" and found it fun. I got uncomfortable and felt ill. After mentioning my discomfort with the situation they thought I was dumb. Like what? Just because I don't support underage drinking?

I just feel like shit. All are good friends and it feels like the group of friends i have has become more shit with time. A friend almost got kicked out because two people didn't like him or something. Its a shitfest.

Thanks for reading if you did. Any encouragement or support or advice would be nice.
