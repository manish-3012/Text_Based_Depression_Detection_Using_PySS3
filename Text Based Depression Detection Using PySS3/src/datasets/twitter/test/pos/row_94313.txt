second try at poetry this is for u/4nimegf (probably my last) when people people see my fit

"damn son where'd you get that"

well not my father I surely know that

my father and I are are stuck cuz of resemblance

A black mirror... probably share the same appendix

left me for some RX

thanks for that

I would solemnly wait for his apology

but just looks me in the eye

"are his glasses foggy"

so no this fit he never bought me

"well it looks cozy, what's your inspiration"

global warming... 

cuz it's cozy on cozy

\*I hate this poem somebody end me\*

almost forgot I did it u/4nimegf &lt;3
