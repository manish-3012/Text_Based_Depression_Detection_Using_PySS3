You can dream small and still be happy Seriously tho, not everyone is special or has big dreams that will change the world. You can just get a small job and still be happy ðŸ˜Š to be happy, you don't have to be famous, look at me I'm not famous but I'm still smiling here. So can you. Having small dreams doesn't mean you are afraid of taking big steps, it just means that you aren't interested in what the world has for you.

 You can be an introvert or an extrovert but everyone deserves happiness. YOU ARE AWESOME, KEEP SMILING
