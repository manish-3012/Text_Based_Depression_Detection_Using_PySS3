The internet fucked up my perception of reality. I feel like I lost my sense of reality almost completely. I've been on the internet since I was like eleven or twelve, I am currently 17 and will graduate from school early next year.

I won't tell you my entire life story, don't worry, but to sum it up: My parents were never home a lot and I occupied myself with the internet, completely unsupervised. Now, I am kind of a goody-two-shoes, always have been, so I didn't do anything stupid, but I watched a lot from the sidelines. I didn't interact with many people online, but I became invested in a lot of stuff, like, I dunno, YouTube.

Now how did it fuck me up? Long story short, I'm pretty much a hermit. I do leave the house, but need a really good reason for it. My life is kind of spiraling out of control, I have no idea what to do in the future, I am completely dependent on others and know next to nothing about the real world.

My expectations are mostly based off YT, Instagram and so on, so basically they are way too high to ever be fulfilled. I know that I won't ever accidentally get famous. I know that I won't ever become a meme and experience my own 15 seconds of fame. I know that I will never be more than a spectator. I lost hope for my life tbh. I do have some things going for me that could potentially grant me a good life but... I have this expectation that everything is just going to be handed to me. I have no motivation to work hard. I keep being shown the perfect lives of others, their perfect creations, their perfect selves; I know that they probably worked hard too, but it *looks* so easy... And I just can't get it in my head that they also had to do something.

I am just watching the world around me... And whenever I am pulled back to reality and have to do something myself, I just get completely overwhelmed. I don't know how to interact with people. I don't know how to operate this vending machine. I don't know how to stand up for myself. I don't even know how to order something in a restaurant without help. I was left alone, on the internet, being fed this false narrative that I can become successful without putting any work into it. Whenever I do try to do something, I get discouraged immediatly, because I see someone doing it better or just don't get any attention. It's awful and I hate it...

Real life feels surreal. I feel like I am just watching everything through the eyes of someone else. When someone calls my name, it doesn't feel like I am that person. I make everything sound so dramatic, I'm sorry, but I really am just this spectator person... I am kind of despairing every day. I hate my life. But I don't know how to fix it either..... Hell, I don't even know if this qualifies as a rant, I'm completely clueless about everything.... I also just feel so lonely as well.. I have people that I like around me, sure, but my expectations tell me that even this is not how it is "supposed" to be...

Welp, if you made it this far, thank you. I'm sorry that I wasted your time.. I hope that you are in a better situation, living an actual life and have a nice day
