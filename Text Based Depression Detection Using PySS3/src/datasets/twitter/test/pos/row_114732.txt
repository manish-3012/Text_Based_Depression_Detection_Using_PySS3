I started cutting myself recently and... and I liked it. Someone help. Uh, hey. Letâ€™s get straight into this.

Recently I havenâ€™t been in the best mental state. I wonâ€™t go into much detail, just know that I have never considered self harm, so Iâ€™ve gone pretty low. 

So I started cutting myself a few days ago. I used a knife from my kitchen and used it right below my shoulder. I thought I was going to be a one time thing, but I liked it.

Now, I donâ€™t like stitches, needles or any major injuries, but the pain itself I somewhat enjoy. So if I broke my arm I wouldnâ€™t be like â€œmmm I like thisâ€ but cuts and biting the sides of my mouth feels somewhat good. Iâ€™m probably messed up in the head, right? 

I have no plans on going further than cutting, and I want to stop. I didnâ€™t go too deep the first time, but Iâ€™m afraid I will next time or my parents find out. I just wonâ€™t want to hurt myself badly or people think Iâ€™m suicidal, because Iâ€™m not. 

So how do I stop? Or at least be â€œsaferâ€ about it? Any tips? Anything helps so go ahead. Iâ€™ll be here.
