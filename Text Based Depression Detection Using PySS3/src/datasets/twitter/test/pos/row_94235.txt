At what point will the toxicity of a relationship out way how much you feel for them? Stopped talking to a girl I saw for a few months Becuase it was getting way to toxic but now she added me on snap and were calling every night and I can't get her out of my head. If I saw what happend from the outside I'd probly stop it but from the inside this girl is the only thing I care about
