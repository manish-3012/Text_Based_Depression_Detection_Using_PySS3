Oh no no no no Whenever I think I'm getting better, I realize that I haven't made any progress then I feel worse. I feel like a huge disappointment all the time. My grades are dropping. I'm losing all my common sense. I don't think I'm going to live past 18. I'm somehow going to get myself killed. Idk why I should try to set up a good life for myself if I'm going to die before it really starts. I'd be okay with dying if I knew it wouldn't tear my family apart. But knowing my dad, he'd probably accidentally get him self killed, if any of his kids died. I don't wanna go through this but I don't wanna fucking ruin my families lives either. 

Thank you for your time
