Please don't ask out girls when you first meet them online. So for me, and some other people, it's hard to make friends, I'm shy and I don't even know how to talk to people online. Other girls aren't shy but you know what is pretty annoying for all of us? When males ask out straight away, how old are you, are you single, can you be my girlfriend? Sorry but that just makes us feel really uncomfortable and feeling bothered so we're not at all going to be at least friends with you. You want to actually know the person, and be friends with them for at least maybe a few weeks or a couple months, then if you know the person is single and you know how old they are, you can ask them out. I'm personally in a relationship and it gets bothersome because personally, I have no friends and it's difficult for me to make any when you ask us if we can be with you or if we're in a relationship right away when we're basically strangers. Some girls find it embarrassing to tell people if they're in a relationship so starting of a conversation with a girl saying "are you single?" Makes us uncomfortable.
