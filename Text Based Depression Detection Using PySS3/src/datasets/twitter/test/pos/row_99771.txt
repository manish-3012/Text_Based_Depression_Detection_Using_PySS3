So uh, guys? Itâ€™s me Last week, I confessed my feelings to that one girl, I was rejected and spent a day really hurt. 
I was kind of lucky though, because I didnâ€™t know her, like, at all, I moved on after a few days. 
Yesterday, I met a really nice girl, that makes me smile, and I make smile just as much, and I really fell in love. I think I was a bit of a simp for he last girl tbh, but, as of today, I got into my first relationship. It might not last, but I love her so, so much. Sheâ€™s really sweet, and always tells me I make her smile. Iâ€™ve never met someone so beautiful, on the inside and out. This is possibly the last post Iâ€™ll make with the â€œrelationshipâ€ flair for a long while, unless I want to talk about her,  Iâ€™m really happy.
