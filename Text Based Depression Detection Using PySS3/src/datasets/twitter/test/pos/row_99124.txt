Apparently it gets better Listen, a few weeks ago I genuinely believed that I didn't have a fucking future, that I wasn't going to get into university. Miraculously I fucking did. I now have the opportunity to fix my life, and I intend to do so. I genuinely wanted to kill myself, throw myself off a tall building and be done with it, but now I have a chance to live long enough to do something with my life. I'm still going to die a complete virgin; no sex no kisses, but I've accepted that. Point is, you can succeed



I'm pretty drunk rn, so that might explain all the swearing
