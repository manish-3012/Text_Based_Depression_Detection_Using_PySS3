Long Distance Relationship and Hoodies My gf lives in Wisconsin while I live in California and I sent her a gift of my hoodie, an inversible octopus plushie, some matching pajamas, and some of her favorite snacks. I will tell u. When she pulled out that hoodie and took a FAT WHIFF, I died. She was so cute when she put it on. Easily one of my favorite moments with her. I love her so much. She cried when she pulled away from the hoodie. Just wanted to share a moment that I treasure. Happy new years!
