Warm as hell Hi, im 15 and a junior in highschool. I sweat a lot, its part of male puberty but when i get up there is a small sweat mark on most seats. I dont normally sweat excessively but its really embarrassing. Still happens with ac on, i try to sit on the grey chairs instead of the blue ones. Advice?
