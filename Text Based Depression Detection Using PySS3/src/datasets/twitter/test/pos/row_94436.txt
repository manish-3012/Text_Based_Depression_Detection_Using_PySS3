Canâ€™t get my homework done on time I've been struggling to get my homework done. Last year I usually worked on stuff in class and got most of my homework done before school ended so I could go home and relax. I did that because at home I work really slow. This year I have to do everything at home and I'm just...so slow. I take about 3 or 4 hours to finish one assignment, even though I take breaks and cut out distractions. So I usually end up getting 2 assignments done, but they give me 4 a day. I don't know what to do, I've tried scheduling it out, putting my phone in a different room, all that jazz. Bring in the advice please!
