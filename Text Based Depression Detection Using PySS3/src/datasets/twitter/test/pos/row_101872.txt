Warning. Mutant chickens on the loose in England. They escaped 5:40 local time in Manchester this morning. It's approaching the coast to get to France and destroy afro-eurasia. Some intelligence suggests that it may be heading to Australia and then to the Americas. I have sent out five men, armed with nerf guns, to keep it at bay. I will keep updated. Beware.

Update: the chicken has taken out all my men and has made it to France. I have had a scientific analysis performed on the chickens weaknesses and baguettes seem to one of them, so the French army should be able to take them.

Update 2: the French have run out of ammunition against the force and have made peace. The conversation went as followed:

French: what do you want from us? We will give it.

Chicken: cluck

French: what do you mean no business? Why have you come here?

Chicken: cluck.

French: well, we do have a hate for Italians, so we will help you charge against the Italians under the condition that you do not hurt us.

Chicken: cluck.

French: excellent. We will now begin the march.

This could be the start of world war 3, so I have sent 50 men to try and make peace.

Update 3: the chicken has made it to Italy and ww3 may commence. Luckily, England hasn't joined the war so I can remain safe here. Germany is remaining neutral, but China has taken the chance to make an alliance with Russia and North Korea and restarted the Soviet Union. The chicken has duplicated and will fight against them. Italy has remained as a third party despite being the main target. The chicken plans to travel to the Americas to reunite with Donald trump, his lab mate.
