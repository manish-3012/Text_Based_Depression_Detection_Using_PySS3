Why tf you saying i love you without fucking meaning it. Seriously this thing hurts to me, like i take things damn seriously when someone says i love you or you are cute. Like this compliment and expression of love i always assume to be true. But this girls omg saying i love you to all the cute fucking boys in the world made the word love have no value. Like there is seriously Something wrong with this generation. If not lets talk girls and boys
