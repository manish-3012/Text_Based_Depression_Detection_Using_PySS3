So I learned a lot today It was a ton of stuff about abortion and stem cell research that was actually extremely interesting to hear so many different opinions, it was also surprising that so many were for my idea and so few against it, it turns out that stem cells can be made in a lab rather than being harvested (per say) from aborted fetuses, which I think is a much better option if you want to see the post Iâ€™ll link it in the comments, it was taken down tho cuz it got popular?
