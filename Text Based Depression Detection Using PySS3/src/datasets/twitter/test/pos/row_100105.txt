Posting jokes until I get a girlfriend #5  My friend asked me if I wanted to hear a really good Batman impression, so I said go on then. He shouted, â€œNOT THE KRYPTONITE!â€ and I said, â€œThatâ€™s Supermanâ€¦â€ 

&amp;#x200B;

 â€œThanks, man, â€ he replied, â€œIâ€™ve been practicing it a lot.â€
