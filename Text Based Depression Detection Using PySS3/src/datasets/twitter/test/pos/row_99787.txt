My school did something so annoying So last week I found out that my school is able to make devices ( that are not even connected to their WiFi or anything like that ) have no service in classrooms and Iâ€™m just like bruh. They really need to make classrooms have no service on androids and iPhones to prevent cheating? My god that proves how bad their teachers are at spotting someone LITERALLY ON THEIR PHONE!!!!! Itâ€™s just annoying that they can do that. Also I donâ€™t know about other schools. Also to add on, I KNOW itâ€™s not my network provider because the same issue is with all my friends, as soon as we enter the classroom, our phones get no service and we all have different providers.
