A cute girl from my flight that I wish I talked to. So. This morning, I flew from Zurich to Frankfurt. I was on a Swiss flight, there was this one girl on the flight around my age that I thought was really cute, I â€œcrossedâ€ paths again with her a few times, but I didnâ€™t get the chance to talk to her. Iâ€™m really regretting not going up to her and talking to her.
Iâ€™m in a way writing this as a last ditch effort, in the hopes that I may be able to find her.
If she does see this, I the dude that was wearing the white Mets baseball cap, with longish brown hair. We also almost hit eachother with our carryon bags when taking them out of the over head bin.
I hope this works. Otherwise Iâ€™ll be a sadder boy.
