TikTok: Protest Parody / Media and Govâ€™t High Five I saw a funny TikTok video where three protestors on the left and three protestors on the right were yelling at each other, then they fake fight in the street. 

The end of the video is two suits representing the government and the media watching this unfold, then ending with a high five. 

Can someone help me find it? I thought I saved it, but nope!

Thanks!
