Yâ€™all I think thereâ€™s something wrong with me But Iâ€™m not sure what it is and it also seems HIGHLY common these days. I been wondering if Iâ€™m bipolar, depressed, have ADHD something or ya know maybe what Iâ€™ve been feeling is just the norm these days ... lol

Like one week Iâ€™ll be fine and able to focus on my school work and the next Iâ€™m looking at it like itâ€™s the plague and I canâ€™t focus for my life. Iâ€™ve never been diagnosed with anything but Jesus I sure feel like I have some kind of mental disorder.
