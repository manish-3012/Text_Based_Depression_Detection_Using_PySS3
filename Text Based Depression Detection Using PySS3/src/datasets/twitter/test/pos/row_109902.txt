Posting something I am greatful for for 7 days day 5 LOL I forgot to post this in the morning, so I am posting this at night, but anyways here we go. I am greatful for the skills and talents I have. Now this sub is filled with a bunch of self deprecating teens who are horny and claim to be depressed (At least most of the clam to be depressed but are not and it is not a good thing to put up this facade especially considering the fact that depression is a serious problem) We all have talents, skills and, great attributes. For example I know how to fence and fight with swords. I am glad I have that skill, it has brought me to become a better person and has helped me make a lot of friends. If you don't have a prominent talent go and find one, there will be people in life that will help you pursue these things. Sometimes it won't be easy but it push forward, hiding all day in the corner won't do anything good either.
