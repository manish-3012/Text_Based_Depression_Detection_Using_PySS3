I have a somewhat simple thought. Instead of samurai mastering the blade. What if they mastered the gun. Basically Iâ€™m thinking, feudal Japan has the musket and gunpowder introduced and instead of samurai being trained in the way of the blade they instead learn to use the muskets. And they get to a point where they are basically sniper with them. Just masters of it. And Japan become full of gun slinging samurai and Ronan. And yeah the weapon would trickle down to the lower levels of soldiers but they donâ€™t have the skill and mastery of men trained from birth to use the weapon. The rifles are beautiful, masterfully made, engraved with the finest of engravings, common for houses to hand them down generation to generation. And then men can hit a flying dove from at least 500 meters. There would be other guns too not just long rang rifles. Some would carry blunderbusses, some multiple pistols. 

This is just something my friends and I thought up last night and I wanted to share it with the world. What do you think of it. Anything you would like to add go ahead. I just love this idea.
