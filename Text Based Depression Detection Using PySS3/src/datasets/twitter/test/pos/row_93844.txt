My parents are making me go to bed at 9:00PM consistently, how do I change their minds? My dad is always saying â€œYou are my son, and Iâ€™m your father so I know whatâ€™s rightâ€. Then he says â€œI have watched you since you were a baby and I know you need 11 hours of sleepâ€ I think that is a ridiculous and stupid argument. They claim they know more about me than me. I always get scolded for talking back and making a defence. Even my teachers say â€œyou should get around 8 hours of sleep and he saysâ€ well I donâ€™t care what they say, I know best, so go to bed nowâ€ an argument I make is â€œIâ€™m no ever tired I always lie in bed until midnightâ€. They say â€œthatâ€™s fine just chillâ€. This argument makes my blood boil with rage. They are treating me like Iâ€™m 7 years old and This needs stop. Seriously help me change their minds.
