FRICK YOU BIN LADEN I trusted you, we got to the last 4. One person was proven innocent and there was 1 imposter left. I was most likely innocent, so were you. So we called a meeting. We voted josh off. We thought it was the right thing.

Josh was not an imposter.

Oh shit they think it's me. I hurry to do my only visual task to prove I'm innocent. Bin Laden... You killed me. After I trusted you were innocent, after we got to three people and I presented evidence to protect you...

You betrayed me Bin Laden, and I thought you were on my side. This is why I have trust issues.

Thanks for coming to my rant on the sneaky Bin Laden.
