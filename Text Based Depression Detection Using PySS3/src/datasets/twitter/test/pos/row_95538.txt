As a wise man once said years ago I thought it would be good to share this Kimi started 7th, but after his 1st stop was informed that his brakes were critical needed to be looked after. This prompted him to convert into a 1 stop strategy as passing anyone was impossible due to brake issues. Which in turn meant he must go make his tyres last like Duracell till race end (as he had pitted way early for a 1-stop strategy since they changed tyres originally for a 2-stopper).

This strategy saw him run 2nd till 75% of the race, but soon other drivers like Rosberg, Webber etc started lapping 2 seconds quicker as his tyres reached critical wear and overtook him.

Grosjean, started 17th, also did one stopper but ran a much longer 1st stint as was his original plan. His pace was very good as well and he jumped lots of car due to this strategy and soon caught up with Kimi who now was visibly struggling with poor brakes and bald tyres.

Overtaking him would have been easy for Grosjean who now was 2 seconds faster himself but made a hash of his manoeuvre. Kimi made it difficult and defended with what he got, while Grosjean was impatient in the braking zone and was promptly forced wide off track.

Since Grosjean isn't that good overall at judging overtaking even with major tyre advantage and Massa was giving him a hard time 1 second behind, Lotus thought it's better to shout explicit at Kimi to give way instead of passing a calm team order like every normal team would do. This was also the first call Lotus made to Kimi, there wasn't any previous message about the situation.

Kimi promptly told Permane "Don't shout there fucker, will let him pass when I get the chance but not in fast corners".

Kimi eventually let Grosjean pass at lap end, and pitted with 2 laps to go for new tyres as his tyres were done, finishing 7th.
