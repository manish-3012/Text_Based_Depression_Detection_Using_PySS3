I wanna fight someone Honestly I know how unhealthy this is but Christ I just wanna beat the shit out of someone. No particular person (though I have a few I wouldn't be opposed to) but I just want someone to initiate something and hell even if I lose I'll be satisfied. My life is a mess and I won't be seeking out conflict or anything but after 15 years of avoiding confrontation I just wanna go all out and fucking destroy someone. Before you comment something about my ego or how stupid and unhealthy it is, I am aware but I'm just voicing a small feeling
