IBrokeUpWithMyâ€Bfâ€Wooo! I was initially breaking up with him bc I wasn't mentally ready, my mental health has been terrible lately. I sent him a long ass message that explains everything and y this was my fault, etc. One of the first things he responded was, â€œi don't accept itâ€ like wtf he doesn't have any mental illnesses how can he say that he just â€œcant accept thisâ€ then he tried to guilt trip me many times:â€I was the happiest person it the world when I was with youâ€, â€œYou made me want to change and be a better personâ€ etc. Then I realized how clingy and too much into this supposedly â€œcasual relationshipâ€ we agreed to have. He fucking asked to say I Love you before a week of dating. We were only dating for 10days before I broke up with him. I feel like I dodged a major bullet. Welp thanks for coming to my TedTalk:) (btw this was my first relationship and I took it way better than him who has been in a couple)
