I really need help with school work Hey guys, so I havenâ€™t done any school work for over a month now because weâ€™re online, and Iâ€™ve lost all motivation. My grades are obviously dropping and Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™ve also been skipping a lot of my classes. I feel hopeless and depression has taken over my life. I donâ€™t leave my bed unless I need to get food or use the bathroom. Everytime I want to start on homework, I get so overwhelmed and my anxiety skyrockets. Any advice on how I can begin?
