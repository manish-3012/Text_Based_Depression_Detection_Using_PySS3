im just depressed again idk wat to write here, i guess im just gonna vent...

i still like my friend, she been my crush for like a year now, we started being friends like 3 years ago and i cant get over her... i already ask her out a couple months ago but she said no and she saw me as a brother which is dumb cause we always call back then we were so close she once even kinda cuddle with me but the dumbass i am not wanting hope i said it was gay making her stop it like im not kidding she lay her head in my shoulder but im just retarted and she said she doesn't want to date ppl inside our friend group which is also stupid af how are you gonna not date someone inside it cause all of our friends are in the friend group you dont just date some random stranger its stupid you have to meet them and get to know them ya know????
maybe im just being over proctive.... i just care a lot for her i may not be able to conformt very well but atleast i try making her forget her problems when she down by saying a joke... i just.... like seeing her happy.... ya know... even if i cant be her boyfriend i just want to try my best so she doesn't get used by some retarted boy or girl (she bi), i want her to have a good life atleast... she the only girl i ever have crushed hard on... we have so much in common and the same humor and shit.... she just perfect...

I just love her ya know....
