I finally catched the courage to post my opinion on homophobia and homosexuality I agree that homosexuality is a sin (written in: Leviticus 18:22) and am not very comfortable with it, but at the end of the day LGBTQ+ members are people as well and they shall he treated equally because they are also human beings, they are not any type of monster or anything, not because a person don't like how someone thinks they are going to hate them, so i don't get why some people hate LGBTQ+, BUT i really get mad when they teach that to children making it look as if it is okay, for example my little brother, he started to watch gacha life films and he thought being gay was okay so now he is, and my bro 9 years old, so my main point is that homosexuality is not okay, but not because of someone thinks different, they are going to hate them, love is love and that's a fact, if someone is gay let them be, it doesn't harm you in any way, but they should not make children think that it's a good thing to be or that it's okay, thanks for comming to my ted talk.
