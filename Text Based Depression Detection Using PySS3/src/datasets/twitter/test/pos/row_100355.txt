16m looking to make some new online friends About me-i live in Ohio and have all my life. Im a very open and talkative person and love meeting new people. Im available almost all of the time to talk. Im here looking to meet some new friends preferably from ohio but idm anywhere. I play a lot of xbox and love cod, warzone, doom, ark, Minecraft, and a bunch of other games. I have a wide music taste but i mainly listen to 90s rap and im a huge eazy e and geto boys fan. I also read a lot and i love the post apocalypse genre and my favorite author is mark tufo. If you wanna chat/be friend's feel free to message me. :)
