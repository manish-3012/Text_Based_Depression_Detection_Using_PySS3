my exbestfriend ( I just want to kind of let it go) my ex-bestfreind was nice in the start but eventually she began taking advantage of me. I'm a really oblivious person sometimes and the 'quiet kid' of the class at the time. even my mom didn't like her. I remember very clearly this one time i asked her if she was playing with the 'popular girls' and spreading lies about me so that she would become popular? she straight up answered with yes. and because i have a hard time hating people (and being oblivious) she would convince me my bully wasn't bullying me. and that she was just a little mean. and that i was just jealous of the other girls not hurt by them not wanting to play with me. luckily my teachers noticed that i didn't play with anyone but her. they tried to kind of separate us, so that i would get social with the other kids. and that slowly made me realize what she was doing. i tried to 'break up' with her but she just began spreading rumers. then i tried again she began crying hysterically, so i said i was just joking. sometime after that a girl that had started in our school a year before became our friend. slowly me and the girl became bestfreinds but my other bestfreind didn't like that.( i'll call my exbest freind Britney from now on, since i got a knew one). Britney said she was jealous that i had two bestfreinds, and that i wasn't aloud to have another bestfreind.  meanwhile she had three other bestfreinds. ofc this time i didnt listen to her. my other bestfreind made me realize what britney was doing. she asked if i ever had treid to 'break up' with Britney, and i said yes. so that day i go up to Britney during lunch and  tell her i don't wanna be freinds anymore. she storms of to the bath room. I'm alot happier without her. my bestfreind has helpped me alot. :)
