Letter ideas? So, I just got my letter that would go on a letterman jacket, but I donâ€™t want to do that. I am a band nerd, so nothing else would go onto said jacket except the letter and pins. Iâ€™ve seen display cases that seniors do when they graduate, but I donâ€™t really feel like I want to do that. Any ideas of how I can display it or possibly wear it?
