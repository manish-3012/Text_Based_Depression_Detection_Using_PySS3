I got mononucleosis at 6 years old Mononucleosis is a disease spread by saliva and causes swelling of glands and organs and extreme fatigue. 

No this isnâ€™t a joke, and no I donâ€™t know how I got it. I was on vacation with my family and I was spiking a fever of 103Â°F (39Â°C) every night and breaking out into hives. We called the nurse of the resort to help but she essentially told my mom this shit was above her pay grade and to take me to a doctor when I got home.

On the flight back, I woke up with the fever AND the hives. I also threw up medicine they tried to give me. So we went to the doctor the next day and he felt my throat. He said it was a good thing they brought me in, as the glands in my throat were nearly swollen shut. We had to get a blood test right then and there, and the blood lab was nearly closed. 

(The blood test sparked my fear of needles)

The results came back a day later since this was an urgent case, and a different doctor drew in her breath as she looked at the results. Apparently my liver enzyme levels were 3x higher than normal, indicating my organs had swollen up. 

Now, getting this disease so young doesnâ€™t cause the fatigue symptoms, so I could attend school normally, but I could not participate in gym or recess for about a month. If a ball hit my stomach, my spleen could have exploded. 

Idk why I felt the need to share this but Iâ€™ve been thinking about it lately
