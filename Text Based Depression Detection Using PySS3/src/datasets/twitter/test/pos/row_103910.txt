I see a lot of yâ€™all here asking what you should do about somebody close to you having suicidal thoughts. The answer is just be there for them. Make sure they know that they positively impact your life. If your crush is having suicidal thoughts, then maybe go for it. Give them a self esteem boost. Just love them. If youâ€™re going through something similar then talk to them about your problems as it makes them feel safe with opening up about theirs. Talk to them about how you think theyâ€™re gonna do great in the future. This is coming from someone who wishes that his friends did the same for him and lost his friend/crush to suicide, so Iâ€™d like to think I know a thing or two.
