I need help making my room, â€œmyâ€ room My room right now is pretty bare bones. Itâ€™s got a bed, and a shelf. Thatâ€™s it. The shelf-cubby-thing has a whole bunch of shit in it. My room is downstairs so my window is a fire escape with dead leaves and crap in it so not to good to look at either. Then my closet doesnâ€™t have doors on it so you can just see my clothes and other crap o have in there. (My room is also very hot. Not sure how thatâ€™ll play into anything)


So with that being said if anybody has any guides to help make a bedroom look habitable and a place where I can spend time in, I would greatly appreciate it. I see my friendâ€™s rooms and they just look like suck a comfy place to be, and when I return home I just get all sad at my room. 

Sorry if this is a weird post, we never got around to fixing my room after we had a flood.
