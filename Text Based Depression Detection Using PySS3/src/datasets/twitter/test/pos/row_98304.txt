When will this all end? How long until we get a vaccine? How long after that will it take for widespread access to the vaccine?  how long will I have to stayed cooped up in my home? How long before I can hug my friends again? 

I do not believe the virus is a hoax at all,  I will diligently wear my mask and social distance for however long this takes. What's really affecting me is the isolation. It feels like they're is no light at the end of the tunnel and I'll have to be isolated forever.
