God must not want me to have chips (or crisps if your from the UK i think). I just got some chips (or crisps) again. I had them in my hand and i was walking to my room and tripped. This wouldn't be that big of a problem but there was wood right in front of where i tripped making my nose hit the wood. It also broke my chips (crisps)
