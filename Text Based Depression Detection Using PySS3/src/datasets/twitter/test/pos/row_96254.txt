Thoughts about the new Ternion award It was added a few hours ago, and it costs 50'000 coins, the equivalent of 125 USD. That is a lot of money. I personally am not against Reddit for adding it, because it's their decision and they're forcing no one to buy it. It's just there. But a post that is so meaningful for someone to spend 125 dollars on it seems pretty rare. What is your opinion on the award?
