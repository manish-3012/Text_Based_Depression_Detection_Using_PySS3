Pizza stories. Pizza crust **used** to be the best part of the pizza. When I was 3 years-old, I loved the pizza crust. I would eat the crust first and then the rest of the pizza. It was better than the entirety of the pizza. I even pointed to the entire crust when one of my uncles asked me what slice of pizza I wanted. I would wait for a few minutes for the pizza to cool down, then the crust was crunchy, yet a bit chewy. I'll repeat it again: It **used** to be the best part of the pizza. But the my ideals changed when I was 5.

When I was 5, that was when I properly ate pizza. From the tip of the slice to the crust. I realized that I was a fool, ignorant of all this flavor left over. It was astonishing to eat it. Then the crust fell lower when I had a certain type of pizza: Aldi frozen pizza.

Now, Aldi frozen pizza is okay... but the crust? I wouldn't try to eat it with brittle teeth. It is the hardest fucking thing in my pizza experience. When I had braces, I tried to eat the Aldi crust. What happened? Well I ate it. I ate it, with no pain. But if 7 year-old me ate it, all of my loose teeth would fall out.

Here's another story of pizza crust. When I was 9 years old, I found out that some people don't eat pizza crust, and instead leave it on the pan. I was disgusted. I was thinking *"Why would you do this? Even if the crust has no flavor, just eat it! If you are a functioning human, eat the goddamn crust!"* I couldn't stand how you would ignore pizza crust. It's so fucking long, that you can't ignore it!

Then I came up with this saying a couple of days ago after a certain someone I follow on twitter said something about them not eating pizza crust.

# "If you can't eat the fucking crust, then in my eyes, you are the same status as what you think pizza crust is."

A summary of what you just read: 3 year-old me liked pizza crust, 2 years later I found out about the rest of the pizza's flavor. Aldi frozen pizza has a crust with the hardness of a brick, yet is still chewable. 9 year-old me then found out that people don't eat the crust and I took offense to that. Someone on twitter said that they don't eat pizza crust. So, I came up with the saying above this paragraph.

This is the end of my telling my of pizza backstories.

Please don't harass anyone that you think may have said that they don't eat pizza crust.
