I'm so demotivated that I've stopped doing most of my hobbies Everything except cooking, I have given up on. Swimming, art and programming are all a distant memory and I don't cook much at all. I would get really misserable because I know that I will never be good at it at all and whenever I would want to do it, I would lose all motivation the second after. I just sit blindly at my desk all day wasting my time daydreaming and procrastinating. What do I do? Is there any hope?
