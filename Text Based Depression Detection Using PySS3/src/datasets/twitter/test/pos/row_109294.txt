I really cant understand how people of my age have so many friends and be so social I mean i always sit alone in my room every day and never get any messages or anything and they just straight up are always with friends and always chatting with people 

Is it just me that i am the only one whoâ€™s gonna ignore my birthday like its the fucking plague and just gonna wait for the day to end?! I mean they all have 50 people on their birthday but i probably can only get 5 anyway 

Why they all so social, i cant say a fucking word normal and im almost happy we need to go into a second lockdown 

I already loose my shit when we need to give a presentation in front of the class and if i have to read something in class 

Why am i such a fucking introvert?! Is it because ima weeb or something or a metalhead?! 

Jesus i just wanna be social
