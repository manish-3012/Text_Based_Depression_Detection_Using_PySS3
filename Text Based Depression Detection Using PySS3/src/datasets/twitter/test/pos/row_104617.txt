These cheap $60 earbuds sound amazing They're IEMs technically, which are called TFZ T2

And I have ones that are more expensive. But these aren't necessarily better or (much) worse, they're just different and have very good sounding bass

They're definitely far better than any bluetooth earbuds, I've had the best ones that cost like $300, and with those you're just paying for stupid useless features. And these are wired which definitely sucks for walking and shit, which I bought a bluetooth adapter for since the cable is removable and makes them totally wireless. That was $80 so it's still cheaper than airpods and shit.

And I just go for a walk and vibe while listening to music. Listening to music with other earbuds I had was getting so boring tbh and I'd skip through songs and not rly be into anything, but these I want to stay on a single song and actually finish it. Because there's so much music besides like pop and rap that you really need hifi sound with to take advantage of, where you can hear separate sounds in the music that sound like they're coming from very different directions in the soundstage.
