I feel kinda sad thinking about how women get called twitch thots for literally just streaming and accepting donations, just like guys Like if they wear really suggestive clothing I get it but if they're literally just streaming and they get called sluts and thots then that's really toxic. What do you want them to do, wear guy clothes? I'm tired of everyone being an asshole to girls because they wear a normal shirt that happens to be a little tight so you can see a tiny bit of their body shape so they get called thots but when guys stream shirtless it's totally fine and okay. This is why we don't have as many women in the gaming industry, they don't fucking get respect because people have decided that guys &gt; girls.
