itâ€™s kinda stupid arguing with people about food Sorry Iâ€™m really tired, so this isnâ€™t gonna make much sense. Whenever people fight about things like pineapple on pizza one personâ€™s like â€œew thatâ€™s so gross get that shit away from meâ€ and the other person doesnâ€™t understand bc it tastes good to them. Thereâ€™s really no way to get the other person to understand bc they donâ€™t have the same tastebuds. Just a random thought idk
