i'm getting a gaming laptop and even though the specs are good i've lost all trust in any laptop i get, so i feel like it's just gonna be like every other laptop every other laptop i've gotten from my parents, even when i pay for half and ask for good specs, they all turn out garbage and can barely run minecraft at 30 fps. i fucking hate this. i have trust issues when it comes to laptops now
