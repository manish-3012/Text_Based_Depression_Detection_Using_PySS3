In Terraria you fight: A big golem made by flying snakes and lizard people, and is composed of bricks harder than titanium

I giant thick wall of human flesh that can shoot lasers and vomit leeches

A god of both the moon and space with eyes on his hands that shoot searing beams of lunar light

A psychic teleporting brain that lives in the depths of a land made from flesh and blood, amongst the dripping beating hearts of the underground

And a fucking plant!!

My favorite game ever
