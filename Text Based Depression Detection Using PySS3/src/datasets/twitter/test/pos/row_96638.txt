I don't know what to do. I'm so stuck. I'm 15. I'm overweight and always in front of a screen. My dad regularly yells at me and says how useless and disappointing I am. Saying I don't know sizes and shapes of wrenches. I don't know anything. If we went to war, I would die first. Saying I can't shoot guns (I can, fairly well. Actually shot better at targets than he did). Says I do nothing around the house yet I do everything my parents ask and regularly stop to see how they're doing. Says if I got a job I would be useless. I had a job, worked there for 8 months before I left because they paid me jackshit. I'm in ROTC and exercise strenuously every Friday. I have pretty bad sleeping issues so I often nap after school once I make sure all chores are done and work is finished. He mentioned how if out house got broken into I wouldn't know and would die. He says that were on the brink of war and that you get shot for just being outside. Yet he tells me to go outside and interact with people. Me and a friend go over to each other's houses every week by bike yet he says I have no one and never hang out with people. Says I fail in relationships when I've been in one for 2 years (as of the 25th). When I worked for my grandpa I worked two days and had very severe sunburn afterwards and was told to take off until it healed. He never called me back and my dad said it was because he knew my "reputation" (what fucking reputation). Guys, I'm stuck. No matter what I do it seems like it's not enough. I'm tired of feeling useless but I don't think they really care.
