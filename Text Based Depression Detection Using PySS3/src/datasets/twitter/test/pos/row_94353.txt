Time for me to feel shit about myself It's that time of the year, the one where I have to socialise with family, I hate my family, they expect to just perform tricks, I'm honestly a dog to them.

It's also that I have to pretend I've got a life, that I don't only have online friends and that I'm not dealing with serious mental shit, I hate Christmas, it's just trying to find a good present for someone who you care about and you have to show how much they mean to you with a gift it's stupid.

And my family know I play guitar, if I played then they'd hate it, I'm honestly going to struggle when my dad's parents come to his. They're going to expect me to play, and they'll expect classical music or something, I'll probably give them a heart attack if I play anything I like.

This is fucking ridiculous the way that where I live they're letting people meet up and break quarantine for one fucking day, and I'm going to have to try and remember all of my extended family's names. Then I'll have to talk to them as if I'm a mentally stable human being who doesn't just want to leave.

What else? Other than cope with the little kids screaming their fucking heads off that they wanted a different gift, deal with pretending to like my parents, trying to not walk out and just run (I know the area much better than them and could lose them in the woods) and then just trying to not shout at someone.

I just want to spend Christmas away from my family, but I don't have any friends to hide out at, I also just want to be able to just not show up, stay at home, talk to someone online who isn't pretending they like me just because I'm related to them. That's my dream, just being away from everyone and not struggling to cope with the same song on repeat because everyone thinks it's cute seeing the little kids sing it, it was cute the first time, not the 15th, and I just want to make everyone hate me so I have an excuse not to go, I'm just really stressed about this shit, does it show?
