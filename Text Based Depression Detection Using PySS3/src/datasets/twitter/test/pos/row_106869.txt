Iâ€™m a 15 y/o republican in a democratic state I live in a rural area of a democratic state and people are constantly making fun of me and talking shit because just Iâ€™m a republican, is there anything I can do to keep people from treating me like dirt?

Edit: not that anybody really cares but I come from a military family
