I failed No Nut November It all happened so fast...

I was craving a snack, as one does. However, due to COVID quarantine, we're somewhat low on food. We're not gonna starve, but that's about it. I looked everywhere for something small to chew on, and just as I was about to give up, I saw it - a half-full package of salted peanuts.

I thought about it for a while. What's NNN good for anyway? Unable to come up with an answer that would satisfy me, I indulged in the peanuts. This must've angered the gods of NNN, as my stomach ached for about half an hour after that. Or I just ate too much peanuts at once. Who knows.

Let this be a lesson for you - if you're taking NNN seriously and nevertheless have nuts somewhere in your domicile, make sure there's also a more enticing alternative. I wish you all courage and good luck.
