ive had enough of the "im sad because my crush said ew when i asked her out" posts 9/10 girls will NOT say ew, only if you really stink or generally dont take care of yourself or are creepy. I am not saying that this never happens even if you arent any one of those things, but this is reddit after all. im trying not to be mean but its the truth. i used to be really unfit and overweight and generally really unattractive and socially awkward (I used to quote cringey memes all the time) and once i started skateboarding and bmx i dropped 20kg and started taking care of my self more often, and just generally becoming more self aware. Im not trying to brag, I really am not. But since ive done that i get alot more attention from girls. if you're sick and tired of getting called gross take a long hard stare at yourself and think, what can i work on to make myself more attractive?
