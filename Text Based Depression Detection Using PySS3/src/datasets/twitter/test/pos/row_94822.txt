Just opened a reddit loot box and got this wholesome 100 award.... imma give it to myself since there aren't any wholesome posts on reddit. please don't call me egoist and if anyone else give me an award then they should reconsider their spendings. awards are useless. If this reaches this place called hot then that would be really stupid and I would totally delete my reddit account because fuck it why not.
