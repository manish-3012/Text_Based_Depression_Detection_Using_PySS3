Been a while since Iâ€™ve posted but hereâ€™s an update on my crush situation from a long time ago We have gone on ice skating dates and more movie dates and weâ€™ve been to each otherâ€™s houses many times. My family (my dog included) loves her. I think her family likes me. The pandemic and shutdown had made us drift a little bit but weâ€™re dating now. Iâ€™m sorry for being inactive yâ€™all
