bees are cute af but i'm still super scared of them like, they're cute if you look at them from close up on video (like, i would legit have a dog-sized bee as a pet ngl if it wouldn't fly away) but if they're near me physically and they're like flying and shit they're so fucking scary like aaaa their flight is super unpredictable and idk if they're going to sting me or not

and if there are dead bees (or any dead insect, even flies) on the floor i try my best to avoid that area because i'm afraid that they would spring back to life and attack me

why am i such a pussy
