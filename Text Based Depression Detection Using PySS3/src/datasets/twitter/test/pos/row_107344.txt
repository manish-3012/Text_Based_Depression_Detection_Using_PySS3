Hello and Goodbye! Well itâ€™s almost time, Iâ€™ve never really post on this sub but today is my last day as a teenager as I will be turning 20 tomorrow. I wish I knew about this sub when I was younger, I probably wouldâ€™ve helped to have someone to listen to my problems which seem dumb in hindsight. 

A little advice for yall, donâ€™t sweat the small stuff! Things might seem like the end of the world now but are really dumb in hindsight. For example, for a lot of my teens I really wanted to learn how to drive and get a car. I was a big point of contention between me and my parents because I thought they didnâ€™t really like me because they wouldnâ€™t teach me how to drive. I thought when i did my life would change completely and finally be exciting and worthwhile. But after i Iearned and got a car nothing really changed. I basically just go on errands now. So something that seemed really important to me really wasnâ€™t a big deal. I know this doesnâ€™t apply to everyone, but i just ask that you always keep and open mind

good luck to you all!
