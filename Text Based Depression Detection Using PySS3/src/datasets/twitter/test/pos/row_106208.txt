Ex girlfriend drama So the other night my ex gf who im still friends with, even tho we kinda fell off, sent me pics of us from when we were dating and said â€œhere are some mems :)â€ I told her that that was a little weird and lowkey disrespectful to my current relationship and that I knew she wasnâ€™t reminiscing (she prob was tbh...) but it just sends the wrong message with the way she was talking ab them. The pics werenâ€™t of us kissing or anything but it was stuff of us from dates and concerts we went to. So am I tripping for thinking thatâ€™s kinda weird and off putting or am I a dick?
