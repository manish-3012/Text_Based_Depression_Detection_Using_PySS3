God fucking dammit I canâ€™t fucking believe myself. Iâ€™ve fallen for some fucking girl. How can I fucking do this to myself? Sheâ€™s so fucking great. Blonde fucking hair and a fucking smile and laugh that just fucking melts me inside. Sheâ€™s sorta fucking short and itâ€™s real fucking cute. Iâ€™ve never had this fucking problem before with crushes, but for some fucking reason I get real nervous trying to fucking talk to her. Like even at the fucking idea of it. This has never happened to me before! Iâ€™m usually fucking social but this fucking girl has made all my fucking systems malfunction. Iâ€™ll never fucking be with her because I canâ€™t fucking talk to her
