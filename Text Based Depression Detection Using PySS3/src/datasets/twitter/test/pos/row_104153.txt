Well, I finally know what I want to do about my situation. What I will do is absolutely *nothing* Before I was too focused on what I will have to say to say to her and less focused on myself. Now I will do the opposite.

I will be more focused on myself and less focused on her. I did it once a year ago I can do it now.
