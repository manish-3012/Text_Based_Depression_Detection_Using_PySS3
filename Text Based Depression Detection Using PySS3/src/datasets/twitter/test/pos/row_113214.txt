Horrific videos are being used as weapons at my school. Today, all of the parents at my school got an email. It was about a live-streamed suicide that was trending on Tik Tok. I donâ€™t know of any other people have come across this, but it was a recording of a man putting a shotgun to his head and ending his own life. This post isnâ€™t another Reddit good, Tik Tok bad post but there are horrible people on both apps. With the actual video being horrific, the comment section was even worse. Many, many people said that they were disturbed by the video and that it ought to be taken down but there were quite a few others who were saying horrible, shocking things. Things such as â€œlolâ€ and â€œonly children would be scared of thisâ€. Whilst this was downright sickening, the worst was still to come. People began sharing it around the school and it was only a matter of time before somebody close in my family got involved in one way or another. She, a year seven who started on Monday, was sent the video. She wasnâ€™t on Tik Tok and wanted to know what was going on. What she say was something that no 11 year old should never ever see. I am horrified that somebody in their right mind had the guts to send this to an innocent child for a laugh. Tik Tok is a great site which has some amazing content and inspires many people. But please, please, please never share something that you wouldnâ€™t want sent to a younger person. Stuff like this can ruin lives and take months for a child to forget. And please, if you are ever having suicidal thoughts please speak to someone. The world is a better place with you. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk and please remember, you are not alone.
