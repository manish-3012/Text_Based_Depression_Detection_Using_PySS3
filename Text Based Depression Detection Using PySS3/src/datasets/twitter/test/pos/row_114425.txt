lookng for someone so the last few days i had been talking to someone by the username u/KindlySo, and today it says in the chat \[deleted\] over their name, and I cant view their account, please if anyone knows her or is able to tell me what happened, please do. this is really irritating to me because things was going well and we were talking and such and i'd like to find out what happened. This is not the first time this happened but it's the first time where i'm genuinely upset about it.
