so I opened my papers folders today and I saw this drawing of a hot guy and a hot girl I made and I remembered that then last year I was tryna figure out just how bi I am and I am very very bi and I don't know how I figured that out with drawings. well anime was a big part but whatever.



that's it. thank you for reading. do you like ducks?
