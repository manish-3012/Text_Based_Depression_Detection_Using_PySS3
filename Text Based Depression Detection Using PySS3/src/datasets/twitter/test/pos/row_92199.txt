i'm officially part pansexual so basically who i'm (14m) romantically/sexually attracted to is decided by their traits, each of their traits gives them an increase or decrease on their number, if the number is higher than a certain barrier and there aren't any deal breaking traits left to discover, it will be defined to my brain as a crush, their gender is a big factor but even if they're male if all their other traits are good enough i can develop feelings for them
it's a very systematical and mathematic way of doing this but i can't change it, my brain is my brain
there's a similar method for friendship but it's a different number for each person and different scaling per trait like how gender matters much less


i then had a boy ask me out and him giving hints though saying it was a joke really confused my autistic brain but eventually i straight up asked him whether he was into me or not, he was and we chatting a bit, his compliments completely melted my heart and i fell for him, i can now call myself part pan since i do like all genders though it's a biased for girls
