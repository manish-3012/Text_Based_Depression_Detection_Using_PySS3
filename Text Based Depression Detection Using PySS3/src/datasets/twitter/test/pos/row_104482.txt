Guys don't care about boob/ass sizes 
I posted this here yesterday but deleted it in fear that my girlfriend would see this post, but then I realized I honestly don't care if she sees this so yeah lol

I'm a guy, and I honestly don't care about how big my partner's boobs/ass is, and the guys that I'm friends with think the same. It's something about you that you can't change, and the guys with a brain actually understand that. Edit: I am NOT speaking for every guy.

If you have a small boobs/ass that's okay. Hell, I honestly prefer small and average over big ones, and I'm sure many others do as well. Plus, I'm pretty sure they are easier to spoon! Just gotta wait for the right guy (or girl!) Don't worry if you're small, because if someone decides to break up with you over boobs/ass size, at least you figured out they were a jerk, and who the fuck wants to be with a jerk? If you can't give a guy an orgasm because of your boobs/ass, you still have your hands and mouth. Just learn to use them and I'm sure you and your partner would both have a good time :) Also, I'd rather have someone a small or average size to cuddle rather than something big that could potentially crush my cock. However, if I end up having sex with a girl who is big boobs/ass, that's perfectly okay with me too! I'd just make sure to have good communication with them.

Now I'm not gonna leave out the ones who are huge. Most people think "Bruh they got a gigantic dick why would they be self-conscious?" There are some stories of guys crying because their partner was too big, so some women are afraid they'll hurt their partner. Don't worry. Ask if they can handle it, and if they can then great! If they can't, just go slow and try not to go all the way in, and always have communication. Ask if you could go deeper, or if they're in too much pain and they need a break. Communication is key for you and your partner to give each other a good time :) If you can't get a guy to orgasm, once again, you got your hands and mouth! Ask them what feels good and you guys will both be perfectly fine.

You girls shouldn't worry too much about boobs/ass size. This even goes into height! You don't need to be 6ft or smaller. I'm 5'2" and my girlfriend is probably around 4'11" or 5ft. If a someone actually loves you, they'll care about who YOU are more than your height and boobs/ass size. And don't be sad if you haven't found that person yet. You're young, and still have the homies :&gt;

But that's all! I hope this post gave all of you men a bit more confidence in yourselves :D


Edit: Okay so I'm bad with words sometimes so I apologize for any misunderstandings in this post. Yes, you guys can all have preferences, I just meant that if you're being an asshole about your partner's size - something they have no control over - you don't have a brain. I said I preferred small and average over big, but that doesn't mean I'm against having sex and enjoying it with someone who has a big package. And no, I'm not speaking for every guy, I'm just saying that you girls shouldn't be so self-conscious thinking every guy cares about size. So please chill out in the comments, especially since this is kinda blowing up and I'd rather not see any arguments in here.
