I just want to talk about chosen family for a second here I know I'm a teenager, so it's a little different, but I just want to talk about this for a second. I have a really amazing chosen family. for those of you that don't know what a chosen family is, it's basically a group of friends that are there for you no matter what. it doesn't mean we actually have a family dynamic, but it just means that we care about each other and pretty much consider ourselves a family. I have a really wonderful group of friends at school. most of us are queer and/or trans, almost all of us have mental health issues, family issues, and just a lot of baggage, but we're here for each other no matter what. honestly, I think I owe them my life. I'm not even kidding. I have had so much shit happen to me over the last few years, but these people have been there for me through all of it. I have never been suicidal before because every time I'm hurting, all I have to do is think of them, and I know it's worth sticking around. honestly, they're my ride-or-dies. I can literally talk to them about anything, and I know that they're there for me no matter what. but it's an equal relationship. part of why it works is because I will always be there for them when they need it. I can trust them, they can trust me, and it's just an amazing feeling. I don't know where I would be without them, to be honest. I hope that all of you can find yourself amazing people that are there for you like my friends are for me.
