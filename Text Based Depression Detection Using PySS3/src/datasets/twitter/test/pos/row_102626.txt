Aight boys Iâ€™m gonna need your help on this one. Alright so, Iâ€™m into this girl right? Weâ€™ve been talking for a lilâ€™ while so I tell her how I feel about her. She said at times sheâ€™s attracted to me but then other times she sees me as just a friend. Weâ€™ve agreed that sometime soon weâ€™re going to try dating to see how it goes. Is this a good sign or not? Iâ€™ve never been in a situation like this before and I just need to know if this is a good sign or not.
