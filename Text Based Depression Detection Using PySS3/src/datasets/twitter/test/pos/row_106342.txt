I got all dressed up and pretty only to be disappointed Yesterday my father told my siblings and I that our grandparents were visiting. I got very excited because they rarely come over because â€˜itâ€™s so farâ€™ (probably around 45 mins to 1hr depending on the traffic). We rarely visit them because they live in a dangerous area and my father ainâ€™t tryna lose more family members. Anyhoo, I woke up bright and early this morning, helped my dad because his hand is injured, I did some chores and took care of my sick sister. Then I got dressed in my favorite leggings and favorite blue top. Blue is my fave color btw. I sat down and waited. They said that theyâ€™d come between 8 and 10am but 11 passed, then 12, and then 1. Itâ€™s almost 3pm. My father, not surprised, went out and closed the front gate. Iâ€™m super disappointed because I wanted to see them. Grandfather only came last month and spent less than 10 minutes but I see him every now and then when heâ€™s working with my dad (theyâ€™re both taxi drivers). Seeing grandma is a rarity, she didnâ€™t visit for several years. I feel like a freaking 7 year old for being upset about this. They couldnâ€™t even have the decency to call and say â€œWe canâ€™t make itâ€ or â€œWeâ€™re coming a bit later than expectedâ€. Iâ€™m just gonna take a nap. If they show up, fine then.
