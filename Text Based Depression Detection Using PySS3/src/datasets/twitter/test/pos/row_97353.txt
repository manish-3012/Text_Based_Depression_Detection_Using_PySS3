Idk i just wanted to let this out I have two siblings im the middle the oldest is getting spoiled by most of my family members and the youngest also is getting spoiled while I get nothing..

I asked my uncle if he could make me a study table a couple of days ago. earlier I asked howâ€™s my study table coming along he said its for your younger brother to be honest I should have expected it 

Anybody else relate? Or is it just me
