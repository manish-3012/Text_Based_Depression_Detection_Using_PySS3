I love you Hey you ðŸ‘‹

Yeah, YOU! The one scrolling through Reddit on Valentineâ€™s Day (Thatâ€™s okay by the way).

Just wanted to remind you that I love you. 

You are so special and brilliant in this world of ours. Literally no one can compare to you. 

Remember you are loved, not just by me, but by everyone here. 

Love is such a strong force. It can push tidal waves, and we are enveloping the world in water just for you. 

Just donâ€™t forget to push your own wave too.

Of course, thatâ€™s metaphorical, but as we snap back into reality, not much has changed. Because you are still loved.

I love you.

WE love you.

WE are all rooting for you.

And I hope you are rooting for yourself too.

*virtual hug*

Happy Valentineâ€™s Day â¤ï¸
