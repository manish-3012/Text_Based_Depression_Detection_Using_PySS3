interesting story that happened today so POV you accidentally feel asleep or slept in by accident causing you to miss a few lessons of online class and then you watch tik tok in class and your parental guardian sees on app called family link so they can see what you're doing they call you and tell you you're taking the absolute piss out of them and basically mocking them for watching tik tok during class so they delete basically every social media on your phone but they atleast leave Pokemon go, Pinterest, reddit,Twitter,Spotify and messenger however they do delete WhatsApp for no reason. this was for sleeping in a few times and watching tik tok in class but atleast I still have reddit and contact with one friend over twitter
