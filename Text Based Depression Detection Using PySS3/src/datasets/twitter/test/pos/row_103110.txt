Anyone else just kinda feeling down and have no idea why? Like Iâ€™ve been kinda all over the place today and donâ€™t even know why. You see people complain about being lonely and stuff but I donâ€™t think it usually effects me. I can get like this sometimes but idk, today it feels heavier or something 


Sorry this isnâ€™t some kinda meme or anything.
