Having friends is tiring I just start homeschool and have a discord server with some old friends from public school. Got really close to them over the years, but I have to constantly call them out for how insensitive they can be some times.

I have a real sensitive friend that they constantly mouth off every time theyâ€™re mad. Heck, theyâ€™ve even done it to my little brother... But every time I confront them, they say Iâ€™m â€œtoo niceâ€. When Iâ€™m pissed at them, itâ€™s because Iâ€™m overeating. Known them for years, but I think Iâ€™m done, and am going to try to find new peeps.
