Some kid accused me and some other kid who got 1st and 2nd in a while (In kahoot) of using "hacks". That kid legit went like "bRooo hEs hackiinG", but right after that, the kid who got first went and shunned him SO HARD LMAO. he legit just shut up and decided to rant in a free chat channel. 

It was the best experience ever.
