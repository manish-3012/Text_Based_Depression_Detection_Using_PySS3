My little brother told me he hates me today... I was messing around with my little brothers today and thought it would be funny to spray water at my brother, he got super mad and slammed his door, which pissed my dad off so he wanted to talk to him, he had me too. He made us hold these medicine balls (which arenâ€™t heavy but can get kind of exhausting after holding them for too long, we were standing up by the way) until we could figure it out. I was trying to talk to him but it was pissing him off even more, by the way he wasnâ€™t even facing me, I tried to get him to face me so we could actually communicate and get this over with, he wouldnâ€™t turn around so I moved around him, which he didnâ€™t like. So he decided to put his ball down and go upstairs to his room, all while screaming â€œI hate youâ€ and â€œI never want to see you again.â€ He came back down as per my dadâ€™s orders, went back to where he was and didnâ€™t face me. My dad told us he was going to intervene in 10 minutes unless we could figure it out ourselves. I told him to turn around so we could get this over with before the 10 minutes, he told me he would rather suffer through then have to look at me. So we stood there for 10 minutes not saying anything until my dad got my side of the story and asked how I could do better next time. He let me go but made my brother stay another 5 minutes.

Anyway, I know this is going to make me look horrible, which it will, and deservingly, but Iâ€™m going to actively avoid him to teach him to be carful of what he wishes. Thanks for reading.
