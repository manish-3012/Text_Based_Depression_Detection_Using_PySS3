My Fucked Up, Bipolar Life: Day 4 People:
M + G: My Two Girl Friends, also the only two people i will willingly talk to about my mind and my thoughts.

G, R or D: My guy Friends, help me stop thinking, not honest about my feelings with though.

Moods: 
1. Normal Me: Rarely shows, best version of me
2. Depressed Me: Just feel really down and sad. Usually leads to self harm, shaking and trembling and a inability to sleep.
3. Euphoric Rush Me: Sudden and random spurts of happiness, leads to uncontrollable eye movement and a need to move. Also leads to a inability to sleep.
4. Murderous Me: Worst version of me, physically cant stop, mentally cant stop. I am obsessed with homicide. This as well leads to a inability to sleep, but easily the worst.
5. Mix: Mix of two of them (usually 2 and 4) which just leads to absolute chaos.

Yesterdays Recap: Felt good. Slept a lot, dreamt well. School was school. But it was all around a good day. Not muched happened. Soild day. Normal Me was out in full force.

Today: I can feel my downfall starting..... with everyday that passes I feel worse and worse. I had online school, which is a blessing and a curse. A blessing because of how easy it is. But a curse because with all that time im not doing anything. I'm thinking. And thinking is bad, I hate my thoughts, id do anything to escape my thoughts. I spent most of the day, feeling down, laying in bed, hugging my pillow wishing M + G were there for me. I need them, more than anything else and when my mind runs, it feels like they are the only two that can stop it. It was also the start of my work week. And these are the days we're i usually feel the worst. My last 2/3 hours of my shift include me sitting in a chair doing nothing. Which also leads to bad thoughts. Plus I work alone, so its just me and silence. My brain usually has a field day, but I was able to occupy most of my time drawing flag football plays for my flag football team I coach. But..... with every second I am not staying occupied, I feel worse and worse. Nights are the worst. I send my goodnight hug texts to M + G and try to sleep. But, I cant help but think all night. Work sucked, super busy, school sucked, felt really depressed, very touched deprived. I still felt normal, but im definitely on the verge of my depressed self. Luckily, I've been able to hold off my demons lately and I've been lucky to keep normal me for as long as I have. But, tommorow is a new day and we will see.
