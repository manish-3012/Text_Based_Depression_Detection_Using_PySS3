About a girl So basically i have one girl in my middle school class and i love her, but I'm afraid that she might think she isn't good enough for me.

 I don't want to sound narcissistic or cool but i happen to be quite popular, good looking, being most athletic in my class and quite possibly in other classes as well and with good grades. While she is shy and quiet and doesn't have many friends outside or even in school. 

You would expext for someone like me to be with a popular and dumb whore that also likes to party but i happen to like those nice shy girls, and thus I'm worried that she may think she can't possibly be with me. 

Right now our school is closed and only lessons we will go to school for I don't have with her and quarantine will probably last some time. She doesn't read texts very often so that's not really the way I can contact her. 

Please can someone give me an idea or something for how to approach this situation.
