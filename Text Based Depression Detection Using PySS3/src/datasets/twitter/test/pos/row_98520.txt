never stop talking i think its super adorable when my boyfriend goes on lil tangents about stuff he thinks is interesting. hes such a nerd about certain things and seeing him get excited about them makes me so happy

i love that he has stuff he gets invested in because he thinks its interesting and feels comfortable enough to tell me about. sometimes he'll say things like "am i boring you?" and thinks i want to stop talking, when in reality its the opposite. 

yes, tell me why paper mario has sucked lately. yes the paper aspect was originally just an asthetic choice because it was like a STORY but then the company or whatever was like lets make it about PAPER specifically and also the people who make it dont have as much creative control.... or something. the Xenoblade Soundtrack Is So Good because of the mix of instrumentation and You Need To Play It Because Of The Story. this band is great- oh they have a song that goes to 7/16? and then 21/16? fantastic!! tell me more!!

even if i dont really understand what hes talking about(What the fuck is a mechon??????) i love that he cares so much about things. i want to hear his stories and interests for the rest of my life.
