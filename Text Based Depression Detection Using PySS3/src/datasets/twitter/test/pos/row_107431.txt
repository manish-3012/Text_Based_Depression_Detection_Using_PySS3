just came across some of Reckful's streams on YouTube.... idk man....I wanna cry so badly. why were people so mean to him tho 

a great man lost his life to depression and decided suicide was the option...

hey people, if you are reading this, pls dont think that suicide would get you through this pain and agony

listen, your life is not a game to have levels and you think that to complete one level, you gotta die, NO THIS IS NOT HOW LIFE WORKS

so pls stop thinking about suicide and all that shit

even though you think "imma do it anyways", you gotta start over all of your life again
