I feel so alone because I just need some love Hey since there is a lockdown in my country again, I feel so alone because I dont have such a good relationship to my parents or my brother. Im just in my room all day. Nobody would hug me and phoning my friends even makes me more sad because they all have a close relationship to their siblings or have a boyfriend. I just miss being loved and I think, everybody is so happy right now and makes the best out of the situation except from me. Im overthinking a lot and always think, my friends donâ€™t like me anymore. I just want to live again.
