Omg I just remembered When I was a young kid I collected pokemon cards and me and my older brother tried our best to keep them as clean and perfect as possible. it was the only thing we bought when we had extra money. 

But then a few years back my mom said they useless and when we got in trouble one time she THREW THEM ALL OUT. Then just recently she came back and was like "what ever happened to the pokemon 'I' bought you" 

So that's how my 2017 was and what happened now they were worth a fuck ton 

I remember we counted them all out and we had 520 around there is what I remember 

We even had first edition shiny charizard, that was bought for us for like $1200 by our uncle, and our two aunts

Most of the cards were most likely worth almost nothing even now but that charzard is what I regret
