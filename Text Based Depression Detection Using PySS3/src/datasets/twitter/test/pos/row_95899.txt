Would you take a bullet for your mother? I was asked this question and instantly said yes. My mother had to deal with pains while I was in her for months, she had to deal with me for all these years but a bullet can't compair to that so I would take the bullet. 


On the other hand mother's don't want their child to be in harm and if this was asked to mother's they would reply with they would rather take it. Mine said that she wants us to live a good life as she already lived hers and would rather take it then us as we got a future to live for. I love my mother and she loves me and it's a fact that we don't want to see the other in pain or loose them.

I would for her and she would for me.


~Note~ to all the people who's got family issues or have missing loved ones I deeply am sorry, I do not know your situation and it pains me that you had to deal with that but just remember that in this life we come and go and that yes when you are at the bottom of the hill it's all full of sh*t and pain but life always gets better and there is good waiting for you at the top. You can have a shitty start but still make it or have a really good start and then things fall and crumble but have faith.
