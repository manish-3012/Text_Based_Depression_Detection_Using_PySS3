girls help me so i (a guy) met my crush recently and asked for her instagram which she gave happily 


so i sent a follow request to her, and she hasn't accepted it yet


i sent it last night at 11:30 so maybe she was sleeping but now its the next day and evening and she still hasn't accepted it

is she ignoring me on purpose? or maybe she didnt see the message for since girls tend to get a ton of follow requests... so maybe my request was lost in those ones 

or maybe she just hasn't come online yet


what do i do?
