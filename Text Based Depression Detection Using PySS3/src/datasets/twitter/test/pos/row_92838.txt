How do I tell my friends I'm bi? For about 1.5 years, I know that I am bisexual, but because   I had a homphobe in my class, I couldn't really tell anyone. I also have social anxiety, making it nearly impossible to open up towards other people. 3 months ago, I started taking therapy sessions, and 2 months ago, I really started opening up there, and it felt very good. The homophobe is in an other class now, and I now want to open up to my friends too, but because I've denied being anything but hetero in the past, I have no idea how to tell them. Thank you for answers...
(If one of my friends sees this, it's me Laurin)
