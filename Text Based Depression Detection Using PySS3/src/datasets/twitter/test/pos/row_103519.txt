The only four dreams I remember enough to post.  

I had this recurring dream from when I was really little. Basically, I would start in my bed and get pins and needles in at least one of my limbs. I would then start levitating and start moving away against my will. No matter how hard I clung to my bed, I would always lose my grip and start levitating down the hall and towards the door. My mom would come rushing out right as I was out the door, but stop at the door as I levitated down the street, helpless. I would then wake up with pins and needles in the exact part of my body as I did in the dream.

Another dream that I don't know if I actually had because I was about three or four at the time is this. It was just a blank warm white, but I could could tell that there were these humanoid figures with those cow skulls you see in western movies for heads. It's sort of hard to explain. I couldn't see them, but I could at the same time. The next thing I remember is those humanoid figures skipping around in front of the Matterhorn ride at Disneyland. I was terrified of them. This is probably explained by the fact that my mom made me go on Matterhorn Bobsleds at about that age and I hated it. For years after that I refused to go on any rides unless I could see the entire thing and it didn't look scary. I stuck by this so much that I refused to go on the Monorail.

The next dream is about a parasite. You can tell one of the parasites is around because their presence causes people to percieve the world around them as constantly distorting. They look like little brown grains of rice and infect you by spinning really fast under your foot then somehow getting to your brain then putting you into a coma for a few days and feeding off of your brain waves. Then they just exit somehow and you just go back to normal. So I was at a family reunion at my house when the world starts distorting. I run outside and just start running around in a panicked frenzy when I felt a sharp pain on the sole of my foot and blacked out. Then I woke up and that's all I remember.

The last dream is the most recent. It started out with me going to an art museum with my family. I had a good time and ended up taking a bunch of pictures. Well, apparently that counts as stealing the art in my dreams reality, so I was sentenced to death by hanging. I spent the next few days trying to prove my innocence, but I was pretty much caught red-handed. Eventually, the execution day came. I was about to climb up to the Gallows (which were in a room in the museum for some reason) when I thought "fuck it" and jumped out the window, hopped into a nearby car, and sped away. And then it just cut to me driving with my little sister, even though I was alone when I made my getaway. Anyways, we pulled into a 4th of July party (don't ask why) and got out. And right as we got to the party, a cop pulled up right behind our car. I immediately pulled my sister into a conveniently placed barn where we found another kid. We passed the time by talking to the kid, occasionally peeking outside to see if the cop was still there. Eventually, the party ended and everyone left. We looked outside to see that THE COP WAS STILL THERE. We immediately closed the doors again. And then I woke up to my little brother jumping on the bed next to me.
