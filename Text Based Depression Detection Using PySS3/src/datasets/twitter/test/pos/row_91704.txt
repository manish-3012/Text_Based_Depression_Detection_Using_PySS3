to all those hating on teachers fuck you. the evil one here is the school system, us students *and* teachers are getting equally fucked by the school system, these overgrown fat assholes who have never even been to a normal school and don't know what it's like to be a teacher control the school system and don't know shit about us, if you're getting angry, you should be getting angry at them, not the teachers

well of course there are some Karen teachers who just wanna fucking kill you, but you can't just blame all the teachers for that, they're just as stressed out as you are. "tHeY HaVe To OnLy TeAcH oNe sUbJeCt WhIlE We hAvE To lEArN 7!!!1!1!", fuck you asshole, they gotta teach over 60 assholes like you while you just make their work harder for them, of course they're gonna get angry. ever heard of organising your work, fat bitch? if your school work interferes with your social life how about talking to your teachers? ever thought of that? stop blaming on them for giving too much work when you don't wanna talk with them about it, they're not fucking magicians to read your fucking mind

p.s. editing your stupid post and saying, "you guys know it was a joke right? just a JOKE" doesn't make you suddenly funny and innocent
