I got diagnosed with a disorder today, please give me some hope. I got diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder after 6-7 months of therapy today and I'm starting to lose all hope. I thought it was just the way I am, I didn't know it was actually a disorder.
The more I look into it the more shocked I get. Like I should've known. All those 'symptoms' match what I use to define myself.
And i don't know if it's curable or not. Am I going to be like this my whole life??
