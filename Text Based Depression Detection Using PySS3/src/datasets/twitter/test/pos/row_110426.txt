I have a job interview in 5 minutes in conclusion: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

I know I'll probably be ok, ***but*** ...idk im really anxious because I feel as though I might stutter or mess up, I don't do well under pressure cuz I have anxiety (and YES before u ask i am diagnosed). not sure if anyone will see this but ill update you once its over
