I wrote this little story A short man of muscular physique smiles and lifts his rippled arms into the air. As he does so he lets out a great victorious bellow; â€œWoooo! Yeah baby! Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve been waiting for, thatâ€™s what itâ€™s all about!â€ As he cheers his success, his mighty canine, Tetra, loyally trots to his side to enthusiastically celebrate with him on their accomplishment of finally getting to see a unicorn relieve itself. 

The End
