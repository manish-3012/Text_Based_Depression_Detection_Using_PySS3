I cry at night because I have to put on a brave face for my family all day I have to show my mom that Iâ€™m brave, that Iâ€™m fighting this, that Iâ€™m doing all I can to help myself and to get better, I have to have a brave face because my mom worries so much about me and she cries, so I canâ€™t let her see me cry too so here I am in my room at night 

The truth is Iâ€™m scared, Iâ€™m so afraid and lost and even though I pretend to know what I need to do I donâ€™t and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m strong enough right now to recover and to get better. Iâ€™m so afraid straight


*BTW if you are one of my friends on here reading this I am totally ok and fine Iâ€™m just making a little vent donâ€™t worry ðŸ¤ I love you all*
