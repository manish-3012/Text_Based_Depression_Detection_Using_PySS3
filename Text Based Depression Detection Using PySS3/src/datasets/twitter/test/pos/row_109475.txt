TW: US politics. 


it was bound to happen that people digest political standing into basic Karenism so much and for so long that when we have a SCOTUS pick, it's almost JARRING how fast the (/s) altruistic moralism suddenly whips out. Its not even whether Barrett makes it to SCOTUS. I remember what happened to the last guy ascending to SCOTUS, and it was the same thing "OMIGAWD SHE MADE MISTAKES" ...mistakes. Once theyre on the table, theyre just part of a political hand, as if moralism cared what party you belong to anyway. I don't care either and if you disagree with a SCOTUS pick, let it at least be because of his or her proven career record in the courtroom, not some shit they did when they were students.
