Girls: â€œI want a boy that plays the guitar ðŸ¥ºâ€ This has happened to me so many times. Iâ€™ll be like â€œHey iâ€™ve been playing the guitar for over a decade, I could play probably any song youâ€™d likeâ€ and then I just get â€œNooooo lolâ€ because their version of a boy that plays the guitar is a guy with long hair, muscular, wears beanies, and smokes weed, but can only play smoke on the water.

Why the fuck is it like this.
