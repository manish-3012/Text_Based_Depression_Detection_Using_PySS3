Yeah Sex is cool and all but... did you ever have a weekend with:
 no homework,
your favourite food for lunch,
enough time to relax and play games,
having fun while going outside with friends,
and an actual good movie on tv in the evening?
Because last weekend all those things happened to me :&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
