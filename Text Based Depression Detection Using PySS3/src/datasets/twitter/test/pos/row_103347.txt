Todayâ€™s my birthday And I fucked up my grade badly so my family didnâ€™t come like how they usually do to wake me up with happy birthday music. So I will celebrate with you guys. 

Hereâ€™s a slice of cake ðŸ° only take one as we have two million teenagers to feed. Have a good rest of your day everyone.
