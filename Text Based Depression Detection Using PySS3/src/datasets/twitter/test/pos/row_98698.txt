I was accused of being a p3do :/ Well I was accused of being a p3do here for a misunderstanding.

This is my first and last post here imma delete this account after some days I bet imma do my Farwell to reddit and everything because I don't wanna be accused of something I am not and screw idk my future or my chances for college if it can affect it or whatever. Thank you so much for ruining it for me and for the lad who sent me *f you* thank you too I feel unsafe here and this may also get hate too u know yall *cancel* for something I am not but for something I am suffering from like yall (irl not here I don't post selfies and dont put my age so I won't get weird dms well one woman did but I ignored it and bl0cked/rep0rt her). The days I passed before this one ofc were amazing days thank you for those who were nice to me and put up with my lame comments you gotta know that each interaction I got here (before those accusations for saying *Leave us weirdos* that addressed the p3dos not yall) made me happy kinda so again thanks for the good moments. However imma leave here because it ain't safe anymore for me I feel disgusted since I'm portrayed as a disgusting criminal especially when I had to deal with them irl and I know how they are so ewww (I still suffer the consequences I'm scared of being in the stairs rn it's funny but it sucks too). Well farewell and as I said earlier I believe imma delete this account in some days and leave reddit for good. Have a nice one. And pls don't mind the typos I ain't a native English speaker and autocorrect doesn't help.
