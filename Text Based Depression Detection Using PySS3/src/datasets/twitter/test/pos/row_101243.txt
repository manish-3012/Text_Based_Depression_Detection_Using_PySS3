Reddit should introduce a "no awards" option when posting With the complete shitfest that posts now are with an insane amount of frankly useless awards, I think it would be reasonable to introduce an option to *not* receive awards at all, or at least not the newer ones.

Why? Because no one wants a fucking "wholesome" award on a post ranting about their very serious, personal problems. No one wants an "excited award" on their post about their dog dying.

You should be able to vent about shitty things without the risk of some asshat thinking they're comedians and giving the "faith in humanity restored" or "wHoLeSOme seAL oF aPpROvaL" award.

Seriously. You are not funny if you give the "I'm deceased" award to someone's post about grieving over a loved one. Instead you're an asshole.

This would also be a way to call out the "haha no stop giving awards to me I totally don't want them lolll" edits and posts complaining about awards.

If this bullshit wave of awards continues, it'd be really nice if this option could be added. You can't trust people to behave here or anywhere.

What do you think? Could it work?
