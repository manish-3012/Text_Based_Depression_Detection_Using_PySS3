I have a lot of questions about the university and that makes me nervous, I hope you can answer it for me. Well, first of all, hello, I just finished school and I'm about to enter one of the best universities in the country thanks to the fact that I get a good score in the entrance exam, but that isn't the case, the case is that I have several questions that I have to ask and I do not know who to ask, but luckily I know this incredible application called Reddit, well, let's go with the questions.

1. What do I have to bring my first day of university? I know this question may be a bit silly but when I went to school, the same school would send me a list of supplies to take, and now nothing, I start from scratch and I don't know what take away.
2. What differences does the college have from the university?
3. Is it difficult to make friends at university? I ask this because I don't always have the same classmates or teachers.
4. Lastly, is university easier than school?  I say this because supposedly you are studying something that you like, then it should be easier for you.
