Feeling unwelcome All the posts about â€œgay people shouldnâ€™t flaunt itâ€ and â€œgay people shouldnâ€™t make it their whole personalityâ€ and â€œI want to wear rainbow without being associated with gay peopleâ€ and everything else complaining  about gay people just existing makes me feel really unwelcome in this sub to be honest. Wear whatever you want. Why do you care so much about being associated with gay shit?? And if you donâ€™t like someone for being open/proud about their sexuality or â€œflamboyantâ€ then just leave them alone?? Why do you have to write a post about it every 9 seconds?? Idk why people hang out with people when they donâ€™t even like them. 

My bad for the vent but itâ€™s a huge bummer. I used to really like this sub and it kinda ruins it for me.
