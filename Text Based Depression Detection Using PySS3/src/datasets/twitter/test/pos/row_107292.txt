I have a crush on this girl and want her to be my gf but the chance of me getting friendzoned is too high I just really like being with her and want it to go further than just being friends, but after how she acts around me, calling me king (instead of queen) and acting as if we are like best friends, I'm really scared of getting friendzoned, but even if I do, we can't go back to how it was before.

Ive even known one of her best friends for a long time and she told me that I'll probably get friendzoned. She even asked 'my crush' about her being single and she says that she doesn't mind being single

I'm fricked
