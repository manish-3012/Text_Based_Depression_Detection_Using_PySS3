Using big words doesnâ€™t make you smart It makes you seem insecure about your own intelligence and using big words in everyday conversation is just overcompensating for something that no one cares about. Itâ€™s usually obvious when someone is trying too hard to appear a certain way. I know weâ€™re all teenagers and weâ€™re struggling to find out who we are, but trying to fit yourself in a box just turns you into a walking stereotype. I know itâ€™s cliche, but just donâ€™t care about how others perceive you, donâ€™t try to be something youâ€™re not. Itâ€™s okay to take bits and pieces here and there, but retain your own individually! Just let your intelligence speak for yourself. And now, I refer you to this video:

(Iâ€™m speaking from experience by the way, I did this kind of thing all the time, and I wondered why people bullied me lol)
