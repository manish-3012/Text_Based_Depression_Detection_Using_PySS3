Sadly I forgot, but I think there's still time I care about men's day, but today I ended up forgetting, all I saw were some memes and I didn't even realize it was today, I'm sorry.

Well, remember boys: 

Showing emotions doesn't make you weak or feminine, it makes you human;

Taking care of yourself is just as important as it is for women;

You are important, you matter;

Many people might not recognize men's fights, but I do, we gotta keep on fighting.

Women and men are equally important, but I feel like we're not giving enough attention to men, one thing that proves it is that probably most people know when women's day is, while most probably don't even know men's day exist.

^(again, I'm not saying men are more important or anything)

Have a good night (or day) ðŸ’•
