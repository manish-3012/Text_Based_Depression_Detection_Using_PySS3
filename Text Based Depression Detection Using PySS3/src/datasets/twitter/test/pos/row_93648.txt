Iâ€™m in a teeny tiny curfuffle So I like 2 different girls at the moment (which is already bad in and of itself) and theyâ€™re both really nice, and seem to think the same about me, but idk. So the first one (letâ€™s call her M) is in both of my classes, and seems to find me funny but I donâ€™t think she likes me because she is rumoured to like someone else. The other (letâ€™s call her C) is my friendâ€™s girlfriend. Yeah, I know. And I wingmanned for him too. Anyways, the problem is, Iâ€™ve already told that friend that I like M, and he told everyone. What I didnâ€™t tell him is that I actually like C more than M. So currently, the only people that know about both are you lot and one friend that doesnâ€™t go to my school. So now everybody except M knows that I like her, even C, but I like C more. Keep in mind that my friend and C have known each other for just over a month, and this is grade 8, so I donâ€™t really know how long that will last. Both C and M have said they think Iâ€™m funny, so leave your thoughts below. I would like to get the best out of this situation without aborting the entire thing. Feel free to ask for more details. Thanks in advance!
