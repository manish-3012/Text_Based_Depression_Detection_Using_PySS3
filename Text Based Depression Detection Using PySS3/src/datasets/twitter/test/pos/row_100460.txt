geometry dash do be making me wanna die though 2nd level on chaos gauntlet. XL level. more irritating than difficult. I'm on 85%. i know the next bit and it shouldn't be difficult for me. I just can't finish it. I've been trying this level in 2-4 hour bursts all of today. i can't stop now. it's so fucking long and boring. the colour scheme is shit. it looks like it's having an seizure with all the flashing lights and strobe effects going on. I just want to finish the level. I didn't want it to be the most annoying level in the fucking game. I've done the vast majority of the main game and an easy demon. why am I here. just to suffer? ffs.
