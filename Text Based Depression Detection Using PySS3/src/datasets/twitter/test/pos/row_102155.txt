Anyone watch the Toyshow? Last night the 2020 Late Late Toyshow was aired for the first time. I like to say that if you are Irish, the criteria for being a child os watching the toyshow. And i wanna know who else enjoyed it. I love the toyshow because the reunions, celebrity guests and just everything about it is so special. Its the Irish equivalent of the John Lewis ad. 
This year I loved the lil gal with cancer because she in all technicality raised 5 million euro in just a few hours. I also loved the wee laddie who came second last. His thoughts when WhatsHisFace McSingerMan came on were: *Bop bop boppity bop. Huh? Is it just me or is someone else sin-OH MY GOD ITS WHATSHISFACE MC-FLIPPIN-SINGERMAN.* But the Red Rockodile(the final chap) was.... underwhelming. So yeah, who's Irish round this joint and did you sneak in a watch? Give me a yell.
