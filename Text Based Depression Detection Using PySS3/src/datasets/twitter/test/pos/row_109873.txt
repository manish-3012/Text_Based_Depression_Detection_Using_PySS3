I'm leaving Reddit for a year. I have a very important upcoming exam next summer which will basically determine my future. And I just wanted to thank all of you for making my 1 year on this platform amazing. This period of time requires so much effort and determination, so I just thought I'd delete all my social media. Deleting Reddit now.
