Alcohol and Fitting In (18M) This fall I will be attending a University that is known for its frats and keggers. I donâ€™t drink. I have never drank before and I donâ€™t really want to start. I am very very fucking very worried about fitting in. A part of me says that maybe drinking is not a big deal because â€œhey, everyone is doing itâ€ but the rest of me says â€œitâ€™s objectively bad for you and illegal, at least for nowâ€.
  
College seems to be the most opportune time in anyoneâ€™s life to form a new identity. Iâ€™m not happy with who I am and Iâ€™m tired of being tied to the â€œgood personâ€ prototype. The only problem is my laces are so straight I canâ€™t seem to cross the proverbial line Iâ€™ve towed. 

Iâ€™m a straight-A nobody. I have done nothing with my life and now I want to change that but from what I can tell, my university is where rich, conservative kids get piss drunk and fuck around. I canâ€™t tell you how opposite that is to who I am. 

I want to â€œbreak badâ€ but I donâ€™t know what to do. I think Iâ€™ll have an opportunity to drink this Saturday. Should I take it?
