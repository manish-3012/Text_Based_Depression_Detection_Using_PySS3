How do I explain to my parents that being trans or gay isnâ€™t a Mental illness? Even tho they call it that, itâ€™s kinda ironic how they donâ€™t think that depression and similar mental illnesses exist. They think that thereâ€™s only a man who has a pencil and a woman who has a pencil Case for the pencil ( LITERAL words from their mouths). How do I tell them weâ€™re not in the 1960s anymore?
