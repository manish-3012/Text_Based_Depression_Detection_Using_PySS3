How do I tell someone I miss talking to them without saying "I miss talking to you?" One of my friends has gon kinda silent, only snapping like once or twice a week n shid and their snap score goin up like 30 everyweek, the problem is i cant outright say it because she's a girl and I'm in a relationship and thatd be sus, but we were really good friends and I miss it
