Hereâ€™s to wishing the US gets smarter. Truth be told, I really hate all the memes that are being made about the US right now, but I canâ€™t be mad if they are all true. I hate that people canâ€™t just have sympathy for others here. I understand that some of the people who arenâ€™t wearing masks donâ€™t really care if they die, and though that is understandable, it doesnâ€™t justify potentially hurting others. 
Being in Texas, one of the current case capitals, Iâ€™m depressed with the idea that what used to be one of the best states is suddenly one of the dumbest. 
I supposed to be going to college in Canada for my first year. I will be unable to because people take their make believe right to jeopardize the health of others over education and family. I just want to go to school. By the way it looks I may never see it. I donâ€™t blame the Canadian government if they deemed Americans as walking health factors.

Sorry for my incoherent rant. Just want to get out anger.
