UTI &amp; Sleep Okay so for the past.. 8 months? Kinda. I've been having trouble with an UTI (I'm male, I know that is important), I went to doctors, I got treatment but nope, I'm still fucked up and... And I'm just so tired... I can't sleep well because of it, sometimes I even cry because wtf is wrong with me to have this, why can't i get rid of it, i do all the this that are supposed to help but nothings happens and suddenly trying to sleep became one of the things i fear, and I just want to sleep well again without worrying about that damn pain... I'm kinda desperate as you can see, eight months and countless painful nights is a lot
