I feel like Iâ€™m about to buckle under my parents and the schoolâ€™s expectations I have always been a good student never really the best but always top 10%. Because of this my parents wanted me to take the hardest classes I could. I was mostly fine with this after all I wanted to go to college and get a good job after. Recently however I just donâ€™t know what to to anymore. I am a junior in high school now and my parents had me go into full IB and stack my course load as much as possible. I was able to handle it ok for the first month or two but after it feels like everything has just been stacking up and I canâ€™t handle it anymore. Overt the past few weeks my routine has been wake up go to online classes till 2 go to track then after do homework till I go to bed it hasnâ€™t been uncommon for me to be doing 8+ hours of homework a night plus the 6 hours of classes. The only time I feel free is when Iâ€™m running at track and I just canâ€™t handle it anymore. Last Sunday I woke up at 7 and did homework till 2:30 in the morning on Monday. I havenâ€™t been getting any good sleep because the stress is just so much. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to my parents but they just brush it off saying it canâ€™t be that bad and then my mom will talk about what she has to do for work. Or sheâ€™ll tell me how my sister is doing fine in the same course and she even a year ahead. I donâ€™t mean to sound mean or like a bad person but I donâ€™t really care. Every aspect of my life is fading I used to enjoy reading, watching tv/YouTuber, hanging out with friends, and playing Xbox at night but now it feels like my friendships are starting to deteriorate and I feel like I never have time to do anything else I enjoy. I feel like my lungs are being squeezed tightly at all times. A while ago I tried to talk to talk to a school counselor but they were extremely unhelpful she basically told be to be more positive as well as if I had good study habits I would be fine. I only feel free when Iâ€™m running I feel like Iâ€™m about to break down at any time. To make things even worse even though I keep putting more time in my grades continue to slip right now Iâ€™m even failing a class. I just donâ€™t know what do I feel like I havenâ€™t had a break since the school year began and I feel like Iâ€™m breaking down I donâ€™t know what to do. I just needed to get this off my chest.
