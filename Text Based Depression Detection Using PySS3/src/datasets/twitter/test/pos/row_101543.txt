How Sarcasm was created In ancient Greece there was a man called Sarcasus, he used to compliment whomever he met. One day Sarcasus saw a naked waking freely as if no one was looking at him, he had absurdly small penis. Sarcasus approached him  and said "Nice cock bro" and everyone started laughing. That's how sarcasm was created.
