to people who don't respect neopronouns, why? im just curious, not trying to be rude, i just want to know why

and to those who don't know, neopronouns are any set of singular third-person pronouns that are not officially recognized in the language they are used in, typically created with the intent of being a gender neutral pronoun set. In English, and many other Indo-European languages, third-person pronouns can be gendered. example: xe/xem/xyr, ze/hir/hirs. they are mostly used by gender non-comforming people and non binary people.
