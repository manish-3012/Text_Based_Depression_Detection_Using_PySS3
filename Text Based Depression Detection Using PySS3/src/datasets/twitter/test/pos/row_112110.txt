I hate children at my apartment Like I'm probably a little older than them but BRUH imagine every day some fucking children come in front of your house and talk there with a high voice and bang on the walls I first thought maybe one of the kid is the neighbour's kid so they come here to play but no all of them are from diffrent apartment just come here to test my patience
