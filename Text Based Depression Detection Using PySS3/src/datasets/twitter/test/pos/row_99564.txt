Guys help So this street lamp just outside my window got hit by a massive Lightning and youâ€™d expect it to stop working, But no itâ€™s just started turning on and off And is super annoying. The rain makes the atmosphere before bed quite nice but the street lamp ruins it.                                                       Any idea how i can sleep more comfortably?
