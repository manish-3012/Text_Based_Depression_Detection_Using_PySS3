I had a history final today Because COVID had us half online and it was a giant mess, we got to have a cheat sheet. I spent hours on one and shared it with the class and only three people said thanks. I walked into the exam room this morning and literally almost everyone had printed it off. Feels bad man. I just wanted some recognition for my work.
