How do I stop being friends with someone without being rude? I have a friends who overall is a nice guy, but does and says some weird shit. Although I like to think that I donâ€™t care about what other people think of me, I really do, and the stuff that he does makes me really uncomfortable and me being associated labels me as the â€œweird kidâ€. On top of this, he also somewhat follows me around, and I canâ€™t really picture a situation where me telling him all of this doesnâ€™t hurt him. Am I an asshole for this?
