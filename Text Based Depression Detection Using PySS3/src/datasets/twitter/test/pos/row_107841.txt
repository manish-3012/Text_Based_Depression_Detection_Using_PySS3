Itâ€™s my last day of Summer Vacation and Iâ€™m starting High School 1. Wish me luck
2. I spent the day with my best friend recreating a movie scene and stuffing our faces with marshmallows (I planned this since I was 6)
3. I finished the day off a few minutes ago (itâ€™s a little past midnight as of posting) by watching the Little Mermaid which was one of my favorite movies as a baby

:D
