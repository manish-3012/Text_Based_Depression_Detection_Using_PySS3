Hey Reddit, I have a question Itâ€™s not related to any real word event in my life, but if you tell a girl you like them, and they say they like you back, what do you do? I feel like it would be most comfortable to let the information sink in for a day then do something together, but at the same time I feel that it would be weird if you didnâ€™t do something together.
