My Dad is acting kinda suspicious I feel like my Dad is lying to my mom and I. He said heâ€™s going running but I looked at his location and it said he was at someoneâ€™s house. I asked him over text and he said he was gonna turn sharing off because I was being weird. Either something glitched or heâ€™s lying to us. What should I do now?
