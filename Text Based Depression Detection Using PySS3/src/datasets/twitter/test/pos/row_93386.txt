Anyone else annoyed by the animus stuff in the assassins creed games? I recently started playing AC Origins, and I think it's super fun, it's hella immersive and so much fun to play. I also played a bit of BF a while ago, and it was fun except for one thing: the Animus universe.

I think it's really annoying. The AC universe is super immersive,  but I feel like the fact that you're just playing in a simulation kinda ruins that a little. I just want to go back to shooting ppl with my hunter bow. I don't need to be reminded that I'm just some random person in a simulation. 

It's a neat concept, but it just drags the game down in my opinion.
