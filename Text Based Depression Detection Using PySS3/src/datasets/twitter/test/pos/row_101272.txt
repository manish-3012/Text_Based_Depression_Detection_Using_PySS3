Here's an angry/bitter poem I just wrote for Valentine's Day lol, plz read it Perhaps I was too cold for you,

No warmth within my soul.

Perhaps I was too dangerous,

Too far beyond the mold.

Perhaps I was too blasphemous,

A breed born far too bold.

Perhaps I was too empty,

When all my loveâ€™s been sold.

&amp;#x200B;

So wipe that smile off your face,

And lose that stupid, acted gaze.

Erase your name just like a phase,

And turn the rotten, bitter page.

Curse the ring and itâ€™s silver sting,

I hope you fall and lose your wings.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps I was too hardened,

Too sickened for your tastes.

Perhaps I was too blackened,

Too scarred for you to take.

Perhaps I was too rabid,

My canineâ€™s bite unchained.

Perhaps I was too rancid,

With blood my name engraved.

&amp;#x200B;

Your eyes betray your nature,

Like a sculpture in a crater.

Youâ€™re the sturm without the drang,

Not a sweet but sour tang.

Youâ€™re the game without the show,

Without the money, what a blow.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps you were too frail,

No spine beneath your talk.

Perhaps you were too stale,

And too fat to even walk.

Perhaps you were too ugly,

Yet thought you were on top.

Perhaps you were too dead,

As lifeless as an afterthought.
