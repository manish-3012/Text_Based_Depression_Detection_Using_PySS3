Little rant about dogs and people Okay so I am really tired of hearing that pit bulls are bad and dangerous. People are always stereotypical and mean to pit bulls because everyone thinks they are aggressive. Yea they can be, but thatâ€™s how they are trained not the breed. People train them for illegal dog fighting and things like that from the moment they are born. When I went to the dog shelter the majority of the dogs there were pit bulls. My little brother asked why and the lady who worked there said it was because people donâ€™t want them since they are aggressive. It was so sad to see all of them there because they are really sweet and loving and caring and just want someone to love them.  

Historically Pit bulls were used as herding dogs and as nanny dogs. In Peter Pan the nanny dog was supposed to have been a pit bull but it got changed because of the way people view them and the stereotypes against them. 

If I could have adopted all of them I would but I was able to get my baby girl (a pitbull terrier named Rey). My life is so much better with her and she is the sweetest. The most aggressive part about her is her wagging tail when sheâ€™s happy. She loves to cuddle and play with us and isnâ€™t aggressive at all. She runs up to people outside to say hi if we let her and just wants to be pet. But moral of the rant, pit bulls arenâ€™t dangerous, aggressive, or mean, the people who train them are and if you stereotype them to be all aggressive Iâ€™m the aggressive one youâ€™ll have to deal with. 

Thank you for anyone who listened and if you have any questions Im ignoring my school work so Iâ€™ll be on my phone and answer quickly.
