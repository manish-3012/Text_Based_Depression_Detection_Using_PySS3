Do you think that getting a 75 on a test in a specialized class is bad enough to have your parents make you drop out of the class Just what the title says, I got a 2 75s and an 88 on a math test in a specialized class, and now my mom says that she'll make me drop out of the class. Just wanted your opinions.
