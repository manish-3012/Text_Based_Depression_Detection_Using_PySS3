Mission completed: reassign pronouns ðŸ¤— So guys we did it ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ‘after today I have successfully been able to tell the last of my friends about my new pronouns and as of this evening i have told all my friends that I am now using they/them.

now for the fun part , my parents and everyone else (including the transphobic kids at my school )ðŸ˜¨
