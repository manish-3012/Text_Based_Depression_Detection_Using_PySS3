What else should I ask for Christmas? So far I have a Yeti mug, Chubbies shorts, Swiss Army knife, Xbox one game, and pit viper sunglasses Iâ€™m thinking maybe a penny board but I donâ€™t use my current cruiser enough to warrant a new one I donâ€™t think. Also Iâ€™m considering a paintball gun, but I only go 3 or 4 times a year. I am also into outdoor activities and go fishing frequently. What do you think?
