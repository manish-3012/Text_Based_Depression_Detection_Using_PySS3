If you are the one who did this, then I hope your happy now Ok so last week on friday our teacher was quarantined due to being contact traced. That happened to be the day that we had some big english quiz. I wasn't really prepared for it, so I went in deciding to just wing it. Basically we went through the entire class time without even mentioning the quiz, and finally the class was over. We kinda realized that the teacher had completely forgot that we were supposed to take it that day. Fast forward to after the long weekend. The teacher shows up online (Still quarantined) and announces that SOMEONE reminded her of the frickin quiz in an email they sent her, so now we had to take it today. I wasn't really prepared for it the first time she assigned it, so by now I had forgotten almost every bit of the information I knew.... Yeah I failed.... and so did many other people..... because one kid can't keep his teachers pet mouth shut.
