My older brother only cares about himself. He doesn't give 2 flying fucks about what my parents do for him. They just spent 500 dollars this weekend on a Baseball tournament and he never showed any respect. No thank you or I love yous. This shit is getting out of hand. Honestly I might just fucking hit him for what happened today, my mother cried which happens once in a blue moon. I feel like knocking his teeth in, and I might because my parents haven't. What will make him stop?
