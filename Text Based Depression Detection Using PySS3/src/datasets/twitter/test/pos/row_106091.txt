Wholesome story time So I was riding my bike where I usually go, and I already met my calorie goal and I was kinda tired anyways. Where I ride has a lot of hills, and it's sorta hard riding them after biking for a while. I was biking up a hill and I was gonna stop and just walk the way home, but then there was this older dude behind me riding his bike as well, and he was just dominating the previous hills. He started to get ahead of me, then I told myself I wouldn't be beaten by him and I finished riding up the hills. He still got ahead of me but it was still a cool motivation.
