I'd like to get an opinion on something. I'm hoping at least one person can give me some helpful insight. I'm currently 17, I'll be 18 In 3 monthsish. I have ran into an opportunity to join in on a new business ran by my step-father. I have mixed feelings due to the possibility of my credit score dropping significantly making it even harder for me to start a life. But if it succeeds.... that could set me up for my future. Any advice would be great.
