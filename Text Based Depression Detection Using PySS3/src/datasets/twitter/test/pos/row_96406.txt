Sweden seems great, itâ€™s over 1500km from ZÃ¼rich And Itâ€™s not the us, and itâ€™s less cold than Canada 

But itâ€™s over 1500km from ZÃ¼rich, itâ€™s like a 20 hour drive thatâ€™s perfect, not day trip close but itâ€™s I could go there if I wanted with relative ease close, if itâ€™s close enough that you could take a day trip to ZÃ¼rich itâ€™s too close
