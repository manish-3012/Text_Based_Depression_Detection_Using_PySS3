So confused So 2 days ago on another app (That most people on here probably donâ€™t know abt) I got into an argument with some friends I met on there. This all started when I made a post on there saying my top 25 users all time IMO. So I made it, posted it and figured that, was that, and we move, but it turns out 2 of my friends didnâ€™t agree with the placements and were mad that they didnâ€™t make the list, that didnâ€™t even fucking matter in the first place. So for abt 10 minutes we were in an argument until one of them said â€œFuck you bro, Iâ€™m posting your face bitch ass.â€ Then he posted it. Now that may not seem like a big deal to you but it does to me just because I donâ€™t want my face being in the internet, out to random people, that can do whatever the heâ€™ll the want with it, make edits, share it with their friends, post it somewhere else etc. then immediately after he posted it the other 2 started laughing, calling me a clown, and rubbing it in my face damn well knowing I donâ€™t like my face out to other people I donâ€™t know. So after that, I just decided to block them and go back to it later. 

The next day all 3 of them got banned and people were blaming it on me (Btw on this app you can also make multiple accounts) so during that i did probably the worst thing I couldâ€™ve fucking done, while everyone hated me, and made a post calling them 3 clowns, and explaining my side, but yet everyone just said I was lying and cussing me out and shit, it was bad. Later that day the 3 of them made accounts again and saw my post, so they started attacking me again and we got into another argument, same as the day before then it was done, I blocked them and figured that was the end of it. Later that night I had a conversation with 2 other REALLY CLOSE friends and they said they had my back and wouldnâ€™t just leave me. 

And that brings us to today. So today started off with me waking up, banned. But I did have an alt so I just went on there, said I was banned, and that was that, so I thought. I tried to go look at one of MY CLOSE FRIENDS profiles and it kept saying he had me blocked. Idk what provoked him to do this, but he did and I was really sad that he did cause he was a good friend. So I made an alt and I messaged him saying that I was sorry for whatever I did. IMMEDIATELY after I sent my message, he blocked me on that account too, giving no explanation, so I was wicked confused on why the hell he blocked me, and I still have no clue why tf he did. Then a few hours go by and I look back at my phone and my other REALLY close friend made like 6 different cryptic posts, that were clearly shots at me, again idk wtf proved him to do that but he did and I donâ€™t fucking know why. I then messaged him asking what those all meant and he gave me some whack ass answer abt â€œAre you going to listen to my opinion, or are you going to listen to yourself, and what you think?â€ I said â€œListen to what I thinkâ€ and he said â€œGood then you have found your answer. And that made no sense to me and idk how they even related to his posted taking shots at me. 

Ik this shit sounds petty, and trust me, it is, but Iâ€™m just super fucking confused on whatâ€™s even happening. I lost 3 friends cause they were acting like pricks and I didnâ€™t want anything to do with them anymore, and it seems that I have lost at least one of my close friends and idek why he blocked me meanwhile the other took shots at me for seemingly no reason. Sorry that I prolly just wasted your time with that, I just donâ€™t have anyone else to talk to abt it lmao.
