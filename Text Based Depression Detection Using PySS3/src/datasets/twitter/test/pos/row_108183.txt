Honestly though it gets annoying. So my friend today in 4th hour punched me in the dick, so about 20 minutes later we are switching classes and I do it back. Of course, social distancing is a rule, so the teacher saw me do it, and I said he did it first, because since he did it first, if I'm going down he's going down with me, cause that's what *good* friends do. So I now I have three days detention over some dumbass teacher because there is no cameras in class rooms so there is no evidence that he did it first. School system is bullshit sometimes. High school is bullshit sometimes.
