I've got issues I (16f) like a guy at work (18). He is very experienced. We have kissed before but he has always made the first move. I have recently decided that I want to make the first move. I have never had to before and I'm scared. After thinking about why, I came up with this: I am scared that I am not enough and will never be enough. 

I know this is ridiculous. I love and accept myself for the way I am. But there is still this little voice whispering. Ya know? And I'm going to tell him this. Bc hes made the decision that he will no longer chase me and will wait for me to initiate anything. I genuinely don't know what to do. And my anxiety is eating me alive. 

I knew I liked him too much and was terrified of losinf him. So I decided to date another guy. And in that relationship I slowly tried to make the firat move sometimes. I do have intamicy issues due to my mom basically telling me when I was growing up that men are terrible and love is bullshit. 

Ig I just want to know what I should tell him. And how I should do it. Bc I never see him a lot.
