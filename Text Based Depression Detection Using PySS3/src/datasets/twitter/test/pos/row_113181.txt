Im going to start speedrunning. Alright, my youtube and twitch accounts haven't been touched in a few months, but, I decided "why not start speedrunning on them." So far I am doing SMB1 and my fastest completion is about 7 minutes. SMB3 was around 13 minutes. I'm getting pretty good at it, and I feel as if its going to be interesting, once I get paid on Thursday, im ordering my capture card.
