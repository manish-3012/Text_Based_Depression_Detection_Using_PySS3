My "friend" made a joke saying gays should die His only personality trait is hating gay people and "libtards." He posted a meme on snapchat saying gay people are disguating and he'd kill them if it were legal. Should I just ignore it or what? He does it all the time and I'm just like whatever but it's starting to piss me off. Idk what's considered being too dramatic. Im asking here cuz I dont want responses from only gays. I have to see him every Wednesday at church ðŸ˜
