I want to pay respect to the teachers ( and all) that didnâ€™t make it this year 2020 was shit. It was a real divot in peoples mental stability, and of course people didnâ€™t make it. Some teenagers would of died of Corona and of suicide. A lot of teenagers suffer with depression and mental issues and itâ€™s a real problem. I tell you if you have suicidal ideation. Itâ€™s not worth it, sure you may have no friends or family but thereâ€™s always someone to talk to, especially here. Iâ€™ve met a lot of people here who are really great to talk to and made a few great friends dispute there time difference. If you ever feel down feel free to message me or if you need a friend. Iâ€™m down to talk about anything. 
R.I.P to all who have passed this year from illness and mental illness. Itâ€™s been a hard one but we made it.
