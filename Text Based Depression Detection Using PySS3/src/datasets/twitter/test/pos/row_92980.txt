The â€œTeenage Experienceâ€ Iâ€™m turning 20 in a few days, and looking back at my teenage years, I realised that it wasnâ€™t everything that I made it out to be.

I thought it was gonna be like in the movies where people are sneaking out all the time, drinking, experimenting with drugs, having relationships and sex, blah blah blah

Some of it happened, sure, but itâ€™s mostly outliers that did all of it. I mostly just chilled out in my bedroom playing games and chatting to friends on discord.

It was a bit shit to be honest.

4/10 would not recommend
