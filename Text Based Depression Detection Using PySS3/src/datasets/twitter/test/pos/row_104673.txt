I like this boy Iâ€™ve lowkey liked him for quite a time now, but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s mutual. Thatâ€™s okay. Weâ€™re good friends though, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s worth ruining it. We just get along well and well I donâ€™t know what else to say. I donâ€™t have lots of free time, and he has even less anyways. Iâ€™ve never had a boyfriend. Of course Iâ€™ve dated and kissed boys, but it never felt meaningful. That sucks. And I donâ€™t think itâ€™s just me wanting attention and respect, I think our friendship could actually be a great solid base for a relationship. I know he thinks the same, I just donâ€™t know if heâ€™d get in a relationship with me. I also donâ€™t want to ruin my friendship with him and his buddies either. Next year Iâ€™ll probably be going abroad and will not be seeing him in a long time. I donâ€™t know what to do. It sort of makes me sad.
