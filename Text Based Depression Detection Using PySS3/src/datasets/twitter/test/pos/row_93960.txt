I just dont want toooo My mom split with my dad who is very manipulative and toxic. I used to spend a week at moms, week at dads, but I just grew tired of having to be with my dad, as he would become really entitled to me when I spent more time at my moms. Well when Corona started, I was just done with it and said Im moving to my moms full time. He started acting like he was sad, and loved me and wanted me there. I didnt buy it, he was overdoing the emotions and I could see he didnt mean it. We kind of cut contact though I sometimes went to visit him-mainly to walk the neigbours dog(who I love and she is my best friend)- till this Christmas. Me and mom went over to his house and I just started to feel guilty. He wasnt shaved, had longer hair than usual and was wearing old clothes. I think he did so to manipulate me even more, but still, I did start to feel bad. He wants me to stay there tommorow and sleep over, but I dont want to sleep at the old creepy and depressing house. I feel bad to say no. What should I do :(
