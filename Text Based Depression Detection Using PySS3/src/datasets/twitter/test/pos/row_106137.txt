I lost 4K to someone I thought loved me, and then he cut me out of his life for bullshit reasons and will never pay me back. I (m17) swear he (m19) loved me at the start, and only decided to sacrifice our relationship for his gain due to the stress of his car getting impounded n sent to a tow yard with a rising debt. I gave him 4000 in total and then he cut me out of his life when I told him I had no more to give cause he knew he couldnâ€™t pay me back, despite promising me otherwise. Since then Iâ€™ve had to explain to my parents why I donâ€™t have a â€œbfâ€ anymore n what happened to my entire bank account, which I worked 3 years for. 

Repeat after me kiddos:
TO HELL WITH GOLD DIGGERS
TO HELL WITH SUGAR BABIES
AND TO HELL WITH PEOPLE THAT USE YOU

Seriously, money CANNOT buy or save love, no matter how genuine it feels when they look at you in a way that melts your heart, or the softness of their hand in yours, or the warmth of their body cuddling against you in the same front seat of a car at midnight. If theres money involved AT ALL, take none of that shit for granted.

The world is a fucked and messy place, and people who become a victim to circumstance will have to find a way on their own. When someone is drowning, anyone that comes near becomes nothing more than a floatation device. Stay away, even if it hurts to watch them drown, unless you want to save them at the cost of YOU drowning. 

Donâ€™t get used the same way I did. 
Be smart, ignore your heart.
