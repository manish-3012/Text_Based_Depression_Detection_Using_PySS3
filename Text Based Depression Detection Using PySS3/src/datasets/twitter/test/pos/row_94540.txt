Iâ€™ve seen other posts talking about this, so Iâ€™ve decided to share my story Iâ€™ve had a massive crush on this girl for over a year now, and when I told her she rejected me.

That was 4 months ago, and Iâ€™ve been unable to get over her nor do I want to. Unfortunately this is driving me insane and fueling my horrible mood swings and I genuinely have no idea what to do. She seems to be getting uncharacteristicly nicer (and flirty? Idk cuz Iâ€™m bad at this stuff) lately so idk if that means anything.
