Corona Positive in school. Someone in my school got positive for corona and now me and my friends are in quarantine. 2 of my best friends tested positive for corona. I also got positive and the only thing i can touch is my phone. I sometimes watch youtube or play games. Its my 4th day on hospital and i just wanted to make this post because im super bored. This quarantine thing is so hard and BORING. It feels like im a monster and they keep me locked. Wish me luck :)
