Celery is meaningless. Heck you celery. Dear celery, why do you exist? You are hardly nutritional at all. There are plenty of other cool vegetables with interesting flavours and textures, and they are actually nutritional. You are just crunchy veggie stick. What can you even use celery for? Salad? Soup? There really aren't many options. Celery is just grass but bigger and crunchier. It's just big grass. The literal definition of food is "any nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink or that plants absorb in order to maintain life and growth". See that 'nutritious' at the start? Can celery even be classed as a food or is it just big crunchy grass. Synonyms of food are "nourishment" and "nutriment". Celery is neither nourishing or nutritious.
