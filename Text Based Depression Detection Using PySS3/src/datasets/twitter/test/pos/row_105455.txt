This year has been a ride for sure My first ACTIVE year on reddit has ended and honestly also one of my favorites despite this whole pandemic. I got to meet some wonderful people and I canâ€™t imagine what Iâ€™d do without them now. I started reading a book series that Iâ€™m now obsessed with, started drawing again, and I also got to join this cult of a sub. Other social medias just donâ€™t have the kind of communities like reddit does, good or bad. 

Thanks for being pretty cool u weirdos
