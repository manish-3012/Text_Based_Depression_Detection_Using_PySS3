Hey girls could you maybe help me? I have a few questions,

1. Do girls like confidence?
2. How many girls watch anime?
3. Do girls like like guys who sing? (I'm not very good but I try :/)
4. Do girls get horny?
5. Is it about looks, personality, or both?
6. Do girls like funny people?
7. What kind of music do girls like?
8. Is there anything that guys do that can make girls like them more if they aren't the best looking 

Sorry if I triggered or any of you I litterally have never talked to a girl except one.
