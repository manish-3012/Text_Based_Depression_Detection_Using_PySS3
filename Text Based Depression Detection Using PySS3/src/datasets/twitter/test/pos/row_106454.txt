Just had my first ever nosebleed And holy christ was I leaking. You could literally track me from my bedroom to the kitchen. Any forensic science students wanna get in on this? Like, blood was splattered on cloth, wood, linoleum, metal, and I attempted to clean most of it, albeit poorly. We got a perfect test crime scene here. I lost like a gil of blood.
