School Acceptance Rate Now 
Iâ€™m changing schools and just gave my admission test, everyone is telling me how theyâ€™ll take me since every school wants as many kids to come and thereâ€™s pandemic going so many people wonâ€™t be changing schools. I wanted to know if this is actually true or is just another misconception? 

Thank you.
