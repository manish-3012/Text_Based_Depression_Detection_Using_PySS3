Why do redditors go "you're an ungrateful little shit" as soon as someone complains about there parents... I had a different account which i deleted a year ago because i wanted a break from reddit, when i had that account i was just an angry depressed kid. So i wrote a whole rant on how my father didn't get me an entry level pc so i can try game development, and how I've been working with a pentium4 and 1 gb of ram for the last 8 - 10 years. And NO i can't buy my own pc by saving money from doing little jobs, why? Because I'm from India and I don't know about the rest of my country but at least here in my state, it's a thing that "only poor families have their kids working a job before they're 18" idk why that is, but that means that i cant buy anything for myself. So when i wrote that rant, no matter how much i explained them they just kept saying that I'm an "ungrateful little shit" and how i should "get a job and buy it on my own" , like fuck off dude and why do you even care and people even supported him and downvoted me, out of like the 8 people that replied only one understood what i was saying...Why is that...just... fukin why?

Am going to end this by saying, if you're one of those people who are going to reply in that same manner...just dont... I'm not an ungrateful little shit you're just a stupid dumdum for not understanding my situation
