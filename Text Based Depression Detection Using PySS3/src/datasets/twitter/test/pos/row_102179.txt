Hey, guys, I got something on my mind that's bothering me. Uh, so basically, there's this girl I like, right? Well, she's thirteen, three years younger than me. And I'm sixteen. So, uh, is it bad or wrong that I really like her and wanna ask her out? I don't wanna be a creep, and I have a burning passion for creeps. But I really like her and I don't know what to do.
