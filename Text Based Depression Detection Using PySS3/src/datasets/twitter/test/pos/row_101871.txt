I don't even know I'm in high school sophomore year and I'm doing online I'm constantly stressed with school work I have a hard time sleeping and I don't even know what I'm doing with my life. everyday feels like a waste I don't know where I'm going or what I'm going to do in the future. People say it gets better but that's a fucking lie since the beginning of this year I have gone from a person who has friends who like to just hang out with me play Xbox and do whatever to having friends who I can't even call friends anymore they never want to do anything with me after school saying they're busy or something then I see from either Instagram or Snapchat that they're out and about having fun while I'm stuck at home with 4 younger siblings that make my life hell and parents who when I try to talk to them can't even remember what we talked about I wish I had someone that just cared about me and my problems but I guess that's too much to fucking ask for
