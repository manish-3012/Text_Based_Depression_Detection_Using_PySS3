My brotherâ€™s resistance is cracking I believe I might have finally whittled him down to being vulnerable to good music! He accepted a hand-me-down shirt from me with John Lennon on it. Watch out little siblings. You may win the battles, BUT THE OLDER SIBLINGS WILL WIN THE WAR! 

No actual offense meant to My Chemical Romance, Nirvana or Lil Peep. Theyâ€™re actually very talented musicians as well. But I canâ€™t let my little brother know I think that.
