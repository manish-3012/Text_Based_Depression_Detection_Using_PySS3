Should I buy a new phone? Currently I have my sister's old phone (iPhone 6) and I kind of hate it. There's something wrong with the volume, I can barely hear anything even when it's on loudspeaker, it only rings when it wants to even if it's not on silent mode or something so I miss a lot of calls, it's kinda outdated so some apps don't exactly work well on it and I don't really like Apple in general. 
A year ago I asked my mom if I could have a new phone if I graduated (I did btw, best of my school) and she said she'd buy one for me but instead I got this phone a few months after I asked my mom that from my sister that was already kinda broken with the volume and stuff so yeah. I don't see my mom fulfilling her promise anytime soon and I don't want to remind her because then I'll seem bratty so ig I'll just buy it myself if I decide to.
So yeah uhm if id buy a new phone it'd be one that isn't too expensive (currently looking at the Huawei y6) but if y'all have a recommendation lemme know ig
