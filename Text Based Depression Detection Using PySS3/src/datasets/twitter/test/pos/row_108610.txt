How do I tell my parents that I'm bi? I want to tell my parents that I'm bisexual, but they're both Christian, and I don't know how they'll react.

&amp;#x200B;

Could I...please have some advice...?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, my mom says she supports LGBTQ+ but I'm still not sure about if I should tell her

&amp;#x200B;

Idk 'bout my dad tho...
