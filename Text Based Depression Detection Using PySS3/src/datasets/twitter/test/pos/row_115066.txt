I wanna quit piano lessons. How do I tell my parents? I've been playing piano for 4 years. I always sucked honestly because I seldom practiced it. I love playing pieces I have already learned, I hate learning new stuff. My parents always wanted me to keep playing it because I have no hobbies rather than this. I feel like going to piano lessons is a waste of money but I find it hard to tell my parents. Please, how do I tell them?
