Just got kicked out of zoom meeting So I was in a zoom meeting for my Social Studies class. And we have this daily question and the question was â€œWhat is your lucky number and why?â€ I replied with 420 because blaze it. Then the teacher dmâ€™s saying that Iâ€™m going to be kicked out of the class and he will talk to me after class. What do I do now?
