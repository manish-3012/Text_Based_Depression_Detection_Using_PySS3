Mildly infuriating things in my life right now 1. My parents still constantly argue with each other even after being divorced for 8 years so all I here is them yelling at each other over the phone


2. Everybody at my dads house for some reason has an immune deficiency so i have to wait until they come out with a kids vaccine for my little sisters before they let me go to school


3. My algebra teacher gives a crap ton of homework and we have to show our work or we get an F


4. I have a 79% in one class and until that's an 80% or greater I can't play video games


5. I wake up at 6:30am and go to sleep at 11:00pm every day because of school


6. Acne


7. I got stretch marks on my back that I can feel when I roll over and lay down a certain way


8. One of my lego sets broke the other day


9. I have 0-5 hours of free time total out of the entire week. (this includes weekends)


10. My step mom glares at me everytime I enter the room like I'm the cause of her problems


11. When I try to do homework one of my sisters annoy me and when they leave the other comes in and it is a never ending loop


12. My parents don't listen to what I have to say and if I ask nicely the ignore it and if I yell they yell louder


69. Nice
