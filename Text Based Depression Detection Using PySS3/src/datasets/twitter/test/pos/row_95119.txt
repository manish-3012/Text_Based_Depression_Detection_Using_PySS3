I think I should be back in the mental hospital. (vent) I'm so depressed and lonely that my only form of smiling or laughing is dark humor, and that only lasts a few seconds. I just realized how bad this is when I told my mom one of the jokes (telling her it was dark humor beforehand) and she said it was horrifying. I didn't mean to scare her, I just wanted to share something that made me laugh. I can't sleep, I'm failing my classes, I'm not eating as much as I used to, I don't leave the house, I don't talk to friends or see them, and people are starting to notice. I just stay in my room all day and listen to music and write and watch videos on youtube. I'm so depressed and anxious that I get up with a headache and panic attacks at eight in the morning. I think I should be in the psych ward again, but it's scary there and I've only been to the kids unit, not the teens one, and I've heard a lot of bad things about all of them. I can't focus on even washing my hair or petting my cat or dog for a few seconds. The maladaptive daydreaming is coming back, and I want to just live in these worlds that I've created where there's nothing wrong and I can do whatever I want with no consequences. I want to help out with problems, but I only make them worse. My dad is trying to bring him to "his side" by buying me things and acting like the best dad ever. My mom isn't any help and I don't think she understands how bad I feel about myself, to the point of not eating or talking and just sitting there, crying or thinking about everything else I could've done with my life instead of what I'm doing now. I can't trust anyone I know IRL because I don't want to be forced into the mental hospital again and they just don't listen. You guys and whoever else I find on the internet or whatever are more helpful than anyone else I know and anyone in my life. I know this is going to be buried under other posts of kids getting asked out or whenever, but I just needed to get this off my chest.
