Writing any and all papers for a small fee Iâ€™m a recent college grad, who graduated with a 3.8GPA. I will be getting laid off shortly due to the winter weather approaching. I went into college as an English major, but didnâ€™t come out one. Now in my free time I am looking to make some extra money while I am out of work. All work will be original with 0 plagiarism. I am willing to write papers, or do projects for pretty much any class. PM me if this is something you would be interested in, and please keep me in your mind for the future. Mods if this is against the rules feel free to take it down. Look forward to hearing from some of you.
