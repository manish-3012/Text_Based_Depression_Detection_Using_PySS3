My brother is acting crazy. Help? My parents arenâ€™t home, and my little brother [10] is running around the house screeching. He wonâ€™t stop laughing. Iâ€™ve tried to get him to calm down but he keeps throwing things at me. Right now Iâ€™m taking shelter in my room, because my parents wonâ€™t answer the phone. I need help, any advice?
