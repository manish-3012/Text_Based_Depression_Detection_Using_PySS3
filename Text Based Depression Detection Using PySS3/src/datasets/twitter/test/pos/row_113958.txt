You could have an additional 30 healthy years added to the end of your life, but you are unconscious for the next 10 years starting today. Would you do it? This means that youâ€™re basically in a coma, completely unconscious for the next ten years starting now. When you wake up you will have no medical bills. If youâ€™re 15, you will wake up 25. 

If you were going to live to be 80, youâ€™ll live to be 110. You wonâ€™t be sick in a hospital bed for 30 years, youâ€™ll still be healthy enough to move around and have a clear mind. 

Would you trade your youngest years for 20 extra years of life? Are all your years of life of the same value?
