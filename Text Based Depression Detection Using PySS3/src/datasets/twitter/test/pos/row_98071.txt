There is nothing wrong with being a gamer. So today at school I was talking to a girl (we where doing some lessons) we talked about what we did in the weekend quikly, and I said I bought a new game (skate 3) and then she did these hand signs to her freind ( she did the weirdo hand sign) I of course got really uncomfortable. 

Also everytime we go back from holidays we talk about what we did in the holidays, I of course game a bunch, and almost everyone is acting like gaming is weird, even the the teachers.

I play video games to escape from the real world, and I am social awkward and introverted.


BTW sry for bad English, it's my second language. Thanks for reading kind stranger, bye...
