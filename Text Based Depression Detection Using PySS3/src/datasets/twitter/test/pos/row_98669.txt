I realized that someone I consider very close with, doesnâ€™t want to associate with me anymore Iâ€™m really shocked and heartbroken, I saw an old post on this sub about her asking the sub on how to tell me not to talk about my problems with her anymore without it upsetting me. 

For context, this was someone I am really close with, almost like family. For the people who say â€œjust get professional helpâ€ I have a therapist, but I rarely see her. I also like to say that my problems involve my family, social life, mental health, and other stuff.

Iâ€™m in disappointed with myself and hatred of myself. I canâ€™t believe I fucked up so badly, this is my fault and I donâ€™t want this happening again. Iâ€™m genuinely tired of being myself and I just want to leave and start over. All I want is just another fucking therapist that I could see, she was my closest choice and I fucking blew it. God I hate myself.

If youâ€™re reading this, the person who made that original post...Iâ€™m sorry
