a tip for anyone learning german, dutch, any of the Scandinavian languages, or basically every other germanic language [the english has a thing called do-support. read this wikipedia page so i donâ€™t have to explain it](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do-support)

Celtic languages, and english are the only languages that have that. so instead in most other germanic languages instead of saying â€œdo you have a bananaâ€ you would say â€œhave you a bananaâ€. this construction does appear in english, although itâ€™s rare, and probably 90% of the time itâ€™s someone say â€œhave you no shameâ€
