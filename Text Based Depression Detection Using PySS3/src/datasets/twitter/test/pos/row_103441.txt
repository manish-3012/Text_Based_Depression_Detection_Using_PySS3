Anyone else turn their camera on for zoom lessons to keep the teacher company? Idk, I just know itâ€™s really annoying if youâ€™re taking and just staring at a bunch of blank tiles, also occasionally make more of an effort to look like Iâ€™m smiling or laughing if they make a joke cause at the end of the day the teachers are human too and probably hate zoom as much as we do. Also I find if I turn my camera on, other people are more likely to also turn it on so it just makes it feel more social and â€œnormalâ€
