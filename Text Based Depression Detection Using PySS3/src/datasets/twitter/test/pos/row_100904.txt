yo what happened in this situation that iâ€™m gonna explain so the other day iâ€™m coming home from my friends house tired as fucking running on a little less than three hours sleep 

and honestly i was too tired to give a fuck and i was feeling myself i was feeling good idk why

and i get off tha train and i see this girl and we make eye contact and i jus get this sinking feeling in stomach

and then iâ€™m all of a sudden self conscious 

we hold the contact for a bit then i leave 
never saw the girl ever again

why and how and what does this mean
