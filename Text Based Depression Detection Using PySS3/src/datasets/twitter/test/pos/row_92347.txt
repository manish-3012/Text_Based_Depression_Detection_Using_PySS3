soemthing about my relationshup feels a bit weird so i'm dating a transexual (it dosn't really matter for the story) but when i asked him if he wants to go out he said he can't and the same thing happend a few days later, i just thought he was busy and i was fine with it because we were facetiming everynight, but in the last few days he started acting weird, we added a friend to our facetimes a couple times and everytime our friend left the call he said he need to go, and then i started to feel like he dosn't want to be alone with me, i don't think i've done anything wrong (not that i remember) but when i asked him if he felt uncormtable around me he just didn't answer me.
has anybody been in the same situation and can tell me what to do so i won't freak out about him not wanting to be alone with me?
