Iâ€™m Just Frustrated and at My Wits End. I hated how in elementary school, middle school, and my early years of high school I was pushed by my mother to work hard and be the best in school. 

Now here I am, my last year of high school burnt out and confused. I was A honor roll, apart of GT, and Iâ€™ve been invited to various clubs because of my academic achievements but for what?? Just for me to reach the end and be burnt out? Unless youâ€™re going to some Ivy League school or prestige college or university, they could care less about middle school and your first two years of high school; they damn sure donâ€™t care at all about elementary school. 

I have no motivation, I donâ€™t really know what I want to do, I just want to move away from my family and home. I originally let my mother talk me into sticking around after I graduate, but now Iâ€™ve decided I want to leave. 

Only problem is, I only applied to one school because I knew thatâ€™s where I was going because it was close to home, literally like twenty minutes up the road. Now I want to leave but Iâ€™ve barely applied anywhere, thereâ€™s probably not a lot of financial aid left to go around for the school I do decide to go to last minute. 

My mental health is absolute dog shit. No one even knows I feel this way for me to be taken anywhere to be evaluated and get help. 

I lie to everyone and my doctor every year at my check up and say Iâ€™m doing great, which I kinda like but then again I hate it. Therefore, I have no sort of diagnosis for anything so Iâ€™m just constantly thinking Iâ€™m over exaggerating and Iâ€™m just invalidating the way I feel, even though I know this isnâ€™t a normal nor healthy way to think. 

Even if I did tell someone, they wouldnâ€™t care, theyâ€™d just see me as sensitive or just an extra person whoâ€™s trying to self diagnose something they donâ€™t have.
