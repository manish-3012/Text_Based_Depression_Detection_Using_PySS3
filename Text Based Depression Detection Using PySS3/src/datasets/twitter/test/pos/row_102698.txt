Reasons Iâ€™m a good partner lol  Iâ€™m non binary, they/them OR he/him 

Very addictive personality

I watch anime.

Donâ€™t know how to handle relationships in general 

I am a Redditor

Pissed off easily 

I care too much about others so Iâ€™m not gonna do anything to you without a good reason.

I Often push people away for what I think is their safety but is actually just me being stoopid 

My connections with people make it physically impossible for me to self harm, suicide or even bloody fall over of my own accord.

Stutter so I canâ€™t speak normally to people unless Iâ€™m very close to them  

Anxiety attacks every day every night for stupid reasons 

I play video games, Iâ€™m alright at a few. 

I donâ€™t care enough for myself 

On and off content creation, really uninspired right now though.

Optimist and a realist. I try to look ok the bright side but sometimes I canâ€™t, all I can see is the reality of the situation for better or for worse
