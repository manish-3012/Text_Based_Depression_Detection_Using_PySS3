My cousin's 18th birthday is in two weeks, and we're in a lockdown. My family is visiting my aunt's for a few, and we are gonna be here on my cousins birthday. and not just any birthday, his 18th!

So the problem is that there's a lockdown going on and we have no idea what to do. So far we are thinking about a treasure hunt, but any other ideas or any ideas for treasure hunt missions/cyphers stuff are appreciated... What do you guys think?
