I have decided to go against the odds and try to get my crush some day Ive alredy have posted some time before about this. Ive fell in love for the first time on my life. I tough she was imposible because she is eight years older than me, she is also quite famous, and lives in other country. 

I tried to forget her for quite a long time now. I told my dad about her. Who she was alnd how she made me feel. He told me to not forget her. He told me that I have a chanse. The only thing I need and want to do is just talk to her as a person rahter than a celebrity, and dont be so incistent or annoying with her. Still dont know how im gonna aproach her without being wired or that she thinks im searching her just because of her fame or something. But for now I have a plan. She became famous for animating short stories about her life. So my plan is learn to animate something good enough to get reconition. then find a way of make a collaboration with her and start talking with her thats all for now.
