Petition to make cuddling a friendly thing instead of a romantic thing If I want to cuddle with someone and just be in their arms, it doesnâ€™t inherently mean I wanna be with them or date them. Hugs arenâ€™t romantic, cuddling should be no different.

Cuddling, as an act, is honestly just really nice and I feel as if people would be a lot happier if we could all just cuddle and not feel weird about it.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
