Y'know, there's one thing I miss about being in a relationship It ain't getting nudes, or anything nsfw, nor is it sending eachother small gifts. I don't even miss being able to say I'm not single. But holy fuck I wish I had someone I could just call to sleep on a call together with. Idk why but its just such a nice thing.
