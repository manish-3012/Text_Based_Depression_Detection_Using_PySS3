my girlfriend came out as a lesbian (just so you know I'm a pansexual boy)
we were dating for about 3 months now and our relationship was really healthy, i thought i really found someone there. I was in an extremely bad mental state before we started dating. I recently lost one of my most loving friends due to suicide, which was tough but she helped me through it. I really really loved her and still do but i relapsed so fucking hard just now because she was really the string holding it all together. I of course told her that it's absolutely fine and that we could try as friends, but to be honest everything that reminds me of her now burns and doesn't help the pain. I don't know what to do since I barely have any friends left due to Covid and I can't really talk to someone about it. I don't need any stranger to say that their dms are open, i don't feel comfortable talking to an absolute stranger i just need some advice. if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them

just so you know i didn't really care about spelling and grammar in this text
