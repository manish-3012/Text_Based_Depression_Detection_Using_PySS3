I PRAY FOR ALL OF YOU MAY OUT HOLY FATHER BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU SAFE. MAY HE TAKE YOU TO GREEN PASTURES. MAY HE LIFT YOU FROM THE DARKNESS AND BATHE YOU IN HIS DIVINE LIGHT.

GOD LOVES MEMBERS OF HIS FLOCK, BY THEY BY HIS SIDE OR GONE ASTRAY. MAY HE CARRY THE MEEK AND THE MILD ON HIS SHOULDERS AND RAISE THEM TO THE SKY.

amen.
