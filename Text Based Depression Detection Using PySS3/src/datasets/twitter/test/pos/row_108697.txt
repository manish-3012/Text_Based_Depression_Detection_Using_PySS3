I canâ€™t tell if a dude likes me Now I sound dumb.. Iâ€™m bad with social stuff and all that and canâ€™t figure out if this guy likes me or is just being nice

Now to get started.. thereâ€™s this dude in my class, which is a split class and heâ€™s a year younger but we arenâ€™t that different. I go as a female at school, so he knows me as female. 

Heâ€™s one of the class clowns, kind of. Heâ€™s jokey, he goofs around and all that. However... He treats me a little differently than everyone else. Heâ€™s usually interested in what Iâ€™m doing like if Iâ€™m drawing or working on something. He laughs at my jokes and heâ€™s just way nicer to me than he is to anyone else. He talks to me seriously while he jokes around with his friends.

Whatâ€™s going on here..?
