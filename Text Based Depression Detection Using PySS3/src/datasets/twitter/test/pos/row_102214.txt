Iâ€™m finally gaining self confidence Iâ€™ve never had self confidence Iâ€™ve just been trying to follow societies norms and was just basic before because I didnâ€™t want to stick out. I felt horrible, like I wasnâ€™t really me. This time last year I was deep in the closet (as lesbian) and terrified to come out. Now Iâ€™m mostly out (except for to most of my family but Iâ€™m gonna come out to my siblings soon). Iâ€™m starting to be more myself and not just try to fit in with everyone else. Iâ€™ve had a lot more self confidence since Iâ€™ve stopped dressing basic and more how I want to. I used to feel ugly and insecure now Iâ€™m starting to gain self confidence for the first time in my life. For real. Because I just faked it for YEARS. Iâ€™ve struggled with depression for a while and I think Iâ€™m finally starting to feel a bit better. A bit happier everyday.
