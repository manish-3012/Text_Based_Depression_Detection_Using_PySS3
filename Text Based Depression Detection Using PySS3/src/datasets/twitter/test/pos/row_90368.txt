Is it bad that my only will to live is memes Its 2am where i live. I cant sleep, food stopped tasting good, art and video games stopped making me happy, my dad and stepmom are assholes, and i cant stop crying all the damn time. I was diagnosed with depression 3 years ago and all i think about now is when im gonna die. Im miserable and nothing helps me. I got a therapist a year ago and nothing has changed. I act happy so that my mom and some of my friends dont ask if im ok. The only thing that can even make me so much as feel a tiny bit happy are memes. Idk what to do anymore. Life is pointless. What should i do. Im at rock bottom and im only 14.
