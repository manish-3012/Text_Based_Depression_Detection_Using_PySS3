Bro people are dumb So a bunch of kids on Twitter and TikTok are saying that a law is going to pass where teachers can look at a girls private to know if they trans and tell them what bathroom to use, I did some research and the law that They want to pass is a law that will make sure schools check girls birth certificate (not their privates) if they trying to join a girl only sport and they will only allow biological girls because trans girls have a strength over girls as they were born boys and many donâ€™t go through hormonal therapy so they have the strength of a boy and itâ€™s like letting boys play in girls only teams and will make it hard for biological girls to get scholarships, I kinda donâ€™t see the problem with the bill being passed but what do yâ€™all think
