I just tried exercising after ages And my fuck am I dead! And I didn't even finish the workout! I used to exercise everyday and I kind of stopped because well, I could not be bothered and so we get to yesterday when I realized oh shit, I need to do that thing so I don't die of heart failure, but mainly so if shit hits the fan I can go fast a fuck boi. So I tried today and my arms have fallen off. This is gonna be painful for the next month
