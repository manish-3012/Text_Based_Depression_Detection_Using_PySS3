Have we entered a new space age? Lots of cool stuff is going to happen in space this year. NASA is going to finally launch a successor to the Hubble and orbit a spacecraft around the Moon later this year. SpaceX is making progress on the first fully reusable spaceship. A cancer survivor will be brought into space on the Crew Dragon and will become the youngest American in space.

Thanks to SpaceX space debris have been seen falling in the sky in the Pacific Northwest. It would be reasonable to assume these sightings will become more common. 

Russia and China plan to build a base on the Moon by the 2030s but the US, Japan, and Europe is already planning to assemble one.
