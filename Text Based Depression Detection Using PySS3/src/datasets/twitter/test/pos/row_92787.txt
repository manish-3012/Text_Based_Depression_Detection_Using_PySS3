Customers are so...yucky. Especially on the internet and it seriously shocks me. How can someone's personality be so bad... 


I'm not a businessperson but I sell stuff online to get rid of clutter; how is it through a transaction I can just sense how toxic this person is?


Also I get that when you're a seller you'll encounter a lot of shitty customers. But there's no such thing as a person with good personality but an extremely rude and toxic customer. If you're a bad customer you're DEFINITELY a shitty person. 


Yeah shocks me how rude customers have a social life. Or maybe they don't, idk. But Karens are always married for some reason lol
