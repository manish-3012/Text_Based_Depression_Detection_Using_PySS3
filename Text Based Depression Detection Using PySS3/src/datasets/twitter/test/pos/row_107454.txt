I LOST MY VIRGINITY!!!!! So like any sensible person, I always make sure to have around 10 virgins locked in my basement at all times  for blood sacrifices and such. So today started like any other day, I get up, eat breakfast, get ready for school and go make sure no one has escaped. However this is where everything went wrong. I unlock the door, walk down the stairs, turn the lights on and see that one guy is missing. So of course I immediately panic because if they go to the police it's over, they would let everyone out and put me into jail. It's for situations exactly like this one that I have a second, hidden room in my basement to move everyone into in case anyone comes to investigate. Extremely panicked I rush to move everyone to the hidden room, not even thinking about how I'll miss school. Then I remember to check who escaped so I know where their family lives and where to start searching, and as soon as I read the nametag on the cage I get extremely mad. I don't know how I didn't realize this earlier but of course it's the one person who always tries to start a rebellion even though I give them food and water once every few days, of course it's Ity who escaped.
