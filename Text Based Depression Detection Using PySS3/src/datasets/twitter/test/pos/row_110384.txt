My video game life Every Nintendo product I have ever bought has had a serial number with the first two characters being my initials. My initials are CJW. My Wii was CW, my Wii U is JW, and my 3DS was CW. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve always really liked Nintendo. Theyâ€™ve always had games that I really enjoyed, and when I was younger I always thought Nintendo had specifically made their products for me.
