Idk what to title this post I just want to talk about my feelings So like Iâ€™ve probably only thought about Suicide seriously maybe once in my life?(idk why probably something stupid.) Something like that but for a while now I used to think if some higher entity like god gave me the chance to be stripped from earth, making me have never existed permanently Iâ€™d take it, often lay awake at night thinking how much I wanted this, how long Iâ€™d think about if itâ€™d be better. But recently those thoughts and feelings have been gone, like I still feel sad and all that but now I wanna live through life. Idk for how long but itâ€™s a start. Sorry if this isnâ€™t the kinda thing to post here I just wanted to get this out.
