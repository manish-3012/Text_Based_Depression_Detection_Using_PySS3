is there anyone still active with anything over a 10 year club? i dont think ive bothered to check everyones profile to see when they joined reddit. if you can get someone with the highest possible year club (i think its 15) to respond to you in the comments both you and they get a gold :)   


(even though you wont get a gold please do show to me other active accounts with a year club above 10!)
