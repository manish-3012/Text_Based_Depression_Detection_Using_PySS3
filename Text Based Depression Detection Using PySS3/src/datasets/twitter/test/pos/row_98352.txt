Am i a risk patient? Ok so I've had bronchospasms since I was a child. My doctor said it would probably disappear after puberty and so it did. I just ocasionally can't breath well and need my medicine (i can survive without it tho). It happens when the conditions are given: mostly at night, cold air, too much running on winter, humidity, etc. The last time it happened was nearly a month ago and it surprised me a lot because I thought it was gone. It hardly ever happens. I'm a 15F and I started school, so it's very important for me to know.

I met friends during quarantine and I had some symptoms so there's some probability that I have already had covid and didn't notice (because the symptoms were not a lot yn).

Not a native English speaker btw. If there's anything you don't understand i'll try to explain it with other words.
