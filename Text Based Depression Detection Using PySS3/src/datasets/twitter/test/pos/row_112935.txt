I accidentally deleted my stoneblock world I have been playing stoneblock for a few months now, and I've com quite far, but today, I accidentally opened fullscreen which triggers an error I don't know how to fix in any other way than reinstalling the pack

This has happened a few times before, but every time, I've remembered to backup the world before I delete the pack, but not today. Today, I deleted the pack with the world and everything I had done. 

I know "a few months" is not long, but as I said, I had come quite far, and now I'm just dissapointed. 

Also if you know that it makes backups in other files than I delete, then tell me plz. I mean, it asks if you want to delete backups when you delete the pack, but I can't find any.
