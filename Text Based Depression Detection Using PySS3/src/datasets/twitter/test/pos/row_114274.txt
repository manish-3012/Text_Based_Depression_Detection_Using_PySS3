Any advice on how I as a teen guy can make girls more comfortable around me? I like to be with girls but I feel like they are a little bit shy when talking to me. I dont know what to do. Any advice??? In a few days me &amp; my friend &amp; 2 girls is gonna have a coffe evening. So I guess thatâ€™s a good thing with a group. :)
