(17f) Is anyone fearing going back to school now that lockdown is ending? I've never been good with change, but being at home for over a year and now suddenly being thrown back into college is freaking me out. 

I have no idea how they expect people who are terrified of going back to just snap out of it. Life can't just go "back to normal", and I hate that. 

I started a YouTube channel to cope with my stress, but the relief it gave me is starting to wear off now that I'm expected to go into college on Monday. 

I don't know if I can do it.
