I'm not turning in an assignment for the first time I was in a meeting with my High School Success teacher yesterday, and she mentioned how to take notes on the presentation. I didn't think anything about it because it's happened before and we didn't need the notes for anything. Then at the end of the hour-long meeting, she essentially says "oh and those notes are your exit ticket, bye".

I looked at the assignment and those notes are worth 0 points (yes, 0). And there's no way I'm spending 1.5 hours going back over the metting, squeezing a full page of notes out of that presentation for nothing in return.

So I'm just not going to send it in. What's she going to do, give me a 0?
