I have a question. What are ways to reduce poverty in this world? It's been in my mind. I went to Bangladesh (a very poor country) and remember seeing kids without an arm begging for money on the side of the road and sleeping on top of homes. So I wondered what could we do to at least reduce the poverty rate of the world by a little bit?
