I woke up wishing I didn't exist and wanting to die today. It was a pretty shit morning, and I felt like such a worthless disappointment, but then I found out it was international Monkey day and as silly as it was it made me happy. I spent the whole day on discord in VC with my friends who are a couple, and my childhood friend and I had a really deep conversation and I found out just how much she valued me as a friend. I even took some time in the day to widdle, and it made me feel really relaxed even if I did cut myself accidentally. For a couple hours ive just been in bed reading web comics and listening to Brazilian doomer music. Life may not be the best and I may be going through a rough patch but I think I can make it another day thanks for listening and goodnight / goodmorning :&gt;
