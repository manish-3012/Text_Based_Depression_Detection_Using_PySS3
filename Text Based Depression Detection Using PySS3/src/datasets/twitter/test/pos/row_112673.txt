[SERIOUS] One night, hell of a lot of stress. So, let me start off by saying tonight has been extremely stressful. As they have all been. First, virtual schooling has me pushed to the edge. Slap on top of that health problems, and you already have a big bomb. But apparently life thought, quoting Phil Swift: "That's a lot of damage!! HOW BOUT A LITTLE MORE-" Why do I say this? Well, first, a person that I'm not really friends with anymore ran away from home. Her parents were the first ones to call me thinking she was at my place. Then for an hour I was bouncing between her parents and her friends trying to track her down. Eventually the police found her in a bad part of town, and she was taken back home. Less then ten minutes after that fiasco, I got news that my Great Aunt passed tonight after battling cancer for round two. To say my stress is high is an understatement, and I don't plan on sleeping tonight. So, r/teenagers , do whatever. Comfort is appreciated.

Sincerely, Motor.
