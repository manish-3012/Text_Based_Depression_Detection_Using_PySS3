I don't want to live in my house anymore I'm 13 so obviously that's not an option. My mom threatened to kill herself in front of me and my little sister because I lost my left contact lens. My little sisters an absolute brat with my dad being an activator. My mom uses pity and her "history of abuse" to get what she wants.  I was going to go the the park with my dog and my mom isn't going to give me a ride there as "punishment" because I dropped my contact and she won't help me find it. I want to leave.
