GUYS SHE TOLD ME SHE LOVED ME IM SHAKING WHAT DO I DO Ok so basically 
Backwards to last June, go to school in the same class, I confess to her, she says "I'm not ready to be in a relationship and I really see you as a friend"
Fast forward to a week ago, she stopped being with a toxic guy (not even in relationship or anything just friends with home but really toxic guy) and came back to my friends and I. My feelings for her didn't disappear in half a year. We play minecraft together  with friends during a week, and now back to school. 
And now I was just chillin on forza horizon 4 and she messaged me her goofy adorable cute way and told me she loved me.
I don't know the fuck what to do.
