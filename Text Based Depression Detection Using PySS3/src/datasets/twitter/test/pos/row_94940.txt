How I made $100 in 1 hour Ok, this might sound like some sort of weird promotional ad for some sketchy website but I don't promote that load of bulls\*\*t. Anyway, it was so simple that it even surprised me. So I woke up and was like "You know what? I want some money." I literally just asked 5 people on the street at separate times for $20. That's it. Nothing else.  I will definitely not do that again (mostly because of me feeling guilty for some reason) but it felt good having 100 bucks in my hand.
