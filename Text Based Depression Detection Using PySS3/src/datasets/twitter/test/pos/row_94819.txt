I need help. I look very ugly. I am 16. All these years whenever I look into the mirror I saw myself as really beautiful and didn't care what others said but today after bathing I looked into the mirror and I felt very ugly. Also I have a relative whom I hate very much. My face seems to resemble her a lot today. I now feel like people who look good or at least average are taken seriously and a person like me will be neglected their whole life.
