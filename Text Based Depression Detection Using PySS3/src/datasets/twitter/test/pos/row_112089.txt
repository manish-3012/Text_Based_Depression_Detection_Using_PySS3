If the us goes to complete shit Iâ€™m probably going to move to Europe Switzerland is not an option, I have family from there, I love them but there also very annoying and by they I mean my aunt the rest of them are fine, I was thinking Sweden, I want to do computer science so I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll have a hard time finding a job in most places, at least in theory 

If your wondering why not Canada, thatâ€™s cuz Canada is cold and this is true fuck Canada, yeah I do think there better than the us but thatâ€™s a low fucking bar and itâ€™s worse than a lot of European countries in so many ways
