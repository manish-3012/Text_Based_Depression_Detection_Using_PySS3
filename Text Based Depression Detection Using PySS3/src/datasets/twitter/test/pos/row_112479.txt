Anxiety is making me depressed I want to become an actress because acting is my passion and I havenâ€™t found another job that would truly make me happy in life. The problem is, all these people are saying it is impossible to make it as an actress (including my parents, unfortunately). 

I understand that itâ€™s very difficult and that statistics say I wonâ€™t make it, but I honestly donâ€™t care if I become famous or not. The anxiety of being told that I will be a failure if I pursue this is making me question if I should do something else to make my parents happy (validation, ya know?). But, the thought of that makes me hopeless because I donâ€™t want to be unhappy with my life.

Iâ€™ve had depressive episodes in the past and I think another one is starting because of this among other things (also caused by my GAD).

Help? Advice? Anything helps.
