Hi, I'm u/KirbIsCool. Have you ever wanted to know how to make the most basic and potential garbage omelette ever? Well turns out i'm a bad cook and have just the technique for you. Here are some of the ingredients you will need (you can probably find all of these in your house if you look hard enough)

Eggs 

Oil



Begin with cracking your eggs into a bowl. Remember to get as little shells as possible into the bowl and if any do get in to pull them out.

After your eggs have been cracked you can either wisk first and add salt and peper later or do it the other way round. Be creative.

Now get a pan, figure out why we have oil and start pouring, make sure not to pour to much because then it will be an oily mess.

Now pour the eggs into a pan, tilt the pan slightly from side to side to allow the eggs to cover the surface of the pan completely, as the eggs cook keep checking the down facing side until it is a light brown then flip the omlette over and do the same thing.
(Don't worry if the circle is broken when flipping over, just call it scrambled eggs and you're fine)

Now you can fill the omelette with something but since your following this recipe I will assume you have no idea what flavour is and need a guide, some good flavours are: grated cheese, ham, herbs, mushrooms and salmon. Put these fillings over the top of one side of the omelette and fold gently in half.

And there, you have an excuse of an omelette
