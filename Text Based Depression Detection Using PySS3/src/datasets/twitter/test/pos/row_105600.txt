How long fo you think it will be until smartphones reach a stalemate? Technology is limitless, humans are not. We are limited only to what our bodies are capable of. We already have screens that can refresh at 144hz on smartphones. Can our eyes even detect anything faster than that? Is there any need to go higher? We have phones with 4K displays. Is anything higher than 1080p necessary on an 8" display? Can our eyes even tell the difference? Phones can only get so fast before we are eventually unable to perceive any difference in speed. Image resolution can only get so good until we can no longer see the difference. Do we even need better cameras? They've been good enough for the average consumer since 2017. It's only a matter of time before all phones are IP68 water and dust resistant, have 60V super fast and wireless charging and it's no longer a selling point. 

If it continues, it's going to reach a point where the only thing that can be improved is battery life and with a 5,500mAh battery, is it even needed to be improved on? The only other alternative is if broadband speeds became more advanced (6G?) and made use of the extra capabilities. Either way, when do you think the plateau is going to happen?
