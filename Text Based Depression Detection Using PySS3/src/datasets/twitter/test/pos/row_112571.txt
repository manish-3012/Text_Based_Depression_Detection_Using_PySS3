i stood up for someone I stood up for her in a group chat

i said "yall be too rude, theres a limit to a joke" and idk , i l dont like fights or confrontations but i had to stand up for this girl because they were full on bullying her, and I'm kind of scared to see what they replied with and ugh idk, can yall empower me or smt?
