When will it start? From about 4th grade to 7th grade, I was chunky. In 8th grade, I became really skinny, but still had fat on me. Like my chest and a little on my stomach. Iâ€™ve been doing chest workouts for a bit now, as well as trying to eat better and run when I can. I havenâ€™t seen any changes though. Thereâ€™s barely any fat, but Iâ€™m wondering when Iâ€™ll see changes.
