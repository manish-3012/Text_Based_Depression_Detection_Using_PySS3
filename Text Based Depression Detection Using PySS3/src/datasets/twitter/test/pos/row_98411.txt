I have a new proposal for numbering years We should stop saying last year as 2019 and instead call it 1 BC, as in 1 Before Clown World because thatâ€™s all 2020 is. 2020 would be 1 CE, as in 1 Clown World Era.

It pisses me off that the alt-right stole the term clown world last year because they threw a hissy fit over the world not being like the 1950s anymore. They were one year away from REAL clown world. Like it seriously feels like weâ€™re living in a simulation all of the horrible things that are going on. Like on top of the pandemic thereâ€™s yet another tropical cyclone that will make landfall on the Atlantic coast this year in a few days, and this one will be a category 3 Hurricane that will probably devastate Central America but thatâ€™s just par for the course for 2020.

I know that this shit wonâ€™t go away when 2020 ends but considering that the clown world bullshit literally started on New Yearâ€™s Eve 2019 with the announcement of the coronavirus (which has probably been in America for like a year at this point imo, but because China is modern day Nazi Germany they almost certainly covered it up for months and thereâ€™s an off chance they even engineered it) and then all the Iran tensions beginning as soon as 2020 started, maybe things will rapidly get better around New Yearâ€™s Day. Itâ€™s unlikely, but Iâ€™ve been shocked repeatedly this year.

Letâ€™s just hope that 2021 isnâ€™t 2 CE.
