Fuck people who think that making fun of anyone but but certain groups isnâ€™t racism Today I was playing on a Minecraft SMP server, when a guy asked me which country I was from. Well obviously I straight up told them that I was from India, cuz thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m from. Then the guy along with a few others start making fun of me calling me a burnt sausage because of my skin color and then asking me on how I live in such a shithole and that how we eat the shit of cows. I straight up asked them to stop and told them that it was very uncomfortable and that this was racism. After all this, THEY STILL HAD THE AUDACITY TO SAY THAT RACISM IS ONLY TOWARDS BLACK PEOPLE AND NOT ANYONE ELSE AND THAT IM BEING A WHINY ASS. I reported them to the mods (server has a discord server) and the mods straight up said they couldnâ€™t do anything as they too didnâ€™t feel it was racism. I honestly donâ€™t know what to do and if youâ€™re wondering no, Iâ€™m not gonna be playing on that server anymore.
