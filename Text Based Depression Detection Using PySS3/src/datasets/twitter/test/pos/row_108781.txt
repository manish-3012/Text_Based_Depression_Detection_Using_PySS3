How to tell Australian states and territories apart by what you can find New South Wales: Home to the Sydney Opera House and the main place people visit.

Victoria: A home for Melbourne and Covid-19

Queensland: A home for invasive toads and the slightly off.

Western Australia: The big one, Home to the Quokkas and known for Chinese tourists and being 20 years behind the rest of the country because it doesn't get any tax, even though the mining industry is most of the nation's economy.

South Australia: Home to Kangaroo Island, an island, with kangaroos.

Tasmania: The Island below, home to shitloads of rain and about 4 people.

Northern Territory: Not a state for some reason even though they totally could be a state if they wanted to, home to desert, desert, more desert and a really big rock.

Australian Capital Territory: Home to government buildings, decriminalized marijuana and uhhh, that's about it.

Note: I do not wish to offend anyone, this is all presented in way that is supposed to be humorous, if you feel offended by this post I apologize.
