How do I force myself to give a shit about school? I might be expelled if I dont pull my shit together and start studying but I just cant. I can finish assignments on time but when it comes to tests I really have bad scores. Its not like Im lazy since, as I said before, I can finish assignments just fine. Its like Im tired but have nothing to be tired about so I cant study properly.
