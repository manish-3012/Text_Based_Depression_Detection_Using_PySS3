Approach to a first time job I am 19 and Iâ€™ve never had a job before. I really want to get a job so I can at least have something to put on a resume, but I am so so anxious. Every time I get excited thinking about getting a job at Starbucks, a sandwich place, Walgreens, or somewhere else that doesnâ€™t require previous job experience, I just freak out. I get scared of interviewing and then once I stop panicking about an interview, I start freaking out about doing something wrong and getting reprimanded at work. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll ever become a functioning member of society. I feel like most people have had a first time job by this age so the more time goes by, the more worried I feel. Can anyone relate to this? Or give me any tips about getting past first job anxiety/interview anxiety? Iâ€™m literally freaking out a little thinking about it while writing this post.

TL/DR: I am 19 and have never had a job, how do I get over being so anxious/ how did you learn to nail a job interview/ function day to day at a regular job?
