Everyone is talking about the mods so Iâ€™m going to add my two cents [Serious] If someone calls out a user for pedophilia, they should not be banned. If the mods wonâ€™t change the rules they should at least implement an easy to understand and use system where you can report a user for pedophilia (or some other misdemeanor) so they get banned without the users getting punished for trying to make this sub a better, safer place.

On another topic, in the past I have seen far too many queerphobic memes as top posts. Itâ€™s not super common, but it comes up every so often and I donâ€™t understand why the mods allow those posts to exist.

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk ðŸ™ƒ
