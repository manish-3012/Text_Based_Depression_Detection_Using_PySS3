Do girls have more rights and power over boys in schools? Out teacher held us over 15 minutes after class (despite having no right to) so girls can safely go home and its about snowballing them, i have noticed that girls always have the avantage of the victim and get punished less than boys since they are â€œweakâ€, not even talkin about how many cases of fake rape have been in our school in which girls with 0 proof expeled the boys and made them pay fees. So do girls have an unfair ammount of rights and privilege in school, posted the exact question on r/feminism and got instantly banned
Will try to answer all the comments
