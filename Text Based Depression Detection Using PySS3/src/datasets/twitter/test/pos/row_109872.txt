It just occurred to me that Iâ€™m growing I know Iâ€™m growing, but i mean *growing* growing. As in age. 

I was lying down at 3am trying to sleep when I realised that in 10 years, heck 3-4 years, Iâ€™llâ€”we wouldâ€”be a full blown adult with a job, apartment, etc. 

We might even have kids. I just wonder if people actually realise that they are growing up and are going to be a parent, boss, ceo or anything soon. 

Soon, weâ€™ll be saying, â€œwhen I was your age. . .â€

Or

â€œCherish your youth and take risksâ€”donâ€™t be like me.â€ 

Or saying â€œThis was my high school friend and we havenâ€™t met in 20 years or since 21â€™ â€œ 

Do you guys feel the same?
