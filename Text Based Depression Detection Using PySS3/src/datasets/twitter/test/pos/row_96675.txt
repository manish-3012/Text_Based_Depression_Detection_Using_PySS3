You guys and your â€œcrushesâ€ are ridiculous. No, youâ€™re not in love. Youâ€™re a teenager. Sure, itâ€™s ok to date as teenagers, but you guys take it wayyyyyy too seriously. Youâ€™re not going to marry your â€œcrushâ€ and live happily ever after with them. Youâ€™ll find love when youâ€™re older. So stop being ridiculous and obsessing over your dumb â€œcrushesâ€
