aw shit looks like my subconscious is playing a cruel joke on me :) my brain won't stop plaguing me with thoughts of being eternally single. I would cry but I don't have the energy to cry. I know I'm young and everyone says "you'll find someone eventually" then again maybe my brain wasn't built right to handle relationships since I was cursed with aspergers. As some one on the spectrum part of my disability makes me perseverate on shit and one thing my brain will not stop doing is perseverate on my singleness. Idk I just needed to rant here I will be on my way to try and cry myself to sleep if I even can fall asleep and have peaceful sleep too.
