If I ever ran a theme park, I'd make it a rule that you *must* dress up in at least the style of characters from that universe. If not, your tickets will be refunded, and you can come back later. It just \*ruins\* the feel of the park when you see someone, say, for instance, in Galaxy's Edge in Disneyland, in a T-shirt and shorts and flip flops(thongs for Australians)(Why you're wearing those in a place like Disney, idk dude. That sounds like it'd hurt your feet) and takes a camera or their phone and it's bright pink or blue. I know it's kind of silly, but if people want to dress up, they likely want other people to dress up with them as well. It wouldn't even have to be that extravagant, you'd just need a leather jacket or pleather, a dark colored shirt, some dark pants, and boots. Other than that you'd be fine. Like, I created a character in my head that I could easily dress up as, with just things I can buy at Goodwill or Walmart.  Sorry for the rant, I was watching Star Wars stuff and realised how many people just won't dress up for a \*theme\* park. :/
