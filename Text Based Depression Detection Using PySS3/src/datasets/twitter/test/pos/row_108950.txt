I need some help rn this is just a vent and I need some help

This is long and probably has some typos because Iâ€™m on my phone but please hear me out. Iâ€™m 13 female and my sister is 15

Recently, out of nowhere, the lockdown suddenly hit my family pretty hard. Weâ€™re being safe, not seeing anyone except for each other and another family who weâ€™ve created a bubble with, and are our best friends. My sister is a social person and recently itâ€™s been pretty tough on her. She has a borderline eating disorder now because at the beginning of this year she started to work out a LOT and eat less. She stopped being affectionate to me and my parents (she and I were super close) and hasnâ€™t hugged me voluntarily in a couple of months. I can tell sheâ€™s really pained and I feel so sorry, but I donâ€™t know how to help since she wonâ€™t talk to me and gets defensive and angry whenever I try. Itâ€™s slightly more under control now, as my parents are trying their hardest to take care of her and are looking for therapists (she asked for that too). 

But hereâ€™s the part where Iâ€™m fucking up. I recently cut myself. I have 5 cuts or so now, over the course of like, 3 or 4 days. Mind you, theyâ€™re not deep at all and the only one that drew blood *for real* I did with a hair scissor. Anyways. Iâ€™m not doing it for release, or because I want to die, or because it gives me a high. 

Really I made the conscious (however impulsive) decision to go to the bathroom, clean a pair of scissors from my dads bag, and do it. I did it because recently Iâ€™ve been really numb. When I see something sad I donâ€™t cry, my empathy isnâ€™t working right now, idk. My sister was sad, and in pain and I hate it but I didnâ€™t feel a thing. 

She was crying and I kid you not I started laughing. I searched it up and thatâ€™s pretty normal for some people, because itâ€™s to ease tension in strained situations. I donâ€™t want her to think Iâ€™m an asshole but I wouldnâ€™t stop smiling. Itâ€™s annoying. 

I havenâ€™t been in pain physically for a while so I just did it to myself. And it wasnâ€™t too bad. But I should stop, I know. Itâ€™s just, idk I feel like Iâ€™m giving myself a reason to be in pain because I need to let it all out. I only ever feel bad for myself now and I donâ€™t know if that makes me a narcissist or psychopath but I really hate it. I want to cry because it feels so good when I do. But itâ€™s getting harder to. 

I had one of those dreams recently where you just sob uncontrollably and feel so much emotion and when you wake up you cry a little bit until you realize thereâ€™s nothing to cry about. And it felt so good. I cried a little bit ago funnily enough and it was nice. But it was while I was supposed to be asleep so I couldnâ€™t cry out loud. I havenâ€™t cried out loud in several years. All of them have been stifled and I just want to scream and cry. 

But I donâ€™t want to be another burden on my parents or sister. Because all of them are in so much lain right now. My mom was crying earlier because she was sad about my sisters â€œissueâ€. I canâ€™t come out to them and ask for help because theyâ€™re busy with my sister, and I wouldnâ€™t think to go to my sister because she is having her own problems. I canâ€™t go to my friend whom weâ€™re in a bubble with because she wouldnâ€™t understand I think and I fear she would judge me. So I came here. 

Any advice? I think I need it.
