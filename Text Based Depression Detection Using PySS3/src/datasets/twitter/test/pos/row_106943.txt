I had physical school today! I had actual school today! So weird. We all had our masks on the entire time and everything was sanitized so it was cool. They made us maintain social distancing so it was all good. 

I'm in 11th grade and my batch were the only ones in school today. My class is small with about 19 people, we were in large rooms with spread out desks. 

It was pretty cool, I got to see some friends I haven't seen in a while. 

Still, I'm at my limit for social interaction :/
