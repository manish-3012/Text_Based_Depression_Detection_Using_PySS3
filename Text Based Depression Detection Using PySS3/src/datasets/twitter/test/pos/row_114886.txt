So I took a little break from hw I decided to text my friend bc I havent talked to him for a couple days. He responded to me and we chatted for 2 minutes. Then, he just abruptly told me that he had to go, he always does that when we text. i feel like he doesnâ€™t want to talk to me, he always Makes time to play Minecraft with his friends but never time to talk to me. Is there anything I doing wrong? I mean he does have hw and karate but he takes frequent breaks.
