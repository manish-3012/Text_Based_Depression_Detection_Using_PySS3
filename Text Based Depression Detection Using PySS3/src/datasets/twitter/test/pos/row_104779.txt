I hate this. My family is poor. People say I belittle the suffering of black people by saying I live in the hood. People say Iâ€™m a liar because I go to a good school. I got a scholarship by working hard. We keep getting water shut off. I tried getting a part time job to help out but this shit is crazy. You ready? They canâ€™t hire me because Iâ€™m white. The movie theatre said they are only hiring people from â€œdiverse backgroundsâ€. Like they actually wonâ€™t hire me because of my skin color. This shit just flipped around real quick. I get it, black people have had a rough go at it and itâ€™s important they get the same opportunity as I do, but this is crazy.
