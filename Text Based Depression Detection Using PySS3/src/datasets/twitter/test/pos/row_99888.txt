Uninstalling reddit (finally) i've been using this app less and less recently, with the start of the senester, and I'm finally uninstalling it. I couldn't be happier. I don't have to sit in the bus and awkwardly scroll through reddit/twitter. I finally got a decent pool of friends that I can comfortably talk to without feeling like a condom that was used twice. Bye yall u should focus on ur social life especially when ur a teen, my final message. Bye hope u have a nice day
