We are not strangers in love
You know the rules, and so do I.
I can only think of commitment
You will not receive it from others
I just want to convey my feelings
This will let you know
Do not give up
It never disappoints you
I didn't leave you
It won't make you cry
I'm not saying goodbye
He never lies and will not hurt you
We have known each other for a long time
Your heart still hurts
You are embarrassed to say that
Inside, we all know what happened
We know the game and then play
When you ask me how you feel
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
Do not give up
It never disappoints you
I didn't leave you
It won't make you cry
I'm not saying goodbye
He never lies and will not hurt you
Do not give up
It never disappoints you
I didn't leave you
It won't make you cry
I'm not saying goodbye
He never lies and will not hurt you
I will not give, i will never give
(Do you give up?)
(Oh, oh)
I will not give, i will never give
(Do you give up?)
