How do I make sure I donâ€™t laugh I have to do a speech in front of the school and thank the traditional owners of the land, last time I did it in the practice apparently I sounded super sarcastic and everyone watching the practice was joking about it.

Now Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™m gonna laugh when I say it; how do I make sure I donâ€™t?
