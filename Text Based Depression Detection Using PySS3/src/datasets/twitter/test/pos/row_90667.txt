Instagram stories about guys Iâ€™m just on Instagram checking dms and all that, and I guarantee at least once, somebody posts something about how guys are 99.9999999% more likely to rape someone. Donâ€™t get me wrong, rape is an evil act and completely sickening, but I think itâ€™s very unfair for, not saying always but girls usually ( in my experience ), post things like â€œboys, your silence is very loudâ€ or â€œeducate your sonâ€ and even things like blatant statistics like â€œ1 in 3 of us will be sexually assaulted by a young man in our lifetimeâ€ what the hell? Guys can be assaulted aswell, and we donâ€™t go pointing fingers at every girl we see. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve uninstalled Instagram. Just wondering if anyone else feels the same. Also, I am not saying every girl/woman does this Iâ€™m just saying me experience. Also, my full support goes to anyone that has been assaulted. Just my experience.
