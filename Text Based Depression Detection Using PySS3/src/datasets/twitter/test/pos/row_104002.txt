i hate everything I do tbh everything I do literally just pisses me off
i am so insecure and for w h a t
everything I do, I'm just constantly second guessing and judging. i care about people's opinions of me WAY too much. like I'm literally shaking as I type this because someone might call me cringe. like bro what. that's so pathetic. 
i always try so hard to be cool and quirky and fit into what people say a girl should be like. and it's so stressful. and  constantly stressing myself out over the dumbest things. things that don't even matter. it doesn't even matter. all of these things don't even matter. they don't matter now and they won't matter in the future. so why am I like this ðŸ˜«

if someone could just give me a new brain that would be great thx &lt;3
