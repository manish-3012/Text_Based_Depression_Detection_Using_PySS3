My dog is missing My dog went missing a couple days ago, however my mom didn't bother to call and tell me (I was at my dad's house). It's probably stupid to be mad at my mom about it, but I told her a lot to please not let the pets out unless she was with them because they're all really small and living on the outskirts of town, we have a lot more coyotes. She didn't listen and then my cat went missing, she again didn't tell me for a few days because I wasn't at her house, and she didn't bother to look and got mad when I left to go looking for him. My cat went missing a few months ago and I haven't seen him, he's either dead, or someone found him, she still didn't listen to me and would let my dog and other cat out, at least now she's at least calling the pound. And the worst part is that I don't know how well my cats gonna take this, he never sat by windows he'd always be under my bed or on a shelf in my closet, when the cat went missing he never left the window, I don't know if he was looking for his friend but he's gotten considerably less energetic and just seems sad, he doesn't want to climb the tree anymore, stuff like that, and now his very best friend, the dog he grew up with is missing. I don't know what to do, I can't drive and it's storming out so my mom won't let me go look by bike, all I can do know is hope he comes back. She told us the dog was missing earlier and then immediately started talking about how we need to go on walks with her and she generally started talking as if the dog just wasn't gone.
