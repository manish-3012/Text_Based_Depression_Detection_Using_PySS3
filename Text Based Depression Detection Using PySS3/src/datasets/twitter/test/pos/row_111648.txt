I'm academically smart, but not street smart. And I fuck up because of that quite a lot of times. I'll turn 18 this year, and I'm terrified. Any tips, smart fellas? Not to forget that I was under depression when I was 12-13-14, so I pretty much spent the time crying when teens are supposed to be experimenting. 
I want to know my style, I want to experiment, but now I'm just stuck up between lots of study I have to do to get in a college. I tend to be fooled easily by people, am clumsy, can't maintain eye contact when talking to a person. My parents call me out for it everyday saying how am I gonna live alone. 
TL;DR : I know I suck at life, but I really want to improve. Any tips regarding fashion, being social, general adulting are welcome. 
P.S. I have a very supportive guy by my side, and I'm glad I have him. Life doesn't hurt with him.
