I hate the greed of humans One of my best friends was this girl, anna. She was amazing in every way. We used to do all kinds of things and get in all kinds of fucking trouble together. She always managed to make someone feel good about themselves even if they didn't deserve it, but she had type 1 diabetes as well as other shit that made living a pain for her. Her parents have never made enough money but they always barely had enough for her insulin, but after covid they didn't have enough money at all. So anna was trying to ration her insulin, but it wasn't for her. It was false hope for her parents. She knew she was going to die either way, she had a quater of a months worth of insulin to ration for 6 months. She even told me "Don't miss me too much ok." I was always there for her and it hurts that I wasn't there when she passed, she was all alone. There wasn't even a funeral because of covid. She would have been 17 today. She always wanted to be 18 just so she could. Now she's never going to be able to. Fuck human greed, she needed medicine to stay alive that her parents couldn't afford because some asshats exploit the needs of others for their own gain.
