Itâ€™s my 16th birthday! Itâ€™s 3:30 in the morning and is my birthday today! Iâ€™m going to sleep but was wondering if anyone would like to make my day a little brighter by wishing me happy birthday for when I wake up for school? It might seem like an odd request but Iâ€™m usually a bit sad on my birthdays and this year I am refusing to give in and could use all the help I can get! Thanks for reading and I hope you all have an amazing day!
