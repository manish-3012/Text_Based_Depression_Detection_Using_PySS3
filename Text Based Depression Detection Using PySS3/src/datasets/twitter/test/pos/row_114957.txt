anyone else feel like weâ€™re reliving 2021 in a sense?? itâ€™s all so surreal; i almost canâ€™t believe half of this is happening last year, in january, i remember watching the australian bushfires and thinking, â€œwow. this is probably going to be the highlight/worst part of 2020.â€ i just remember thinking it was really interesting that the timing for the bushfires just happened to align with my lifeâ€™s timeline. that was really a weird feeling, and now iâ€™m getting the same feelingâ€”a big thing happened again thatâ€™s all over the news. idk if itâ€™s going to be the highlight of 2021 or if the rest of 2021 is just as shitty, or possibly even WORSE than 2020.

this is all just such a surreal experience and we can only hope for the best going forward i guess
