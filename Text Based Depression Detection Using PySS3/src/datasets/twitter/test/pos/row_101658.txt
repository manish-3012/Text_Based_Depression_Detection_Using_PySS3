if y'all motherfuckers get to call yourselves witches... and dance around with tarot cards and offerings and spirit readings and all that crap, then I reserve the right to collect swords for a quest to take the holy land.  If y'all can pretend to cast spells and hexes and shit, I get to babble about reclaiming Jerusalem.

Deal?
