2 days ago I took a inch of my hair 

Like a idiot me and my friend were messin at like 3 am dunking are Heads in water to keep are selfs awake I have this weird curly fringe bits that just hang over my glasses and I cut a inch of being dumb since it is normally curly it you have to do a dry cut but I was dunking my head in water And half a inch grew back so now Iâ€™m starting to look good again

TLDR:I cut my hair like a idiot but it grew back real quick. is this normal ?

Edit: my hair instead of curling is swooping to the side how to fix
