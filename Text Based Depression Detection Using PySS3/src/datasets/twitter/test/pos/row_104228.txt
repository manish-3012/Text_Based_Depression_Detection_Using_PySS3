My "Best Friend" on Meds for Depression 

i have this friend, who i used to know, because i barely recognize the person that she's become because of her meds she's taking. They have absolutely changed her for the worse. She says she's "never felt better" and is "happy to be alive", but she's become this hallow shell of her former self and its just sad to watch. We were each others number one supporters, and had something beyond friendship growing as we wanted to date. Feels as though she doesn't
 need me anymore and tossed me aside, she barely talks and feels like a robot and I just don't know what to do, please someone give me advice.

also, if i ever try and make an argument or point, she'll ghost me for a few days and then barely text or talk at all to me for a week. so, "talking to her" is going to be EXTREMELY HARD.
