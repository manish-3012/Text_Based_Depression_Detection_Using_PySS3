Should I tell my friends that I have social anxiety and depression? So I recently went through one of the hardest times of my life, I wanted to kill myself and I relieve stress with pain. I saw a therapist and I'm doing much better now but I still slip up sometimes and self harm. I struggle with motivation and finding a reason to get up in the morning. I also have memorized possible ways conversations could go so I will always be prepared for a sudden conversation. Should I tell my friends about this? When would I saw this, like would I just drop this bomb when were play cod together?
