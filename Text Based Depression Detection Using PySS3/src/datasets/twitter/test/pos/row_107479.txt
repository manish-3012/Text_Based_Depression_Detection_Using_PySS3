Our homie has moved on If you look at my last post on this subreddit you'll know what happened. Basically my long time best friend has extracted himself from our friend group, we used to play games in the playstation everyday. Now he sent me a picture of his unplugged playstation saying he left that life behind. We're looking for someone new to play with and make great memories with on the playstation. Me and my friend are both 15 and need someone to fill the spot of our lost homie. EST
