I got rejected from the same internship 3 times, today was the third time Basically i got an email today that said i didn't pass(again) and i should improve and apply again in 6 months.It was a type of internship that my parents told me a about and wanted me to pass since it would look great on my resume. The first time i applied and got rejected i was a little demotivated and i thought i should maybe try my luck again but after failing the third time i completely don't want to apply again.I even got a little jealous when i heard that 2 of my friends actually applied and got accepted but i didn't mind and congratulated them.

I don't know if i should apply again in 6 months or just move on...

Either way i still feel stupid that i couldn't pass
