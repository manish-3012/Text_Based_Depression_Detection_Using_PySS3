I ran my first DND game tonight!!! I just finished DMing my first game for the first time ever and it went really well! They only got through half of my dungeon but itâ€™s ok cuz they are gonna finish it next week. Iâ€™m so excited.
Iâ€™ve only played like 5 times as a player but I did really well I think.
