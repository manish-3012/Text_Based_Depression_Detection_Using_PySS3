Do parents gain a gene that makes them overreact the second their kid is born? I just told them that I have two Câ€™s on my final report card, and they treat it like I am a failure. I donâ€™t think that they realize how good of a kid in terms of behavior and grades I actually am. I could be drinking, getting girls pregnant and committing crimes, but since I have a C, Iâ€™m a disappointment. I just wish that they could see how hard school actually is, instead of underestimating it and expecting perfection. Also, I donâ€™t get why parents go straight to negative reinforcement. I get that giving me something to work towards is good motivation, but it makes everything seem like itâ€™s just to get to their standards.
