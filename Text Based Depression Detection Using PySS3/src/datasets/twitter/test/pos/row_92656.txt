I Don't know if this is right subreddit but I need help easing my anxiety with a girl I'm talking to So, i have a crush on this girl on my class, she (hopefully) doesn't know and because of mexican beer virus I can only talk through text, well "talk" I usually just text her memes we share light conversation about said memes and we go about our days, but recently she doesn't respond or text anything back to me and god knows why but my brain always immediately thinks of the worst case scenario whenever something goes wrong, so right now part of my brain is convinced she's blocked me even I think she wouldn't have a reason to I only text her like once a month and it's never anything block worthy. I don't even know what I'm asking for in this post but any advice is welcome.

P.S sorry for bad formatting I'm on mobile
