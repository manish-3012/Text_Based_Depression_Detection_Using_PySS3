Looking for willing members!

I am trying to make a metroidvania game, but due to my lack of experience in some of the aspects, and the sheer size of the planned game, I cannot do this alone. I currently have 2 members on the team, me and u/BattleblockB0ss. 

People needed:

A programmer to help with Battleblock.

Someone to deal with the animations.

Someone to help with sprites.

Someone to help with music.

Someone to help with the environments and atmosphere.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I can pay the people who work on this, since it is a passion project
