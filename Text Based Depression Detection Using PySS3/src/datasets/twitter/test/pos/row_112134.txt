does anyone else just feel like they canâ€™t trust their parents with who they are? i just canâ€™t open up to them. i got no reason either, they are great parents. itâ€™s just i canâ€™t help but hide myself from them. iâ€™m overly infatuated with not failing them, even though i think i know i never could. anyone else feel this?
