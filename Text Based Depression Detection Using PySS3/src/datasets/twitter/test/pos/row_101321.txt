i really want to make music but i just cant. im never satisfied with my songwriting skills, singing ability, or guitar playing

tbh iâ€™d say im pretty good at all of those, but itâ€™s never good enough for me. i always think my lyrics are way too uncreative and cheesy, my singing is subpar, and i cant make any creative guitar riffs
