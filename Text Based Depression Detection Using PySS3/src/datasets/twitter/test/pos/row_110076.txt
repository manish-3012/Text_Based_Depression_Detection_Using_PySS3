Iâ€™m gonna make a move Alright so thereâ€™s this girl whoâ€™s been my friend for quite some time now. We both talk to each other about our hardships but she also talks to me about if she should date someone or that someone asked her out. Now, I havenâ€™t done any of that. For all that she knows, weâ€™re both friends. I donâ€™t wanna be that guy who is stuck in the friend zone and canâ€™t get out, what do I do guys?
