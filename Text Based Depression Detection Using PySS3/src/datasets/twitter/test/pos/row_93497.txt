I can unsubscribe my school email from the school email list I decided to read the fine print at the bottom of my schools email newsletters today, and apparently you can opt out of not only the newsletters, but getting emails from any account tied to the district, removing your email from the approved mailing list (meaning no one on a school approved account can email you).

I can remove my school made email from the school made mailing list so I never get messages from teachers or the school again, and cannot view school restricted content - essentially making it so I donâ€™t have to school until they put me back on the list with the valid excuse that I wasnâ€™t getting anything and be unable to view what little I may get.
