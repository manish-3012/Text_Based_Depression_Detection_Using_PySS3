Re-budgeting Filler Filler Filler So we can all agree the US spends money in stupid was, right? Not enough here, way too much their, none at all here, etc. I want the next president after Biden or trump(because we all know neither of those bitches are capable of anything good) To focus on completely overhauling the Federal budget, cause Iâ€™d imagine weâ€™d have so much money left over do fix all the problems we have without having to hack taxes up so much. Iâ€™m a Bernie fan, but I know that no one would vote for him because of the races theyâ€™d have to pay with his plans. If we can dampen the cost with money we are already spending In stupid places, maybe we could actually accomplish some things around here.
