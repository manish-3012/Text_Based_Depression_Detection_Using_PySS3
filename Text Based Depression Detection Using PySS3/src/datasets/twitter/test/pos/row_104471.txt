So yeah I just found out my crush is gay... Hello good people of reddit, I just wanted to vent a bit. So I am a guy and have a crush on this girl who is in my class. Lately we got friendly with each other cus we both like anime. So we were talking about secuality and she told me she is gay. Well now I'm sad. Did this happen to anyone else?
