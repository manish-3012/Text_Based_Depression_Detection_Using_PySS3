Stop lying to people about how beautiful they are "Oh you're not ugly! You're beautiful!"  
"You're not ugly, society is."  
"You look amazing!"

Stop lying to yourself, if you think an ugly ass person is ugly, fucking call them ugly, no reason to lie about it to cheer them up, that's some pussy shit right there.
