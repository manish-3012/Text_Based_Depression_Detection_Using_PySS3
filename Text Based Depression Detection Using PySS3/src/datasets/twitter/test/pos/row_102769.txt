Stop watching porn guys. I can't believe how normalized watching porn is in our society. It's proven to have bad effects on your mental health, and heightens social anxiety. And then you guys complain about not having girlfriends, and then stay home all day beating your meat to girls because that's the only sexual gratification you'll ever get in your life. Give it up.
