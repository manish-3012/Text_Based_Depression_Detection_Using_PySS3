Diary: November 2nd, 2020 Today is November 2nd, 2020. This year has been a living hell. Today is the day before the world will turn upside down, and potentially change history. Tomorrow, it won't matter which side will win; both will outcomes will result in the loosing party protesting to recount the votes. Today's the last day of sanity. Good luck to all.
