I want to know if a girl likes me. Hey guys, I'm currently friends with a girl that I've known for about a year, and I've liked her for some time now. I'm going to dump a lot of information here, so I'd really appreciate it if you took the time to read through it and give me advice.

* I told her that I liked her last year, and she told me that she didn't want to date anyone due to the loads of schoolwork our school imposes on us.
* Heard from one of her close friends that she talks about me a lot.
* During interactions, we've accidentally touched each other in spots that would be classified as inappropriate, but she seemed fine with it. I was mortified at first because I'm usually pretty shy and reserved with physical contact, but she either didn't notice or pretended to not notice. 
* I think she likes to talk to me--she frequently initiates conversation and keeps it going for a long time when we're in the same room. During our free block, she often asks me to keep her company and hang out with her. She's usually loquacious with everyone, though. I tried to apply the "dilated eye" trick on her because she makes eye contact with me a lot, but it's kinda difficult to tell. 
* People have commented on how close in proximity we are when we're together. When we're walking, our arms frequently brush each other and she often hangs on to my backpack. I've seen her hold other friends' backpacks, but not as often as she does to mine. 
* We usually sit next to each other, but when she wants to show me something on her computer, I go over to her. Sometimes, she initiates physical contact and rubs/puts her hand on my shoulder, punches my chest, or playfully hits my arm. She jokingly tells me that she hits me because she enjoys causing me pain. I try to reciprocate by doing similar things (save the chest punches) such as leaning on her shoulder, tousling her hair, and punching her arm lightly, and she seems fine with it. However, she doesn't reciprocate as much when I reciprocate. Sometimes I try not to do anything, and she engages in the same playful physical contact without pause. A few days ago, while she was talking to me, I gently stepped on her foot. We have this thing where she would step on my foot, after which I would step on her foot resting on my foot, and she would step on my foot, which would be above her foot, which would be above mine. I tried that a couple of times, but she didn't respond and kept staring at me and talking. 
* We sometimes wrestle/play fight each other after teasing each other. I'm quicker verbally, so I usually end up getting the last word in, and she jumps at me. 
* She laughs at a lot of things I say, even though they're sarcastic asides or bad jokes, and she frequently gets really hyper around me.
* She told me that even if she liked someone, she wouldn't tell him. I don't think that's very good for my prospects with her. 

I'm sure she likes me as a friend. Do you guys think it goes further than that?
