Competitive meme making For these examples I will be using Player A and Player B as the competitors

There would be sets of 7 and whichever person wins the most games will win the set.

All the posts would be uploaded to the memes subreddit and however many votes they get would equate to their point total for that game

Game 1:
Player A
- 204 points

Player B
- 1,135 points 

Game 1 is won by Player B

So on and so forth


A team game would be very similar. The amount of how many player are on a team (TBD) will add the three amount of votes together and that would be their score for that game

Any other ideas or suggestions would be cool to hear. Let me know if you would compete in competitive meme making
