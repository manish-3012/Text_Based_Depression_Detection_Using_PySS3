My dad is mad at me for reading the wrong thing. My parents have always had a policy that they encourage reading, as long as itâ€™s not inappropriate for my age. A couple of weeks ago, I began reading some online fan fiction for some Star Wars characters that I like and when compared to what Iâ€™d been doing before then, I stepped up massively in the amount that I have been reading daily. It went from like 15 minutes to 4 hours per day. Now, my dad is pressuring me to read â€˜a real bookâ€™ because apparently it would be better for me to spend 15 minutes a day reading something offline than 4 hours a day reading something online. His issue seems to be that Iâ€™m spending too much time reading on my phone and should be reading something physical but he is a total hypocrite. He constantly reads books and comics on his phone but apparently I shouldnâ€™t. I am sorry for the totally unimportant rant but itâ€™s midnight and Iâ€™m mad
