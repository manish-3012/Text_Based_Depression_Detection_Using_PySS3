Seriously I think one of the most Boston sentences ever uttered, is " Park your car at harvard yard." Just because every time I hear it I hear my friend Maddox when he is slightly intoxicated In full bostonian. brogue, Something he only really . When alcohol is involved. Complaining that we hadn't found any edelweiss yet because we had gone looking for it that morning on the hike. Which turned more into a minor mountaineering expedition.

It was fun but we got a little bit to drunk And fell asleep on the mountain when we came to it was dark and thankfully it was summer so it wasn't horrifically cold and we brought A-tent with us so we just camped there till morning.

It was fun but I still find it funny that every time I think of that sentence or Maddox speaking with a Boston accent, Which is his natural speaking pattern when not consciously modified I'm reminded of a mountain side in Germany and the search an elusive plant edelweiss
