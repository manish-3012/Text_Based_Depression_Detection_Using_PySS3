I really cannot comprehend this In my country there will be a plebiscite to see if a new constitution is accepted or not. But the thing I don't understand is the people themselves, if you vote no, you are a fascist and if you vote I approve, you are a communist. Why? I don't understand and the memes that come out of this; those who vote rejection they call those who approve "apruebonados" (like approve stupids). And I have to say that this not only happens in this situation, but in all politics. I also do not understand the young people (13-17 years old) who join this at that early age to the world of politics, ok it's good that you like them but don't treat it so seriously, you can't even vote yet.

Sorry if I misspelled something.
