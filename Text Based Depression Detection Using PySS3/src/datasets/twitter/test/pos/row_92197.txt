Am I the only one that really loves to go to the orthodontist? Holy cow it's so relaxing lol it feels like a spa. The chair is even more comfortable than my bed and the lamp they have above you is so comforting. It gives off the slightest amount of warmth and it makes me feel like a lizard under a heat lamp XD. Plus it's kinda sexy ngl. Something about the gloves and laying down and having someone inside your mouth. My orthodontist is kinda hot too lol. does anyone else love going there or is it just me.
