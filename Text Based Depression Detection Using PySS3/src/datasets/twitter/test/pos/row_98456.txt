I hate masks!!! Okay so not to be a Karen or anything, but right now I'm really hating to have to wear a mask. I've been having an issue where parts of my chest are inflammed and it hurts so much to breathe and I'm constantly short of breath and often need to just stop for a bit to catch my breath. I'm already struggling to breathe, and a mask makes it so much harder for me. I am being treated for it but it's taking a really long time.

I still wear it, obviously for my own and others safety, but damn am I struggling. Anyways. Thanks for reading my stupid rant
