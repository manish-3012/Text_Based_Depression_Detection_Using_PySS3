dude my wisdom teeth r coming in it hurts sooooo fucking much, like, bruhhhh. its only the bottom 2 rn but holy shit when they hurt its almost unbearable. i can barely eat, and it hurts sm sometimes i cant even smoke. im alr starting a tolerance break so when i get them out i dont wanna smoke as bad but like still god fucking damn it hurts, and imma have to deal with this for like another month or so prolly.
