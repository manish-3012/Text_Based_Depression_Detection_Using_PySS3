You know whatâ€™s really annoying? PE homework. I mean like come on I already have 5 other classes to do I donâ€™t need to research my sleep habits or learn about the history of frisbee golf. Itâ€™s just so fucking stupid that they give us actual stuff to research and grade us on how well we do it. Yeah yeah I know itâ€™s school thatâ€™s what theyâ€™re supposed to do but come on. I already have to deal with a total creep of a PE teacher I donâ€™t want this to be worse.
