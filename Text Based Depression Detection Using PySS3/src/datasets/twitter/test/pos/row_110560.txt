Here is a rant to my dad Today and yesterday you really fucking annoyed me. So basically my dad isn't happy about my grades, but as of right now, I'm having the best grades I've had in my entire life. My science is 82, math is 84, my health is 100, my religion is 97, my social is 84 and la is 72. Now I'm tryna work on La, but this guy wants aLl nInTeYs. And im fucking trying. All he ever says is "do better" when he sets stupid high standards for me. He doesn't know that I always ask questions, or that i always email my teachers, or get my work in on time, or wake up early in the morning to work on school shit, or set up student connects (its basically a 1 on 1 w/ your teacher and they help you w/ shit). All he knows is that my grades arent all 90s. He also keeps comparing me to my brother, whos doing better in school than I am. He said "cant you see he's doing better than you" or something like that, which fucking pissed me off.  Don't get me wrong I love my brother but I dont care he's has better grades than me. im trying my fucking best every day. he also says that im too playful. dont get me wrong i fucking loooooove video games (especially gtao), but i still get my school work fucking done. finally, he says he wants me to be an engineer, which im just not gonna do. he always wnted me to do that, but i made my own decision to make music. i havent told him yet. he prolly wont support it but idc ill do it anyways. i do eventually wanna go mainstream (its the main plan) but obv ill start small. if u wanna link to my songs ill send the link. but yeah thats my rant. its pretty long so thanks 4 reading
