A girl who is not related to me just told me "I love you" for the first time in my life I'm on mobile so sorry for formatting.
A year ago a new girl came into our class. We were in 9th grade so we had to make a performance at the end of the year, "the last bell" or smth like that. We decided to dance waltz, she and I got paired together. We both enjoyed our conversation, bonded, and soon I developed a crush on her. I wanted to ask her, if she would like to date me, but then the lockdown happened. Halfway through the lockdown (it has ended in my country) I decided, that I can't wait any longer and instead of asking her in person I messaged her. She said yes and that she was afraid that this moment would never come. We spend a lot more time together now that we're in school and today as we went home she told me "I love you", I'am very very happy.
