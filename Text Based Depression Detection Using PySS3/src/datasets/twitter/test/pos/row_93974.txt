Iâ€™m starting to feel like video games arenâ€™t worth it. Imean Iâ€™m bot a noob and I have pretty good video game skills, but whatâ€™s the point of playing games if youâ€™re losing so many times, or your friends just get better than you, **even though** youâ€™ve played **way** longer than them. Like I play for eight hours just grinding on some game (currently splatoon 2 rn) then some person comes up and BAM just smooshes you down like a bug like it was nothing. Itâ€™s like all this effort for playing hours and hours is not worth it, but the thing is it happens again and again and again AND AGAIN! So whatâ€™s the point? Iâ€™m starting to just give up. Iâ€™ve been playing games ever since I was like 5 or something (donâ€™t exactly remember) and Iâ€™m starting to think that video games arenâ€™t really worth it to play anymore. And at some point I get ridiculously angry and just start crying like a baby and rage when this happens sometimes, itâ€™s fucking ridiculous.
