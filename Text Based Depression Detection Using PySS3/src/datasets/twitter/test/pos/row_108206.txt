Friend calling me gay So one of my best friends (we will call her daisy because thatâ€™s her name) has found out that I want to start cosplaying (I donâ€™t know why she is so bothered by it because itâ€™s what I want To do and it doesnâ€™t effect her) and because of that she is now calling me gay and pan sexual which I am not Iâ€™m straight and a she/her Iâ€™m pretty basic she says that itâ€™s also because I game and watch anime but why does that make me gay we usually joke about it to each other (our humour is pretty dark) but now I feel like she actually means it she made a tiktok about it and said that Iâ€™m in denial which Iâ€™m not I know what I am so I commented Iâ€™m not gay Iâ€™m straight so then she started a whole comment thread about it I just feel really sad about it and didnâ€™t know where else to vent so there you go
