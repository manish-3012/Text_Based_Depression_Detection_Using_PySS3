Story I wrote. Please read. Tell me what you think of it. This is my second time ever writing. I legitimately know nothing of how to write. I'm just testing to see if I could one day have what it takes. Though I'm young and still have loads to learn before I could ever write a good story. If I cant be great I dont see a point. Fuck mediocrity. This story is about a grandfather telling stories about his life to his grandson. The grandfather had a tough life growing up. The only reason the stories sound like fantasy is because his version of reality was distorted by drugs. - I would reveal this fact near the end of the book. This part below is about the grandfather coming off a big high. Taking another hit. And then getting arrested by the police. This is his version of that story. Hes telling it to his grandson.

--So there I was. At the base of a mountain. It was quite a surprise to know that i was just all the way at the top. Looking down on everything. The houses. Trees. Everything looked so much smaller. I felt a lot bigger in a way. A lot smaller in others. Anyways, that doesnt matter. I was at the bottom, and I had to pass through this valley to get to where i was going. The only problem is that id heard of this valley before. It was supposedly filled with all kinds of horrible creatures. All kinds of things hidden in the cracks of the unknown. Dusk was in a few hours so I thought I might as well make a little headway. I decided to start walking. 100 feet in.. 200.. Then a mile. I came across a stream. I could hear the water falling onto itself. Swishing past the rocks. In fact now that I think about it I could hear many things. The cries of the crickets. The trees makings sounds out of the wind. The birds. Cawing in the distance. I could feel the wind. Feel the grass beneath my bent knee. I opened my canteen and dunked it into the river. Refilling it for later. God only knew how long it would be until I found water again. I took a sip and walked on. As the hours passed i started to feel a little fuzzy. Weird. It felt like something was watching me. But not in a scary way. Not like it was preying apon me. In a way like how a kid would look at a toy. Like I was some sort of entertainment. Like I was amusing. This feeling just seemed to be growing more and more until i can feel it peeling at the back of my neck. Soaking out of my pores. Something was.. off. Something was.. wrong. I walked on. Then I slowly started to hear a faint hum. It was nice. Soothing. Like a perfect melody. I started stepping to the beat. It kept growing louder and louder.. until it was all that I could hear. Then suddenly.. Silence. The melody was gone. Every other sound was gone. I heard nothing. A being appeared in front of me. It was.. purple. That's the only word I would use to describe it. Not necessarily because it looked like it was purple. But because I could feel that it was purple. I seemed to be experiencing some sort of synesthesia. The very essence of it's being felt purple. Then.. this creature took a step toward me. RED. RED. RED. Frightened, I took a step back. I ran. This creature leaped at me. Grabbed me. Its arms started growing. Twisting around me. Encapsulating me. I blacked out. As I awoke all I could see was white. I didnt feel weight. I was.. weightless. Though I could feel pressure all around my skin. Like the air was hugging me just a bit too tightly. I decided to walk around a bit. No matter which direction I went I seemed to always end up back in the same spot. I was... trapped. 
I became anxious. To the point of suffocation. Paranoid. Or was it something else that was suffocating me? I found myself clawing at my airway. Trying to break free. Fighting to survive...
