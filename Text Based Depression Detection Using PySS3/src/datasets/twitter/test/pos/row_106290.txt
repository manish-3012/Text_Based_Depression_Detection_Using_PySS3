why does my heart do a lilâ€™ leap when i hear the name of any of my crushes. it doesnâ€™t help that they all have really common names. kinda rant/hor-knee post, but nothing too sexual. holy shit why do i have so many male crushes, and theyâ€™re all straight skinny musicians from the uk and iâ€™m just a small bisexual american dude. and yeah this is england and wales weâ€™re talking about so the names over there donâ€™t get any more common. or maybe i need to get outside more.

anyways NAMES, that was the whole point of the post. does anyone else get really hor-knee or flustered when you hear or read the name of one of your crushes. doesnâ€™t help that most of their names are super common, as in youâ€™ll see it in a math question type common. itâ€™s becoming a problem, i canâ€™t even focus when i hear or see their name. flows off the tongue so nicely, plus the person iâ€™ve seen and the persona of them i made up in my own head connected to that common name. could spend hours thinking about them.

anyways iâ€™m gonna listen to their horniest songs to cope. horny rant over, iâ€™ll take myself to r/hornyjail .
