Social life in the pandemic Just wanted to know if Iâ€™m the only one here trying to deal with that issue. So basically pre-pandemic when there was normal school (not online) I used to go out basically every friday and weekends with my friends for a drink or to a party. Besides that, I hit the gym a few times a week with my mates so we were in touch all the time. However, now I go out extremely rarely and my social life kind of disappeared because of covid, closed bars, hotels, clubs etc.

So my question is, am I alone in this boat or are you guys going out a lot less than you used to before covid was a thing?
