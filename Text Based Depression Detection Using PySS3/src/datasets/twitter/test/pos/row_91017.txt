When your friends have to make jokes every damn time you mention this one girl She's in marching band and also a clarinetist and a year ahead of me (I'm freshman) and I've mentioned her a few times about band and she's actually a nice person but my god every time I mention her my friends all make jokes about it. So yeah that happens.
