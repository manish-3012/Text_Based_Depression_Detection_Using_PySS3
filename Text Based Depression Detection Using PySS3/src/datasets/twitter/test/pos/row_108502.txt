My dog might die and I just don't know how to deal with it Title pretty much says it all.
I got him for my 13th birthday after begging my parents for a dog for years (I'm 17) and he's the love of my life.

In the last week he's been feeling really unwell so we took him to the vet and they found a bunch of masses in his chest area. The doctor said the need to run more tests to confirm it but if it's the type of cancer he thinks it is then he has only 3 months to live and not even that because the recommendation with this type of cancer is to just put the dog out of its misery.

I just don't know what to do and how to continue my life without him
