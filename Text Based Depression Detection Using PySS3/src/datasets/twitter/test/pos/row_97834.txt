I cant get any close freinds This will be deleted in about 20 minutes, but I just want to get this off my chest 

I'm freinds with about half the people in my year group (not a brag), but I have no best freinds or anything. I've managed to keep freinds for long periods of time, but anyone I've got in a close relationship to has left. One freind who I had around my house about twice a week moved house to out of my town, as soon as I was getting into a secure freind group, I moved to a sub-section of my school where I couldn't see them during break or lunch, and could only have a slight chance of seeing them at the end of school. 

I think I just dont know how to get closer to someone. It's pretty much in my muscle memory to just sit back in group conversations and laugh at other people's jokes. This means I never have a presence in a group, and I'll just be pretty much ignored.

 I almost never have one to one conversations, or say anything when in a group because it just seems too daunting to me. What if I ruin the mood, or go too far with a joke? What if they say something offensive or ask me a question I'm not comfortable answering? 

I have tried to just naturally let a closer bond form, but like I said- I've had relationships for several years, where we are just acquaintances at best. I dont want to force a bond though, as I dont want to become an outcast because every freind has just been creeped out by me harassing them. 

Thanks for reading all of this, and sorry if it was messy or anything- I practically poured my heart out in all it's mutilated parts.
