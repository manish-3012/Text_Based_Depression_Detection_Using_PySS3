i'm afraid to ever actually get into a relationship tbh i mean, i doubt i could actually sustain one if i do manage to get one lol

i'm awkward and uninteresting, and i have trouble holding basic conversations

i'm not exactly a 'romantic' person either, so i just can't imagine myself actually managing to form a relationship with someone that stays together for longer than a month lol

i guess there isn't much point in fussing about it, i just wanted to get those thoughts out of my head lol
