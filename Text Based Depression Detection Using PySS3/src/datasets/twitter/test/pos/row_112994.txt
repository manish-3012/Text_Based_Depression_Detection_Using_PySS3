This may be a problem So i saw this post today, about someone with a dog that is in need of surgery. However, the title said it already was undergoing surgery. Why would they then need money for it? And why aren't they explaining anything? 

So i checked the other posts, 2 of which were about the same thing, different titles which weren't descriptive at all. Both were removed.

I looked a little further and saw a post about needing to gather money quickly. 

I dont want to jump to conclusions, but 2 posts for donations that have been removed and a need for money, added up by the fact that there is no info about the dog or its disease do make me suspicious.

My incredible apologies if this is just a coincidence. I will not include this persons name because I am absolutely not sure of this, they could just really be in need of help. But remember that you need to be careful around people that need money. I'll let you all decide for yourself to donate to this person.

Stay safe
