One of my friends is in the hospital right now and Idk what to do or say She is paralyzed from the waist down and idk. they say sheâ€™s probably not gonna be able to walk for like idk a year. 
I feel so sad even tho we werenâ€™t really close and sometimes she was kinda toxic for me but I still feel this way it sucks and I wanna cry but I canâ€™t because I feel so empty 

So ye
