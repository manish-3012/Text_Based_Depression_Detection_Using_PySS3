Am I a good person for constantly sacrificing myself in Battle Royale games so my squadmates can live? Yesterday I was playing Warzone, when one of my squadmates died.  
 
I ran over to the buy station, bought him back and I led them into the final circle, only to get shot and killed by a camping cunt.  
  
But while he was distracted with me, my squadmates whom I bought back managed to escape.  
So am I a good person?
