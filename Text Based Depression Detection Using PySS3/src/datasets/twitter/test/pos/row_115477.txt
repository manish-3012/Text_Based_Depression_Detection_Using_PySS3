I came out to my mom's coworkers and she thinks I owe her an apology- Help! Hi! This is my first post on r/teenangers. I'm 16! (Male)  
So, I came out bisexual to my mom and then 5 months later came out to one of her coworkers-  
She told me that her work was her only save haven and I shouldn't have done that and she feels like I owe her an apology and I don't know if I should say sorry or not..  


HELP!!?
