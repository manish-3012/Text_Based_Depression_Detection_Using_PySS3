Some random girl just called my natural hair beautiful and it reassured me after the antagonizing of some racists at school :,) I just switched from online school to public this Tuesday. None of my approximately three friends are in any of my classes, except for P.E.

All we ever really do in there is walk/run around the volleyball net, but today our coaches took out some basketballs, volleyballs, and hula hoops for a free day.

Generally, my friends and I walk around the perimeter of the gym and talk when we have free days, but this time the two in this class with me were just talking to one another, so I was just kind of leaching along awkwardly. They obviously didn't want me there, they kind of just swooped out of the way when I can closer. I didn't want to instert myself and seem annoying so I just mindlessly circled around the gym.

I wore my natural hair out today, contrary to what I normally do, which is install some braids or shove it under a headscarf.

"What's on your head?" Some girl got my attention when she "asked" me that, because it wasn't even a question, she was making fun of my coily hair.

I have thick 4C hair, and it seems like anywhere I go I can't escape the discrimination. Even in my own home, from my own mother (who uses perms).

"Do you even brush that?"

"It looks like a dirty sponge. Just like your skin, maybe if you bathed you wouldn't be so dark."

Just her and her little circle antoagozing me. I decided to go over to a space of the volleyball net, far enough away to not bother anyone, but close enough to the game some girls were playing so that I did not seem so lost and look like an easy target.

Then some girl coming out of the bathroom stopped for a second, saw my hair, and gasped. I thought she would have a snarky comment, until- 

"Oh my god, your hair's so beautiful!"

I don't know why, but that just touched my heart. I'll be wearing my hair down tomorrow.
