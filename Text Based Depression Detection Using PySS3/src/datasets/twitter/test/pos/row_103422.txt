I talked with a girl who isnâ€™t my classmate.           The last time I talked to a girl who wasnâ€™t my classmate before this was like 8 months ago. Today my friend added this girl he met on Minecraft to the homie discord chat, she saw our faces on a call where we were discussing homework and said I looked cute. I felt like a million bucks because the only thing girls say to me is shut up. 

           A few hours ago her and I played bedwars but joined my friends server a few minutes later. If you have ever used discord you know that if there is more than 5 people in a call it becomes impossible to hear anything, well my friends were mean to her making a lot of gender jokes and then she left. 

             My friends are calling me a simp and a little bitch but I really just need someone cool and chill to talk to. I asked her if she wanted to play something tomorrow and she said she really wanted to. I apologized on behalf of my friends and she said it was fine. Anyway in case she has Reddit, this is Carver.
