How has it gotten this bad? How have I messed up my relationship with everyone who has ever cared about me. 2 years ago I had so many friends, and good ones. But here I am, almost 14 and no friends, the thing I hate is, I have enough stuff about me that impress people and then they really get to know me, and I'm an asshole, I know this, but I can't figure out exactly what it is. This became really apparent to me when my gf said something bad happened and for 2 days she didn't text me (everything ended up fine and it wasn't my fault) and I realized I've fucked up the relationship I've had with everyone, romantic or not
