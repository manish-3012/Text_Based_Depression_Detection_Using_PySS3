Girls are better to have as best friends While nothing beats hanging out with â€œthe boisâ€
Sleepovers where you are the only guy at are so much fun. Chilling watching movies and series while eating food on a couch with three girl-friends is something great. 

I used to have twice as many female friends as male friends until I moved school so those kind of experiences are less common. 

In primary school I hung out with the â€œpopular girlsâ€ because they were just the most interesting people to talk to. I recently went to Charlotte NC USA and went to a high school for a week and all of the friends I made were girls. 

I will never give up being the gay/bi BFF of the girl group, it is the best position to be in. I get to chill with EVERYONE.
