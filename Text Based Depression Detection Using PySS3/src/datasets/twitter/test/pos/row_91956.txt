Lmao I donâ€™t care about anything kinda weird tho Idk my grandma died and I didnâ€™t cry. I didnâ€™t feel anything really when I was with my parents I had to forced myself to cry. Itâ€™s weird I havenâ€™t really been happy either for a while. And Iâ€™ve just stopped caring about everything. Lmao guess Iâ€™m just teenager though. If you want to talk Iâ€™ll try to respond but no promises
