clothing preferences so iâ€™m a 17year old boy and iâ€™m recently getting into wearing like pink shoes and black nail polish. havenâ€™t tried them out in an outfit yet however my parents and siblings are like donâ€™t do it because iâ€™ll get hassled for it. other friends of mine are all for it because itâ€™s something new that could actually be something iâ€™m comfortable with. the only catch is that my family are not the most keen on it (oversized tees and hoodies, black nail polish, pink shoes). i have a pair of pink shoes arriving tomorrow (if any of you hypebeasts know what these are, the dunk high x ambush pink) and i wanna wear them as their my size but my family are practically against it because they feel that people will take the mickey and hassle me so thatâ€™s that really. how do i talk to them about it in a sense of me wanting to try something new without causing an argument with them?
