I think theres a ghost in my apt. You probably read the title, I think that there is a ghost in my apt, so a little bit of background I live in an apartment that is very small, so I notice things that change immediately, I notice that the towels are not where they were, I hear noise from the roof, and possibly the freakiest thing that happened, my stove went on, it was late at night, I was scrolling through reddit, and then the stove, just, randomly went on, I quickly turned it off and went straight to bed, I didn't sleep much that night, so, yes I think theres a (probably lesbian) ghost in my apartment.
