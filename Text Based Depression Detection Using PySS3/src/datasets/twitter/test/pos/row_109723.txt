Me ranting about my parents Before I go into this bullshit, keep in mind I have had straight As for as long as I can remember, and participate in many school activities (Freshman).

Rules:
1. No devices on the Weekdays. No consoles, no laptops, and no phone minus basic communication.

2. 9:00 bedtime on weekdays, 12:00 on weekends.

3. No food or drinks anywhere besides the kitchen.

Plus, they always make me feel like shit by talking to be passive aggressive and condescending, sometimes I can go from a very good day to ruins with one interaction from them.

Plus, the majority of the time, my little siblings get all the attention, leaving me with table scraps

Sorry about the rant, I just had to get it out of my system.
