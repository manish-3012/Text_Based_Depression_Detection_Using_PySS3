Need some words of encouragement Back on the 9th i got my self a old pontiac from 1967 to restore, today i got it in our enclosed garage to start work and my dad keeps bad mouthing it on how its a  *rust bucket* *you will never get this pile of shit on the road just give up on it* and *its worth more in scrap*,  i know he cant scrap the car himself since its registered in my name and reguarding the rust it did sit 6 years outside so some patch welding is needed,it runs and drives and all that, i know i can do it, just he barrades me every time he sees me working on it, its discouraged me and i need some positively, and if you want i can link some pics of it
