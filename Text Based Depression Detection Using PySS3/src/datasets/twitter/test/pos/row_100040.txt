Totally a normal text about Online School. (You don't wanna read this, I have warned you and if you got a stroke and died then it's your own fault). Welcome to the random text about online school that I have no reason to do this or a reason to not.

Anyway for the stuff I wanted to describe : Online School.

Online school is an alternative for the offline school called Seven Crappy Hours Of Our Life.

Its basically something you wanted to uninstall, it sacrifice your internet for nothing but some words that you can't remember (For dummies), lucky people (Smart Lads) would probably remember them.

The difference between these schools are one,
Ordinary school are not online and its basically real life and of course its offline, the fact that you are also lazy to go to the offline school or joining the online classroom are the similarities between these things, known as laziness.

Online school have one weakness, known as distraction.

Look a giraffe! You liked giraffe more than school right? or maybe some games? Yeaa Games!!

Well lot of things can distract you and the most thing you should fear is your habbit of laughing at nothing or having some funny flashbacks.

It will make you look like an idiot in the other people eyes, trust me.

And I bet you want to escape this online school...
Its almost impossible for people who have their parents informed about this and kept telling them to join the online class.

So if you want to escape society, be a caveman and beat a bear.
