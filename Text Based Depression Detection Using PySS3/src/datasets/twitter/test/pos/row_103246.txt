Ever like someone so much it hurts Like you just look at them for a second and your all veins explode like a firework and your heart clenches up and for barely a moment you picture holding them, and every cell in your body is filled to the brim with disappointment when you realize she'll never take you seriously? And you raise an eyebrow at her, pretending to be cool, and barely a wave from her hip literally fulfills every fantasy tenfold, because it was real?

Because I sure as hell don't.....
