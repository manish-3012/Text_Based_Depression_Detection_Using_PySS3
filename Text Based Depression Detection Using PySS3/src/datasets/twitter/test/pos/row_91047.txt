Guess the song Iâ€™m currently listening to by its lyrics â€œI stay up all night with you
You don't have to lie, you can tell the truth
I would rather die than be without you
I would rather die than be without you
I stay up all night with you
You don't have to lie, you can tell the truth
I would rather die than be without you
I would rather die than be without you
I can't get you off my mind
I still think about it all the time
You know I hate to see you cry
And I don't want to be alive
I don't wanna see you all alone
No one's gonna miss me when I'm gone
I don't wanna see you all alone
No one's gonna miss me when I'm gone
When I'm gone, all alone
All alone, when I'm gone
I stay up all night with you
You don't have to lie, you can tell the truth
I would rather die than be without you
I would rather die than be without you
I stay up all night with you
You don't have to lie, you can tell the truth
I would rather die than be without you
I would rather die than be without you (without you)â€ slow paste songs are always the best to cry too
