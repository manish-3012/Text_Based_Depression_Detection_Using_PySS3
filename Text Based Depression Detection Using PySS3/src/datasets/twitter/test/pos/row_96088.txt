Gave my sister a knife I bought a new knife and it ended up being way better than I thought. I had an old one of the same brand but a little smaller and the spring was a little worn down but not enough to be dangerous. 

Well I gave that old one to my sister who is 15. She's never had a knife before and I'm just hoping I didn't make a mistake.
