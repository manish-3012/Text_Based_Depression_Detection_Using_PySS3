My dog just passed. He was my best friend. I always had trouble making friends at school, but I knew when I came home he would be there for me. He didnâ€™t judge, didnâ€™t care what I looked like, he gave me unconditional love. Iâ€™m so happy about the time we spent together, but I donâ€™t know how to carry on without him.
