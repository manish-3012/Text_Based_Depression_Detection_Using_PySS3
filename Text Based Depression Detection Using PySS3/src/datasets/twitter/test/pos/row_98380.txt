Anyone else actually suffering from depression and anxeity but fam thinks it's normal Like they do love me and care for me but they don't understand man

They don't understand that it's hard for me to get out of bed,keep proper hygiene
Concentrate on studying
Do any physical work

And then they say, everyone goes through it,you just need to put in more effort


Fuck life man,I hate it here
