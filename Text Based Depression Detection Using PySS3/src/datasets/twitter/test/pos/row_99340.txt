My dad and I were having a conversation and somehow it got to comedy and I said that I kinda liked dark/offensive humour He asked me to tell him a joke so I asked â€œhow offensive do you want it?â€ And he said â€œI donâ€™t careâ€ so I just told him the joke that got me into that stuff. â€œWhat do you call an Asian Jew? A rice crispy!â€ He got really mad at me. He started telling me that I can never joke about that stuff and itâ€™s extremely insensitive. I told him it was going to be offensive. He still wanted to hear it and then he proceeded to get angry. He also always wonders why I donâ€™t show him too much of my interests and donâ€™t talk about my life.
