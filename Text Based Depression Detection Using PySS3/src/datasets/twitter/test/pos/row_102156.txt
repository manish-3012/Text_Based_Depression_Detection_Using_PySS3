I crashed my new scooter on my 2nd day.. Iâ€™ve been thinking about it all day. How can I relieve the stress? So I tried to go into a road, and whilst I was looking at the road to check that I can swing into it and thereâ€™s no cars, I noticed that I was soon about to drive out of the way. I quickly steered the wheel and I fucking fell, since the ground had stones over it, what made my scooter slide.. how can I try to tell myself something to not think about it.. I told my mom that Iâ€™ll pay for everything myself, but that doesnâ€™t make me less stressed. What can I do? Has this happened to you?
