Someone, anyone, read my thoughts. Why can't I fix everything for everyone I care about. My dad blows everything off and I upsets people I love and I hate it and my grandparents act like politics is everything and define my mom for her political views. My mom doesn't sleep well and I can't help her and I hate it. My grandma is forced into a gener role and treated like something that just exists and not a person. My dad dates women and then breaks up with them when he is bored, which I hate it's not right. I also can't fucking sleep and sorry for the poor grammer. I need friends im lonely.
