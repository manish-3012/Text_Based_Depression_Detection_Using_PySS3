I dont feel like I am enough I feel like I am ugly, uninteresting, and just not enough, I don't feel like I am enough for my gf, my friends, or anyone else, I am ugly, I can't exercise, so I am kinda fat, I feel like my gf might cheat on me for a hot guy with a 6 pack, and I can't do anything about it, my mom doesn't let me go outside to at least walk, and I can't go to a gym, my memory is terrible, I am ugly and worthless, I am not enough.
