Chipotle sucks ass Itâ€™s not as good anymore. Thatâ€™s it. Everything tastes the same, the chicken is tough and tasteless, the steak is chewy, the carnitas are only good on quesadillas, but the barbacoa is pretty good tho. The guacamole and chips are the only things that kept up their taste throughout the years
