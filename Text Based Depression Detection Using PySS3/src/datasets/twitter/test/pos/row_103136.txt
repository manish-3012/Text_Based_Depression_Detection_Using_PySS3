AHHH IM SO EMBARRASSED so we had to write this paragraph thing and if you didnâ€™t turn it in by the end of class then your lunch period would be taken away. I didnâ€™t want that so I rushed it and didnâ€™t put in any effort. Today people are reviewing our paragraphs and uh.. itâ€™s really embarrassing. Writing is one of my strong suits so Iâ€™m sure if I put in effort I couldâ€™ve made it a lot better then it actually is... Iâ€™m so embarrassed
