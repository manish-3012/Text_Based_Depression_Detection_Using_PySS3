Do people even care anymore? Does anyone care about me tbh idk anymore. And I donâ€™t like to think this way but sometimes itâ€™s just ugh. Sometimes I think maybe no one does and thatâ€™s when I spiral and I hate that. Especially since I canâ€™t see my therapist for the time being and feel like I donâ€™t deserve to start taking antidepressants
