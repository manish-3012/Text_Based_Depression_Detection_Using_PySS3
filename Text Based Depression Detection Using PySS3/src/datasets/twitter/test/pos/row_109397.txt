Just remembered I used a fake code blue alarm to get away from singing with my dad So my family was in the kitchen and we were all eating grilled cheese, and then my dad started playing this obscure old song that low key sounded bad.

He was like â€œcome on everyone, song alongâ€ and we said we donâ€™t know the lyrics so he was like letâ€™s learn them

my mom left the kitchen and my siblings looked at each other like *scatter*

So I played the code blue alarm on my phone and said â€œIâ€™m being paged, I gotta goâ€ and went to my room, followed by my sister going â€œI have a business callâ€, and my brother picking up his grilled cheese and going to the basement without a word

Fun times
