Iâ€™ve recently have been struggling to contrast dreams and reality Some times after I wake up, even after I come to my senses I still thing from a dream is real. Itâ€™s mainly something little. The first time Iâ€™ve had it was when I was in kindergarten. But I was def and idiot back then. But recently Iâ€™ve been thinking about some old friend I had but halfway through the morning after Iâ€™ve done my whole morning routine I realize that this person does not exist. Recently I thought of a piece of Fiction most likely of an scp article about some weird temple but only soon way soon after that it was fake. I know that a lot of these dreams are based off of past memories and some of my own struggles. The temple one was based off of probably other scps combined while the old friend hinted to some kid I saw on the board walk near a beach that I did a little activity with. Has anyone else struggled to process what is from a dream and what is from reality?
