Update on my old friend that I don't like anymore So I had this friend, me and him were best friends at one point. He kept convincing me to break things and I now realized the reality of what he's doing. I had enough of his shit a few days ago. My mom's friend was coming over Saturday and we had to clean up everything. My friend took his mess (it was snap circuits if you even know what they are) and just threw everything in the closet. I was tired of him so me and his "best friend" went to his house and he slammed the door on us when we wanted to talk to his mom. He slammed the door and I yelled through the door "I have your mom's number" he came outside and said "JuSt LoSe It MaN" and I said no. We got his mom and me and my little brother and his best friend told his mom about everything he's done to us. He broke so many of my things and hasn't replaced anything, including a flare gun from 1945 that we can't fix. He also broke my dad's BB gun from over 30 years ago. His mom is gonna replace the gun. I am not gonna talk to him anymore. I don't want a repeat of everything that happened to happen.
