I know the n- word is bad, but... Look I am not white or black or even American, so this topic is not really of big issue for me but look by watching so much of American Entertainment content the swear words just kinda feel right, and for some reason the N-word doesn't seem like a bad thing... Maybe it's just cause of seeing the black dudes say it to their homies but Idk, the word does not exactly sounds bad when talking among friends.
