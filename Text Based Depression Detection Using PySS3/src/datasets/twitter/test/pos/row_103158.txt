Rant About Everything That Has Gone Wrong in My Life Lmao \[This is gonna be me ranting so it's gonna be long\]I am at the point where all I want is to be happy and my parents do whatever they can to stop me from achieving that. I have ADHD but it's not super severe (The Attention Deficit part) I am medicated and it helps a lot. the only thing the meds don't help with is the inconsistent amount of dopamine my brain will produce sometimes. This really means that I will pretty much just get depression and anxiety for about 3-5 days at a time. It sucks, and I don't want to tell my parents because I don't want them to see me as being weak or babying me because of it. I tend to use the phrase "I'm just not feeling it today" when my parents ask me about it. The anxiety causes me to have a paranoid spiral where I'm completely convinced that all of my friends and mentors hate me. This of course isn't true but they are like intrusive thoughts x10. Luckily that has only happened to me a hand full of times. My mother hasn't been a very good mother, to say the least (My Dad and Mom haven't been together since I was like 5 and I live with my Dad and stepmom) and my stepmother is in no way a good maternal figure in my life because all she does is yell, scream, hit and demean me in any way possible. The lack of a mother figure in my life gave me what most call "Mommy Issues" People show me basic kindness and I instantly get attached to them, which makes it hard to know when girls are actually into me. But recently I was talking to this girl and we had a ton in common (The way we grew up, parental situation, our energies in general) and she was just a super caring person in general. I was gonna jump WAY out of my comfort zone and actually tell her I was into her (I have a major fear of rejection so I don't ask girls out) but she "Got grounded" and hasn't texted me in over a week. she was the only person I felt comfortable talking to about my problems (Was raised in an abusive household where I was never able to cry, let my feelings out, or tell people how I felt and to be masculine, some would call it toxic masculinity but IDK) and now she is "Grounded" (I keep saying "Grounded" in quotation marks because I have no clue if she just needed an excuse to ghost me or if she actually got grounded. she did talk about her parent doing that in the past but I had toxic friends who convinced me that if any girl showed interest in me they were fucking with me) and I feel like I can't talk to anyone. This girl would help me through issues and would give me positive affirmations whenever I would be feeling like I'm trash. Now I just feel kinda lost without her. we talked for hours every day and now all I do during the time is work out to try and forget the pain and lay in my bed. I would be going to the gym but my parents decide that I'm only allowed to leave the house when it's something they want to do or for school. I know people have it a lot harder than I do but to the people who don't have toxic parents or friends... you are lucky, you get to skip over the mental strain they put on you. convincing you that you mean nothing, that nobody could ever like you/love you/ be your friend other than them, it's all just shitty. I cut off my toxic friends and haven't talked to them in almost a year. I'm usually a very upbeat person but I just needed to get all of this garbage and bullshit out of my head. If you read this entire thing then holy shit thanks.
