I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m in love So some background info. My cousin lives several states away from mine and we only see each other in the summer. We have been really close for several years

So basically this summer my dog died and my cousin had left back home so I was really sad. We started texting each other after they had left and we have been texting nonstop. She told me that she felt super alone back home and wanted to stay here. She also told me that she misses me all of the time. And whenever I tell her that Iâ€™m sad she always cheers me up and makes me feel happy. Sheâ€™s the only person that makes me happy, and the highlight of my day is texting her. We make each other so happy. She also told me that I was the only person that she opened up to, and she always tell me her problems that sheâ€™s going through. I feel like sheâ€™s the only person who cares about me and that she actually listens to me.

I donâ€™t know if I love her please help me...
