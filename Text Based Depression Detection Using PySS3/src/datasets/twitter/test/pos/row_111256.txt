I got called adorable for the first time So I was in online class and I saw this profile pic of a girl that I had a class with last year so I go in a discord room for me and my friends and I tell them that the girl was bad meaning like very attractive.So my friend ends up actually knowing this girl and talks to her and stuff.So he told her what I said which I was cool with and she asks for a picture of me and he sends it to her and she called me adorable.Yup,nothing crazy so I'm not gonna big headed over it but I will count it as a W or her just trying to be nice
