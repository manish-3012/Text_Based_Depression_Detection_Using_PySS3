I just made the stupidest bet with my friend. I'm such a dumbass! Okay so the bet is if I get a gf by the end of the school year. I was the one who made this bet with him! It started cuz I almost got a gf recently (don't wanna talk about it). Because of this I got a sudden boost of confidence and thought I could get one by the end of this school year. Now I realize it is almost impossible cuz of COVID. I don't want to give my friend $25 dollars at the end of the year. I have a lot of girls added on snapchat, but I don't think any of them would like me. Pls help I'm in deep shit right now!!!
