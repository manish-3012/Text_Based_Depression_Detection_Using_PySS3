Ah yes, getting laid in a All-Girl sleepover amidst a pandemic. Iâ€™m sure a bunch of people in the sub have seen the post about the guy that got invited into the sleepover. And Iâ€™m in disbelief; did you guys believe it because the quarantineâ€™s had you so depraved of seeing people? Just what the fuck man, itâ€™s embarrassing to be around yâ€™all. 

Please be better than this, even if the story was true why are you celebrating the fact that they had a sleepover party on a pandemic? Jesus Christ, and the comments saying that the guy in-question is a hero for â€œliving out our dreamsâ€ just make me feel slimy and gross. I guess this is what I get for being a girl in this subreddit. Iâ€™m ready for downvotes, fingers crossed.
