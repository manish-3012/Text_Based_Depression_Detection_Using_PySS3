I'm introverted, shy, and a geek, how can I get more people to like me? Hey fellow teenagers, I would need some advice about this.. I'm a bit introverted, shy, and a geek, and the people around me.. my classmates.. they don't like my personality. Everyone here is so.. different from me. They are all extroverted, they have many friends, social circles, they hang out with popular teens from my town, and some are very popular themselves, yet.. they don't like me. They make fun of me for literally every mistake I make, and they don't like the fact that I like to spend more time home and not spend that much time outside.. in the city etc. I'm a person who likes to meet people and get to know them, yet most people find me too annoying/boring and don't want to talk to me or bully me.
