A friend of mine has been ignoring me for the past 4 months, and it's starting to make me doubt myself I met her in an online class over the summer. She's in grad school across the country and has a boyfriend.

We did all of the homework together, and after the class, we regularly texted for a couple months. She's a pretty cool person, and I've gotten a lot of valuable advice from her.

Some time in October she just... stopped replying to my messages. I didn't say anything weird or strange, her last message to me was "Thanks seccret726" (obviously using my real name)

I see her online on discord, but she ignores me. I feel like shit cause I don't know why she's ignoring me, and I don't know whats going on with her.

What can I do? Nothing?
