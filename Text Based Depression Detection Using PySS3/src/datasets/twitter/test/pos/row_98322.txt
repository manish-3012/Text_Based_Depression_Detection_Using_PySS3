Rant: If I tell you to be quiet, don't reply ok. Look if I'm watching youtube and don't want to be interrupted by someone I'll tell them to be quiet and go back to youtube. Now if you reply ok... I get interrupted. I know there are many solutions but sometimes this is annoying. Thank you for coming to my talk ted.
