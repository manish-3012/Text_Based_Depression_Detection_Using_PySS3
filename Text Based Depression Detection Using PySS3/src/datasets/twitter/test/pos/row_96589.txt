Iâ€™m interested in seeing other peopleâ€™s point of views So letâ€™s have a CIVIL discussion on abortion. Pro-life or pro-choice? Please remember to be kind to everyone and if you donâ€™t agree thatâ€™s fine. Discussion is different than telling people they are idiots for having a certain belief(unless they like fortnite /s)
