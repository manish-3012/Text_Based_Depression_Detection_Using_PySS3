Here I go againðŸ˜ Ok so I posted here earlier about my issue with this guy and y'all really gave me the push I needed. I told him how I didn't like his habits and how I think he's a bad influence for me. I told him that I was better off without him and he told me that I couldn't break up with him, that he would change. Ok first of all I never agreed to be his girlfriend because I knew that he would think he had power over me or something. He said that he loves me and that he wants to be with me. I told him that I really didn't want to see him or talk to him again. He texted my friend who I wasn't talking to anymore, so he can find out where I am. That kinda scared me.(this isn't something where he wants to hurt me or himself, he just wants to talk) I'm getting calls from random numbers which I'm blocking. I have so much stress with my work and exams that I have to do before monday and this is stressing me even more. I honestly really do like him or liked, he wasn't always like this, he helped me out with a lot of my shit and we had fun together, but I have to stop talking to him because this is not going to be good for me.
