It might sound weird but It is quite common nowadays for boys and girls to have sexting, do physical moves and the type of stuff that falls under the category that might appear more beautiful inside a marriage and not before a marriage.  
What I wanna say is, imagine both genders trying to control their temptations â€” especially boys, as you and I have a similarly about what crosses out minds most of the times â€” and try to respect eachother for more as a human.  
I personally see two main problems:  
1. You no longer being able to give some amount of respect to your same sex friends.  
2. You have already spent the rosy part of a relationship that after marriage it doesn't really excite you much.  

I could be wrong, but I feel like it, and whenever I feel like I have lustful intentions while looking at a sister, mother or daughter, I lower my gaze.  

I would be happy to see my (future) wife in a beautiful dress and keep complimenting her all my day for how beautiful she is, rather than harassing someone else.  

I ain't gonna lie about the fact that I do have raging hormones inside my brain, but the drive of being chaste for someone is completely different.  

What are your thoughts, tho?
