My gf is cheating on me with my best friend... https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/in4ek4/my_girlfriend_has_been_cheating_on_me/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share


So if you haven't seen my last post , go see it 

I called her and when she finally picked up after like 10 missed calls , I confronted her about the text on her phone..

She told me " if I tell you the truth, will you forgive me ? " I told her yes just to know the truth

When I opened the text , it was from my best friend , lets call him " X " , now X has been my best friend since pre-school , we had a bro code.... 

I just lost my 2 year relationship with a girl that I really liked and my best friend for 13 years.. 

I.... I don't know what to do , I'm just sad like I haven't been in my life it's ridiculous how can someone be so heartless..
