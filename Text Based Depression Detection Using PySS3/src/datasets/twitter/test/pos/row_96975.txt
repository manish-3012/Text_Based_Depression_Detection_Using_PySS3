Thank god for snap maps I was just on call with a friend while they were in a car accident. We were talking and all I heard was him say â€œoh shitâ€ and then the sounds of his car flipping. Then the call ended. He was driving through backroads at night and most likely hit a deer going pretty fast. I was able to figure out his last known location through snap maps and call 911 for him. After that I was able to call him and see if he needs anything. He is seemingly okay, but is definitely running on adrenaline. Heâ€™ll be sore tomorrow but thank god i was able to find him on snap maps and get someone out to him. I donâ€™t even want to think what wouldâ€™ve happened if I didnâ€™t even know where he last was.
