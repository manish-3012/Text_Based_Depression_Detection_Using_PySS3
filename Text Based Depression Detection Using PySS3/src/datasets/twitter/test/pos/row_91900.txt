Help asking a girl out I like this girl a lot and I think sheâ€™s in to me. Would it be lame if I asked her if she wanted to go to get some ice cream after school? Weâ€™re just talking rn but would you feel comfortable with someone driving you there after school? I drive since Iâ€™m a junior but I donâ€™t want her parents to think something is sketch. Any thoughts?
