Can I just clarify how much I hate being called a Simp So me and my(not anymore)friends were playing Ark(a survival game) and since its very grindy we didnt habe anything game related to talk about so we started a normal small talk conversation.All went completely normal but then....I made the mistake of wanting to invite charlie(one of my friends)in our party and as excpected my then friends asked who charlie was and I explained its a girl I have been friends with since the start of the quarantine(for context she lives in australia I live in germany) so then they just started calling me a simp.I couldnt even finish a sentence before being called a simp.After three days I was ready to give myself a bullet and I just stopped talking to them.They can go fuck themselves

Edit:  To the person who gave me an award: Thanks but Why
