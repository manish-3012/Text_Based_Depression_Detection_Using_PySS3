Iâ€™m anxious all the time I really canâ€™t help but freaking out when ever I have exams so much that I canâ€™t sleep. Eat. Or even study.
This has a major impact on my grades but most importantly it impacts my mental health
I keep having panic attacks and I feel my heart beat so much it might leave my body.
Do you have any advice?
I canâ€™t go to psychologist bc I canâ€™t afford to
