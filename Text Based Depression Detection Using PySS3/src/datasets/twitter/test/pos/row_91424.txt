I made a thing (very cool, epic) So basically, my friend and I wrote a script for a demo, that was based on a larger concept, and then along came a film contest. We decide to shorten the script and adapt it to a 3 minute run. This was our first short film and we had a budget of ~100 dollars, and a crew of 5 people at most including actors. Umm was the cameraman who you can hear talking in the behind the scenes video.
