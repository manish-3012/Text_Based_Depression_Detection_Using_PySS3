How do I become attractive? I feel ugly. I feel ugly and disgusting. I don't think I can ever get a girlfriend, I've been posting on incel subreddits for a year or two and I think I just need help now.  I've become addicted to these incel subreddits because I met people who were very similar to me, low self esteem and no success with girls.  How do I finally stop browsing these kinds of subreddits? I feel like they're damaging my self esteem and mental health even more.

Should I go see a psychiatrist about this? I'm only 17 and I need to snap out of these damn incel subreddits.
