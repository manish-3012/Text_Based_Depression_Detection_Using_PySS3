i fucking hate my mom rn!!!!! like sheâ€™s being such a bitch!!!!!!!!!!! she was asking why i canâ€™t get anything done and why iâ€™m waking up late and am a genuine mess. i said i was depressed. which is more than true as iâ€™ve been diagnosed for years now and have been hospitalized many times for my depression. she said â€œyouâ€™re only depressed because youâ€™re behind in schoolâ€ â€œwell mom, considering im still depressed in the summer thatâ€™s just not true.â€ â€œyou wear ur depression like a badge of honorâ€. no, i donâ€™t. trust me. i donâ€™t want this. 
 
i was listening to music and making a sandwich and she said â€œif u get ur math done weâ€™ll go to targetâ€ softly. this is one of those times where my brains in full on selective mutism mode, so i just pretended to listen to music as she doesnâ€™t believe in the less pretty symptoms of my asd. i was trying to speak mom. i just fucking canâ€™t. later she said â€œfine. i guess we wonâ€™t.â€ nearly yelling, and i was like â€œdid you say something earlier i was listening to music so i didnâ€™t hearâ€ and she got all snappy and yelled 
 
this is literally just the last 30 minutes itâ€™s been like this all day i just wanna dieeee
