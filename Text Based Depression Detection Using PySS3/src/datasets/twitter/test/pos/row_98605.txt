My closest friend kissed me Yesterday at school i was having a really tough day, i was crying most of the afternoon and i was really stressed, after class i met up with them and they saw that i was crying. They've been my best friends for almost 4 years, they've helped me through a lot win the past and i have helped them too, when they sawme they hugged me and gave me a kiss on the head. They have never done that and i was really surprised, they never done anything like that before, i was really surprised as they have never done anything like that, it felt nice.
