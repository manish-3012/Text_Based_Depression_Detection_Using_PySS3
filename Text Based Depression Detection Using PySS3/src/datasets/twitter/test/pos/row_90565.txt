The relationship between me and my father is fucked up . Hey guys so its my ( 21M ) first time to write here . As an introvert i mind sharing everything even to close friends but here no one knows me . Well lets come to the point .
.
A little intro about me and my father relations . My father is a doctor and he wanted me to be doctor i wanted to be a mathematician or software engineer but whatever i took medicine and started preparing to become a doctor . My dad and me are not on good terms . We speak less we meet less solid reason i can give is that he wants me to be an overachiever in medicine because his friend's son is an overachiever and here i am overachiever in mathematics with full score. Let that alone . He continuously tortures me and my mom and my family not physically but mentally by speaking out things like disgracing mom's side relatives , about me that i am just an asshole or about my sister and brother that they are dumb ...etc...

.. so the story goes here ..

.

So before dinner today around 7 pm , i casually went to my Dad's room while just looking he said ask before you come that is manners he wasnt doing anything but i dont know why he said that so i said sorry and went out of the room . Now he keeps going to my mom telling about me that you didnt brought him up well he is not a man he is some kind of asshole all that stuff . I was listening but i was quiet . After some time he decided to go out for some shopping at the mall we also decided to go with him . I never go out with him but today i said I'll go as long as i said I'll go he told that we'll go tomorrow i am not going because tomorrow i think there will be good things to shop . So in a funny manner i said "my father's name"
Is coming we have to restock our new goods especially for that guy . He got offended and started demeaning me by cursing and i said i was joking he didnt stop so fight started and he told me go out of the house and do something on my own and then talk back to him .

..

I am feeling so fucking bad that i am crying now while typing this that i cannot afford anything and leave this fucking house with my mom and my siblings . I am eldest brother in the family even my mom says that do something in your life and leave this house and leave happily study hard . I wish i can fucking afford a house and 3 meals a day so i can live peacefully... hoping to achieve my medical degree soon and then getting a job and moving out as soon as possible ... FUCKKKKIINGGG SHITTT I FEEL NOWWW ...FUCKKKK


...
REQUEST :- please dont curse my dad or anything i respect him as he is my father no matter what . I hope y'all stay safe at home .
