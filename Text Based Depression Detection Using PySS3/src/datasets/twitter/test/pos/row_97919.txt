Love you all and don't let you or anyone else tell you different I had to take a break from every social media or anything in general and I realised people cared I just never went out of my way to realise maybe it's not the same for you and I've had my traumas as well but just know I love you and whatever you are going through will pass and I'm here for you except not really since I'm sleeping soon but I'll be here tomorrow
