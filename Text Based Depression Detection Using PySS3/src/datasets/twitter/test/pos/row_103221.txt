My best friend of 5 years cut me off completely I was friends with him since 6th grade and now we are both in 10th and he just recently told me that he has a girlfriend that goes to his school (he moved away recently) and that she's been helping him deal with his stress. We were so close that everyone always thought we were dating. He was my best friend and now i can't even text him bc he blocked me. I canged my ps4 name to match his so we could call ourselves the fruit bowl. He even texted me saying that we could still talk we just cant be friends again like we used to. Yesterday i was talking about my other friend and my sister goes "she still wont admit that she likes adam" and i almost started crying bc then i had to explain that hes not even friends with me anymore. I have to go back to school tomorrow and if any of my friends ask about him im gonna cry. Idk y but i feel like i did something to cause him to leave me. And now i need a new guy best friend.
