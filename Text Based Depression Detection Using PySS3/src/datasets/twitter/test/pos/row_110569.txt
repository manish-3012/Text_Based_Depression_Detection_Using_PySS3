The fragile boys of my old highschool There were a couple of guys at my old highschool who were very hypocrite and annoying. They liked to hit and squeeze people in their necks with their cold and wet fingers, so one break I had enough of being hit in my neck or one of my friends getting her neck squeezed so I hid myself between some sophomores and started moving my hand around the bicep of one of those guys (Damn actually ðŸ˜) and because of that they started gossiping about that was somehow in love with him and they started giving me a disgusted look. Now do they know how it feels when someone touches you without permission.
