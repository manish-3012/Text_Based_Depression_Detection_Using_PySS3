Is somthing wrong with me? heya people things, i really hadnt told anyone this so here is some things to know before: I have a twin. I watch movies alot and play videogames (currently pokemon crown tundra) but about the movies part. Now to the story, it is always kids movies like monsters university, or home alone 2, coco, or the lorax or something really childish that me and my twin watch. (Though recently its been marvel movies like ant-man, guardians of the galaxy 1 and 2, endgame) But what is even worse is that we watch these for like multiple weeks everytime we get the chance, like oh im not doing anything, lets watch cloudy with a chance of meatballs 2 for the 43rd time (we actually watched that ALOT of times) So do any of yall think something might be wrong with us? Oh and everytime we watch movies for weeks we get a shit ton of references and quote them when they can be applied, which there is surprisingly alot (we get really good grades so it might not be mentally related) By the way here is some info on how long we watched some movies they will be sorted by Era (time period)
Well be going in order so me and my twin think it started with a particular christmas movie in summer of 2018 or 2019 we lost track of time by like a year or so. (we were 100% not time traveling)
Starting the list now! (Movies that i remembered will be in caps to help differentiate the word era from the movie)

Elf era (2 months)

The Lorax era (2 weeks)

Home alone 2 era(2 months)

All other movie eras that lasted 2 weeks (not in order i forgot)
Monsters Inc., monsters u, coco, cloudy with a chance of meatballs, cloudy with a chance of meatballs 2, spongebob squarepants movie 1 and 2, shazam, antman, antman and the wasp, guardians of the galaxy 1 and 2, Madagascar, madagascar 2 escape 2 africa, madagascar 3 europes most wanted, shrek 4, ratatouille, hotel transylvania, hotel transylvania 2, hotel transylvania 3 and plenty more that i dont remember. Jumanji welcome to the jungle was going to happen but it lasted like 2 days
And there was the garfield show for like 3 weeks.

And we still make refrences from home alone 2 which was probably 2 years ago?
So is there a DEFINITELY 100% something wrong or not and do you know anyone with a similar situation, or hell even if youre in a similar situation?
i need help, dont i?
