I hate ppl which are too full of themselves I was on a call with my class. One girl said: "Nobody loves me"
I said: "Itâ€™s not nice calling me nobody"
Her friend said: "Itâ€™s the truth though"
I said: "itâ€™s true that I am nobody but already I have amounted to more than you. You keep saying 'Nobody can amount to more than I can'"
Girl1: "Ew youâ€™re ugly. Youâ€™re weird. How dare you love me fucking creep. I am disgusted"
Girl2: "Now look at what you did"
_Girl1 starts crying_

I kinda regret being so cold, but these were popular girls Iâ€™m talking abt. Just wanted to tell this to sm1, otherwise have a good day
