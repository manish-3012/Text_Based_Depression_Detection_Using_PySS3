I just realized I'm so lonly I can careless about having sex (Read if you want i kinda lose my train of though) Ok i want to have sex but I've never really have been in a relationship and it gets really lonely my parents are really lazy I just want a nice girlfriend who understands me and is funny and just wants to have a casual relationship but Covid-19 is making that even harder to get a girlfriend than it already is. As I listen to logics new album im just thinking sad and feeling really depressed idek what I'm saying anymore. Sorry for me spilling my dumb life onto you guys there are much more pressing stuff on this sub you guys should be reading.
