My Parents Might Get Divorced. My parents are thinking about getting divorced. They have been together for 22 years; arranged marriage. My mom think's my dad's cheating on her, my dad think's she's a phsyco. I just love both my parents.

This morning I was sleeping, and all of a sudden I hear someone banging the door really hard, both my parents are cursing at each other and my younger sister is just looking at me for help. My mom go's to my grandmother's house ( who lives next door) and locks all the doors. My dad was about to break the door to my grandmother's house but was stopped. 

My mom hugged me goodbye and told me to stay brave and she doesn't know when I'll see me again and told me to go to my dad. I did with my sister and he told us about their whole fight, and how both of them cant take each other anymore and this might have been the last straw. 

I don't know what to do. I am just sad and hope they don't divorce.
