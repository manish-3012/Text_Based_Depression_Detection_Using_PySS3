So my parents just threatened to make my life a living hell Long story short, I had a misunderstanding about an assignment, and I was really stressed about it. I accidentally raised my voice to my mom, and then they said that they would send me to a doctor (therapist, ect.) if I donâ€™t clean up my act. 

They then said to explain what the problem was without a â€œsnarkyâ€ attitude. I then did that, and did my best fake smile. Thatâ€™s when the said they would make my life a living hell.

At this point, Iâ€™m just trying not to interact with them so I donâ€™t make things worse.
