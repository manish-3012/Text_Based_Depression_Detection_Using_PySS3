My school and itâ€™s lack of brain cells In the beginning of the school year, we were given the option to either do it all online or do it hybrid (go to school 2 days a week and go online 3 days a week). The school did not disclose this until weeks after this was announced that online classes would only be offered for CP (college prep or average in difficulty classes). This also does not include any music classes such as band, orchestra, and chorus. For me, I like to push and challenge myself and I am aiming to applying to a fairly competitive college in a few years , so Iâ€™ve been working hard for many years to be in honors classes. This year I enrolled in my first AP class and honors classes for the rest. However, none of these classes are offered online, and if I were to take online, I would be automatically be bumped down to CP. The school is ultimately forcing any kids who want to take honors or AP classes to go to school in person. My parents are immunocompromised and in the end, Iâ€™m risking my familyâ€™s lives in order to get a decent education. Many of my friends who also take at least an honors class or AP class also have immunocompromised family members or are even immunocompromised themselves, so itâ€™s been extremely frustrating to decide whether to go to school or not. I still feel horrible in my decision to go to school in person in order to save my GPA and my transcript. Three weeks into my school year, and I can verify itâ€™s a big bruh.
