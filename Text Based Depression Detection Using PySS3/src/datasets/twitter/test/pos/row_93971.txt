I feel bad that 2020 is ending, that 2021 is coming 2021 will be the year of laziness for me, I'm worried about my AP Human Geography exam and also the fact that I have to do my ACT and SAT in the 11th grade. Idk what to do, I'm scared that I will fail. I'm wanting to make a plan of working really hard with my sister on ACT and SAT, I'm also wanting to improve my programming and art skills so I can become a game developer and artist. I'm wanting to become a better person but I'm lazy and I always procrastinate until its too late. I cried last night because I was thinking about Naruto and how sad it was, I felt sad after that. I feel bad for my upbringing now, I should've been beaten or something so I can get disciplined. Now, I'm just a lazy loser. Anyway bye guys.
