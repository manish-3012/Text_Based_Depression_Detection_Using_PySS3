I have not slept in 30 hours The trick is to watch/play something in the meantime, during the day, I do normal stuff that actual humans do. At the night, however, you watch a show, play a game, catch up with cultural wonders. I have been watching the Legend of Korra for 4 hours straight. It's currently 5AM. I feel fantastic. Another useful tactic is water, water and flavoured beverages. Can't go to bed if you're constantly walking to the bathroom.

More stuff but a break in the text to please your eyes. **Wired headphones**, your headphones don't die if they're wired. Also, have you computer or laptop on a desk near your bed; make your bed not a sleep palace, but a *gamer space*. You won't be able to sleep if there's something interesting you, distracting you. Your phone, after experimenting, will not do, it dies too quick, the screen is too small, it no longer supports wired headphones, your phone will not do.

**I don't want your eyes to hurt** 
Have a back up plan, **YOU WILL GET BORED**, my case is an exception, as the Legend of Korra will never get boring, but in every other case, have a backup plan. You may either finish your show and have nothing else to do, or simply get bored. **Have a backup plan**

Sorry if formatting is bad, it's 6 AM now.
