How realistic would it be for someone to actually kill or immobilize a dude by snapping his neck from behind Hollywood seems to do it too easily in almost every movies. It would be understandable if a big sized dude did it but this is mostly done by women lol. Worst offender is black widow, she does it with her legs wtf like we get it that women have strong lower bodies but snapping a neck?
