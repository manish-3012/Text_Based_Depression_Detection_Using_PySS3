There was a short movie about Garfield's 9 lives made in the 80s. Based on a book, I am led to believe that it's a mostly canonical account of every incarnation of Garfield he's lived/will live.

&gt;! Also Garfield tricks God into giving him and Odie 9 more lives after Garfield's "final" death. !&lt;
