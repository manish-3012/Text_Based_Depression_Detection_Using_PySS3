Iâ€™m paralyzed fear is my savior yet my enemy .because Iâ€™m too scared to take risks but to scared to die .
I canâ€™t even go with people bc Iâ€™m scared they will reject me 
I am stuck in between happiness and sadness without a clear purpose .i am too lonely to have people to tell my problems too so i swallow all my issues and they burn me inside 
All I am clinging on is for something  to happen but deep inside I know that nothing will move if I donâ€™t push it 
I try to make progress but for every step I take forward I take 2 back 
I try to hide my feelings  but also feel like I am not understood 
If life is pain I buried mine long time ago but it is still alive 
I keep telling myself that I donâ€™t need anyone but really all I need
Is a wanna talk â€œ ,a hug 
All I really need is someone to care for me
