How can I confess without ruining a friendship? I've liked this friend for over a year. I've had to keep my feelings a secret. She's had a fair amount of heartbreaks, I don't want her to think I could be the cause of another one.

She is one of my only friends and I don't want to ruin that. 
The reason I didn't put this in r/relationshipadvice is because, these are teens. This subreddit also, shares just enough to be good.
