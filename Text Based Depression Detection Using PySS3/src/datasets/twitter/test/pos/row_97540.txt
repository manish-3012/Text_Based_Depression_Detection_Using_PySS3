Toxic Parents: kicking me out because of clutter and cooking My mom snoops through my room, my bags and purses, my closet, drawers, everything. She will dig until she finds something to complain about. My room isnâ€™t even as half as bad as average teens. I donâ€™t leave dishes laying around, and I donâ€™t have clothes and etc all over my floor. She found some granola bars in a purse, some clothes (pjâ€™s) on my bed, a pile of clothes in my closet (cuz of too many clothes and small closet) and two small loads of laundry. Also garbage, but inside of my can. She also dug through my drawers until she found my hidden stash of cash. 

She proceeds to overreact and exaggerate of course everything to my dad. So now my dad and her believes that thereâ€™s dirty underwear in my bed, rotten food in my bags and on my desk, 5 loads of two week old laundry in my basket, and overflowing trash can, and an overloaded closet thatâ€™s pouring out onto the floor. (this is NOT even what my room had been like, it was as I described in the first paragraph.) So now my dad is PISSED and they both proceed to do the following. 

They sit me down and my dad is yelling at me. Heâ€™s never yelled at me like this before, so I started crying.  He was explaining everything mom had exaggerated to him about. I tried to say something but he shut me up and said Iâ€™m not allowed to talk or to cry or feel sad because â€˜people have it worseâ€™ thus saying my emotions are invalid. They called me a slob and said they feel like I donâ€™t care about them raising me my whole life. Not true. I care about them. I do my damn best to keep them happy, but I fuck up because Iâ€™m not perfect. They want my room to be spotless. Okay, understandable, but I do my best and things they say to me donâ€™t add up to it. They start comparing me to other peopleâ€™s kids, and my sister, saying why canâ€™t I be like them. They compared me to my cousins and said why donâ€™t you ever cook dinner for us. Well nobody ever taught me how to cook. And whenever I ask if I can help them with dinner, majority of the time they say no. And what does cooking even have to do with this??? To top it off they said I have a month to â€˜grow upâ€™ (because of my room and no cooking skills) or else they will kick me out. And no joke, they will, because they did back around Christmas and then got mad at me â€˜for leavingâ€™. Honestly at this point, Iâ€™d be happier to leave. Better for my mental health. They also said this, which really got to me, â€œwhere did we go wrongâ€ . You know how that made me feel? Like an absolute failure. I had thought of killing myself. I try my best to be the best child I can be, but I am never good enough because of my little mistakes. They say they want me to act more like an adult, yet they control me and Iâ€™m not allowed to do what I want even though I pay rent here and Iâ€™m an â€˜adultâ€™. My boyfriend has a bad relationship with them too because he sees that they are controlling of me and not good at communicating with me, plus they always threaten him and threaten that I canâ€™t see him if I make a mistake again. 

I wanted to go for a walk to relax and they wouldnâ€™t let me. They forced me back upstairs as I was trying to get out the door. Why wasnâ€™t I able to go for a freaking walk after all the shit they said to me. 

I went to my room and had a breakdown and panic attack. My mom barged in and continued going on about the conversation, and I asked politely â€œcan I please be alone for a bit? Can we talk more later I want to be alone?â€ she didnâ€™t care she continued on. 

I want to leave my house and go stay at my boyfriends again, but my parents feel like I donâ€™t care about them so I feel stuck in this toxic household because I do care about them. But I want whatâ€™s best for my mental health. When they drag me down and make small deals like these big deals, I canâ€™t stand how sad it makes me feel. I donâ€™t want to be a disappointment. But I donâ€™t tolerate things they say to me. I know they do it out of love and they want me to be respectful of them because I live under their roof, however its hard when Iâ€™m treated like this even though I am trying especially when deep down I am struggling inside. 

TLDR: parents found slightly messy room, threatened to kick me out because I canâ€™t keep it perfectly clean and because I canâ€™t cook like other kids can. 
But who raised me? They did. What am I supposed to do????!
