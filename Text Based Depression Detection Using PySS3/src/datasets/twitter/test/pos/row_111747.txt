Am I just being stressed for nothing? Iâ€™ve been dating this girl did a few weeks now, I really like her, but her family seems to like to take her phone away; recently, sheâ€™s just randomly stopped texting me

Now the thing is last time she got her phone taken, she told me beforehand, but this time, nothing. I really hope it is just that she got her phone taken, but my mind is keep on going to â€œshe left, you hurt her somehow with our noticingâ€

Edit: also we are long distance
