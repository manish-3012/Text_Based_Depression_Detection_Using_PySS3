Should i trust her? (Sorry for the bad english. its not my firs language )

So i lost some people in the past half year.
U know brackeups and all that.
Some people just played with me.

And idk i feel like now i found someone right. 
Its this girl she is soo cool evene tho we never meet.
I talked with for a month.
We flirt frome time to time. 
She even told me that i mean a lot to her and helped her through some dark times.

Last night i got in a fight with my dad and he took my phone away 

She keept messageing me all night to see why i dident reply.
 Like she said she was scared that something happend to me.
And that she keept thinking abouth me all day.

And i feel like she realy cares abouth me.

But what if she is just playing with me ? 
Should i think of this? Idk im afraid to loose her too
