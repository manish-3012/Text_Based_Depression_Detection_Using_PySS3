It appears the cat post was fake Yesterday someone made a post about losing their cat, here is a comment someone made with evidence that the cat posted was theirs. It appears that OP was just joking for karma.

The person just said that they posted it with their friend as a joke. Whatâ€™s sick is that many of us have had to lose our pets and these stupid fucks thought it was funny to do this.
