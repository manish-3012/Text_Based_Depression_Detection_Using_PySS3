Oh god oh god it has happened to me My dad just walked into me having my fun time, though my room is pitch dark and he asked me if Iâ€™m going to bed and left when I said yeah. So maybe, just MAYBE he didnâ€™t know what was going on. Whatâ€™s kind of more embarrassing was I didnâ€™t hear him until he spoke up so I could have been waking it hardcore whilst he just sat at the door. There is also an angle from where the door is so he could have not opened it all the way and didnâ€™t see me. I also had my fan on so he might not have heard the slapping sound. Hopefully I wonâ€™t have to see him for a bit until he comes back from work tomorrow.
