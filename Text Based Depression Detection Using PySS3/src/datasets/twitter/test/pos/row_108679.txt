I got hugged by a girl!! So I brought some frosted cinnamon rolls to my class, it's not really a class, but a school room with several other students only because of Covid-19 restrictions, I brought them in class and I gave them to my friends, then one of my others friends realized she didn't get one, so she asked if she could have one and I gave her one, she was like "oh my god this is so good" she then asked the supervisor in the room if it was ok to hug me, and we hugged, she felt soft, warm, and smelled good, it was so nice, the most physical contact I've made with a girl in a while.
