Damn man, Cuties' really sucks! I watched the trailer as it is all over reddit telling how it is super gross and it's fuckin' true. What was Netflix thinking srsly!! 

In middle of the trailer, a girl's mom tells her that she's a woman and in the latter part, when a boy asks her she says that she's 11.... I mean, WOW  à² _à² 

Showing 11 year olds  twerking is srsly disgusting Netflix and on top of that, the poster is also  inappropriate on so many levels.....
