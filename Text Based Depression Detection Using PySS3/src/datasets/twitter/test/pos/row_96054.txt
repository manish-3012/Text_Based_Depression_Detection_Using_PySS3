Real latinos don't even care about racism. Only Latinos born in the U.S are the ones that are leftist, lgbt pro, abortion pro, all that af. Latinos born in latin america have more important stuff to worry about... Like economical crisis, cartel violence, mara violence and oppressive governments.

While American Latinos are more like white girls... Just... Tire color.
