My gf seems distant... My girl and I are both 17, been together for about 2 months now. Iâ€™ve made my own fair share of mistakes, but she glosses over them quickly which I love about her. Itâ€™s starting to feel as if she is distant, seeming like she is more excited to talk to other guys than me. I donâ€™t want to be possessive, but Iâ€™m scared for us. Iâ€™m scared for me. I donâ€™t want our relationship to end, but it seems like what Iâ€™m doing isnâ€™t working. I need help desperately. I go to bed sad and afraid, not convinced when she says she loves me
