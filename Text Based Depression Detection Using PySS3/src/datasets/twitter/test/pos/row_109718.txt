I'm into a guy but I'm friends with his twin sister Let'sÂ  call this guy Josh and his twinÂ  sister Joanna

so I've met Josh and Joanna 2 years ago in a party .. But we were younger and not really mature 

Recently (the past 2 months ) Joanna and I started hanging out . And me Joanna and Josh went out before lockdown .

That night I saw Josh staring at me and touching his beard . 

Anyways now we are chatting through social , and he ALWAYS compliments me . I compliment him too cause I really like him and he is so kind but also shyÂ  . He's never been in a relationship before ( we are all in the same age 19 ) .

There's no way of meeting him cause of lockdown(they say that it might last till half of December )

I don't want to ask him out becauseÂ  
1)I don't want to ruin my friendship with Joanna since she might think that I'm only hanging out with her cause of Josh ( I really appreciate her)
2) I don't want to do it and if I do he probably tell it to Joanna ðŸ˜‚

Need your advice PLEASE !!!!
