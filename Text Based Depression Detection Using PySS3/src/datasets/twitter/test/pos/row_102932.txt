Itâ€™s my year in this sub... I turned 19 I feel like all we want to do when we are young is grow up, but there comes an age where all you want to do is grow down. 

I know that sounded cheesy, but I really wish I could stay this young, just for a bit longer... I feel like Iâ€™ve missed out on so much.
