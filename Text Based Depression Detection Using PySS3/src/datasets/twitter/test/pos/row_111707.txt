Fairy tale of new York censorship is bs Is ridiculous everybody is so sensitive now you can't even keep the best Christmas song on without being homophobic even though f****t has multiple meanings obviously one of the meaning is a gay guy but it also has different meanings like a bundle of sticks(certain parts of england) to bind something and its part of embroidery its also Irish slang for lazy or someone who's wasteful which is what its about in the song. I've never met 1 person who is lgbt+ who thinks its homophobic the only people who do are the snowflakes who try to censor everything incase it hurts one person's feelings its ridiculous.
