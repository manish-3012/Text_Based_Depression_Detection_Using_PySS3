Hey howdy ho could you guys take a look at something I wrote? Be brutally honest pls pls pls Beyond the stars, on a new frontier is where we shall be. We will leave the relics and tragedies of our past and let you rot and starve in a cold, water sleep for our return there is no guarantee. You may ask forgiveness, beg and plead all you like but for what you have done there is no excuse. The lies and the abuse, years and years of misuse and for what? Money and fame whilst you let the rest of us die in vain. Do you not see the pain like a freight train barrelling straight through all our goddamn brains making us fucking insane whilst you sip your champagne in your ivory towers built upon bane and disdain whilst your might slowly wanes. You are hereby honourably discharged for being dishonourably in charge. You have been let go and forgotten, future generations will hear of your crimes against the people, count yourself lucky to not have your desecrated corpses hung from the steeple for all to see. Your medieval practices and trials tainting our once beautiful isles where now lay nothing but denial. I pray for you to realise one day how much chaos and dismay you have brought upon yourselves through broken, hollow yells screaming down with the monarchy, down with the oppression and down with the unruly ruling you have decided to follow.
