Oh my God, what should I do? A stranger has my pic. It's not a nude but I don't want the stranger to have it cuz what if they altered it and blackmailed me with it? What if they're a hacker or something? I blocked him and deleted his number but I'm so scared. Someone tell me what to do. Please. This is serious.
