4 days of no porn and no social medias. how the hell do i stop thinking about girls?? any time i see a couple i begin to be jealous of them, i wish i hsd the guys personality, many girls have called me a "Nice guy" and i hate thats all i am? i want to be more..i hate being called "Nice guy" causs they always finish last or finish in the shower.

and make it about me, i begin to tell.my self "am i not good enough to have a GF?" 

why does no one love me? i cant even make friends, why is making friends so hard for me? do i have to ger out more?

past 4 days have been hard. i was even afraid to speak because i thought what ever i would say wouldnt be good enough...

other guys who get more attention than me i feel like they are better/cooler/smarter than me in every way... its like im a fan and they are a celebrity, 

its like idiolize everyone and makes me nervous around others and afraid what i will say might upset them then i judge my self that i cant even make friends.

i judge my self worth by how others react to me, i used to depend my happiness on external sources but i know i should be happy within first.
