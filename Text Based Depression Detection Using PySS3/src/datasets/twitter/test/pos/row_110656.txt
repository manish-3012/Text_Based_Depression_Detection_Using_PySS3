my teacher said he didn't believe in ghosts So I sent him an essay long email about cults, paranormal hotspots/activity, skeptics, scientists &amp; then recommended him way too many videos/documentaries, books, sites, etc.

it's just my topic of interest.

I regret this. He's totally going to try and talk to me about it tomorrow. That's too much social interaction.

 Please kill me.
