iâ€™m 14 and my mother still controls what i wear i know how i want to dress, but i canâ€™t dress that way because my mother doesnâ€™t like it. i like more loose fitting clothes, they make me feel more confident and happy, but my mum hates it and tries her best to make sure i donâ€™t wear them. i have a few pairs of mom jeans and i love them, i wear them as much as i can, but she refuses to buy me baggier shirts so i have to wear fitted ones. they make me feel anxious about my body and i hate it. iâ€™ve tried asking so many times if when i next have time buy new jeans i can stop wearing skinny jeans, but she says no every time and literally just buys me skinny jeans. iâ€™m perfectly willing to buy my clothes with my own money, but iâ€™m scared that sheâ€™ll get angry because i choose clothes she doesnâ€™t like. since most days she basically tells me what to wear, i look like iâ€™m wearing the same thing every day and i hate it, but i donâ€™t want to do other than what she tells me because iâ€™m scared sheâ€™ll tell me off. 

i just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. i look in the mirror wearing the clothes she buys me and i hate it, it feels like the person staring back at me isnâ€™t even me, i donâ€™t know how else to describe it.
