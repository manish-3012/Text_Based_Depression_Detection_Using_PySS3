2020 was overhyped Iâ€™m so angry that I bought 2020 preorder pack. I thought this yearly addition was going to be like 2019 so I preordered it but all I got was a flimsy mask, which was a tease of an update to be added later on, that broke as soon as I put it on. The update teased was the Outbreak Update, which didnâ€™t even add any zombies or anything. The gameplay during this update was severely lacking, like you couldnâ€™t even go outside or invite friends to your lobby. Once they added in huge, killer hornets but they took them out as quickly as they added them in. The devs easily couldâ€™ve made this fun, after all, it was the beginning of the â€œ20â€™s, but they are so inept that they couldnâ€™t even do that correctly. This was obviously a cashgrab. Iâ€™m tired of this business practice and Iâ€™m boycotting the next release and so should you.
