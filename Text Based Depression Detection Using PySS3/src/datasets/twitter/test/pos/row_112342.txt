TW: Self H*rm kinda - Weird intrusive thoughts So I've been sewing a lot lately, and I keep having intrusive thoughts of stabbing myself with a pin or sewing on my skin??? And I obviously haven't done that because Ouchie but it got so bad that I was poking the surface of my skin with a pin and had to push it into a pin cushion for a while to get rid of the urge to push it into my thigh

how do I deal with these weird intrusive thoughts, or at least keep myself from acting upon them? aah
