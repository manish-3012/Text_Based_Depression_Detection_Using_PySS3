Why do I do this to myself I go to bed too late last night and when I wake up this morning I feel like shit. I eat a very small breakfast at 9 and donâ€™t eat again till 3 so I got a headache on top of the tiredness. I take a nap later in the day and feel better. But now Iâ€™m not tired and itâ€™s 2 am, Iâ€™m wide awake. And have a meeting to join at 8 plus tons of work to do for school. Then I gotta workout even though it feels pointless because I canâ€™t seem to control my eating habits. Then I have to have a music lesson and I havenâ€™t looked over any of the material because I donâ€™t practice enough so every lesson thereâ€™s always something I struggle with. Iâ€™ve been playing music in school since 4th grade but never really took the time to learn notes and so my teacher thinks I know way more than I do. Wtf man
