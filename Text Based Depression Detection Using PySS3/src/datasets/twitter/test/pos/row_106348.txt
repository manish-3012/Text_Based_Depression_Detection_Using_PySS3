should i get this tattoo i want even though my best friend thinks i shouldnt (if ur going to say i shouldnt be ruining my body with tattoos dont bother lol)

i have a drain gang art style butterfly design that i really like n want to get inbetween my breasts so i asked my friend for her input bc i know she likes body mods aaaafhhs she said i shouldnâ€™t get it bc that part of the body is a good canvas n i might want a piece there when im older or smth 

our tattoo tastes r different n i think she doesnâ€™t like â€œrandomâ€ tats where im the complete opposite LOL i have a couple of sanrio tattoos + a bunch of dumb stick n pokes + a catgirl tattoo ,,, and im planning on getting more â€œignorant styleâ€ tats

i have bad impulse control so i think sheâ€™s also trying to prevent me from doing smth ill regret later

should i say Fuck It bc im confident abt the tat/placement and dont see me getting some really big pretty tattoo around my chest area ,, or should i not do it n take my friends advice?? 

my boyfriend said i should get it but idk
