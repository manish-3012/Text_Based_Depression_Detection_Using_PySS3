I need help. I canâ€™t stand him My stepbrother got mad at our dog for playing with a toy, yelled at him and hit a toy buzzer, I told him to stop and he gave a snarky response. His mom told him to stop yelling and to stay out, so the stepbrother is being a massive jackass. He does register really low on the autism spectrum but my god. Heâ€™s being really loud and itâ€™s 8:20 pm. I canâ€™t stand it. Heâ€™s a brat and he needs to not be. Goddammit Iâ€™m pissed
