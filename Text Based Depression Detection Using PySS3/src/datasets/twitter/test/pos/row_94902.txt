Hate when people do this They'll start texting you and you ask what they're doing and they say "hanging out with friends" like why did you start texting me then? And then like a minute after they say that they're like "oop! Gtg do something with them!" Again, why tf did u text me in the first place? What did either of us gain from that waste of time? Now I'm sitting here sad and alone wishing we could've talked.
