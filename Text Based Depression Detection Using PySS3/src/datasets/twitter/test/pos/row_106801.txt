I know this is overused and unoriginal but... Thanks so much for making my first year on reddit....interesting. I got the chance to help out so many of you with various life issues, which is an experience that I'll never forget. I got to see the rise and fall of the car girl meme, read many shit posts, see other teens dramatically leave this subreddit, and just about everything else. Some of the stories and advice I have read on this subreddit have really influenced some of my decisions for the better. So, thanks, and I hope my years get even better on this subreddit.
