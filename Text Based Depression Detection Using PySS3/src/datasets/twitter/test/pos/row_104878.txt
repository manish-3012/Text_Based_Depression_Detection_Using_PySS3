I deleted my Facebook So, I have been using Facebook a lot for over 5 years and shitposted throughout my teenage (I am still 17) and in the last few months the toxicity with people mocking me for the name of banter was getting heavy. 
Like I was doing something and they would call it false or fluke or just a clout chaser, a wannabe. I have told them not to troll me because I never trolled others and stayed in my lane for most of the time. It was getting a lot of hectic for my mental health and I had nightmares therefore, I just deleted/deactivate my facebook and I don't think of coming back at all.
