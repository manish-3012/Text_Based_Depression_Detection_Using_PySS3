I got rejected by my crush Lately I (M16) decided to tell my crush (F16) that I like her. We don't know each other that well but she's really cute and I like her. We're also in the same class together. Her first reaction was like "okay haha" so I asked if she wanted to go out sometime. She said "I'll pass". Ofcourse I feel sorry she doesn't feel the same way but I still think it was worth the try. To all of you who are hesitating to confess to your crush, do it. Even if you get rejected, you don't have the feeling anymore of not knowing whether she likes you back.
