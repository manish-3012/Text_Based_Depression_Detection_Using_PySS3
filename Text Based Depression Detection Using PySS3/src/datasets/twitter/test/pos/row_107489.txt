Help me Me and this girl agreed to meet up and get a drink.. now I ask: are you free Wednesday because Im not free from thursday to Saturday. She says: oh why not. Then I say why I can't. And she says: oh

Htf should I response to 'oh'?? Why wouldn't she say if she's available? 

Anyway how can I actually have a date with her
