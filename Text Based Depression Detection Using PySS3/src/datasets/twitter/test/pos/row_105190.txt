Wish me luck yall My report card just came in and my grades are 
80, 73, 71, 71, 69, 66, 60 my parents havenâ€™t seen them yet, but they just got the email. Iâ€™m so fucked. Iâ€™m so anxious, and I know all they are gonna see is the failures, but in reality, I made the biggest comeback in the history of comebacks. I used to have a 25 in one subject and I brought it up to an 80. I had a 43 and brought it up to a 60. I had 50s in so many subject and brought them up to 70s. God Iâ€™m so scared
