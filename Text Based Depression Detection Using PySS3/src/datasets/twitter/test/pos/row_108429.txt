i friendzoned a girl, was i right to do so? (theres a tl;dr, don't worry). i know this is a lot, there is a tl;dr at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

so before we begin, heres a little backstory on myself relationship wise, my last gf was 3 years ago, which i fucked up to an amazing extent and don't want to talk about it, but the basics are that she (the 3-years-ago girl) wanted someone to love and be loved by romantically, now, myself at the time wasn't particularly interested in girls, as i was only 11, so i thought "hehe yay i can say i have gf!" and if cuked it all up because i couldn't give her proper love. 

now, back to today, i've completely flipped sides from that me, and i'm now very romantic, im pretty lonely and touch starved, and this girl i've known for a while but only ever thought of in a friend way messegas me on discord, and says "i really like you and i have for a while" which surprised me, i took some time to think about it and decided to friendzone her, it was a tough decision, but at the end of things, she had gone through 2 other guys only a week ago, and i don't want to be 3rd choice, i decided that if i were to date someone it would be because they wanted me before anyone else, but i'm not sure it was the right thing to do, because i feel like it might be my only chance to be in a relationship for a while. what do you guys think?

tl;dr: what the title says, i did it because i was only 3rd choice, did i do a good or bad?
