There is no such thing as true love! Yes you have heard me, you pseudo optimistic \*humans\*. I once believed that, too. But all this is a huge goddamn lie. 3 times now, I have thought it would be true love, but all the time I have got fooled, all of them are just exchangeable human beings, all the same, like fucking robots. First you see them they like you and you don't, then you begin to like them, and they let you hang. They throw you away like a smoked cigarette. They use you, they extract the joy of your life, and then you are garbage to them.
