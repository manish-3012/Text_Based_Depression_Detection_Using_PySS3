How do I prevent my idiotic self from hurting my grandmas feelings? My birthday is Jan. 3rd, right after Christmas so Iâ€™m always a little dry with gift ideas when my grandparents ask me for a list or something of the sort. My grandma wants to get me gift cards and things like that but I feel like those gifts are sort of boring or not though out, but how do I tell her this without hurting her feelings? She can get pretty sensitive when it comes to gift giving and Is known to compare hers to my other grandparents gifts, so I donâ€™t want to hurt her feelings by passively insulting her gift idea, but I also feel like gift cards are boring gifts when I could ask for something else instead. Does anybody know some better phrasing then â€œgift cards seem kind of boring compared to other things I could ask forâ€ because that sounds like itâ€™s not a good gift and I would feel like a POS for months to come.
