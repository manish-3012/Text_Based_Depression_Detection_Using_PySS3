hey iâ€™m rly tired and sad like. all i do is sit in my room. which would be fine if i didnâ€™t feel so bad about it all the time. but i donâ€™t want to be out of my room because i donâ€™t wanna be highkey shamed by my family (love that) and theyâ€™re always laughing and chilling together but when i go out i just feel like they donâ€™t want me there? and iâ€™m p sure they donâ€™t. i just feel like i donâ€™t fit yknow? so iâ€™ve been spending my energy playing guitar and making art and stuff but it still feels so empty and lonely, even if iâ€™m talking to my friends (iâ€™m usually not tho, during quarantine we havenâ€™t been talking much so ðŸ˜—ðŸ”«). iâ€™ve also been tryin to fix my diet...and failing but what else is new. so yeah, in conclusion i feel sad and lonely and really want out of this house ðŸ™ƒ
