Day 36 of posting quotes from We Know The Devil until I get some fucking garlic bread. "Her stare is as quiet and black as the surface of the lake, like she's tempting us to drown. The only chill of summer is in that lake, and even in August, it still holds places we can freeze to death. Neptune reaches for us. She's a flood, of every wicked thought, and they are pouring out of her mouth." - Narration
