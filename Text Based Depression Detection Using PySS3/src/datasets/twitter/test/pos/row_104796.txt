I think i fu#ked it up Out of curiosity I downloaded the app called Tellonym.
I've noticed that my crush also has an account 
She already got questions about if she has a crush (which one of those posts she deleted shortly after I followed her,which said directly that she does have one) 
My curiosity got over me and I started to ask her questions in hope to find out if it's me or not.
I f#king over did it and I think she knows it's me now ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜« 
Man I want to hide in a hole now ;___;
Should I pretend at school that it wasn't me anyway .___.
