Okay joke (even if it's not funny) or nah? Okay so in my college dorm a lot of people have put little introductions about themselves on their doors so I decided to do the same but put my own little spin on it. So, being a massive dinosaur nerd, I made a joke version about me being a dinosaur (cringe I know but that was intentional). Now a lot of people have included some politically related thing in their introduction, namely the BLM movement, so, as a joke with no hard feelings intended, I put #Dinosaur Lives Matter at the bottom of mine. I put a picture of it on my Instagram to show my friends and while most of them found humor in it, one said that my "'joke' wasn't funny and is actually quite insensitive given the current climate in America." I should clarify that while I'm not super political I do support the Black Live Matter movement as I believe all humans should be treated equally. The #Dinosaur Lives Matter thing wasn't meant to mock the BLM movement, it was simply meant as a harmless piece of cringey humor. Now what do you guys think? Yay or nay? And if anyone's interested in seeing my "welcome sign" I may post it one here when self-post weekend is deactivated.
