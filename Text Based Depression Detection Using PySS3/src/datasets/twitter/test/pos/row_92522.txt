I became a proud fruit parent today :) Iâ€™ve been growing this banana tree for almost three years, and I found the first yield of bananas on it today. Growing this tree is the biggest accomplishment Iâ€™ve had in so long and I canâ€™t keep it to myself. I am a proud banana person! 
Also they are blue java bananas so they should turn blue on the outside once they get bigger which is pretty cool imao
