guys, I found the secret to adulthood. Nobody knows what they are doing. They can only act like they do but most of the time they are bullshiting their way through it. So donâ€™t sweat it. By the time you get there you still wonâ€™t know what to do, but neither will anyone else! And look at them, they seem to be fine.
