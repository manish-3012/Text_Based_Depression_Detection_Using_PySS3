Goodnight, world. Going to go hibernate in an industrial shipping crate. Here's what I need you to do. 

**Find your favorite inspirational quote, and then use Google Translate to translate it through like 500 different languages, and then back to English. Doesn't have to be an exact number. But make sure the quote is** ***just*** **mistranslated enough that some of the meaning gets lost in the gibberish when it's translated back to English. Whatever that advice is, no matter how stupid or incomprehensible it may be, I will follow that advice and tell you where it lead me at the end of the day. Goodnight &lt;3**
