I donâ€™t mind guests at the house I mean I donâ€™t see what the problem is. My parents donâ€™t often have guests but when they do theyâ€™re usually adults. I usually donâ€™t have a problem talking to adults because theyâ€™re much more easy to talk to and donâ€™t judge you as often as other teenagers.
