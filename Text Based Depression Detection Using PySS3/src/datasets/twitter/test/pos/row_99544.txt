I bought a new phone case and it's just a thin clear plastic one that looks just like my older one, but it's somehow easier to hold even tho it doesn't look like it is much thinner. My phone is a samsung note 20 ultra so it's pretty big and hard to hold xD ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤  ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤ ã…¤
