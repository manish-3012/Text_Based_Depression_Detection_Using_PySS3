Having problems with friends, need some help. I've been having problems with some friends over discord. TL;DR at the bottom.

So I play Minecraft on a server with friends. About a month ago, one of my very good friends (Let's call him H) burnt down another one of my other friend's (Let's call her L) wooden house with lava. H was one of my good friends, so I accepted his apology, however L didn't give a shit and banned him and some others who helped him.

So about 4 weeks go by. They've had the server white listed and, and it won't let me connect to it. (They've told me I'm white listed and I'm in 1.16.2 , which is the version the server runs on.) So I have been constantly trying to fix the problem and today I had a suspicion that they also changed the sever address.

So I go to ask L on discord; "Hey is there a new server address for the MC server? That might be the problem I'm having."

It took a bit, but then she said;

"SHUT UR MOUTH" in all caps.

Kinda hurt, cause she isn't really this mean to anyone else like this. After that I kinda just stayed quite and talked to H about it.

H told me that she's kinda selfish and that she's an attention seeker, which is why H torched her house in lava.

So know, I'm kinda at a crossroads between L and H. TBH, H is a better friend of mine, however I know lots of people in that Minecraft server.

I'm 85% sure it has to do with me still being friends with H, but she says that she doesn't hate me.

TL;DR: Friend is mad at other friend who burnt down her house in Minecraft and is mad that I'm still friends with them.

If you want some clarification, let me know.
