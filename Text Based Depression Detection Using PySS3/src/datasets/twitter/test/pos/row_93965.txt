Does anybody else think that when the so called "apocalypse" comes, it will actually be like really cool? Like I mean sure there's movies like The Road, Mad Max, and ofcourse the Fallout game series, and they all depict the post apocalypse like this hellish land full of anarchy and destruction and all that shit.

But could it be possible that it could turn to be like this cool and fun time where all these settlements are built and everyone is friendly with one another and everyone just has fun driving buggies and shit everywhere? Everyone adapting old world values with the new future sort of stuff like people converting skateboards into rocket boards or like electronic powered monster trucks or something like that.

Almost like as if it was like a Simpsons episode or something. I dunno, I guess I'm just trying to put a weird perspective into my head of what the future could possibly look like haha. Anyways.
