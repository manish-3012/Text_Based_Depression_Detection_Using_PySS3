My friends ran away and I feel like it's my fault One of my friends I've met through friends we've had our fights but in the end, we've made up. but recently I haven't been hanging out with the group cause I either was busy or can't go and I feel like it's my fault and I'm not thinking positive about this situation and I don't know what to do and my mental state has been down recently and this isn't really helping.
