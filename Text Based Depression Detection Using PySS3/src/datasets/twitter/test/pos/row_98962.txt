Imagine this okay It's 2 am. You are playing they are billions. A rts zombie survival game.

You go on YouTube and search up your favourite song.

You see it "panic in the pentagram by powerwolf"

You are ready to listen to the song and go back to the game as the finale wave is gonna hit. Thousands of zombies attacking, snipers in towers, huge machine gun turrets about to go online.

Then you get a fucking kids add and you have to stand there for 5 seconds. Your mood is ruined.

You press skip ad but it's over. You have no reason to live anymore and you give up.

You see your base get torn apart by the infected. You spent hours building it. Training units earning resources and it's over.

Ads suck
