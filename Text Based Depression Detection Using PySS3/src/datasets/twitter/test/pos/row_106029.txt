donâ€™t be an asshole in games So I played some ranked games today in a certain game, idk but I went with some really toxic people in my team. 
I got carried hard because Iâ€™m a shit player and I was told to kill myself because I made a bad play. After more rounds the opponent got a single win and the fucking ass decides to write a full paragraph on why Iâ€™m shit and me as a person donâ€™t deserve to live etc... now Iâ€™m really lucky that Iâ€™m a happy person and I donâ€™t take things like that to heart but by my judgement, a lot of people could. 
Telling someone to kill themselves is never okay. You donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re going through and they might actually do it, especially in games because a lot of people play to escape the ruthless world for once. In the end a life isnâ€™t worth any in game victory, donâ€™t be a dick guys if you donâ€™t have anything nice to say to your teammates just keep it to yourself.
