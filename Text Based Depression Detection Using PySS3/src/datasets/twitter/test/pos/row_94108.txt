I see you at the window sill
The rain, it won't stop, the air is so chill
I never heard the words you said
The phone, it can't ring if the heart is dead
You carry 'round your box of glass
With wings so sharp that they cut too fast
Riding when the sky comes down
Growing more cracks when you can't be found
I took your heart and made it mine
Do my best to justify, yeah
Call it pleasure but it feels like pain
So how we let it get this way?
Your broken heart was just like mine
We built these walls and hid inside 'em
I said I wouldn't let you in
And now you know I'm paper-thin
And now you know I'm paper-thin
And now you know I'm paper-thin
Maybe I'll just let you down
But look at those eyes, I'm thinking too loud
Maybe I'll just bide my time
So when it feels right, you can be mine
Didn't know it'd be so late
Drinking all night and numbing that shame
Guessing I'll be careful now
I'm holding your past, I'll carry you out
I took your heart and made it mine
Do my best to justify, yeah
Call it pleasure but it feels like pain
So how we let it get this way?
Your broken heart was just like mine
We built these walls and hid inside 'em
I said I wouldn't let you in
And now you know I'm paper-thin
And now you know I'm paper-thin
And now you know I'm paper-thin
Don't lie to us, don't lie to us
Don't hide from us
Or anything, or anyone
It would make me spend
And now you know I'm paper-thin
Don't lie to us, don't lie to us
Don't hide from us
Or anything, or anyone
It would make me spend
And now you know I'm paper-thin
Don't lie to us, don't lie to us
Don't hide from us
Or anything, or anyone
It would make me spend
And now you know I'm paper-thin
