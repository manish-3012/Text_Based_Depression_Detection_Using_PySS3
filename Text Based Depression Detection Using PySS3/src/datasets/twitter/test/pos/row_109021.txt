Hhhhhhhh im tired of this Trigger warning because i dont wanna hurt people or make them have a panic attack, this includes mention of self harm and other things that may possibly trigger someone



So this another self check because I havenâ€™t done one in like a while because i was doing perfectly fine. Key word was. Lets start with the first thing, i decided to harm myself because i was stressed and didnâ€™t talk to my parents about it. Second thing im tired of feeling like nothing. And when i try to talk to my ex about how i feel about what happened he just ignores it and talks about something else. Im tired, im so tired of pretending. Im tired of skipping lunch because i feel too sad or sick to eat. Im done im done with this stupid shit.
