Ive decided since i cant end it i may aswell help myself, so i need advice I have two problem.

1. Ive been dwelling on the simulation theory and thinking that everyone is AI while im the only person here,

So this is a massive problem as it's making it hard trying to help myself when i feel like it's pointless and the simulation theory makes it worse, i dont like the idea of living in a simulated world where im the only real person, if i were AI myself then i would be fine or if this world isnt simulated, i would be fine but you cant prove it's not a simulated world so i just want to remove this theory from my thoughts and life.

2. Love and the forbidden horny,

So ive been hating these emotions and it because i feel disgusting meaing horny and i feel terrible feeling love as i thiink ill form an unhealthy obsession to the person, im afraid that these two emotions will control me and that feeling horny feel wrong, im a male and i hate the stereotypes that male think about sex most of the time or can talk about boobs for an hour, i hate it, i dont want to be perceive that way yet the world enjoys it and i feel like im being left out.

Two of my friends and one of them i was interested in were talking about going to a cabin with a person of their choice and doing with the person of their choice and it destroyed me, i hate feeling jealousy or anything related to relationship yet i dont feel normal, i have desires for wanting to do it wiith someone and im fine with that but i hate how people make music of it like wap or talk about casually, i hate it that it bothers me.

Ok well im going to go on a walk so that all i can write and ill look at the post when im back.

Please help.
