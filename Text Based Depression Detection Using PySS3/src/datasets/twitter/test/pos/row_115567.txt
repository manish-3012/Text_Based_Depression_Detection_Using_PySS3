[US teens 16+] Did you know if you can't vote there is a good chance you can still contribute to democracy by working the polls and get paid in the process! Check out the links below to see if you qualify. It's a great way to pick up chicks if you know what I mean, wink wink, chickens are great! 1. Research your state to see how old you have to be to qualify. I suggest you look deeper then the first answer as many states have student work programs that don't initially show up. This is a great place to start but again you will have to check on your state website if you're under 18: [https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac\_assets/1/28/Compendium.2016.pdf](https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/eac_assets/1/28/Compendium.2016.pdf)
2. Ounce you know if you qualify use this website to get in contact with the right people for your area: [https://www.powerthepolls.org/](https://www.powerthepolls.org/)

That's it! You've contributed to democracy and you're an A+ citizen. Congratulations!
