I embarrassed myself in a zoom call So I was in a PAP Algebra zoom call, where a bunch of kids a year older than me were having class on campus. I watch a lot of anime, so I was singing japanese openings, and then I realized that I wasn't muted. I heard everyone in the class starting to laugh, and I was confused af. Then I realized that I wasn't muted, and everyone in the class heard my horrible voice. I left the zoom call immediately, and I told my mom about it, and she told me to join it again. I agreed, but I really hope no one thought it was me.
