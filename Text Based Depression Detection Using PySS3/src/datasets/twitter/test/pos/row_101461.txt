I hate homeschool ive been doing it before covid, the first year was fine, but after that its just absolute shit, it never explains anything correctly and its such a poorly made app they use, i want to actually learn and have a real teacher and attempt socializing, but my mom says i cant go to real school, so yea, just wanted to share
