Private maths lesson but very awkward So I was in my weekly private lessons and the teacher was fairly new so It was only me, a kid, and him in an apartment so I started some problems or something I don't remember and I shit you not his neighbours just wouldn't stop going at it. The moment they started we all just kinda looked at the ceiling for a few seconds then we both went on doing the work but with an extra pinch of akwardness.
