The Star Safari Song â€œThe eyes of the scorpion are red
The wings of the eagle are spread,
The eyes of the puppy are blue
The snake of light is coiled up tight
Â 
Orion is singing up high
Sending down dew and frost,
The clouds of Andromeda
Are in the shape of a fish's mouth
Â 
When big bear extends his leg
For the fifth time to the north
Just above the forehead of little bear
Is where our star safari headsâ€

Excerpt from
Night on the Milky Way Railway
Kenji Miyazawa

PS: night on the Milky Way railway (which goes by other names as well) is my favorite book
