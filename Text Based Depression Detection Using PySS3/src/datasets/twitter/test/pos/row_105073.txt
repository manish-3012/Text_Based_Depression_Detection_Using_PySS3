Anybody else just feel really ashamed? Goddamn I keep thinking of all the stupid shit I've done over the past few years. I feel like the guilt is weighing me down. I just can't get over everything I've done and it's just like... haunting me? That seems like an extreme way to put it, but it's also kind of right. There is so much stuff I feel horrible about doing that I'm just constantly reminded of. And it's not even stuff that's that bad, it's just that culmination of all those things and my self awareness as I accidentally do them every so often. It's getting harder to sleep at night. God I'm 17 and feel like crying at work right now.
