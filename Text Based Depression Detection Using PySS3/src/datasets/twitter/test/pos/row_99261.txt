Best imposter play I wanted to see how dumb my teammates could be so I said white vented, white got voted out.
Surprisingly no one voted me out. Confirm ejects were on btw! 

Next round I called emergency and said â€˜orange said white vented but he lied so it must be orangeâ€™ for some fucking reason everyone believed me. 2 ppl were saying scroll up to prove I made it all up but no one did? 

Next round I killed someone and self reported and pinned it on one of the other guys remaining. He got voted out and yeah... if you get a good lobby you can be the worst imposter ever and win lol
