examples of why talking to my family is so stressful Mom: â€œcan you make a side to go with the wings for dinner?â€ 
Me: â€œyes I can.â€
Mom: â€œare you ever going to eat the leftover macaroni thatâ€™s in the fridge?â€ 
Me: â€œcan I have the macaroni with the wings?â€
Mom: â€œI was asking you to make a side for EVERYONE to go with the wings.â€
Me: â€œyes. Can I eat my macaroni with the wings though?â€
Mom: â€œI WANT YOU TO MAKE A SIDEE FOR EVERYONEE FOR DINNERR.â€ 
Me: â€œyes I know. Iâ€™m just asking if I can eat the macaroni too with it.â€ 
I walk away
Dad: â€œwhy do you ask so many questionsâ€
me to myself â€˜cuz I donâ€™t understand yâ€™all lol I just wanted to know if I can eat my maccy with the wingsâ€™
Me: â€œI never said I wasnâ€™t going to make a side everyone makes things so complicated :(â€œ 


My sister: â€œcan you help me with something?â€
Me: comes over and starts helping 
My sister: gets mad and pushes or disagrees when I trying to help her 
Me: â€œI donâ€™t want to help you if you ask me for help and then get mad at me for helping :/â€œ
