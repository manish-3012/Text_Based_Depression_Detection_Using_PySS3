A boner does not count as consent Hey guys, only sister of 6 brothers here. Yes, sometimes a boner can mean its horny time but most of the time it just happens because it does, no bad thoughts or bad intentions. I've been living in a house full of boys for 16 years and they get random boners all the time, not because it's horny time but just because its what a dudes body does. So ladies, if you want to have sex with a guy, and he doesn't want to but has a boner do not take that as a que to keep going. He's not playing hard to get, the boner does not mean he wants to and if he tells you no, no means no just as much for guys as it does for girls.

Thank you for coming to my Ted talk
