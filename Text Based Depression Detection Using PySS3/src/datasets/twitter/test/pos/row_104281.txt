Stop crying about wholesome awards The entire thing with wholesome awards is basically: Somebody gives a wholesome award to a serious post --&gt; people in the comments start complaining about it --&gt; people start giving more wholesome awards --&gt; the person who made the posts notices it too and makes an edit --&gt; the post gets spammed with wholesome awards and everybody forgets about the post and just starts complaining about the wholesome awards --&gt; Everybody forgets it ever happened --&gt; A new post is made and the cycle repets. 

 Just stop giving them attention. Some wholesome awards are given to show kindness and the person who gave the award did not have enough money to award a different one. When you give attention the wholesome award trolls see that it annoys you and they start giving more.

You threw hay at a small fire so it\`s your fault that the house burned down not the fires.
