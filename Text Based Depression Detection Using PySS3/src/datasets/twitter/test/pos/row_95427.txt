How do I convince my girlfriend that sheâ€™s not a burden? Iâ€™ve been dating my gf for about 10 months now, and I really love her. Sheâ€™s incredible and I love every moment I get to spend with her. 

Unfortunately, sheâ€™s dealt with some things in her life that have led to her being pretty emotionally reserved and not very open. Sheâ€™s told me before that sheâ€™s told me more about herself than sheâ€™s told anyone else. Every time sheâ€™s said this, I tell her how much I appreciate her trust and that if sheâ€™s ever uncomfortable sharing something, she doesnâ€™t have to. I can tell that sheâ€™s willing to open up to me, but thereâ€™s something stopping her, and sheâ€™s mentioned once or twice in the past that she doesnâ€™t want to inconvenience me by putting all of her baggage onto me (not exact words) and that she doesnâ€™t want to cause me any problems. Iâ€™ve told her that itâ€™s not a problem and that sheâ€™s not a burden, but she still holds back.

What can I do to make her understand that sheâ€™s not a burden and that I want to do everything I can to help her?
