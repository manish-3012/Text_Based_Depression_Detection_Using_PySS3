apartment fire not. also bad My apartment's fire alarm just went off and Im locked out of my room. It was 40 degrees and we had to wait 30 minutes for the firemen to show up (to the wrong building) and then realize that the door to my bedroom somehow locked itself with the key inside.

The leasing office opens in 2 hours until then Im stuck on the couch :| 

Also there was no fire
