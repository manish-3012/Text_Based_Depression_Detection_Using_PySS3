The damn doc is broke Fuckkkkkk  man I hate how Google classroom and shit like that doesn't have any damn support for Microsoft anything. Oh you want to hand something in, really well just read thru 35 DIFFRENT FUCKING VERSIONS AND HAND IN THE WRONG ONE. Fuuuuuuck I hate that shit. And then my introverted ass has to talk awkwardly to the teacher why I handed in an incomplete assignment. Like whÃ½yyyyyyyyyyyyy does google not have any support for fuckimg Microsoft. 

I'm done now.
