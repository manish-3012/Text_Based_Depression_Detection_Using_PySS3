Women really be putting other women down for some pretty ass reasons Another post after post nut clarity 

Now I might be a lil bit of an ease dropper but really tho most of the time I over hear a conversation with a group of women it's almost always shot talking there friend or talking about how fake of a body they have like damn here u thought women out here really for body positivity but out here shaming other women for wearing revealing clothing for example brittany venti I watched her video on anisa johma and the video was basically shaming her for her past of tity streaming but brittany is very hypocritical considering the fact she did tity streaming but now that she's anti porn and all that jazz she feels the need to put down other women for what she used to do, she also felt the need to bring up the fact that anissa might be using push up bras but brittany dosent cause she's naturally curvy like why would you need to bring that up oh and if you wear a bikini well apparently if it's not artistic or sumn shit you're producing soft core porn, and she really has this obsession with pokimane she literally went after her looks because she may or may not use photoshop and then says she has insecurities and what really gripes me is that somehow if you're somewhat attractive woman who streams well you're fanbase are only Simps as if a man can't simply enjoy a female streamer I get what she's done in the past might've been shitty but come on and yeah there are times where she poses provocatively but if you think about it why wouldn't she l, she's attractive and has a nice figure why wouldn't she use her body to her advantage 

So thank you for listening to my rant
