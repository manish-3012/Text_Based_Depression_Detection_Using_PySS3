The killing of the 5 year old Cannon Hinnant isnâ€™t comparable to George Floyd or Brianna Taylor I woke up today to find posts everywhere about this murder and I just want to say that Iâ€™m really sorry for the familyâ€™s loss and I hope the murderer rots in prison/hell. But, I disagree with everyone comparing this to the killing of George Floyd. Those murders are completely different and shouldnâ€™t be compared. One was racially motivated by someone whoâ€™s job is to protect the American people while the other was a crazy man killing a little boy. The murder of Cannon Hinnant was terrible but it in no way should be used as a way to discredit BLM in any way. The only reason this murder was a big deal is because it was the most recent Black on White murder so anti-BLM people could exploit it. If this was a black on black murder nobody would be talking about it at all. There are plenty of murders not talked about on the news, this is completely normal.
