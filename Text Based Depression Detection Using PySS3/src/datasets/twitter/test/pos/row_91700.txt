The French government is fucking stupid So a few days ago the French president decided to te-confine the country so, he closed unnecessary business, and then he made a speech about how we need to protect kids and teenagers cause they are the ones that spread most of the cases, so after that you come to the conclusion that â€œoh yeah close the schools since kids are spreading the virusâ€ but this dumb ass decided TO FUKING LEAVE THEM OPEN. And oh you might say â€œ oh but what happens if the parents canâ€™t take care of their children, 
1. What does that say about people? That they canâ€™t take care of their own children, that they just throw them into school for the whole day or get rid of them?
2. Ok sure if parents canâ€™t take care of their kids then they need to go to school but what about 5th grade and above I know that I can take care of myself so why canâ€™t they close 5th grade and above? 

Yeah as you can tell I am very mad about this give me your opinions about this.
