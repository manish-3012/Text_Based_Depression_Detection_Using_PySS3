Insecurities In that era, specially for teens, insecurities start to build up more and more. I'm a 17f, medium-pretty if I may say so, my face from the front is nice but side profile very bad, anyways that's not the point bcs if I had the count my insecurities, it's endless. But one of my main insecurities is my butt (I do have a small waist but no wide hips), I'm flat if I were to wear jeans or whatever, with leggings it's fine ig. With being flat comes boney ass, and I'm worried that whenever I get boyfriend (never had one) I'd be too insecure to sit on his lap and be cute or whatever. 
So question for the boys: If you ever liked a girl, since y'all start with her body, and ended being together like is that a big deal? Idk how to ask this but hopefully y'all got the point.
