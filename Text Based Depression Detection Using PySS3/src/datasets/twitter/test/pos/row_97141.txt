I feel really bad for my PE teachers They canâ€™t easily teach PE over lockdown and have had lots of hate from the kids who just want to skive off school. Theyâ€™ve even made a  YouTube channelâ€LRGS PEâ€ and I thought they would feel happier if some people went and showed them some love.
Stay safe, bye
