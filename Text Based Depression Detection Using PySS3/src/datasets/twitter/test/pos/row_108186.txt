I know this is kinda stupid lmao but I'm a little scared... Girl Issues Up ahead:


So i'm 13, and recently all of my friends have been getting their periods. I'm actually the oldest out of all my friends with most of them being 12 or some 11, and i'm a little nervous because I don't want to feel left out just because I don't have it yet. I know I should feel lucky because I don't have it yet, but I can't help feeling left out because everyone I know already has their period. I've also been reading lots of online blogs, and i'm scared I won't have my period until i'm like 18, which is a little weird but the blogs all talk about how like they had some sort of disease or medical issue to why they got their periods late, and I'm a bit scared. I know this is kind of silly, But like i don't really know what to do.
