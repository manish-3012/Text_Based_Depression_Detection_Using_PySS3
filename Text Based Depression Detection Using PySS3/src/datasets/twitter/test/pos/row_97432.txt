i hate myself so much (Tw!!)  i hate myself so much iâ€™m a failure of a person iâ€™m not even pretty so i have no right to be so stupid i donâ€™t ever wanna grow up everything feels like a video game i donâ€™t feel like myself everything feels fake and i just wanna run away and escape, i always feel numb and dead but my mind is racing all the time it never stops, and everybody hates me and iâ€™m always so sad so my friends probably hate me too, i never can grow up iâ€™m currently eating shaving cream and trying to make every part of me bleed because my whole arm has been taken up by scars, thereâ€™s no hope for me and i donâ€™t know what to do i really wanna die
