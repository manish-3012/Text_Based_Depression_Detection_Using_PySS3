Something weird happening I may have discovered the weirdest yet dumbest thing about myself today

I was taking a nap before I went back into class ,(I barely had any sleep don't you dare judge me) and I had a certain dream in said nap

I was in a dream somewhere with someone going somewhere, and then I saw a big bird in the distance, it looked like an emu, but then it turned to me, and it ran to me, and just before I made contact I woke up in a fricking panic, and I felt the biggest pit in my stomach

At first I was confused but went back to my nap (I don't know why either) and had another dream with the same creature from hell, and it repeated the same cycle and woke up with the same results

I legitimately don't know why that happened, I don't know what was that about, it's not even that I have a fear of big braids or emu's, I DON'T EVEN LIVE OR HAVE EVER BEEN TO AUSTRALIA! 

Someone please help me I am having a crisis of some kind and I don't even know why this happened in the first place, but I might not look at emu's the same for a while ;-;
