Iâ€™ve been slowly and steadily falling into depression recently Iâ€™ve finally got the motivation to go for a bike ride at night, I feel a bit better now like Iâ€™m doing something but I know itâ€™s gonna take more than just this, I used to run miles during the morning, afternoon and nighttime, I wanna try my best to do that again just to put my energy into something, hopefully hunting/coyote mating season doesnâ€™t stop me lol :)
