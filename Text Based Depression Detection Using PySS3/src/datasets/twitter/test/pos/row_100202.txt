We need a name for this type of person: So you know those popular girls that go up to the â€œquiet/ weird kidsâ€. And theyâ€™re not really weird, they just donâ€™t talk a lot. And theyâ€™re like â€œOMG hey bestie ðŸ¤ªðŸ¥ºâ€. But theyâ€™re not actually trying to be ur friend. Theyâ€™re just.... honestly I donâ€™t even know what their motives are. Maybe to make themselves look good??
