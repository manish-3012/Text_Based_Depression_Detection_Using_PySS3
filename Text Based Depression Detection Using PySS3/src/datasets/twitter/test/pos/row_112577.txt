I took a nap and now my parents think that I do drugs The situation:
Yesterday I got to bed too late and slept for like ~5 hours. Today when I got home from school, I immediately got to bed and fell asleep. When I woke up it was evening. Parents took me to kitchen and we sat to talk. Uh. They started to accuse me for doing drugs. I was shocked. I had nothing to say. They took my phone and started to read my PMs. Then we went to my room and started to look over my stuff. They found a pen case and said that i could use it for sniffing drugs. I don't even know why I didn't throw the broken pen away. Their main accusation was - "Your grades went down last month and you never acted like this (What? Going to bed to take a nap is a weird thing? Maybe thats because I've been doing my homework till 2am?!)".

Even though they found nothing in my stuff and in my phone, they still don't believe me. What the hell do I do?
