I fucking created a mommy gf inside my head Yeah, I'm down bad.

I was speaking with my friend the other day, and somehow the topic of my mom came up and when I was speaking with him, at the end of it all he ended up telling me that he thinks I have mommy issues (think daddy issues, but mother-son relationship). So I think "Well's that odd, I have a good relationship with my mother" until I realized that other people don't have to hide what they have to say from their mom because of her anger issues. So I was like alright, I'll go see what all this mommy gf stuff is all about, and it was all very nice. I don't think I've ever heard my mom say that she was proud of me or anything like a mommy gf would say. I ended up sleeping it off and I was resting my eyes, I spoke to myself in my head in a feminine voice saying stuff like "Oh I'm so proud of you baby" "Mommy's proud of you" "You're my baby". Writing all this out makes me wish I hadn't, but it's too late to go back. Now gamers, what do I exactly do in this situation? I'm not crazy, am I?
