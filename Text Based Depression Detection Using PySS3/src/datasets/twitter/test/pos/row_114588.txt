I deel betrayed I have 2 best friends and one of them is a girl and the other a guy I know the guy since elementary school and the girl about 6 years and have had a relationship with her when we broke up me and a friend of her were crushing on each other and she wasn't happy about it she manipulated her friend into never talking to me again 
and me an my friend didn't talk for a while but in lockdown we started gaming together enter my other best friend they were pretty good friends right away
At a moment they were gaming more with each other then there combined times with me and I found out she likes him but I have a feeling she is using him to get back at me 
What should I do?
