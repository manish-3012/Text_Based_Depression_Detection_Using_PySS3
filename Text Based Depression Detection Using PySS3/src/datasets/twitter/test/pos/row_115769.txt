is anyone else disappointed in the new animal crossing? it just doesn't feel like animal crossing

they removed all the shops, mini games and NPCs

the villagers are boring and they all say the same 3 things

THE MUSIC SUCKS ASS OH MY GOD IT'S SO BAD I HATE IT SO MUCH AHAGAHAHAH

I wish they just made new leaf for the switch
