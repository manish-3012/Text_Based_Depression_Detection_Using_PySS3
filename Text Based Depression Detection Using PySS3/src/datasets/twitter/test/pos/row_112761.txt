hey guys i need some help figuring what iâ€™m gonna do the rest of my life    So basically all my life i wanted to become a doctor, but now i finally have a choice if i do want to become one. The main reason i think iâ€™ve wanted to become a doctor was because my sister wanted to be one and i always wanted to compete against her. iâ€™m taking a course for like a medicine and i just found out that i donâ€™t think being a doctor is for me. my parents told me itâ€™s okay if i donâ€™t want to be one and iâ€™ve always had an interest for being an engineer, what do i do? please i need help
