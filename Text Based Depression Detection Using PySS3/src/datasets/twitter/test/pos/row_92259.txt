So, about reddit hate... People hate on reddit like it's the first of it's kind, like it was birthed by 4Chan or something, even though all the "wrong" things that reddit has done, were either jokes, trolling or simply dumb, at first I thought it got hated on because of it's features (auto removal of posts and all that, even though this happens on every SM site), then it turned into hate on the people using reddit, then I was like wtf, why are redditors considered children of the devil now ? Trolls ? Pedophiles ? Incels ? Normies ? Those kinds of people exist on the internet as a whole, not just reddit or mostly reddit, and I'm not defending reddit here, there are/were some pretty fucking shitty humans on this site (*cough* *cough* CarlH *cough*), but that's the same thing for every other SM site, now every other SM site shits, snd I mean *S H I T S* on reddit for being a bad SM site, even people who use reddit regularly do the same thing, so, grab a big wooden cross and some nails, but at least tell me, why has the internet as a whole decided to collectively shit, piss and cum on this site ?
