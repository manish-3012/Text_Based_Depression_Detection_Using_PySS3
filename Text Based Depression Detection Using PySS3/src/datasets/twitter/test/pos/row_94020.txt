I caused a fight in the class groupchat So i posted this before but didnt explain what happened. Some alt girl in my old class posted on Instagram how she hates superstraight people, i commented on that that i were â€œâœ¨superstraightâœ¨â€ and proud as a joke and that it would be hypocritical if she would hate on it.

Eventually there was a fight with her and all the guys and she called everyone transphobic because we prefer a girl that has always been a girl, it went on for hours and eventually I dissapeared.

*no i dont hate lgtbq

*yes i would only date a girl that has always been a girl since birth

*cant cancel me if i dont care
