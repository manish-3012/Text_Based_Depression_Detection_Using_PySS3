Rate/ Finnish by Edgar Allen Poe inspired poem for English class I had to write a poem about a parrot that's similar to "The Raven" by Edgar Allen Poe but idk how to finnish it. (I need 2 more stanzas with 4-6 lines each)

[Stanza 1]

Once upon a lofty journey, there was a pirate sick with scurvy.

He led a crew of the poorest goons, for they had lost their gold and all thier doubloons.

As the captain lay sleeping and slacking, he was awakened by creaking and cracking--

As his men entered his cabin, he assumed it was an attacker

Until he heard "Polly wants a cracker."

[Stanza 2]

He saw his prized parrot perched proudly upon his private's shoulder and promptly fed the bird.

Now that Polly had no hunger, the captain returned to his slumber and dreamt of something absurd.

He imagined an island full of treasure and riches for him and his crew to gather.

They filled their chests and britches and their pockets grew fatter and fatter.

To the captain's displeasure, he awoke once more, to the familiar sound of fluttering feather.

Then he heard, "Polly wants a cracker."

[Stanza 3]

He fed the bird again, hoping the interruptions would cease

But then Polly squawked "Give me one more piece!"

The pirate gave into the bird's command, hoping they would quickly find land--

For they were low on food and night time was coming soon.

As the captain's eyes grew heavy and the sky became blacker 

Once again he heard, "Polly wants a cracker."
