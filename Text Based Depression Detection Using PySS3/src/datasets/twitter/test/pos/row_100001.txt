Hey guys can you tell me something. [My story update.](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/j8sbte/hey_all_heres_an_update_to_my_previous_story/)

On my story update I said how my mom might make me ride my bike 1.8 miles to school or walk it. The user u/Astronius said  that  is  illegal  and  i  should  call  CPS/Police.  I  said  if  she  makes  me  do  it  i  will  call/email  my  school  counselor.

is this the right thing to do?
