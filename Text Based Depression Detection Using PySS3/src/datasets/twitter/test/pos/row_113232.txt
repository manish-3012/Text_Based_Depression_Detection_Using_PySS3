Iâ€™m tired of the proud boys fad Half of my Reddit feed for the las three days has been nothing but gay couples with the caption â€œproud boys.

Yeah yeah gay pride whatever, Iâ€™m not comfortable with my sexuality being used as a joke about a certain group that people are making fun of. Being gay isnâ€™t an insult. My sexuality isnâ€™t a token for you to throw at others to make them feel bad.
