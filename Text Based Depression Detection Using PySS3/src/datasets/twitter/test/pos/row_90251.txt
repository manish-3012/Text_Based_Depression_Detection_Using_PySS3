Opening up about childhood trauma. A therapist recommended opening up about my trauma, and since i cant do that with my friend rn, i think i should do it here. Just.. Getting it off my chest. Trigger warning: violence,  trauma, and incredibly sensitive topics ahead.

Ill go by a list since i dont know what else to do

1: ive seen my siblings get beaten to the ground by loved ones

2: ive had books and soiled diapers thrown at me

3: from the ages of 9-12 i was taught to fear my eldest brother because he has a porn addiction and my family thought he would try to do something with me, his little sister

4: i lost my dad at the age of 13

5: my mom told me everything from financial situations to a lot of personal stuff from a young age

6: CPS was in my familys life many times bc my second brother tried to frame my grandpa for a black eye he got

7: ive had severe medical issues that mafe me the target for bullying my whole life

8: my parents didnt think something was wrong with me until i had x rays done, my father still didnt believe me

9: i had no friends until i was 13

10: my family constantly made me feel bad for my body, to the point where if i go in public without a corset on i feel horrible

9: my mom still throws things in the house and when i tried to inform my brother about the riots going on, i got humiliated and was thrown into a panic attack. My mom is very conservative and screamed at me that "i wont spout that rhetoric in her house" and "i want my family dead" for context i have cops in my family. I was so scared i ended up pissing myself for rhe first time in over a year (part of the medical thing; i was really proud of my over a year mark because of my issues)

Theres a lot more but my brains too full to think of them right now. Im sorry if this is a lot. I just think i need to get it out there since i have no one rn to speak about it with. If you got this far, i hope you have a blessed night
