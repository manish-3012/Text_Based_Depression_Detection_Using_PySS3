What is the superior and worse eye colour in your opinion? In my opinion, light green is the best one. It's very beautiful. But blue with orange speckles look amazing too. The eyes I have are the worse imo. They're dark brown with a very dark olive colour around it. So I just look dead. Red Albino eyes also kinda look cool but I wouldn't want to have them. What is you guy's opinion?
