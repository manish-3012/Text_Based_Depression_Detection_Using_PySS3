I literally want to cry. My daily life #34 First ,about the day. I completed lvl 12 of geometry dash within 1000 attempts. And I completed lvl 11 with 2.5k attempts. Can't understand whether I am good or bad at this game.  


Then as usual I studied , but not as much as other days. after that dinner and the day over.  


Now the title describes my night. I felt lonely. Just lonely. The one thing I want is a hug for that \*frickin\* loneliness. I used two blankets. One for my body , and other as a replica of a human being and squeezing it so tightly it felt like a hug (somewhat).

Anyways all things aside. Hope you have a good day and cya.
