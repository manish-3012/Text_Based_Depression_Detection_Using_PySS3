For those who dont understand discord calls late at night It is a back and forth of jokes, inside jokes, relaxed political discussions, random bullshit that makes you laugh, and taking crap about that one friend that you all love. Besides the, "we've been talking for so long" and the  "i wish we could meet up :(" its all fun and games.
