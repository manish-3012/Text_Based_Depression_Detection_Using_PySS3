LGBTP+ not LGBT+ Pedophilia is born not acquired (links below). In other words, a pedophile doesn't CHOOSE to be as is. We should accept pedophiles for who they are. The same way we accept LGBT+ community. We must help them control their urges, and not act on them. But that's exactly the opposite of what society is doing rn.

The constant shaming of pedophiles reminds us of the constant shaming of homosexuals a 100 years ago. I think we learned from our mistakes...

Note that pedophiles aren't a sort of monsters, we're the ones who create monsters from them. Being a pedophile doesn't make one bad, one is just suffering from a genetic disorder. We don't shame people having genetic problems... Or do we?!

It's time for us to help pedophiles overcome their fears, problems, and especially society.
