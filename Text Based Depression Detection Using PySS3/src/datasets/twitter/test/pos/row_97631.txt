I have a dilemma I am very confused whether to drop out of highschool when I go into it this year and start working and invest my money when I get my paychecks and my dads money he saves. I donâ€™t really want education, I am good at it but I donâ€™t enjoy it much. I think I would be a good investor since I predicted GME when it was still 17, I asked my dad a lot to buy it when it was still low, I then asked him again when it was 40 and then again when it was 120. I could tell he listened to me a lot more after that, I then told him to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum when it low and sell it high, I couldâ€™ve earned 900 in 1 day that day. I am not mad at him at all, I respect him and heâ€™s a pretty good investor but there feels like thereâ€™s a lot chances for us to be rich. Thatâ€™s why I think it would be a good idea to drop out and invest and become pretty rich with minimal work and I want to hear you opinions and before you say â€œoh but u just predicted 2â€ I did just predict 2 which were huge ones and Iâ€™ve predicted smaller ones and gotten pretty close to being exactly right.
