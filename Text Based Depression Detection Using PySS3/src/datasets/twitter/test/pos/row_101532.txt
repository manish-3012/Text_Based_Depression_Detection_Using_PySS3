I need some help with getting my boyfriend out of the pits of despair So my boyfriend (R) never looks highly of himself but recently he's gotten worse and worse, I can't keep up but I know that there are kind-hearted people here that care about everyone, and by worse I mean at first he would say things like "You're too good for me" and "I don't deserve you" but in the last few days He's said things like "I'm absolute trash", "Go on and leave me, I'm no good", and "I'm nothing, lower than the dirt you walk on". he doesn't think people will care about him, help me prove him wrong, please.
