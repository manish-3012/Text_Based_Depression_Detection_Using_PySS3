hey guys something unfair happened. so basically my aunt came into my house from another city a week ago and today i was using the computer and says "bring my bags upstairs" i softly said after two minutes and she didn't hear me and i continued and she started scolding me and i was like what . she turned off my pc and started scolding even more after all that i apologized and she still didn't accept it.later on my sisters where like we got 50 dollars each and my other sister got 100 dollars for her birthday which is in 27th august.

My oldest sister said if you didn't misbehave you would have gotten it . I didn't even say anything to her later on i got mad and started writing this.And look my aunt is like in her 50s. Thanks for reading.
