my lack of social skills and possibly being unable to watch one of my favorite youtubers due to embarasseD so i DMed this youtuber bc i like the way he edits his videos and he's pretty small (like 30k subs and 2.5k followers), so the chances of him actually responding were pretty good, and oH mY fUcKiNg GoD that had to be one of the most awkward conversations i've ever had (and i've had plenty of uncomfortable convos). so i asked wut he uses to edit, he told me, i made a joke being like "my 6 year old macbook can't handle that lmao" and he liked the message and didn't respond. i texted my friend and complained about my lacking social skills, and i told her about it, so i showed her his channel and she asked how old he was (which is fair, he has that vibe going where u can't tell if he's 13 or 16), and i was like "idk i'll ask ig" so like an hour after the last DM i did the good old "idk how to not sound like a stalker while asking this but how old r u" and he replied with his age and was polite and everything but i'm pretty sure he thought i was a psycho fangirl (i am in fact a dude) and i feel rlly awkward about the whole thing,, im v sry for wasting ur time if u read this whole thing lmao
