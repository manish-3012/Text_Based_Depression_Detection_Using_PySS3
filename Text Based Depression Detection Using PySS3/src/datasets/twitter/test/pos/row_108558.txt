I just got rejected like a piece of shit Just to put you in context I'm 17 still in high school (senior), so I had a crush on this girl for about a year and we were talking for the past 3 months, I decided to ask her out on a date but not in boring bland way. so i payed an indian guy on fiverr to ask her to go out on a date with me while holding a distorted picture of me in his hands and doing a fortnite dance. She replied "thats very funny but i cant answer that question" like bruh.
give me advice to clear my mind and chill.
