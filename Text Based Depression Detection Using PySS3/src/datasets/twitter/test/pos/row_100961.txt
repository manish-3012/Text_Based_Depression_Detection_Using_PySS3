i am pretty sad she made me feel appreciated she made me happy she made me feel like it was worth it
idk y she decided to do that but i cant change it

i looked forward to seeing her everyday 

now its torture when i see her face

the best things remind me of her

cus thats what she was to me

being around her made me 10x happier

it wasnt long but it was enough to be

attached maybe in love maybe next year ill find the one

but for now ill lay thinking about what went wrong
