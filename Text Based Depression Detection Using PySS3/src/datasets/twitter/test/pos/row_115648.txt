Rest In Peace Nye Newman (aka Nye Brewman) On this day 4 years ago we lost you at the young age of 17. You inspired so many others, including me, to do parkour. You were an amazing teacher and an amazing kid and weâ€™re all hurting without you here. Thank you for all the happiness you brought us in your 17 years here. Until we meet again bro âœŠðŸ»
