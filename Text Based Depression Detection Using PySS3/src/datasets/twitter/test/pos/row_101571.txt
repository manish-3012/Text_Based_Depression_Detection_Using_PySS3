HOW TO: Disclose sad/terrible information in a casual conversation. **This short guide will help you become more socially inclined so pay attention.**

*two people see each other during the schoolday

"hey! how's it going?"

"Terrible. My dad has the flu and I threw up today"

"Aww well I hope things gets better for you" :/

"It won't. My dad is immuno-compromised plus my mom has stage 40 cancer and only has 1 day to live"

"Oh.. umm.."

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ STOP ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

This is a no no in conversation. Let's talk about it. I'm sure that everyone has at least witnessed this sort of situation at some point and I consider it to be a faux pas in conversation.

The main thing you have to realize is that this conversation was meant to be a casual greeting. One of those 'see someone in the hallway; say hi as you pass' or 'have a short conversation in class' sort of deals.

Now of course I feel bad for person B. I mean their mom has stage 40 cancer, but person A didn't sign up for all of that baggage to be put on them. What if they have baggage themselves and can't handle all of that extra?

 When someone is feeling down, it's generally nice to give an optimistic comment or two to cheer them up, but person A has been put in a corner where they can't do that. They pretty much have to say something along the lines of "I'm sorry for your loss." - which chances are will ruin their mood for the rest of the day. 

Another big thing to consider is that person A did not sign up for person B's story. If person A went up to person B and said something like "hey I've noticed you've been down recently, what's up?" Then person B could have unloaded because A was prepared. 

**TL;DR:** as person B, don't corner someone in conversation and don't unexpectedly give them terrible news. Prepare them, or give them an 'out' in case they aren't up for it!

â­â­BETTER WAYâ­â­

"Hey! How's it going?"

"Terrible."

[Person A can then respond with:]

"Aww that's not good :/ well I hope things get better."
(Notice how they didn't specifically ask why and it would be acceptable for the convo to end here)
[Person B SHOULD NOT deny A's statement and say "it won't" - effectively cornering person A]

Or

"Aww that's not good :/ what happened?"
(They are now prepared. Have shown interest in whats wrong. Conversation will continue)

"Terrible"

"Well I hope things get better for you"

"They won't. [Says terrible story]"

"Well I can still hope right? Even if things are looking down right now, they'll get better. Trust me. Hey I'll see you later, ok?"
