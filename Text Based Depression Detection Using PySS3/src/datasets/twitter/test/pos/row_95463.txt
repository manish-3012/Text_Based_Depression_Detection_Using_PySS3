Ive had a awful few days and i need to rant. Please no joking.

Ive had almost no sleep, laying up till 3-4 AM every Night filled with anxiety and having an exstistential Crisis.

Ive lost all hope for everything, im tired, really, Ive had roughly 4 hours of sleep or less these last 3 days.

Im feeling kinda depressed ngl, im overthinking everything, and starting to having mild Impostor syndrome (please no Among us jokes, and im not diagnosed with anything, this is just my Personal feelings)
