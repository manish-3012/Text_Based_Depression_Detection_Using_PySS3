So I took a nap. Fist nap I've taken in months because I'm not much of a nap person. Then out of no where I remembered the lyrics to this really sad song from a video I watched when I was like twelve. And then a floodgates of memories of what I watched back then and all the cool stuff I watched came back to me. And IT HIT HARD. I almost cried. Now I kinda wanna re-watch all that stuff just for nostalgia sake
