I'm currently making a playlist and need your help Spotify link: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1bUrx7Pz7itCjtf9BPzOyn?si=APLOomR1SHWcooZspzFT7A

It's a playlist with some good beats for gaming. Do you have any recommendations on what to add? The best would be English songs with bass that are *rather* well-known. Thanks for helping!

(However, even if you can't contribute, have a nice day and stay hydrated, guys, gals and non-binary pals!)
