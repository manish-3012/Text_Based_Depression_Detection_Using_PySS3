Unpopular opinion This is pretty bold but it needs to be said. 

Murder is bad. There, I said it.

I'm a guy, and I've been murdered many times, and the femoids that murder me always say it's because I'm a man.

People need to realise that in today's society men have it way worse than evil disgusting women do.

I actually went up to my crush yesterday and before I could even ask her out she said "please just leave me alone I don't want to file a restraining order" which just made me feel so destroyed but everyone just told me to man up.

I'm going to get downvoted to hell for saying this but it's what I think.

Edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger :)

Edit 2: wow did not expect this to blow up thanks for all your kind messages, and to everyone disagreeing with me and calling me a karma whore, and hope you get painfully tortured and burned alive, have a nice day :)
