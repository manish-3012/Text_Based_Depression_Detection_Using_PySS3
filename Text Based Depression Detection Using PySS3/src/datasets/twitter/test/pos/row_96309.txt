My dad's coworker caught COVID. He (coworker) tested today and it came back positive. My dad is going to test tommorow. Tbh it was just a matter of time.

I am not worried at all and I think I'm gonna survive it. I'm just worried about my family.

So yeah I just wanted to share that with y'all. Stay safe everybody :)
