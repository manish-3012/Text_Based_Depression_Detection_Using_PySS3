I like her so much but she hates me Since last year I've had a crush on this girl in the grade above me. A few days before the covid lock-down (it might have actually been the day before) I found her snapchat on snapchat. Since then I've been trying to hang out or play a videogame with her. She always said she was busy when I asked to hang out but seemed willing to play something but we have different consoles and most games she had weren't cross-play. Our friendship peeked in September when we were on the same minecraft server that my friend made and we were actually having long lasting conversations but then in October she started dry texting me and then ghosted me a week into November. I ended up creating a second account just to see if she was doing it to everyone or just me (in hindsight I realize that I probably shouldn't have done this). She responded to my second account and I responded with, "thanks, that's everything I need to know". She took a screen shot and sent it to me to ask if it was me, I denied it. She stopped ghosting me but was dry texting. In January she agreed to play a videogame with me multiple times but always gave a reason as to why she couldn't the day of. Now I'm trying not to text her but it's so difficult because she's so pretty and I don't even care if we date, I just want to at least be friends.   I want to text her but I know it will be bad for my mental health if I do. She probably hates me. 

Tl;dr I've spent like 11 months trying to build a friendship with a girl I like and I'm pretty sure she hates me
