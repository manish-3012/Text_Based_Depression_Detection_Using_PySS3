My feelings are kinda fucked up So to break it down:

I cry without feeling that im sad

Even if i get stuff that i want i cant feel happiness (not just materia things )

My general mood is kinda tending to being sad when i am not distracted but i dknt think in a depressed way

etc.

Like i dont feel things like i used to do i know this sub isnt for mental health advise but is it normal that my feelings are fucked up like that

Ps: the etc is just there bcs i dont know how to explain other examples so it isnt confusing

Thanks for a the hell in advance
