Jeez I am nervous about the election If Trump wins again I'm going to have to spend my adult life in a US that has just recovered from his mistakes. I can't take his shit anymore it's making me want to move to Canada. He's going to ruin the climate and drag out Covid recovery and become the worst president. Also I have 2 essays due this week so yay.
