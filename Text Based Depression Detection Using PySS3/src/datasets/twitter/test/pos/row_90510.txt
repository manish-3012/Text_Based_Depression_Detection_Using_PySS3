I think I know why i don't pick up hints from girls Two years ago I was in a small town by a lake. I went to the beach every day to see my friends. One day when I was going there, a girl (who I didn't know) came up to me and asked if I had a gf (I didn't). Well I was surprised to say the least. That evening I got enough courage to walk up to her. I asked her why did she ask me, and she simply told me: "I was just curious, I thought that the girl who you are always with is your gf. Oh and btw I have a bf." (the girl she mentioned is my best friend). So yeah, if any girl would ask me if I had a gf, I would be like "no" and go about my day. Thank you random girl on the beach.
