I got a 94 on my EMR test. It was a 100 question test. You needed an 80 or higher to pass it. I got a 94. The highest in the class. Even higher then the smart girl in the class. The teacher was super proud of me too. I could have gotten higher. At least a 96 but I miss read a couple answers and clicked them. Dumb mistakes. But Iâ€™m soooooo proud of my self and wanted to share. Best in the class and all her other classes. EMR certified
