I can't wait until this year is over so I can stop having politics shoved down my throat Like seriously I don't give a FUCK about what X political organization did, I don't give a FUCK about what people think of a political candidate, and I'm SICK of people calling others rAcIsT, SeXiSt, or hOmOpHoBic for asinine reasons (i'm not trying to say that racism, sexism, or homophobes don't exist). 

Like seriously people. SHUT. THE FUCK. UP. ABOUT POLITICS. No one wants to have politics and propaganda shoved down their throats 24/7 (Ya hear that, "News" outlets?".

I only watched bits and pieces of the political debate just to see what everyone is mad at and the "debate" was literally two old guys yelling at each other for 2 hours. Seriously the whole debate was a conversation you could hear at buffalo wild wings while the super bowl was going on.

In short, I can't fucking wait til this year is over so that everyone can shut up about politics.
