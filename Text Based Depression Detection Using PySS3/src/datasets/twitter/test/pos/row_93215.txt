Bruh antisocial parents are god tier if you are too Iâ€™ll be in public with my dad and some lady that my mom knows will approach us and my dad will just let me hide behind him and while she keeps talking to him we keep glancing and laughing and then when she leaves we laugh super hard because we both hate social interaction. Iâ€™m blessed to have an antisocial dad.
