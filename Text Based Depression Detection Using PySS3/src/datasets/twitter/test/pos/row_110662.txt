Y'all ever touch a lint roller? Or the backside of a sticker too? Maybe one of those rubbery, solid-glue type things that holds gift cards in their little pamphlet wrappers? The point is, why? Why am I so enamoured with the sensation of an object refusing to end contact with my hand? Is it warmth? Compassion? Why must these little molecules of dopamine be shot so high up into my brain, for no reason other than the sticky side of a price of tape brushed my arm. I cannot explain it. Maybe we all just want someone, or albeit something, idk what y'all are into, to grip our hand refuse to let go. Perhaps we want, deep down, someone who won't abandon us. Sure, I can't give you a good reason to stay, but maybe the reason can just be why not? Will you stay by me? Just, be by my side, even if for just a little bit?
