Tomorrow is going to be a sad day I have 2 works that are going to be graded, one in Russian and the other in biology. But this isn't even the worst thing. For the last year I have written a book, but since I'm using it as a creative work that we need to do in 8th grade. Because of that I'm going to have to finish it tomorrow. Well, it looks like Elliot is going to die...
