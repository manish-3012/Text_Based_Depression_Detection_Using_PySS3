Made some posts regarding singing classes a while back here. Finally took it up to teach myself how to sing. Need advice from possible singers in this subreddit. DM me, if you want horrible singing. The story was I never performed or joined classes since I was 10, and now revisiting when Iâ€™m somewhere in between puberty, I try to sing, and it hit me when I pressed record, I canâ€™t sing no more. My voice was lower, canâ€™t be pushed too much. Iâ€™m still finding my voice range. Donâ€™t know how to find it accurately though. Voice was lower in day 1, but day 7 now and I learned to push it higher, since I didnâ€™t open my mouth much the first day. Kind of like riding a bike, except I have Alzheimerâ€™s, so I donâ€™t remember my childhood at all, and now I need to ride the bike for the first time again.
