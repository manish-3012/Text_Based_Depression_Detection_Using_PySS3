Is it normal to feel like an utter dumbass after looking up every question of maths? Finally, I'm trying to git gud at maths, going at it with a positive attitude everyday. 


The problem is I have to look up the solution of every single question and then I feel like an idiot, thinking what's even the point?


I don't like looking up solutions because I get the feeling I'm getting spoonfed because I'm trying to understand maths so that I can face it without any stress, not to just solve questions. 


Any advice from you guys?
