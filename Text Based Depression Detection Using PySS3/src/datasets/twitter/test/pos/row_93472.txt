These are some poems that I've written while dealing with depression. I hope that if you're going through a hard time, that you can relate to these and know that someone else has been where you are

\*\*PAPER 1\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Trapped in a hell-hole I call my life

There is only one escape in sight

Do I have the strength to do it?

The only thing that will stop my depression

&amp;#x200B;

There is no going back from this,

I need to make sure I put enough thought in

Once I escape all the pain this world brings

Then I will finally spread my wings

&amp;#x200B;

Music is cool, sleeping is great

The only escapes from this world that I hate

But my music has been taken away

And I cannot sleep all day

(Edit: I had just gotten grounded so I couldn't listen to music)

&amp;#x200B;

The urge is real

To stop this pain I feel

I need friends 

before I meet my end

&amp;#x200B;

Happiness is temporary

Sadness is the only feeling,

That lasts longer than an hour or two

I believe my death date is due

(Edit: I don't like the flow of this one)

&amp;#x200B;

Everything that made me happy seems so insignificant

I'm in a room, and suicide is the elephant

I always saw suicide as a way out

Now I see it as a way in

&amp;#x200B;

I get shamed for trying to be happy,

They say to be perfect, and happiness will find you

I have found the only way to be free

But no one understands me

&amp;#x200B;

How can I feel loved

When I'm as insignificant as a shrub?

How is death the only escape

From this life that we call great?

&amp;#x200B;

The things that make me happy

Aren't so white and black

Why is suicide the only option

If there is no going back?

\*\*PAPER 2\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The question is not will I

The questions are when and why

&amp;#x200B;

There is nobody to trust

I tell the wrong person, and I'm fucked

&amp;#x200B;

All happiness is temporary,

There is only sadness for me

&amp;#x200B;

Music is my only escape,

But it can't save me; it's too late

&amp;#x200B;

Have you ever wondered if your "friends" don't like you,

But put up with you because they feel bad for you?

(Edit: 10/10 rhyming there)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling happy again now,

I guess I should put my pencil down

(Edit: I wrote these on paper and am now typing them)

&amp;#x200B;

The only problem is that I can't sleep

Now my suicidal thoughts come back to feast

&amp;#x200B;

What if everyone hates me

And I'm nothing more than annoying?

&amp;#x200B;

Why is suicide the only hope

To escape this world we call home?

&amp;#x200B;

Everyone dies eventually,

But is death an exit or an entry?

&amp;#x200B;

Why can't I go to sleep?

So I can escape these thoughts that I think

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck it. I suppose I'll try

If I'm back, then my peace has been denied

(Edit: it wasn't :D)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*PAPER 3\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

When my life's a mess, I get depressed

I'd rather get high than want to die

(Edit: I copied and changed Juice Wrlds [lyrics](https://genius.com/Juice-wrld-and-halsey-lifes-a-mess-lyrics) in Life's a mess. His lyrics were, "Uh, sometimes life's a messI get high when I'm upset").

&amp;#x200B;

Why is my mind dysfunctional?

My thoughts, I can't control

&amp;#x200B;

Why must I think this way?

I'm like this every day

&amp;#x200B;

What am I missing?

Everyone but me knows the key

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not alright

It's being brought to light

&amp;#x200B;

Where is this so-called happiness?

Is it fake, or am I just missing it?

&amp;#x200B;

My mind likes to tell me that I'm happy

But I realize it's fake when I stop to think

&amp;#x200B;

I sometimes like to pretend I'm happy,

It fools myself for the time being

&amp;#x200B;
