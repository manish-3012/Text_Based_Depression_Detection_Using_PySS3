Lunch in the morning So one time in an english class we had some practice for our social exam and one student didn't know the english word for breakfast and in a panic he blurted out "lunch in the morning". The whole class including my teacher broke down in laughter and we still joke about it today. Like lunch in the morning ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
