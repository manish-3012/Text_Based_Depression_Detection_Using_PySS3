girls can you explain this psychology to me first of all i know all girls arent the same and whatever but aint no boy gonna be able to explain this to me

so all i do is play among us and convo goes like this

me: "any girls"
girl: "im a girl"
"yooo how you doin today"
"good hbu"
"good"

wait a few rounds after just playing the game and they're like "yo whats ur snap" or whatever

why does this happen i didnt do anything please
