Privacy stuff Ok so my mom got really angry at me because I keep procrastinating with my homework and stuff (I still do it on time but she hates it when I sleep past 11). She actually called our wifi provider (verizon I think) and got my entire internet history. Is there any free vpn that blocks the ISP from accessing my files and history? I'm currently using Windscribe but I'm not sure if it works.
