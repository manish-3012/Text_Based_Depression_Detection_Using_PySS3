SNAPCHAT IS ABSULUTE SHIT So i(13m) got a girl (13f) she goes to my school but we both study online and a day before exam we chatted a lot and she herself gave me her snap (I don't look good, just my jokes do the deal) and we spoke like for hours a day for a week and now from 5 days Mother ****ing snapchat is not showing me her contact( I have 8 friends but she is the only one gone) and now we have a 4 day national holiday coming up so by the time this stuff is done mother ****ing snapchat ruined my relationship. She had started getting really close to me and she used to like me
