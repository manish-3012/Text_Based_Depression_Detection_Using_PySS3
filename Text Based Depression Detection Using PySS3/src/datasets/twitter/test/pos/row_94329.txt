We all know the communist kids Iknow some people at my school bla bla bla

They say that billionaires should be abolished and that nobody needs a million. Well we all dont need shit but look at us. They also dont understand net worth and gaining money with stocks. 

We all dont have the money and time to live good and be a good person so why be a hypocrite typing nobody should be rich on their iphone

Chance of becoming a millionaire or billionaire is low but why would it be impossible, my chances are as low as the chances were of those people.

And ofc there is child labour exploitation whatever but thats litteraly in almost every company, it is something that is the responsibility of goverments to solve, not random individuals 

Maybe they should asked someone that lived in russia years ago how communism really is. I didnt start from the bottom but my grandparents did and they worked hard for what they had and never expected handouts.

Im not a millionaire now or billionaire but thats logical since im only 15
