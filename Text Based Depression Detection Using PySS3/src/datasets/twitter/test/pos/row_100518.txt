My 18th birthday Today is my 18th birthday and im having my drivers test that ive been stressing over for the past week and my girlfriend is angry at me for being stressed and being too tired to leave my house to meet her. I understand that my stress has gone towards her by being a little bit of an asshole but she is the same almost every week and I just wanted her to be there to distract me from the stress but seems like she wasnt dealing with this shit. Was I being too much of an asshole. I mean she has started arguments and fights (arguments over stupid shit i mean) because she felt like it and she fucks with me because she felt like it. Iâ€™ve tried to tell her that i dont like it yet she still does it. She started yesterday fucking with me about being too tired to leave the house. Like cmon i havent been able to sleep well and yesterday i had to wake up at 6am for my last drivers lesson because i booked an early lesson due to school. Now im the asshole for being tired of life, stressed about driving school and normal school. Like why did she have to be like that yesterday. Why couldnt she come here instead, well here is what she said â€your house is boring and i have to pack my stuff before the moveâ€. She doesnt have allot of stuff and she doesnt pack until the last two days before the move usually. Might just end it here im tired of her stuff, she has a good family, plenty of pets (3 cats and a dog). Yes every family has problems but ive told her im jealous of what she has. There is allot more shit in this relationship but this are the recent ones. Her life is going well, her school is going well and im home alone (i live alone due to the fact that my parents are moving to portugal) and im really lonely due to covid aswell and my friends dont even contact me anymore. I hope i pass my exam today so i can borrow my dads car and just drive for the whole night. I am really thankful for the loving family i have but i just feel lonely and spent most of the days alone. Sorry for the long text. If you want to ask anything just ask and ill answer
