So itâ€™s my birthday today And to celebrate. I had a dentist appointment set up for my incoming wisdom tooth, then my mouth cleaned which hurt like a bitch, and my teeth xrayed. Turns out I need 2 fillings and they also pulled a tooth. (No anesthetics, it was a small-ish one)

Edit: got a ps4 game a really wanted and my mouth no longer feels like any Schumerâ€™s reserved Taco Bell restroom so turned out pretty good.
