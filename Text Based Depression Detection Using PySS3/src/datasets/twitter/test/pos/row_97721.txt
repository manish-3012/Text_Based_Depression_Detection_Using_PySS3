So, my BF got his first kiss last night! Why do I feel so shitty about it? My BF got me a really cute teddy bear and chocolate, and I drew him SpongeBob memes (might post them on my alt. account), bought him a My Hero Academia wallet, a card, and a box of chocolates. We usually hug goodbye, but I've been waiting to kiss him all night last night. When we were saying goodbye, I kissed him on the cheek and asked if I could kiss him on the lips. He said he's never done that before, so I was like, "Well we're doing it now", completely letting my aggressive side take over me. He just gave me a quick peck, but I wanted so badly to hold it for longer. And now I feel terrible for forcing him to do something he wasn't ready for. He's only ever supported me in everything, and now I feel like such a shitty person for trying to get him to kiss me when he clearly wasn't ready. I'm thinking about calling later today to apologies, he just means so much to me and I feel so bad that it ever happened like that.
