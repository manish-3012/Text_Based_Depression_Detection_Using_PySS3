The most important thing of cereal is how the milk is gonna taste after finishing the cereal (Change My Mind) Nah, when Iâ€™m making cereal Iâ€™m not thinking about â€˜that tasty cerealâ€™, Iâ€™m thinking of the milk, what effect is it gonna have on the milk, will it become sweeter, will it change into cinnamon-milk? Or, my personal preference is when it turns into chocolate-milk. A nice bowl of sweet and cold milk.
