I have a 200IQ idea to recover my crush's attention Alright so, for some context. This girl and I have known eachother for like 3 years, we met through instagram and we usually talk via it or discord. 
Some months ago, I replied to one of her instastories and from there we kinda started liking eachother, we were flirting all the time, calling us cute name and bla bla. BUT happiness isn't forever, lately she has been quite absent and she blames it on her being in a "terrible mood", which I know for sure isn't completely true cause I have first hand information from her bestfriend. 


Anyways , to make her recover her interest I've decided to create A VISUAL MASTERPIECE, my own ted talk about why she should date me.(I know this is not an original idea but given she's an artist and likes creative stuff I thought this would be around her taste)

I thought about creating a PowerPoint and writing the script with my 2007 Microsoft Word (yeah I'm so cool ik). In my future oscar winning masterpiece I'll add slides talking about the interests we share, reminding her of some good situations we've gone through together and yeah more stuff, which I really dont know now, OH and also some fresh as memes 

I know this was tedious to read but I'm so nervous about all this, I would appreciate if you guys shared your opinion about this idea

Thanks!
