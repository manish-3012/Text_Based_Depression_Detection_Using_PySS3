In my district, they are giving us the option to either do hybrid learning which is going to school 2-3 times a week and online the rest or do just online learning. I would like to go back, but I know it is unsafe and I don't want to be part of the problem. What should I choose? both my parents want me to do hybrid, but i don't want to be part of the problem. This is also California btw.
