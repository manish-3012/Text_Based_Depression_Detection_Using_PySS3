A questions for the girls of this subreddit : Oh. My.  GOD!  I was having a perfectly fine chat with a few of my friends, when one of my friends said she didnâ€™t want to go to school because she was tired.  I asked why and she said she stayed up late reading.  I said ok and we continued talking about something else.  Then, she randomly said she was also having her period last night, and she couldnâ€™t sleep.  And I was like wtf-  Thereâ€™s really no reason she had to mention that!  One reason would have been perfectly fine for why she was tired!!!  So my question to you:  Why do you think she randomly mentioned her period when it was unnecessary and would make us guys in the chat uncomfortable?
