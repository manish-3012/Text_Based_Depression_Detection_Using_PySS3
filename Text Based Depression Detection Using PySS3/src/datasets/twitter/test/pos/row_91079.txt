â€œI wouldnâ€™t be surprised if you came out as bisexualâ€ What does that even mean?
I was talking to a guy that sits next to me in class. We talk quite a lot as heâ€™s my best friendâ€™s boyfriend. Today we talked about how I find guys with nails polish attractive. I tried to explain that itâ€™s not the â€˜nail polishâ€™ that makes them attractive but the fact that theyâ€™re so confident in themself to just say: â€œskrew gender normsâ€. He didnâ€™t understand this tho and the girl that sat next to us started talking about how only â€œgaysâ€ and â€œwannabe womenâ€ wear nail polish. I got a little upset and corrected her that she shouldnâ€™t say those things. 
After a while my friendâ€™s boyfriend says â€œI wouldnâ€™t be surprised if you came out as bisexualâ€. I get that a lot, but Iâ€™m very sure that Iâ€™m straight. I just find it fascinating how people can just assume your sexuality because you happen to think differently then themselves. 
I know this guy quite well and he know me so Iâ€™ve probably done more things that in his opinion is â€œacting biâ€. (Just to put it in here, his girlfriend is bi). I talk to him a lot about boys as well and have never shown interest in women, so I honestly donâ€™t even know how he can be so shallow about something like this. Not that Iâ€™m offended in anyway, I just think itâ€™s weird to judge someoneâ€™s sexuality based on opinions like: guys with nail polish is hot. 

So my question is: What does it mean? This whole thing, what does it mean? What is he judging from and why do I have people thinking Iâ€™m bi just because of dumb things like this?
