Why are all the boys in my class the same, and only seem intrested in these things D:? From what I can tell, everyone just seems to have girlfriends and boyfriends for nudes and shit. I just want someone I can hold hands with and hug. I mean, it can't be only me, can it? Should I just wait until I'm in highschool to find someone to be more than friends with?
