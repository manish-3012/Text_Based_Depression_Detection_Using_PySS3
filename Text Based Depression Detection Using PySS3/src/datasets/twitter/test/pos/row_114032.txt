My driving permit I've studied and memorized about 160 questions (inlcluding signs). Alot of people say that the test is super easy, but I am still not so sure if I am ready. I am able to do the first 3 practice test flawlessly (the rest are locked behind a pay wall) on [driving-test.org](https://driving-test.org), but I am still not so sure. Need some reassurance or some tips.
