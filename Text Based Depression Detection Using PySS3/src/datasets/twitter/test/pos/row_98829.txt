Am I the only one who thinks that think the way movies that are supposed to be "women empowering" just don't do it right Like most of them either make women look like these "can do anything first try, without any problems and can fight anyone with no problem and is able to do anything any time" or just change the gender of an already established character 

Like just changing the gender of an already established character is done for woke points and its useless, most of them have annoying writing and the "women can do everything/anything" message slapped all over it 

And just showing that a woman can defuse a bomb, while fighting 30 people at the same time, while being the pilot of a crashing plane and giving birth just feels unrealistic and again for woke points 

Don't tell me women can do everything, cause no one can do everything or anything 

Show me a realistic person, that is written well and is grounded. Cause a strong woman isn't what they think it is.

And why did Alien do it better, than Ghostbusters 2016 or fucking Charlie's Angels (the new one I forgot the name). Cause they knew what they were doing, and wrote a compelling protagonist.
