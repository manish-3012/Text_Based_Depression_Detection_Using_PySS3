hey teenagers, what does it feel like to be a teanager these days? I'm 29 now, but I'm just curious to know what it's like to be a teenager now (not just COVID-related)

It seems like it must be more stressful and chaotic these days. What do you guys think? How do social interactions work? Are there cliques? What are your collective feelings as teenagers?
