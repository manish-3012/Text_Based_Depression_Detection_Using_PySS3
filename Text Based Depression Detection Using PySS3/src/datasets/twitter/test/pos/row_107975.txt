This is not a paid advertisement for the English language, English is by no means perfect Latin should not be revived 

The only good thing about Latin is the way the vocabulary works, English already works in a way where you can add any Latin/French/Greek vocabulary/root you want, so the only thing Latin is better than most languages at English is better at than Latin, yeah itâ€™s better than the rest of the Romance languages but English combines all the good parts of Germanic languages, all the good parts of Romance languages, and removes the stupid parts like grammatical genders
