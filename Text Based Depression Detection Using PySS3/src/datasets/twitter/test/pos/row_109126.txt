Job Advice I just started my first actual job just under 3 weeks ago. I work at a region-wide coffee chain. When I was hired, I was told that I would get paid every 2 weeks on Mondays at a specific time. After my first week, I got paid a really weird amount. It was too small to be for my shifts that week, so I assume it was for orientation. Because of this, I know that my direct deposit is set up correctly. But now itâ€™s been 3 weeks and I havenâ€™t gotten paid at all for my shifts. Should I quit after my next shift? I donâ€™t live in the area and Iâ€™ve done volunteer work and odd jobs so references arenâ€™t an issue. I hate it there anyways and my mental health has plummeted (mean boss combined with anxiety issues). 

So, should I quit or wait it out? If I quit, should I give my two weeks (even though Iâ€™m sure my boss will bully me for it) or should I quit on the spot? I feel really lost, idk what to do.
