My dad may be cheating. My dad may be cheating on my mom but I'm not sure, on one hand she may know, on the other she may not know about it. I don't want to tell anyone because I'd have to live with my father anyway and my brother is leaving this year so I would be alone with him if they get a divorce for the next 2 1/2 years. What do I do, do i have my brother say something in a year or so?

Please any advice would be welcomed.
