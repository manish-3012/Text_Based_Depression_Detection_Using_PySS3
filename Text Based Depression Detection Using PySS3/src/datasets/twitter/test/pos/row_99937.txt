I'm nervous about my crush Ugh I suppose I'm just worried like I don't have enough world experience for my crush to take me seriously enough for him to like me back in the future. I feel childish compared to him and ugh why do I even have to like someone older than me like crushes are so annoyingg. I'm a senior in hs and he's in college and stuff and I've never had a job...I think my anxiety makes it worse cause sometimes I wonder how anyone would wanna deal with that since sometimes the things I get anxious about just make no sense.
