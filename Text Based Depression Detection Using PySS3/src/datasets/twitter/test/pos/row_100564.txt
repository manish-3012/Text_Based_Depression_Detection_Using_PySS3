What is with all of the sexism in comments lately? I see so many posts that have a cesspool of people being sexist and crappy in their comments. And sometimes I wonder if people are posting things to provoke that on purpose. Overall I keep seeing comments after comments about how bad women are and sometimes it is even in posts about empowering men. Putting down women doesn't empower men it just spreads more hate! I'd really appreciate if the mods could make certain rules against this, the rules currently dont cut it. I appreciate what you do mods but if you could make some improvements that would be greatly appreciated. Respect each other, just as not all men are rapist and violent, not all women are cheaters, "whores", and liars.
