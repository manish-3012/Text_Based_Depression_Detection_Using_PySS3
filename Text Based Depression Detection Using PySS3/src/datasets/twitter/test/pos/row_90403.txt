How to study? Please help. Can anyone gove me tips on how to study! I have exams starting on like 10th Nov and I've barely studied anything. Quarantine's got me lazy. How do I get in the mood? When are the best times to study? How do I memorise good? How do I force myself to ignore all urges to do stuff like using my phone, video games, texting, movies and shit like that? Please. Any tips.
