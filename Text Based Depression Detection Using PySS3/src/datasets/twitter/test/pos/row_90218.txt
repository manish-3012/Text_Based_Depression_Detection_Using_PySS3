YOU WEREN'T BORN IN THE WRONG GENERATION! If you like something from the 60s, 70s, 80s etc YOU WERE NOT BORN IN THE WRONG GENERATION, YOU JUST LIKE SOMETHING, TONS OF OTHER PEOPLE LIKE THE SAME THING. 


If you like something from the past, you don't have to brag about it. I like Queen and The Beatles but that doesn't mean I'm in the wrong generation


If you like something from the past you just like it, no one cares if you say you're not from this generation
