So uhmm.... Any country girls/boys to yeehaw with? ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ You know... You yee my haw, I yee your haw. Then we do some country stuff together with soothing guitar music in the background as we appear in a really neat montage where we laugh and do stuff, occasionally me getting randomly surprised by random shanaenigans and get more and more used to them, including a part where you give me your hat and I look cute af in it, complementing with a really cute outfit too, then more shanaenigans happen until it cuts out to us riding horses towards the sunset in the middle of a golden field full of wheat plants but since we only have that one stubborn black horse we bonded with during the montage we're riding it together seeking for adventure, and I get to sit in the back and hug you tightly while the end credits roll slowly with an emotional version of the montage song but with some vocals on top of it saying stuff about love and changing and yadayadayada.

Anyone? ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆðŸ¥º
