Is there anyone else that stopp their blood going to their head? Is there anybody that stopp their blood going to their head by holding hard pressure over the arteries going to their brain? 
For me it gives me a feeling of not really being anywhere. It feels like it is just me and lots of emptiness. I also loos feeling in other parts of my body.
I was just wondering if it is just me or if it is others that do it too, and to hear if it is safe?
