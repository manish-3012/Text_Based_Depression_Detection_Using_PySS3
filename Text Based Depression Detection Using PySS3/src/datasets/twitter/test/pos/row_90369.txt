I "snitched" and they found out Context: I go to a rather *ostentatious* Australian school that has been in the city and national papers a few times in the past few years so the Senior Leadership doesn't shy away from coming down hard on things...

A few weeks ago I became aware of a Google Slides document shared between 40 people and was 200 slides long referring to me as a *Retar.ded s.pastic f.ucking monkey* (I'm part Maori) and other students and teachers in similar fashions. (Lots of s.exis.t comments about teachers)...

I told the appropriate person, and it quickly made its way up the chain to a man with the title of '*Senior Master'*... Now because these idiots kept the doc on their school google drives, it took about 2 minutes for them to take it off their drive.

40 people have now all been issued "stages" (20 detentions, but with no right to appeal them) and 10 of them have been referred to the Lord Principal pending suspension.

Despite my rather extensive attempts to conceal my identity, naturally, they found out.
