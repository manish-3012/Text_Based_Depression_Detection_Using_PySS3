Using this sub as a diary part 6 Hello there "scrolling through new" guy. Nice to meet you! Have a nice day!  


Anyway, today was a bit more productive. I started working on that birthay gift for my friend. Sadly I remembered in just that moment, that my drawings suck . . .  
Well, either that or nothing. So the next few days I will try my best to make it acceptable.  


School begins tomorrow, so I can be a bit productive again. But some teachers really handle the whole lockdown situation quite questionably, so fuck my life I guess.  


I have to wake up at 9 tomorrow, so from now on these posts will be made much earlier. Which also means it's less likely anyone sees this.  
If you do happen to see this though, thanks for stopping by. Good night Reddit!
