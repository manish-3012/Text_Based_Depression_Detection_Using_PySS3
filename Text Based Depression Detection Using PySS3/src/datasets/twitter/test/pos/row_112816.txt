Why are people getting so pissed? I know super straight is a thing and people ar getting pissed at that for good reason, but thereâ€™s also people calling others who just donâ€™t have an attraction to transgender people transphobic and homophobic. HOW THE FUCK IS THAT TRANSPHOBIC! If i donâ€™t like men does that make me homophobic? no, it doesnâ€™t. Stop. I can date whoever i want, i can choose to not date someone who is transgender if i want. Doesnâ€™t make me a bad person.
