When should I leave this group chat There was a group chat made for the seniors in one of my classes on snapchat because a couple students were working with a teacher to get info out when school got canceled. We were class of 2020. I thought it would die and everyone would leave but its still super active and I feel awkward just leaving after not saying anything for a year
