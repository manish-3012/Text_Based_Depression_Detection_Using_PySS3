My grandmother tested positive for Covid My grandmother tested positive for Covid  and has to go to the Covid section of her assisted living building. She doesnâ€™t want to go though because she doesnâ€™t have symptoms and thinks it was a false positive. If it was a False positive, she doesnâ€™t want to be exposed to others with Covid. Her assisted living place wonâ€™t let her get tested again for another 3 months.
