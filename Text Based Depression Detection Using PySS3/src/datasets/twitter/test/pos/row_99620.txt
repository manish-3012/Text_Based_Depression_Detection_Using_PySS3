Everyone is talking about test scores and Iâ€™m just here burnt out from finishing a 100 minute math test that had 10 questions and hoping that I didnâ€™t fuck up. AND studying for a chem test tomorrow. @-@ I should just go to bed but I canâ€™t because I almost failed my chem test last time and anxiety is building up because I am totally screwed if I lose my scholarship here holy crap
