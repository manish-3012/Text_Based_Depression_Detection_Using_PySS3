Hi! Iâ€™m looking to promote my sub and find responsible moderators! Hello I have been a sub about teen sexuality, teen ranting, stories, issues or problems with finding out your sexuality and more. 

Iâ€™m trying to make it a bit bigger so people who are questioning themselves can get the support and help they need! Also instead of just asking or talking about sexuality, it can be a fun place for teenagers to share stories or memes or stuff. 

I also need like 2 mods so whoever is active and responsible I will most likely give the mod
position too. Thanks!
