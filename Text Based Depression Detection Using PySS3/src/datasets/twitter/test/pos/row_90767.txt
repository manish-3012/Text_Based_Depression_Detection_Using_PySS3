What do teenage girls call each other? So I've heard girls calling each other "dude" and "bro" a few times. Is that normal?

As a guy, what should I use when like texting female friends? (ie when texting my guy friends: "Bro my history teacher gave us a 15 page essay for homework" )

Starting with "girl" is weird, right? Is Bro/Dude fine or weird?

^(I know this is a super weird question lmfao but ty for helping)
