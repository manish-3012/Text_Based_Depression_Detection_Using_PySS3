Please someone just kill me right now. I have autism, asperger and depression. Today my mom told me to do my homework. I said I have no idea what was given for homework. She started talking about that I should have a small notebook to write down what's for homework. I asked how tf could I remember that I have to write down my homework. She started yelling and I started crying. She called it "sElF-pItY". She walked her room and left me on the floor, crying and thinking about how crappy my life is and how everything used to be diffferent when I was still a happy kid. Now I'm refusing to eat anything till my own mother can treat me like a human being.
