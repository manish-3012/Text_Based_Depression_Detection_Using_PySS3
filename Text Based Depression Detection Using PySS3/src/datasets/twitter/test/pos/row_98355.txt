I love you guys Iâ€™ve been a watcher on this sub for so long and i think itâ€™s finally time I say something, so I will. It always puts a smile on my face to see the stuff posted no matter how cringey or stupid, or actually interesting, I love it all. It has helped me through so much and helped me to get my mind off suicide lately. Thank you guys so much for everything even when you didnâ€™t mean it.
