Help with talking to parents about mental illnesses I recently told my mom about my depression and anxiety and explained some reasons behind it, but she seems to think that it is a mild thing when it's not. She said when I talked to her "come and talk to me if it gets worse," but it's already serious and not mild at all. I haven't talked to her about it since but I really feel like I need a therapist or something, but I can't do it myself and I don't want her to have to pay for something like that.
