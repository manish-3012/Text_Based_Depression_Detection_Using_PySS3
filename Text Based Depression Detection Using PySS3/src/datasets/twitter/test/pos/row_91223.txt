Why do parents even care what we do with our hair I want to cut my hair and dye it pink, i have no clue why my mom cares about my hair at all. I could cut it myself tonight and she couldnâ€™t do anything about it, itâ€™s just hair!! It grows back!! Somebody please tell me WHY parents care so much about our hair
