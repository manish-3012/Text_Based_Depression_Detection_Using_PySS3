Anyone's feeling queasy for back to school? My senior year abruptly ended back in March due to the pandemic and we had an in-person graduation at the end of June. So I'm still "stuck" in the high school mindset. I have like 21 days until I move into my dorm. While I'm excited to begin studying nursing, I feel a little uneasy but I guess it's near impossible to do online classes for a nursing major. Any who, are y'all ready for back to school?

&gt;!P.S. if you have an alternative to the r/teenagers Discord server (I got banned a year ago), I'd like to join and chill with y'all.!&lt;
