Some advice for my dudes who can't tell her how you feel I fell in love with a girl a couple months ago, we both knew we had feelings for each other but nobody made a move. 

Yesterday I asked her out but it was too late tho, we had grown a platonic relationship and I have been banished to the "close, good friend zone" 


Don't make the same mistake I did, it won't ruin your friendship if you tell her about how you feel.
