I GOT A GAMING PC!!!!!! So basically iâ€™ve been wanting one for a while and have been saving up, so last night my parents said we were going to costco to get a brisket. But when we got there they bought me a gaming PC and then took me to Best Buy to get a monitor, weâ€™re setting it up tonight. I love them so much ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
