Wholesome Mom Moment So my step mother has the amazon prime account we all use. I ordered something on amazon and the total was like 14.75 or something. I came back with a 20 and gave it to her. She turns around with change and I told her it was fine. she proceeded to try and give me the money. I said â€œseriously. Itâ€™s fineâ€. And she goes â€œhereâ€™s your moneyâ€ and I respond â€œyou fucking raised me. Itâ€™s fineâ€

She hugged me. 

I think because I recognized all her hard work that it took to raise me that last 9 years since my birth mother left. We obviously exchange I love youâ€™s and I try my best to put more effort into making the house clean but I think its how passionate I said it to her. Idk but it was heartwarming for whatever reason. Figured Iâ€™d share. All that for 4 dollars lol.
