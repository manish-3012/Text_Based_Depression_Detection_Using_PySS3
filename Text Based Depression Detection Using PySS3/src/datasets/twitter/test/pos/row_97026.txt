Survey for University Hello, teenagers! Iâ€™m a 19-year-old university student, and I need to make a survey about the website of a company. I chose "Converse", and since their primary demographic are teenagers, I decided that I would ask here. If you are a teenager that fits into the "Converse" demographic (rebellious, a dreamer, creative and/or middle class), I would greatly appreciate it if you would go to the "Converse" website ([https://www.converse.com](https://www.converse.com)) and answer the following questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there something specific that catches your eye when you open up the website? If so, what is it?
2. Try to search for something specific using the built-in search engine. Did you find what you were looking for?
3. Were the suggestions given in the search bar helpful?
4. Pretend as if you were looking to buy shoes of a specific style. Do you consider the options given in the navigation bar to be helpful categories?
5. When you committed an error (such as accidently clicking on the wrong option), would you say that the website provided a good way to undo the mistake?
6. Would you say that itâ€™s easy to learn the layout of the website?
7. Does the website offer fast ways to do specific tasks (such as finding or comparing products)?
8. Would you consider the aesthetic design of the website to be pleasing to look at?
9. Would you consider that interacting with the website feels reliable?
10. In one word, how would you describe the general mood or aesthetic of the website?
