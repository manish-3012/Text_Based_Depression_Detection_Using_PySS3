Follow up with the Jehovah Witness meme I created Well, me and my mom has, a tough relationship now. The story behind it is that, I was in my mother's car, only me and my mom, and we where not talking, until I said, " if Jehovah created all things, did he create homo etectus, the Nethadrothols, and the rest of the human prehistoric ancestors. My mom said it was scientific lies, and that I was wrong. She went on a tyrant that "Jehovah is the only thing that created the human beings." Wanna know something else about the Jehovah Witness? The original name was the Bible students, and it was created by Charles Tay Russel. When he died, another person, which I forgot the name of, renamed it to Jehovah witness, and he even sent a letter to Hitler saying what he was doing was good. Go watch telltale atheist videos on YouTube to learn more about the Jehovah's witnesses. After that talk we have a shaky relationship
