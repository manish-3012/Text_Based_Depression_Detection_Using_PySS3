I just got sent to my Room for breathing the wrong way?! What the hell? (English is not my native language so please bear with me) My Dad and I had an Argument. He was mad about some Streaming Platforms adding Warnings to old TV-Shows or Movies which warn of the possible racist or sexist Language that is often used in them.

He was trying to spin the Narrative that stuff is being "Censored" and I was like: "Explaining or Warning about Language or Themes in Old Media trough, for example, a Paragraph on the Screen or Paper is in No way Censorship of Anything."

He didn't like that. At all, but he wasn't livid just yet, just pretty agitated that I was disagreeing with him. (He doesn't like that in general).

Things keep devolving with him just talking himself into a rage, and me trying to explain why this is happening and why most of what he says isn't true. 

Now, the moment comes which sent him over the Edge, I used a term he reportedly wasn't familiar with, even tough he himself used it very often. AND DARE I, I breathed in too heavy for his taste and that's when he sent me to my Room.

And now I'm sitting here, writing this, upset and wondering why some people can't accept another Opinion or why he's always so outraged when I voice my own thoughts.

If this doesn't belong here, I'm sorry.
