Does anyone else feel so fking nostalgic after listening to music?! Like, Iâ€™m only 14, but every time I listen to music, I start remembering all my memories from when I was younger. I remember all my friends, all our times together,  and like such deep feelings. I feel like I can see my entire life when the song hits just write. Anyone else feel like this?
