"School teaches us useless information" Well yes, but actually no Now before everyone spams information you learnt in school and don't need in the comments, pls hear me out first.

Also I am currently talking about high school since that is what people talk about.

When people say that they often think about the information being useless in daily life, which is true, you won't need a lot of the information.

However, that is not the purpose of high school. That is the purpose of elementary school.

High school is meant to teach basic information from a range of subjects because when you continue your studies later on it will become useful.

No let me use the greek educational system for an example.

In Greece high school is separated into junior and senior and they last 3 years each. At the second year of senior high school you get to choose a "direction" as we call it. I don't know how to translate them to English but basically:

One direction has subjects like Language and Literature and History etc. language related stuff.

The other has maths, physics, chemistry, biology etc. More sciency related stuff.

You are taught all of those in high school and use the basics to go on to more advanced material.

Pls tell me how the school system works in your country I am interested.

So yeah high school gives you from  basics to before-university level knowledge from many subjects because they don't know what you are planning on studying. 

And tbh you probably don't know for sure either except maybe by the time you finish high school.
