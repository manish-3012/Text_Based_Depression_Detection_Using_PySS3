Anybody else get treated horribly compared to their siblings? My brother is given anything and everything he wants. In just the past month my brother has gotten 3 pairs of shoes, 2 skateboards, a skate box, a couple shirts, pants, 3 games, etc. and has pretty much been taken anywhere he wants. Why does he get whatever he wants whenever he wants it?
