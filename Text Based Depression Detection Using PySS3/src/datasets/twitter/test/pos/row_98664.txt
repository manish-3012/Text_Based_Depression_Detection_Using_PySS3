I'm joining the navy in July I'm going in as a fire controlman, which are the guys that control the large weapons on the ships. It involves a lot of computer use which i know i'm good with. If it's true that navy guys drink like crazy then that's something you know i'm looking forward to. I've been working out more so I can pass the physical requirements but i'm pretty sure i'll be acing it by july. I scored more enough on my asvab to qualify. Pretty sure boot camp is gonna suck but at least i'll be able to shoot guns. After I get out i'm gonna start talking like a pirate and live on a river
