Autism is... odd. Like really weird. I am an above average student, honors classes throughout my schooling, and was considered by some to be the smartest in my class. Did I have the best grades? No. I cant tell you the amount of times I have lost points on a test because the teacher couldn't read my handwriting. And if it wasn't just that, I would always get my homework done before I even got home (before our school got iPads and migrated all of our work over there), just for me to lose track of it somewhere. For example, I had a chemistry test today. Wasn't hard at all, got every single question right. Happened to end up in the middle of the pack. Why? Because I wrote down my work wrong with all the right answers. Compound this with three sports year round because you CANT quit even ONE because what else do you have going on, sounding like a DUMBASS because you have a speech impediment for soft it's that never went away, being PETRIFIED to even come close to an INTERACTION with a girl, and constantly stepping on the lines of social norms, and you got yourself a kid with mild autism. I'm going to go play chess now, I'm done venting.
