This isn't the right sub, but I think some of you could help me with this. I have a Dell computer with a bunch of pictures on Google photos (or whatever the built in photos application is on Dell). I'd like to share the photos to my phone but I can't figure out how. When I click the share button, it says I need to have Google hello? Please tell me if you need more details
