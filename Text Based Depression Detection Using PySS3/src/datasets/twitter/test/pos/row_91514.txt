I'm shit scared for my GCSE results tomorrow I'm getting my results tomorrow and I know I'll get the grades to get into my school's sixth form (I'm like 75% sure anyway) but I'm still terrified. I haven't been able to eat or sleep all week, and I know all my friends will do so much better than me. I did my maths last year and got an A, and I'll do well in English and my chosen subjects, but I'm terrified I'll disappoint my parents. My brother did well in his GCSEs but he's just got his alevels and barely passed one subject (even with teacher's predicted grades) so I don't wanna do worse than him/be a repeat of my brother. 

If anyone has any advice to help me calm down I'd appreciate it as well, but this is mainly just for me to rant out my feelings. I hope everyone else getting results tomorrow gets the grades they want. Wish me luck! Xoxo
