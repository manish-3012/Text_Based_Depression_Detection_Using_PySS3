Who cares if you exist? Who cares if you cease to exist? Who cares if you're hurt? Who cares if you're lonely? no one does, other than your parents. To all the others you gotta make them care. You gotta make yourself important. You can do it bud, believe in yourself. If not today you're gonna be important to someone someday so don't lose hope.
