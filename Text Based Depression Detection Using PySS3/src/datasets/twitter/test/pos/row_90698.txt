Anyone have some questions for a college student With the next school year approaching every day I wanted to see if people wanted to get some answers about college stuff like college apps or dorm life or anything related to college. I'm only a first year so I can't tell you everything, but I wanted to see if I could help anyways.

BTW this is targeted at Americans because I don't really know anything about higher level education outside if the US.
