Dont you ever just feel like crap the day before school I feel like everybody experienced this at least once in their life because itâ€™s like you canâ€™t play video games or go outside or even be antisocial, it feels like your being forced out into a world with a bunch of dicks and theres nothing you can do about it, eventually this feeling goes away within a week or two and it feels like a meaningless wash rinse repeat routine.
