Please send me a photo of your history textbook! So I'm currently planning to write a short essay on the different representations of the Battle of Waterloo in education, as viewed in varying countries. However, I am unable (or unwilling) to purchase all these different textbooks from all over the world and wait for them to get shipped to my location, without even knowing if it's usable for my research. Therefore, I humbly ask all of you to send me a photo of a page from your textbooks relating to the Battle of Waterloo! (or Napoleon, for that matter) I would especially appreciate it if I got German, French, or British books, but I would really appreciate anything at all to be honest.
