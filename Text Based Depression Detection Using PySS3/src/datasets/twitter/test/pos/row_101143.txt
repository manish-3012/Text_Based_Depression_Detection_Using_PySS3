How do I forgive myself I used to be a bully four years ago, and itâ€™s eaten away at me for those years. Iâ€™ve had people tell me Iâ€™ve ruined their lives and I made them give up. This year I tried to kill myself with an overdose and it didnâ€™t work, I said it was a mistake and everyone believed me because they donâ€™t know this is how I really feel. Since then Iâ€™ve been worse than normal but havenâ€™t had the strength to attempt suicide again all I do is burn myself with hot pieces of metal. Recently Iâ€™ve reached out to everyone Iâ€™ve bullied and apologized, they all forgave me. Even the person I bullied the most forgave me. I expected that to be the end of all my suffering but it wasnâ€™t I still hate myself. How can the people I put through hell forgive me when I canâ€™t I just want to be happy again and to stop hurting people. I feel the need to punish myself because I wasnâ€™t punished before which is why I burn myself, and plan on cutting myself. I canâ€™t tell my family this because we donâ€™t have the money to get me help and my mother has an expensive surgery coming up, I wouldnâ€™t be able to take it if they helped me. I want to die to help everyone else Iâ€™m so tired of myself. I know I shouldnâ€™t feel this way but I donâ€™t know how I should move on, please help.
