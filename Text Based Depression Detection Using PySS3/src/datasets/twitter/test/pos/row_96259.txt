I need to clean myself up but im too overstimulated mentally So i have a lot of mental illnesses that make ne overstimulated easy, plus i have more nerves than others, so i feel a lot more than others (ex: my hair feels like spider legs on my neck constantly)

Im so overstimulated right now and its partially due to being sweaty but getting into a shower sounds like hell rn because of having things constantly hitting me

If any teen who has issues like this too please help? None of my family really understand so i cant go to them. Also please dont tell me im dirty i showered on thursday its just a hot day today
