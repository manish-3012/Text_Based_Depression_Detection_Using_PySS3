My Talking Angela Theories Still Freak Me Out When I was a kid, I really had the app. I was 11 years old, in grade 5, and this was in 2015, before I ever heard of the rumours. I remember the cat asking me invasive questions. I remember her asking me where I live. I also remember her asking me what the weather's like, which could seem innocuous but in this light, it's creepy. I don't remember much else of what she said.
