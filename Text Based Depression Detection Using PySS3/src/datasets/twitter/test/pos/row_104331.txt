The big problem with the "Not Like Other Girls" mindset The big problem with the "not like other girls" mindset is that society has taught us that all girls are dumb, superficial and wear revealing clothing and heaps of makeup in order to gain the approval of men and that they are all just mindless carbon copies of this cookie cutter idea. This leads girls to think they are different from the norm just because they have a personality and don't always live up to societies beauty standards for women. Not only is this a harmful mindset for the individual it also breeds hatred between the girls that feel they are different and the girls they perceive to be normal and further pushes the sense of competition between women in our society. Conventionally attractive girls are slutshamed and called superficial  whether or not it's true and the others are shamed for being "ugly" or "weird", both these stereotypes are being perpetuated by the not like other girls phenomenon. In the end it all just contributes to misogyny and the objectification of women.

Sorry if that was worded badly, I'm not the best and putting my ideas into words
