i wish i just knew the meaning of it all i mean i know we were created by chance, some meteors containing proteins binded together and created life, and from thereon we mutated to humans today, but why? there has got to be meaning to it all, why are we sentient? i just wish i knew, if there was some sort of key to just happiness, but as far as im aware theres nothing to live for. we live, we die. its a cycle that will go on until we go extinct. i just wish it made sense.
