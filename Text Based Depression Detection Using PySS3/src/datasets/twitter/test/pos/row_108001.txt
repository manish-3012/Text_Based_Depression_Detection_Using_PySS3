I have two very bad pieces of advice/tips for a heartbreak They're so bad that I actually advise you not to do them. 

The first one is probably very much illegal and therefore I suggest you do not do it: slash three of their tires with one knife, and the fourth with another. It'll look like fraud to the insurance company.

The second piece is just as bad and because this is r/teenagers and it's probably illegal for a minor, but hey, if you still hold a grudge when you're 25, go for it!

Date their father/mother. Show up one day when they're around and just go, "Oh hey, kids!"

(Bonus points if you add, "I fucked your mom.")

*This is not meant to be taken seriously but I can't stop you if you want to.*
