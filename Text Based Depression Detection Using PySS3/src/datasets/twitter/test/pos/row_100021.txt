How mowing the lawn in the middle of fall helped me find a giant pair of scissors I'm not joking. My dad tells me to mow the lawn, so I do, while pushing it along, i run over something, it stops the blade and I think I screwed the mower with a rock I didn't see. I move the mower back and I find giant garden scissors. I proceeded to look closer at it and noticed I dented the handle, but it still works.

Yes I am a moron and yes I did proceed to finish cutting the lawn with them.
