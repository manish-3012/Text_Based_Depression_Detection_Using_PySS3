I went through more pain that you could imagine So a few weeks ago I broke my arm in two spots by snowboarding (caught an edge). And I went in for a check up for my arm and it wasnâ€™t healing right, thus having them to re-break my arm. They only gave me a Advil during the treatment, and when they re-broke my arm I let out sounds I didnâ€™t know I could make. Pain, I can still hear the *pop*.
