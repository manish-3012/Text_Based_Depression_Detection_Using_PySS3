Hurricane coming! So I live in Louisiana, US, and down here we have things called hurricanes whereâ€™s itâ€™s like a huge storm and this is like the 4th one this past year. And usually we get one or two but 2020 is awesome. Anyway it hits Friday night, last hurricane took off our neighbors roof and unpacked some of the roads. Wish me luck, will update every now and then
