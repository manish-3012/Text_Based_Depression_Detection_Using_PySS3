My hookup lied about their HIV status and convinced me I didnt need to use a condom. Im only 18. I dont want to die of aids. I made a mistake and I cant take it back. Anyone who wants to have sex, please do it safely, dont be an idiot like me. I hooked up with a stranger on a dating app-

During sex he had a breakdown and started talking about how his physically abusive ex got him hooked on meth, and he cried for like, 20 minutes.He then asked if I was comfortable with him doing meth so he can enjoy sex better and be happy- I said No, I wouldnt be comfortable

Probably should have left here, right? Stupid me stayed for a bit longer and fucked him some more .During anal, he stops and says: You can put your pants on. Okay, he wants me to leave, so I leave.

He texts me 2 hours after (he's admits to being high on meth) and asks for me to come back because he's lonely, when its made apparent I wont come back he tells me he's going to kill himself because he has HIV. I had a panic attack/meltdown and went to the ER and now Ive been on PEP (Post exposure Prophylaxes- it reduces the chance of contracting HIV) for like, 2/3 days. Also my co-workers have been joking about my (possible) HIV status by saying "stay positive" (my boss told them- I told my boss because I was in the ER and thought i was going to be late)

Im scared, alone and well, terrified. I havent told my family because Im 18. I have no friends or anyone to confide in. If Im positive Im going to kill myself. I already have depression/anxiety and have been close to suicide before. This might be the thing to push me over. Ive been in tears over the past few days.

Im dumb, so dumb. I shouldve just worn a condom. I know Im dumb, so please dont say you shouldve worn a condom) 

And yes, Im trans but im closeted.
