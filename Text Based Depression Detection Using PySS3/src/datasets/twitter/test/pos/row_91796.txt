Uncomfortable Situation Okay im not sure how many people will see this, and i know it may be a lot to read so ill try to keep it short, but bear with me. Over the past week or so, i (F,16) have been made very uncomfortable by the way i was being talked to and treated by someone online (M,16). At first i thought he was cool and all, and he didnt seem weird at all. Eventually he started talking in a sexual manner towards me and it made me uncomfortable, but i said nothing about it because of some stuff he had told me before. It got to the point where i felt like i couldnt do anything about it at all and i was stuck. thankfully, with some help of a very close irl friend, i got the courage to stick up for myself, put the creep in his place with a long message about how everything he told me was wrong in every way, and i blocked him.
This can happen to anyone, and its not fun at all. If you think this is happening to you, please, stick up for yourself and do not let it get too far. If they try to manipulate you and guilt trip you ( like what happened with me ) do not listen to anything they say. Dont let them think they can just walk all over you and do/say whatever they want. If you are in an uncomfortable situation, speak up.
Also to those that think its okay to sexualize others and to make them uncomfortable, it is not okay at all. It is very messed up. Just because youre horny and cant control yourself and your thoughts doesnt mean you need to ruin other peoples lives and make them uncomfortable.
