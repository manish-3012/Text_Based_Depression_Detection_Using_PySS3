My friend says she wishes she still had her virginity. This is fucking stupid for some reasons. Firstly because even after saying that, she still doesnâ€™t shut up about it. Like if someone says theyâ€™ve still got their v-card sheâ€™ll say something like â€œcanâ€™t relate hahaâ€. We can just be having a normal conversation but sheâ€™ll put in her 5 cents and bring it up ffs. 

Secondly, your social status doesnâ€™t depend on wether you fuck or not. She says it in the â€˜Iâ€™m not like other girlsâ€™ voice and all I can say to that is â€œyou just are.â€ And then she gets upset when I tell her to stop. 

Ffs

Btw Iâ€™m not a virgin but I just donâ€™t see the big whoop about it.
