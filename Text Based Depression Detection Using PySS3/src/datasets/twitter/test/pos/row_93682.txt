Do any other bi dudes feel like you have to hide your sexuality on dating sites when talking to women? I noticed when I added bi and a little pride flag into my bio I didn't necessarily get less matches maybe 20% less but I noticed wayyyyy less girls were writing to me first is there any reason for this?
