Should I go back to my high school or should I do my online school until i graduate? (Please help) So I left my high school after my first semester as a freshman. I just hated my high school. Everyone there was toxic and fake and Iâ€™m short so I got teased a lot and it hurt. Also it was so stressful because of my frequent tests and constant worrying and studying. I hated getting up in the morning and I had the biggest relief every for leaving every day after a long day at school. But then I got tired of all of it and decided to do online school. I started in January and I barely did any of it because I just donâ€™t like how Iâ€™m learning anything. Maybe itâ€™s because I searched up answers for exams but even when I did read the lessons it didnâ€™t help. I do like how I can do it on my own time and Iâ€™m less stressed. But I also donâ€™t like how Iâ€™m teased by my friends cuz I do online school. I didnâ€™t tell them why I left my high school and I donâ€™t want to as it  was due to bullying so I just let the teasing happen. Now idk what to do. Itâ€™s hard for me to go back into high school due to covid and my parents jobs and only one person can take me to school. Idk
