Assaulted by teacher: School does nothing So about a week or two ago I was assaulted by my teacher which left swelling and bruising on my shoulder. This teacher is best friends with the Head Principal of my school, like they work out and do everything together. Well the school has shuffled everything under the rug and has not done anything about it. Iâ€™ve contacted a lawyer, we are going to do everything possible to get this teacher fired and charged, along with a lawsuit against the school and we might leak this story to the press :)
