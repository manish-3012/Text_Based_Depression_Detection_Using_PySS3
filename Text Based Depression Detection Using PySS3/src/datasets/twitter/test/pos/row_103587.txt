I just got reminded of the time we made a teacher cry in class So we were in 7th grade and we were in english class and nobody would shut up, classmates were talking to eachother some were nit even sat on their seats just playing in the middle of the classroom and the teacher was trying to get everyone to sit down but nobody would listen so she just got fed up and she screamed. Everyone imedeatly just shat up and the teacher starting yelling at everyone. She told us stop the things we were doing (yâ€™know how teachers lecture their students for being roudy) but then she started crying. Everyone was just silent, it was akward and sad, then we just sat there until she decided to stop and actually teach us but she just fucking cried until bell rang. I think she trying to get sympathy but these were teenagers, dont expect to get sympathy from teens. She was later fired for unprofessionalism and trying to harm another teacher, pretty sure she wasnt the most mentally stable person. Anyway thats my story on how we got a teacher to cry for 10 minutes straight.
