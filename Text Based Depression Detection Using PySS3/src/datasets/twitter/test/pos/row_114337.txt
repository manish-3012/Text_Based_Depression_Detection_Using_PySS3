I have a magical ability to piss my mom off Like my brother will give my mom shit and argue, my sister will run away to the city, and she can manage her temper with those two most of the time. But if I say one thing in a way she doesn't like or be too slow at a chore or do anything she loses her shit at me. Maybe I do actually deserve it, maybe she attacks me the most because she knows I won't fight back, either way I'm wishing this day would end sooner so she can travel to another state and leave me alone.
