Happy Birthday Justin I know itâ€™s been months since weâ€™ve talked cause, yknow, you blocked me, but I never forgot your birthday. How could I forget, itâ€™s the day before mine. I hope youâ€™ve been doing well. I really hope youâ€™ve gotten better. Iâ€™m sorry if I did something to make you feel the way you did. I was just really trying to help you. But now youâ€™re 18 thatâ€™s exciting. Good luck in your life Justin, I know youâ€™ll be fine. Happy birthday to you!
