My touchpad started working again For hose of you who clicked on this, why?

Anyway now that you're here, let me get to the point.

My touchpad on my ASUS laptop hasn't been working for a week now. Despite endless googling, struggling and asking, i could not get the damn thing to scroll or click and i had to use a mouse, which was not ideal cuz i like keeping the laptop on my lap. Anyway it was getting to me, not being able to use the touchpad.

But then a miracle happened. It started working.

With no prior warning, no nothing, it just all of a sudden decided to work again. I checked if it was working every time i used it, and one day it just did. I have no idea how but i was grateful. Grateful to the gods who had bestowed this blessing upon me. I was thrilled. I had my laptop back.

If you took the time to read this, first off, thanks. And yes i am aware how amazingly stupid this sounds. A touchpad not working? Why the hell should anyone care? Why do *I* care? Why post this on Reddit? Why bother writing this whole essay?

To be honest i don't really know why i posted this, but its something that made me happy, and its a reminder that there are simple things which can drastically change your mood and improve your day. I hope you have a great day, and just remember to do something that makes you happy too.

Now after that little lesson in philosophy
