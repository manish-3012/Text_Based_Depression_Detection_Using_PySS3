Bruh theres so much misinformation on instagram Ya ya social media in general is misinforming but holy shit who decided to just randomly pull a caption out of their ass like bruh the actual story is way more interesting stop pulling this click bate shit and misinforming the younger generation

At this point ive gotten pretty good at spotting a bs post for clout but its still pretty alarming that people will go to these lengths for likes
