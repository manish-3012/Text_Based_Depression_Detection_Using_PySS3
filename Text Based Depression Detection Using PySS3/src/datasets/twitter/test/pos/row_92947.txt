Benefits of having your friend group be exclusively gay men (when youâ€™re a college girl) (Disclaimer: this is all based on my real experiences. No stereotyping is intended.) (Also Iâ€™m not all â€œgay best friend yaay!!â€ thatâ€™s bad donâ€™t get a gay friend just to get a gay friend.)


- You know they arenâ€™t interested in you so thereâ€™s no chance of awkwardness later on


- Got a crush, but heâ€™s a theatre major? Get Gaydarâ„¢ to make sure heâ€™s straight!


- Funny as all hell


- Theyâ€™ll help you do your makeup and paint your nails 


- Someone to duet musical theatre with!


- Theyâ€™ve got some good music that I hadnâ€™t heard before but 100% fits my taste


- Not obsessed with conforming to toxic masculinity and so occasionally actually show A Feeling


- Basically, my friends are all great people and I love them
