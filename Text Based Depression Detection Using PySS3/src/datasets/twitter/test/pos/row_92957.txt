It's so close to March 13th. The day everything became bad. It's closing in on the 1 year mark since a emergency was declared in the US, closing schools, movie theaters, malls, and everything. I don't Want this anymore. I haven't been in school for nearly a year and I feel horrible. It's all just zoom classes.
