It's almost 3AM right now and some type of guy feeling or something hits me I don't know what it is but something feels off like something just happened and I don't know how to find out what 

I really just can't put into words as to what I'm sensing 

I'm sure it's probably nothing hopefully 

Maybe it's just my wack sleeping habits messing with me 

I'm sure most of you probably don't even care I'm not even sure if I care 

Writing it down and coming back to after I maybe fall asleep and recollecting anything is what I think is the best bet right now 

Maybe it's the wrong choice maybe there is something wrong and maybe whatever happened is my fault because im choosing to ignore this 

I guess maybe I'll have to find out

For anyone that did read this any input you don't have to it's really just a reminder for me to check everything when I wake up
