If a ants were bigger they wouldve taken over the world I learnt some stuff about ants through yt videos and they talk to each other by rubbing their thorax with their abdomin to make noise, like ppl do (with our throats instead), have their own languages, like ppl do, they have farms, like ppl do, their own politics, they work in a similar way ppl do, they get paid with food, they have little homes in their colonies, they have roads similar to people do and they've even been seen to stop and have a friendly chat with their friends. If ants were too big to be stepped on, I dont think its unreasonable to say they wouldnt have taken over the world
