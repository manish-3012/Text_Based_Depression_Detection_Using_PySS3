i have a question about clocks so if anyone knows a good sub for it please tell me anyways hereâ€™s the question (if u know the answer pls tell me): if the way a clock measures seconds is by the oscillation or smthg of a quartz crystal, or in an atomic clock an atom, is our perception of seconds based off clocks or are clocks based off our idea of seconds? 

like which came first: the length of a second or the length of a quartz crystalâ€™s vibrations?
