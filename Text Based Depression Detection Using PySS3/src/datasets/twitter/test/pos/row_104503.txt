Someone just tried to break into our house We were all just chilling. Then some random dude suddenly entered the door. Thankfully, we managed to subjugate him. The police came and took him for questioning. I'm scared. I'm sure he isn't alone. I think that he was just here to scout the house. The real deal is out there somewhere...
