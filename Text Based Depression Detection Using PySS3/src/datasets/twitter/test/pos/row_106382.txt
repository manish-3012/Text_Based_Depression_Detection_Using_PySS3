I want to be feminine like guys can be feminine. I donâ€™t know how to explain it. Iâ€™m a girl and being masculine is pretty nice, since ya know itâ€™s not really something thatâ€™s expected for me to be. I donâ€™t want to be a guy tho. I canâ€™t explain it very well, but being masculine as a girl, and feminine as a guy seems nice.
