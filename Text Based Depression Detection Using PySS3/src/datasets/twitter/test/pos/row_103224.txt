Ok I got a question. Why do people even like people in skirts? Honestly I don't see the point of it. Don't see why it's considered hot or anything like that. Just some regular old jeans and shirt already look nice. 

Also, don't say i should put on a skirt. I will never put on a skirt. And even if I did, i got hairy ass legs which most of you wouldn't like.
