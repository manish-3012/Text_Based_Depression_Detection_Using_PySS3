Probably an easy way to meet new people Iâ€™m pretty bored right now so I was wondering if anyone wanted to join a teens discord server that Iâ€™m in. Itâ€™s decently populated and has weekly events for creativity and memes and stuff. It has occasional voice chats for just talking, studying and gaming plus thereâ€™s also a connected D&amp;D server. Just shoot me a pm if you want an invite or if you just want to talk :)
