does anyone else get shivers or tingles of sadness? it's like a weird sensation that runs down my spine, scalp, or leg sometimes and I feel like I'm the only one that experiences something like this. I haven't seen anyone else talking about it. not like that ruble some ppl feel in their stomachs, more like a tingle or something. idk
