Yâ€™all ever go to church and find something that shouldnâ€™t be there I just was coming back from Wednesday night service and found a pack of trulys ( wild berry flavored) and a back of 5 % menthol pods. In the parking lot . They looked like they had been thrown out of the car. Needless to say I took them home and snuck them to my room. Gonna have a fun night tonight . I already own a juul so some fresh pods were nice.


Update:
Opened the first truly and it tasted fine , didnâ€™t explode even though there was some dints in it.
Also the juul pods are real and really fresh. 

Iâ€™ll will update for more
