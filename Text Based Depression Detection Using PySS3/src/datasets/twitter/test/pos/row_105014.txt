Og post was lost in new but update 
Help motivating a friend

My friend and I started a YouTube channel which heâ€™s always wanted to do but didnâ€™t understand the technical side. I made the channel and posted a video and asked him to do the same. The videos havenâ€™t really been seen and itâ€™s discouraging him. I told him to be patient but heâ€™s losing hope. Iâ€™m posting another video right now that will be up later tonight of playing in rec room. All I ask is that you go check it out and if you think the channel has potential subscribe if you wonâ€™t really like the content then donâ€™t

My friend agreed to make another video so letâ€™s keep the views coming in
