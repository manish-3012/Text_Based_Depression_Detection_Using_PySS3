We need to shut this fucking website down. Not reddit, kidschat.net That fucking website is full of pedophiles. I decided to check it out to see if I could hunt any pedos down. I of course used TOR. This was a good idea. You'll find out later.

I eventually caught one. I reported it to the FBI. I reported it to the staff and admins on the site.

What do they do?

[**Kidschat.net**](https://Kidschat.net) **has banned this IP address.** Luckily, I was using TOR. I opened up a new circuit on TOR, and hunted more down.

# They know who their primary audience is, and they know who uses their site.

YouTubers Nexpo and Mamamax have both done videos on this site from hell. But I haven't seen any action being taken. You can help.

Just wanted to bring this bask to light.
