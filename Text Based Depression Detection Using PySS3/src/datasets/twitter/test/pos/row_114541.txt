I just sent all my teachers homework So I just sent all my teachers homework.

I found pdf printouts and website practices online, and sent each teacher a bunch of them according to the subject they teach.

I told them all "the recent influx and workload is due to your lack of progress in the past few weeks".

Of course all of this was a joke, and all the teachers were cool with it because I am lucky enough to have cool teachers. But I want them in by Friday! 

The science teacher even did a page or 2. I printed those off and am going to "turn them in" for credit today.
