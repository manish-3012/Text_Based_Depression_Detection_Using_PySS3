After talking with some people... Iâ€™ve finally started to think Iâ€™m attractive. For all my life Iâ€™ve been shitted and told I wasnâ€™t good enough. From being rejected with responses like â€œEw gross,â€ to â€œEat shit,â€ and to the classic â€œFuck off,â€ I didnâ€™t think I would ever be found good looking ever. But some good friends from this sub Iâ€™ve finally turned that around and have led me to finally seeing my worth. To all of you who have helped me, you know who you are. To those who also struggle and/or are struggling like me, those are afraid of talking with people due to fear of being shit on again, just know this: you have worth and you will find it. I was just like you. You might not find it tomorrow or this week, but you will find it. Please keep your heads held high Kings and Queens because you all have to rule your kingdoms throughout all turmoil. :)
