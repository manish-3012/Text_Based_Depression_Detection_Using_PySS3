Sometimes I wish I could read peopleâ€™s minds And I know thereâ€™d be soooo many cons coming from it but also,

This cute guy in my class walked my route after class?? And I think he uses a different route usually so Iâ€™m like, did he wanna walk with me?? Because itâ€™s *me* or because he just wants to talk to someone on the way home? My friend was there but he only really talks to me in that class 

Itâ€™d be so nice if I could just know an ounce of what he thinks of me without confronting?? Bc confrontation is scary when rejection is on the line lmao
