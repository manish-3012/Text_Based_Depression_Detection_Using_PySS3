Am i the only one here who hates thinking, talking or doing anything about Love Life / Girlfriends / Boyfriends? It's just boring and it hurts too much to think about it. I simply avoid it. You only get hurt in the End.   
Ye cuddling and all is nice but in the end you break up then you cry say dramatic stuff and whatnot. Not to mention It's complex and a bit Expensive.   


I already accept the fact that i will die alone.   
I'll just find a way of dying early. I bet the Military is a nice option.
