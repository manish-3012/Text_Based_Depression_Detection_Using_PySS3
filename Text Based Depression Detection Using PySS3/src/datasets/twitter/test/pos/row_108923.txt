how do u do school  My school rn is part online and part in person. When I'm online I just mute my teacher, and in-person school sucks.  I do the bare minimum so I can get average grades, so my parents don't get mad.

But it's so fucking boring. There's no reason to do any of it. Is there a legit way to get through this garbage without going insane.
