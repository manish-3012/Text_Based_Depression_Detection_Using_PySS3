The game Guess Who is ruined. I tried playing the game â€œGuess Whoâ€ with my friend in school. We were guessing like we usually do in any class we play in but one class we got in trouble for playing. My friend asked â€œis your person blackâ€ and the teacher gave us a look. Then I asked â€œis your person a femaleâ€ then the teacher came over to us and told us to stop playing because â€œyour assuming someones gender and race. Like, can we not just play our kid friendly guessing game in peace anymore?
