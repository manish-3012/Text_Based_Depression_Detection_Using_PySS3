Stop scrolling. Place your hand near your cheek. Just lightly, with the mere tips of your fingers, touch your cheek. Lightly drag it up to your forehead. Back down. Repeat this with your eyes closed. This is what human touch feels like. You will feel that (again or for the first time) one day.  That will be the touch of someone who loves you.  Its too good to miss.
