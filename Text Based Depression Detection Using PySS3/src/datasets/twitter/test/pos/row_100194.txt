I don't care about karma. I just thought this is where I could get the most help. My mom might have pancreatic cancer.. My mom might have pancreatic cancer and were going to have to wait a few days before she can go do some tests. I'm just scared. I'm on a walk with my dog right now trying to chill out. 

She has had pain in her back once a year for like 3 weeks for 8 years, and finally she started going to the chiropractor, who when she told her about her back said that its probably kidney stones, I dont really know the rest. 

She went in to the hospital to check if she had kidney stones and after a CT scan they said they saw a mass but that's where the kidney stones would potentially be, a doctor said she had pancreatic cancer but the next day her usual doctor said its unbelievable that the other doctor came to that conclusion especially with the whole 8 year history pointing to kidney stones...

I dont know but even a nurse came in the first night and talked to her about it....

I just want some positive energy and thoughts pointing to her just in case thst helps. Her name is julie. I'm her 18 year old son.
