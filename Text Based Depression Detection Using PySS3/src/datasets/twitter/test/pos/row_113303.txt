I had a miscommunication with my boyfriend just now I texted him asking if he likes anybody else. He said no, and why I would think that. It's because he goes to school with everyone else and we hardly see each other anymore. So I get worried that he likes other people. He said "do you?" I thought he was asking if I liked him so I said yes. But he was asking me the same thing I asked him. It got cleared up pretty quick but I feel so awful
