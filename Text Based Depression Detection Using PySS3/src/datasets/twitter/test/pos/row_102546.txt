Idk man So basically i like this girl. Literally I've known her since I moved,  which was idk 4 to 5 years, I told my friends about her and how nice she is, and they said I should get in touch. I've been talking to her for a couple months every week, just to catch up. Ever since my family members passed on, I was talking to her daily. But I think the vibe just isn't there man, it's not like she likes me, but I remember I got a letter from her when she moved away that she liked me, and I told my friends about it, and they tell me to make moves all the time, but I don't know when to just tell her. I drop hints from. Time to time but idk. It seems alright to try, but she seems so busy all the time.
