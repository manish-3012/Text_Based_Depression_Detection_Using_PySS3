My Samsung Galaxy Tab A is tweaking and all my drawings for my future bidness is on here ðŸ˜© Its flashing with the charge symbol thing for the past 10 mins I know this is repairs but y'all are smart right? I was on my tablet drawing until it died  at like 6:30pm, and came back and hour later and it wouldn't turn on. Now it's flashing n' ish with the charge symbol and it's plugged into my portable charger rn so it can be close to me. Shiiiii first my phone dies in 15 minutes after being on only 50% and now my tablet that I draw for tees on isn't working ðŸ˜­ HELP
