I have chocolate and free time what should i bake? I havenâ€™t baked in a while so i thought i could make something today. My dad also bought baking chocolate so itâ€™s the perfect opportunity.

Also i would prefer something other than brownies or cookies, i know theyâ€™re hella good but i always make them and wanna try something different for once
