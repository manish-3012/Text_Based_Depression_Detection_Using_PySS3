itâ€™s been almost 3 years since i tried to kill myself. iâ€™m just really proud of myself. the only reason iâ€™m saying it here is because no one knows i tried to do this, not even my family. i donâ€™t really have anyone to be happy about this with so i guess redditâ€™s gonna be my person this time.
