One more year Just turned 17 today and Iâ€™m kinda nervous for whatâ€™s to come once Iâ€™m an adult. Tbh thereâ€™s so much I want to do, but Iâ€™m scared of all the responsibilities ahead of me. I have confidence that I can probably make the long road ahead of me, but being only 5â€™9 and having a bit of a higher voice, I still feel like a kid.
Is anyone else in the same boat as me?
