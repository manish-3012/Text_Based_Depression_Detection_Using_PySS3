Weebs are the most oppressed minority Like why the fuck does everyone give me weird looks when I say I watch anime? I only started over the summer so Iâ€™m a pretty new anime enjoyer but I still get people saying wow what a weeb and shut like that. We also have no representation in government, last time I checked there was no anime political party. Yea some anime enjoyers are cringe but no need to be mean.
