My mom and stepdad finally got married today. It's been an emotional day, to say the least. I cried twice (almost more), ate good food, had nice cake, got to watch my mom be really happy, and surprisingly danced a lot.














Out of all the guys my mom has dated (not saying it in a negative way), I'm really glad it was him that she married. He was in a shitty place before they met, and she turned his life around and put him back on track. It's nice to see them both happy.
