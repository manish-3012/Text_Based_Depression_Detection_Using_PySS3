I have three resolutions for 2021, feel free to share yours to inspire others :) Mine are:

1. Be more confident in myself - I donâ€™t like the way I look because of my acne. I need to prove to myself that no one really pays any attention to my face when they talk to me and usually will focus on the conversation at hand

2. Find a job or get my first commission- Iâ€™ve never had a paid job or anything that will bring in any sort of income, so this is the year for me!

3. Take phone calls - I hate phone calls. I absolutely hate them with all my being, but I understand that they are important in life and that I will have to take phone calls in the future

What are your new year resolutions? :D
