Imagine sending away your dog and calling it a bad dog because it killed your bird because it didn't know if it was a threat or not and it was part of it's instinct That's Logan Paul for ya. He calls her a bitch, and a murderer. Logan should have trained her better before sending her away like that. Plus its a MASTIFF!!

Look, I know it's sad that the bird, he got only to make money off of it, died. But seriously, what do you think is going to happen when a big dog meets a tiny bird they think is a threat and know nothing about?
