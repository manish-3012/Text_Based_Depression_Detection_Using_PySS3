I failed I failed my drivings lisence test (the 2 times I took it), I failed maths, I failed physics, I failed chemistry, and I failed language. My mom called me a failiure the other day in a moment of rage and it hit me, I honestly feel like one right now. I don't even want to study to pass anything anymore, I don't want to do nothing. I feel pretty much useless. I feel alone.
