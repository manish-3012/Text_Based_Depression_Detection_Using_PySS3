Itâ€™s 6:01 am and Iâ€™ve been up all night reminiscing in my head about the days before covid Iâ€™m absolutely miserable right now, I missed out on my senior year, missed prom, missed graduation and my life is boring as fuck. Iâ€™ve been up all night thinking about how good I had it right before covid started. Those memories of my daily routine are running through my head and I canâ€™t stop them. Everything changed so fast. One week I was at a debate tournament, I was practicing for the talent show, I was chatting with my friends on the way to runningstart classes. The next week, I was home and had no idea how long this was gonna last. I hate my life and I canâ€™t sleep because of how much I hate my life right now. Fuck covid and fuck my brain for not shutting up. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­
