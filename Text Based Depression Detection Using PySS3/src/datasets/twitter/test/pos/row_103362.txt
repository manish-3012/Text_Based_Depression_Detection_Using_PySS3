I Didn't Think I would Live to See My 18th Birthday, but I Guess I've Made it. Hi,

My name is Wren, I'm MtF transgender, and I turned 18 today. I have been struggling with depression and a whole host of other mental health issues for a really long time. When I was 15, I couldn't see a light at the end of a tunnel, everything was falling apart, and I thought my life was over. I was not functioning well at all.

I was struggling with anorexia, anxiety, major depression, suicidal ideation, self-harm, dysphoria, and lots of trauma. I really wasn't doing well. I was in the process of coming out to a very conservative family, watching my GPA tank, and dealing with bullying and harassment almost constantly. I had been kicked out of my boarding-school and home for 2 1/2 years due to mental health and had no fucking clue what I was doing with my life. I was incredibly lonely and most of my social interaction was from hanging out with people in depression or suicide chatrooms.

The last 3 years have been really fucking hard. I have lost almost everyone I used to know before coming out. Half of my family is unaccepting and won't acknowledge me as Wren. I have been harassed, assaulted, given death and rape threats, and been on the receiving end of some horrible shit. But for some reason I'm still here. I've tried killing myself twice, and should have died more times than that, but God or ***something*** wants me here and I don't have a choice the matter.

I feel like I didn't start existing until a year and a half ago, and that everything before that is a former life. It may as well be with how much everything has changed. It's like I'm a person that has been forged in a crucible of suffering and pain. I've gone through a difficult and destructive growing process as a person. But with everything I've been through, I've never felt more secure in who I am.

I know myself, and I understand what drives other people better than I ever could have before. I'm less judgmental, more accepting, and more productive than I was. I'm very very far from perfect, but I'm a more balanced and decent person than I used to be.

I know what my purpose is in life, and I feel driven to meet it. I want to help other people who are struggling like I was. I'm not exactly sure *how* I want to do that, but I think being a public-defender or a therapist would make good use of my skills. I could be a musician or a woodworker, or work doing any number of other things that I enjoy. But if I take the help I was given and pay it forward, then I could help 20 or 30 other people grow and overcome their struggles.

I still have depression and I'm incredibly lonely most of the time, but I'm capable of handling it, and I'm a high-functioning depressive person. No matter how bad I feel or how bad things get, I don't consider killing myself, because I know that I can work through it, and that there's going to be some silver lining I can hold onto. I remember telling my girlfriend when I was 16 that, "I'm either going to die really young, or live for a really long time". I guess the former is no longer an option, so the latter it is!

I'm sorry if this post came across as disjointed. I just feel really hopeful today, and I wanted to share some good vibes with everyone. I also want to congratulate myself for getting this far, and to try and reach out to anyone who's struggling like I was. Even if things don't get better for a really long time, ***you*** will get better. Even if you can't see it right now, you are growing, you are good enough, and this struggle is going to make you better. PTSD, Depression, Anxiety, and anything else you're struggling with might not make you stronger in the moment. But you can harness your pain and develop a greater understanding for people and what makes them tick.

Take care,

Wren =3
