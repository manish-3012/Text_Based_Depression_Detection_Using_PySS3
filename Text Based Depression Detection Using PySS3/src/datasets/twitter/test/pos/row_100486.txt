Posting this here since it's has been removed from r/casualconversation I am so fucking sad right, I had a dream where I had a boyfriend and was gay. It's was a boy in yellow jacket and we had a fake marriage in my street and everybody i know was there. I was in love with him and then a waked up and now I am sad. I don't why I am sad, I like girls and I am straight. shit, dude. That dream made a fuss in my emotions and I am so confused right now
