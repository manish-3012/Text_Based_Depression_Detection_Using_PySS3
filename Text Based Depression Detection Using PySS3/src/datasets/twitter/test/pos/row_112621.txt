I need to get my shit together Right now it is 5:55 am i have been awake sinse 2 am and i have been doing school work the entire time. Why? my school is starting in about 2 hours and 40 min and before yesterday i havent even started with my work. My mom is gonna wale up in 5 min and i still need to get ny school clothes shes gonna be pissed when she sees i didnt take it out yet. My room has a bunch of papers and clothes all over and it loojs pretty fucking messy. I have been jerking off and drinking energy drinks to get away from the stress and now i still need to do my sosial studies and math work.

What im trying to say is im fucked. and if u still need to do your work go do it and dont waste your time like i did.

now if u will excuse me i have to go search for my math book
