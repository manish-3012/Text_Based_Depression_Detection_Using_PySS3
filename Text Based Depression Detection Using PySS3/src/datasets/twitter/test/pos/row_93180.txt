I want to forget I want to forget my exâ€™s, how I loved them, and how they crushed me by cheating. everyone Iâ€™ve ever been with I was cheated on. the pain is just so much sometimes, and now I have trust issues. I try to move on but no matter who I text they donâ€™t wanna talk to me. Iâ€™m alone with my thoughts and all I want is to forget the pain
