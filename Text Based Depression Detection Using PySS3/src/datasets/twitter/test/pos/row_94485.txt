Just a friendly reminder that you can advocate for your self academically :) If you feel something isn't right in how your teacher is treating you or your assignments (ie picking favorites treating other students like trash or not giving your assignments the credit they deserve or not honoring their syllabus) then talk to the teacher about it. Preferably through email so you have a "paper trail" and can follow up with counseling or admin if they still won't budge or just straight up won't answer. It's your education, and some teachers need a reality check. They be getting a little too comfortable sometimes :)))))


You're not a snitch, you're not a kiss up. But if it's serious and is impacting your ability to learn in the classroom and/or your grades, you need to be the one to change that. Advocate for yourself please.
