I'm having trouble moving on Have you guys ever met a girl that gave you a bunch of fake hope and in the end you guys never got together? Happened to me and I've been wanting to move on ever since but I'm having trouble moving on and it's almost been a year since it happened, I also found out that it recently has been easily affecting my mood but I dont know what to do with it. Do you guys have any advice for me?
