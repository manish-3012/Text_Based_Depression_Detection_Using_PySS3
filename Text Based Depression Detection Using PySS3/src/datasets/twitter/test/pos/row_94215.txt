Iâ€™m turning 15 in 5 days. I turned 14 nearly a year ago, but I feel like Iâ€™ve been 14 forever. 14 was the age where I truly became aware of my world. I started actually transitioning into an adult. I had never felt that way before. Anything before my 14th birthday feels like a million years ago to me. Now, my age is once again going to increase. However, I feel ready for it. My life has not changed very much for the past five months, and I feel very bored. May this new era of my life hold exciting new times!
