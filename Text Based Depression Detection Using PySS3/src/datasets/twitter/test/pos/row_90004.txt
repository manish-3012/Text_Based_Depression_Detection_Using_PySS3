dont ever let yourself settle for being someone's second choice pls just take it from me, i had to learn the hard way. don't put yourself through that. it's not worth it, and you deserve someone that will put you above anything else and you will find that person. just dont settle for anything less than you are bc no matter how hard you want it to work, it never will.
