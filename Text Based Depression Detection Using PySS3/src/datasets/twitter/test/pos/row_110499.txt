My elder sibling and his friend (brotherly figure to me) told my physics teacher that I have issues while studying I know this will lead to nothing just my teacher calling me out in front of 14 classmates whom I've never met. Now no one will like me and everyone will think that I'm the dumbest student in the class. OMG!! OMG!! OMG!! panik panik. What will I say when the teacher will ask me what's the issue?
