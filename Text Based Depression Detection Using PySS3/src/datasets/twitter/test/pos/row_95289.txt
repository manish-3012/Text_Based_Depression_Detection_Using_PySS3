I canâ€™t stop crying I feel so bad. My brain feels yucky and itâ€™s making my body feel yucky. everything is hard. socializing is. my parents fighting is. now Iâ€™m thinking I blame my problems on my mom and dads relationship issues. My grades are terrible, Iâ€™ve lost so many friends. This girl liked me back but I fucked that up. I feel so lonely. I feel disgusting posting here about my mental health issues, but I really need something to lift my mood.
