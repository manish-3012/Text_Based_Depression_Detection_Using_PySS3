This is for my spanish speakers here So you know how Llanas are supposed to not have a â€™ when it ends in a n or s or vowel? 

So why does policÃ­a have a tilde? It's a Llana no?

po-li-cÃ­-a.

But it ends in a vowel. So why tf does it have it???????

There's other words like this but i forgot them 

Why are they the exception? What made them the exception????

Â¡AAAAAGGGHHHHH!
