Today, my crush told me who he likes. It's not me. We're friends, and, I was bugging him about his crush, and he's been hanging out with this girl a lot lately and I was like "Oh my god, do you like \*her name\*?" And he smiled and said no, but he eventually admitted that yes, he likes her, and I feel like shit right now. I really like him and he clearly doesn't like me back and now I feel sad, so I'm probably gonna go eat chips and watch sad movies and cry my eyes out.
