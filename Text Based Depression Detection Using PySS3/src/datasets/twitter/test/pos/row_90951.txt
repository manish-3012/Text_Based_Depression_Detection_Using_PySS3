I just got a really creepy dm So someone ON HERE said who wanted to chat and so I said yeah sure why not. We were opposite genders, (Iâ€™m a guy) and it turns out that that person was.....well.....horny apparently. And they wanted me to do something about it, making me very uncomfortable.


I got disturbed, and even grossed out. I immediately blocked them and quit the chat. 

So, in conclusion, most likely I will delete this account and even Reddit altogether now. I also want to say, that yes, there are girls who do this type of stuff apparently, not just guys. Either gender, itâ€™s still messed up in my opinion, and gross.
