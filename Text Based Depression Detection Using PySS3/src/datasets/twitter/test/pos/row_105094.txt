Why are some people like this My sister saw a group of freshman students who were hanging out in my apartment complex's lobby. A city lockdown is happening right now due to the rise in covid cases. Currently, social gatherings are completely prohibited. This just shows that they do not care about the lockdown whatsoever. 

This isn't even the first time that the same group of kids were caught doing something as inconsiderate as this. 

Those freshmen go to the same school as I do. Someone in my household is in the high risk age group. I'm a senior student who cannot afford to have online school. I already have enough stress from part-time classes, and online school will make everything worse for me.
