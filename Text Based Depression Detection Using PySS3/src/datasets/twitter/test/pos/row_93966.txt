How should I meet up with my girlfriend? So I started dating someone a few weeks back, sheâ€™s a friend of one of my closest friends. We chatted on discord throughout lockdown, just hanging out and having a good time.

About two weeks back, we both admitted that we had a crush on each other and we are now dating. She lives about a fifteen minute drive away. The problem is I live in a particularly isolated area, the closest neighbour I have is still pretty far away and she doesnâ€™t go to my school. I am anxious about what my parents would say as we havenâ€™t really previously talked about relationships as itâ€™s not really something I get myself into that often.
Thanks for the advice in advance.
