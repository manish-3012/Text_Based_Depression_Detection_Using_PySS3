Some kid knows my IP address I'll explain this best I can, in greentext format

&gt;Be me

&gt;7th grade

&gt;Be in this class that assists in math

&gt;Only be in there if you failed the math test at the end of the year prior

&gt;Have one kid in that class

&gt;Become good friends

&gt;Ffw to 8th grade

&gt;Friend starts saying he can hack people

&gt;Dont believe him

&gt;He tells me to give him my insta

&gt;Do that

&gt;Him and his cousin put me in group chat

&gt;They begin threatning me

&gt;Explain how they have my home address as well

&gt;Saying how i'll be murdered or raped (Im a dude)

&gt;Kinda fear for family

&gt;They slow down my internet for a good week

&gt;forget about it 

&gt;ffw to present day

&gt;They have slowed down my ps4 speed for a solid month

&gt;Laptop works, phone works, PS4 is the only thing being slow

&gt;Not too concerned for family, more concerned for PS4. Cant play games no more

&gt;I have no online classes with him or any form of contact

&gt;dont know his home address

&gt;He probably doesnt even go to my HS 

What do?
