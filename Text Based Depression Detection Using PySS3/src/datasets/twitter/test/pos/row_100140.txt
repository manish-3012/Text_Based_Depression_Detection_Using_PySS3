Is this considered an invasion of privacy? So my dad recently got me (13F) and my brother (13M) a phone, but they said that we had to tell them our passcode, so we did. But lately I've noticed that my phone goes missing at around 12am-2am. My brothers phone has been gone as well. 

As it turns out, my dad was taking them from us to read our messages, and to check our social media. He'd accidentally let it slip. Like most people, I have quite a few things I keep secret from my dad (sexuality, opinions, religion, etc). 

I trust him a LOT, and I feel like they should know some things that are going on in my life, but I think that this crosses the line.

Is this pushing the boundaries, or am I just overreacting?
