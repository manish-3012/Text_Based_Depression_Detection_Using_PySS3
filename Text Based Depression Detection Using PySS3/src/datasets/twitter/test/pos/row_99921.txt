The discusion culture in here is the worst So i had had this argument a while back, one side putting up points, me explaining mine.  
I try to explain it in a way, so that it can be understood, usually in an argument my goal is to convince or be convinced. 

And I also sometimes take positions, that not everyone might agree with, however instead of then looking at my fucking points and trying to understand them, as soon as the opinion isn't equal to the hive's, everyone is merely looking for one small thing that out of context would make no sense and use that to downvote the shit out of me and replying that point over and over.

Then I painfully write a reply to every single one of these comments that critcized me, elaborating on what I meant to convey, and guess what, not a single reply! The downvotes however are still there.

Then there is a situation that happend just now:   
I tell my opinion about something,   
downvotes go BRRRR,   
someone answers,  
I answer them,  
they don't answer  
suddenly we both have downvotes from other people watching, gg.

&amp;#x200B;

Being able to just downvote a comment, without having to answer it, just because you don't like the opinion is not healthy for any discussion really...

And it's not even that i fucking care about reddit karma, but: Because I had the "wrong" opinion, I now have this 10 minute buffer again which is the stupidest thing if you just wanna browse some posts,   
because all it's doing, is making me open a baghzillion tabs to save comments, posting them one after another.

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, people should be able to set their posts to ignore votes in any direction, so people have to actually bring up a point in order to disagree.

Also guys, if you don't have a point you could make against a comment, then do not fucking downvote please!
