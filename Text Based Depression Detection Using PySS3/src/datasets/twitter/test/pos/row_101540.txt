I've given up I've been speaking to a girl who I met recently and we were really having a connection and she called me cute and was giving me hints and flirting, then she started talking about a guy she had a crush on and was asking me for advice.
Just to say this isn't the first time this has happened to me its happened like 3 times now. I'm just sick of being rejected. I try so hard and get nothing out of it.
