So my crush asked me to prom today Id been wanting to ask her for a while now.. but was scared to ask cause i didnt want to ruin any of her plans..

And.. prom got cancelled (technically).. in the sense.. we have a party, but prom isnt the theme.. so if you dont choose to bring someone, thats cool too. So i thought i shouldnt ask her then.. but welp

And what makes it even more special is the fact that it was her birthday, and we threw a surprise party for her, and out of no fucking where she called me to her balcony, and asked me out.
