So I just had a Mentalbreakdown I had some free periods and I just wanted to clean up a little, which also included changing my bed sheets, but my cat was laying on it, so I couldn't do that. First I just sat around getting depressed and then I put on some really sad music. Then I started picking some clothes from the floor and throwing them into the laundry basket (which is actually a huge thing, cause I haven't really been doing laundry since online class, just kinda wearing the same outfit for days and then throwing it on the floor) and then I picked up other random stuff laying around and I started whipping dust of my shelves. And then I got the vacuum cleaner, threw everything peace of furniture that was not my bed, my desk or my closet in the hall and vacuumed everything... I kinda got aggressive cause, well Idk stuff was happening. And after I was done, I tried putting everything back, but I knocked over my trash can (it wasn't that much in it, but still) and I just screamed. Not like yelling, just high pitched screams. And the I threw some stuff around. But my father was in the next room so he heard all of it. Then he just kind of jokingly asked what was going on and then I cried while he hugged me... Cause i don't even know what's going on...

In all that time, I should have read a book for class and eaten lunch, cause I'm starving, but I don't want to eat, cause Idk
Pls help :)
I'm better now, but it's been happening a lot lately.
