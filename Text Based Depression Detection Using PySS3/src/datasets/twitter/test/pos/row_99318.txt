Sleep is frickin weird. It was 7PM, I had a stomach ache, and thought "maybe I should fall asleep earlier than usual" (much earlier). I ended up falling asleep and having a dream about the Pokemon presentation that airs on February 26th. I woke up expecting to watch the presentation first thing in the morning. I looked at the clock and was surprised to see it said 10PM. I had only slept 3 hours. I swear it felt like I slept for at least until morning. When I woke up it almost felt like I woke up in a parallel universe or something. At least my stomach ache went away.
