I will take a non-biased perspective on which sex has it worse Firstly, we will discuss men.
Men go through a lot, people, no matter what sex, go through alot. Now let's see what men go through. They are forced to bottle down emotions which is pretty bad, (depression rates between sexes disputed so I won't touch on that) the court system heavily leans towards women, which can be very bad, a man can lose everything, and which in the same situation, a woman loses little to nothing. Men also have a few benefits, they are naturally stronger and bigger than a woman, if you put a man against a woman (average man and woman) a man will probably beat her into oblivion. So this can give men an authority complex, granted this is rare and shouldn't be a justification for hating men. 
Boys growing up also suffer problems in school, teachers are usually biased towards girls (especially if the teacher is female, if a male teacher is biased towards girls the FBI needs to be called) and the American school system is weighed more for girls to succeed, this is in Elementary school mostly. A boy once got in trouble for chewing a Pop Tart into the shape of a gun. Which is something boys are interested in. Most things boys are interested (guns, war, action, hero stories, video games) are repressed for more girl like things. Which makes things hard.

Now let's get to women, they are expected to be pretty, and are more likely to be sexually abused, and periods, oh god, periods, this shit is painful and shouldn't exist, it is the unholy spawn of Satan himself, I don't see how its possible for women to go through this shit for 10 days per month, it is painful, it shouldn't exist, it justifies why women get everything handed to them, oh god, thinking about it makes me scared.

My final verdict, men have it worse, but who cares? Men aren't people. Jk, but if any women can help expand the bad things for women list, feel free to
