Do you want more boys in skirts? Then join r/BoysInSkirts, because I need your help. r/BoysInSkirts

I have made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BoysInSkirts/) calling for a mod of the subreddit. Considering that the meme has blown up over the past few days, and it's not a new meme whatsoever, I figured that bringing it to everyone's attention would be the best way to find a new mod. I'm not interested in modding it, but maybe someone here is, and I'd like that person to be actually interested in creating a community around this meme.

 Please read the instructions, and comment here if you have any questions. The sub will be unrestricted here soon enough.
