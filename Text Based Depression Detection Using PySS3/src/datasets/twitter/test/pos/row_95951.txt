My YouTube channel project. Please help by subscribing ðŸ˜Š 
Hello r/teenagers, Iâ€™m a young teen from Australia and have recently started a YouTube channel. It is about my nonnoâ€™s inspirational life stories and it would be appreciated if you could check it out. The reason I made this channel is because my nonno has so many funny, inspirational and wholesome stories to tell before he eventually passes it away. It would be great if you could check it out. Thanks
