Whatâ€™s a good idea for a second date Basically title. Weâ€™re not really â€˜datingâ€™ dating, but we both like each other and have gone out before. The first time we just met up at a park and fucked around for an hour before her mom basically told us we need to go home

So what should I do for date two? I want it to be nice and fun, but almost everything is closed and her parents are super strict
