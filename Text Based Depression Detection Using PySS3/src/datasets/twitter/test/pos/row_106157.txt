The whole class hates me what the hell do i do So when when went outside in English class 3 weeks ago (like we always do on Friday)  there where two kids fighting with sticks. So I naturally stopped them and stopped them. Then the teacher saw me with the sticks. Then for the last three weeks the class hasnâ€™t been allowed outside. The whole class hates me. Constantly getting annoyed about it and the teacher even allowed kids to make drawings mocking me and put it up on the front of the class. So the lesson is that if you try to do something good life will f**k you up.
