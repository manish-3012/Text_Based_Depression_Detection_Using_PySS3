im having some problems , i need advice so, my dad asked me (a 14 year old) what i want to do for college, and then i was like 'yea, ive been thinking about it but i dont want to rush yet' , and he was like 'true, u cant be rushing' the next day he comes and asks me the same thing again, and i said 'i cant rush this i need time' and he started to yell at me and left the room. a few days later i had a job in mind, so i went and told him that i want to pursue a career in media and editing, and i want to be a video editor, and goes 'if u want to continue that junk tell me now because then i can stop sending you to school and atleast save some money'.

like what am i supposed to do now, i cant think of anything, and my mom keeps saying i have an 'attitude' and i have to fix that to become a 'proper child'.

at this point its like they're not allowing me to be myself.
