Why has the population of America become lazier, greedier, and more stupid? We worship celebrities and athletes instead of scientists and engineers. We spend money on pointless wars we can't afford. We worship excessive greed. We don't speak out against the violent gang cultures in many American cities. We allow a tiny percentage of the population to hoard all the wealth.

What happened America?
