Boys did you ever just... ..found a girl that is just absolutely gorgeous from her face, voice, personality that all you wanna do is to admire her? Literally thinking nothing but admiring her, and it gives you this feeling you cant really pinpoint or describe but it felt..., magical. It felt like youâ€™re in an unending grass field filled with flowers and blue sky, white puffy clouds, hill in the distance and wind blowing softly ever so often. It felt like youâ€™re in peace.

Just thought i share it here since i dont really know someone that i could share this feeling i felt.

And no there is no chance of me asking her out because i havenâ€™t even met her physically nor online. 

All right thats all thanks for reading my thoughts i really appreciate that you read this and that a forum like this exist. :)
