Yea this is not ok I've seen multiple posts about tragedies such as suicide, a loved ones death, or other things related. Many, if not all of these posts, have awards such as "wholesome", which is an obvious troll, rude, inconsiderate, and sickening. A post I made months ago on another account on r/Suicidewatch was awarded with wholesome and I'm deceased, so I was wondering if you guys would answer: do you think we should be able to disable awards on posts or entire subreddits?
