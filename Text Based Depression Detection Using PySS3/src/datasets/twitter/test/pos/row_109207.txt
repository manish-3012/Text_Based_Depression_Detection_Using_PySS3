My friends think im a bully and they are harrasing me as a "joke" This all began when I said I stole jakes girlfriend (fake name: Jake) I was being sarcastic. Jake and his girlfriend dated in June, But they only dated for 3 days. Since jakes girlfriend was my bestfriend in 4th grade I texted her saying Hello like a normal person. I thought it would be funny to say i stole Jakes girlfriend, it was obvious sarcasm. A month later Im getting messages that im a jerk for saying i stole jakes girlfriend in reality it was a joke i never flirted with jakes girlfriend nothing. Jake even says I never did anything wrong. The kid that started the alligations is Alex with no evidence and every one of my friends turned on me. Today everyones mad at me for doing nothing i showed evidence and im still getting hate, its at the point of getting suicidal thoughts, I told my sister the situation she told me to cut them off because ill get new friends in highsxhool,I didnt listen since im attached to that group of friends now they are bullying me for no reason such as mimicking making fun of my height ignoring me and being mad at me for no reason
