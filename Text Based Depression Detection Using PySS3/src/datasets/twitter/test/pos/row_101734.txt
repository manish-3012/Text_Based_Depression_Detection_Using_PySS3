I got yeeted out of existence So like 4 weeks ago my girlfriend fucking dumped me. And I always thought that if/when we break up, Iâ€™d be devastated. But Iâ€™m not. I mean sometimes I get sad, but not often at all. And TBH I wasnâ€™t really feeling it. And so now, My best friend has a sister of whom Iâ€™ve been friends for a while. And low-key, Iâ€™ve always liked her. Iâ€™m just asking the people if I should ask her out already, or if itâ€™s too soon after getting dumped?
