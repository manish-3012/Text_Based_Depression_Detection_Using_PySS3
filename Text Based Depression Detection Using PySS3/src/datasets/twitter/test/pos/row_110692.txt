My parents literally discredit me for everything. Hi, Ik this might sound kinda stupid, but I need yalls advice. I have an older sister (22) who lives with us. Ever since we were kids, she was always the center of attention. When she was in high school-college, she would always get what she wanted, new phone, clothes, car everything. Literally my parents would give her $300 a week to go out and buy clothes. For me its been different. I had to beg my parents for 1 year to get a gaming pc which was only $600, when my sister asked for a laptop she got it within a week even tho it was $1200. Itâ€™s always been her word over mine for my parents. If she called me an idiot and I called her something back, it would instantly be my fault. Its just so fucked up. I literally do everything my mom asks. My parents work 9am-6pm. And my sister works at home 9am-5:30pm. So Iâ€™m the only one free all day since I have online school and so I just wash the dishes, vacuum sometimes and etc, and sometimes make lunch if my mom didnâ€™t make anything. And as soon as I get in an argument with my sister and I say that I do more things in the house, and I help mom and dad more then her my whole family is like No you donâ€™t do anything. Its so fucked up. This shit been going on for years, Iâ€™m just so over it.
