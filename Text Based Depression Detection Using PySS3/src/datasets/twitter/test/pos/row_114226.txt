My online friend who was gone for over a month just reappeared Thereâ€™s a guy online who Iâ€™ve been talking to on discord daily since quarantine happened and he became one of my closest friends. Sometime at the beginning of September he just....disappeared. He wasnâ€™t answering anyone, some of the people on the server were his real life friends and he wasnâ€™t answering them either. He was one of my closer friends at that point. And today he just...came back to play with us. Out of nowhere. I asked him why he was gone for so long but he wouldnâ€™t answer and I didnâ€™t want to pressure him into sharing something he wasnâ€™t comfortable with. But heâ€™s just...back. After ignoring dms and everyone and everything, he just came back out of no where. I should be happy about this, but instead I feel like crying and am in shock. Iâ€™m angry but also not. I genuinely thought he was gone forever. I detached myself emotionally and moved on and now heâ€™s back and he promised he would never permanently leave us and I just...I donâ€™t know how to feel about that. I should be happy but instead I feel like crying.
