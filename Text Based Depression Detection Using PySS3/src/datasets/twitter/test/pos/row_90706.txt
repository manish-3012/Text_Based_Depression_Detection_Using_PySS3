i just cut my balls while trying to shave them so today i noticed my pubes were beginning to grow a bit long, so naturally i pick up a razor and start shaving, what i didn't know is that i apparently need a lot more practice, because that hurt, i know it just sounds like a made up story for karma, and i wish it was, but sadly it isn't.
