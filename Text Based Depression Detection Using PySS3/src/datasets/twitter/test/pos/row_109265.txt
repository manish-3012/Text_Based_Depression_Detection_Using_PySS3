How the hell are people so talented? Like I know so many people that are great at everything. Art, music, singing, writing, talking, cooking, sports, being good looking, being funny, etc. Why am I so not good at any of those? Like damn I know I'm the bottom of the barrel but why did I end up so darn useless.
