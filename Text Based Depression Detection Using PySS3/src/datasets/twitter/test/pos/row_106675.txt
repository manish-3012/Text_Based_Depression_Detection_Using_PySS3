What social media site can I go to where my sexuality won't be made fun of? Last night I posted a picture of myself in r/pics in a spaghetti strap undershirt and shorts (technically born male), with the caption "me after 3 months of becoming female", and somehow almost everyone there took offense to it. Where do I go now? Does anyone know any social media platforms for trans teens? I'm running out of options.
