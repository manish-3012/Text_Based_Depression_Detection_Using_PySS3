Need A gift suggestion for my 16-year-old sibling (female) [serious] Little sisters birthday is tomorrow and I donâ€™t know what to get her... sheâ€™s your typical 16 year old (turning 16), and I guess Iâ€™m just not trendy enough to know what gen z girls are into.  

Iâ€™d say my budget is probably $40, $50 if itâ€™s like
