Note to Self I know I am okay. I know I am doing my best. I know I am a good person. I am struggling inside, but I know my worth, so it doesnâ€™t matter what anyone else thinks. I may get treated poorly, misunderstood, etc. But all that really matters is that I know myself. And as long as I treat myself with love and care, and think good things about myself, then others thoughts about me donâ€™t deserve my attention. And the thoughts I get that send me doubts, that send me insecurities, guilt, and blame, donâ€™t deserve my attention either. They are irrelevant and meaningless. I try to make others happy, but I donâ€™t focus on myself enough. My mind and body deserve to be taken care of by myself. I should treat myself to healthy foods, good sleep, happy habits. Itâ€™s not selfish. I know my worth, I am relevant, I am deserving, and even though I may be struggling, I know my feelings and emotions are valid and that I have the strength to continue doing my best and better.
