The day I accidentaly "simped" So in 2018, I was playing a Roblox game called Survivor, which works exactly like the Survivor show, and I found my first immunity idol (an item that gave the player immunity in the contestant's voting out). After that day's challenge, I came up 2nd place and knew everyone would vote for me so I used the idol. I got surprised when a new tab appeared with the title "Who will you use the idol in?" And I only had like 3 seconds to choose so I clicked fast in the person I voted off (a girl who was also good at the game). I could have used the idol for myself but I didn't appear in the list so I thought it was like an extra vote. Then I realised that I had to scroll down to find my avatar in the list but it was too late. After the player got the idol she thanked me but she was also confused. I explained to the server what happened but at the end, just as how I predicted it, everyone voted for me.
So you know what they say:
"Small pp, but good person".
I felt sad because I could have won but was also glad I made someone else happy, even tho everyone voted for me so the idol gave immunity to someone who didn't need it.
