Love is a scary thing I am amazed at all these people on this subreddit who have the confidence to ask someone else out. And I am a soft person, I will love each and every one of you :) but I don't want love now. Love is a beautiful thing and it should be nice but it seems scary to me. For me, I feel scared that if I fall in love, I won't be able to come back from it and when I am forced to leave, it's going to sting. Because of this love isn't really something I want, I mainly want friends to talk to. I don't really want someone who I can say is my girlfriend/boyfriend. I just want to talk about memes, Minecraft, and anime. I understand that it is possible to have that in a girlfriend or boyfriend but I don't really want to pursue that. I don't know why I posted this, I just felt like talking to strangers on the interweb.
