males pls answer ok, so since this sub is a sausage fest i figure its a good place to conduct my research: for guys,  do looks matter more than personality? because super attractive girl with ugly guy is a lot more common than ugly girl with super attractive guy. also, guys seem to be ok with going for a girl who's super attractive but dumb and nice. Ik for a fact that for a normal sane female that would be a turn off. so uh, answer honestly? appreciate the input
