Who has had covid? I need help figuring something out. Ok, so 2 days ago I lost my smell. Then last night I lost my taste and got a migraine. I woke up and now have the chills, fatigue, and a sore throat.

I don't have a cough of fever though, I haven't done much to get it, other than go to school. I've been banished to my bedroom and he'll, there's a possibility I don't have it :/

My brother is calling my covid hands and freaks out when I touch him or his favorite dog :/ brothers suck.

What are the chances I have covid?
