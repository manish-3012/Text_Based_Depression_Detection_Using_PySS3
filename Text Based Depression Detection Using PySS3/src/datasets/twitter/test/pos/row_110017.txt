So I entered a writing contest but didnâ€™t win so I decided to share it with yâ€™all. I hope you like. The Existential Crash

I run as fast as I can into the woods and collapse.

I won't rest until he's dead.

I check my phone, but no one has called or texted me.

I get up and walk back to the clearing, and there's a blood trail leading into the woods.

I follow the trail and stumble over a body.

I bend down to look at it.

It's Stephan.

He's been stabbed in the back.

I cry, and tears begin to stream down my face.

I crawl into the woods and try to hide, but I don't have time to hide.

As soon as my eyes adjust, I see a man coming toward me.

It's the bald guy from the pub.

He's in a suit and he has a gun.

He shoots me, and he hits my leg.

I'm bleeding from my knee.

He's pulling me to his car, and I try to struggle to get away.

My hands are numb, and I can't find the gun.

I'm weak, and I start to let him drag me to the car.

He slams my face into the passenger door, and I go unconscious.

I'm in the hospital.

I can see the wound.

I can feel the blood and pain as I squeeze my hands together.

I know that I don't have long.

I don't want to die, but I don't want to live like this, either.

A man enters the room, and I see his eyes.

They're the same eyes that look out from the painting on the wall.

I open my eyes and see a nurse coming toward me.

My eyes dart to the clock.

It's 11:00 a.m. She puts an oxygen mask over my face.

"Dorian, you have to wake up now."

I start to cry.

I feel horrible.

I'm going to die.

I knew it was a bad idea to get drunk.

I'm dying.

I can't remember how I got here.

I start to fade, and I see a woman's face.

I think she's the woman who's standing in the painting.

It's my grandmother, crying.

My heart stops, and I see her face.

It's not my grandmother, but her, but-

"No!"

I scream, and suddenly I'm in a large bathroom.

It's bright, and my vision is foggy.

I'm trying to sit up, but my head hurts.

I feel my forehead.

It feels like a giant rock.

"No."

The word comes out of my mouth.

"It's going to be okay, Dorian," a woman says.

She smiles and squeezes my hand.

"It will be okay.

Just relax."

I close my eyes and try to listen.

"I'm Dr. North.

I'm with St. Francis.

Do you remember how you got here?"

I don't know if I'm breathing, but I force myself to inhale.

"You're safe now," she says, and then I hear a voice in the background.

"Your son needs you, Dorian.

You have to wake up now."

I open my eyes and see a tall man standing in front of me.

His eyes are dark and dark, and I can't place them.

He's wearing a suit and tie.

"You're on St. Francis," I say.

"My father was a staff member here."

He takes my hand and squeezes it.

"Good to hear you have a sense of humor.

How are you feeling?"

"My head hurts."

"It does when you're standing up."

He helps me sit up.

"Take it slow.

The wound is still too fresh.

How many fingers am I holding up?"

I think I'm talking to a nurse.

"Four," I tell him.

"Good.

Try not to move for now.

You have two fractures in your left tibia and a severely lacerated knee."

I frown, but he cuts me off.

"Don't worry.

You'll be fine.

I was surprised by how quickly you woke up."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean that you're a fighter."

He smiles, and I realize it's the same smile I saw in the painting.

"Come on, we have to get you to the hospital.

I've called ahead, and they're expecting you.

Do you have any questions?"

I close my eyes, and I feel the nurses help me stand.

One guides me to a wheelchair.

"You're going to be fine," the doctor says.

He's a different doctor from the man who brought me here.

This one looks like he's my father's age.

"Let's go."

I'm still shaking as they wheel me out of the building and into the bright afternoon sunlight.

The nurse who was pushing me says, "The doctors want to make sure you can use your legs before you leave."

"I have to go back to work," I say to no one in particular.

"I know," she says.

"You have to get better, Dorian."

I'm on the third floor of the hospital.

I can see the door to the waiting room.

I can see Aimee, and even though I know she's only a voice, I can't seem to move.

I'm stuck on the third floor.

As I take my first steps, I start to cry.

I don't care that I look like a giant baby, and no one gives me a second glance.

The parking lot is empty.

The car is gone.

I look at my knees.

They're wrapped in a large bandage, but I don't remember the doctor asking if I wanted to wear one.

I'm sitting on a bench, staring at my phone.

I press a button to bring up the dial pad.

I'm reaching for a number I don't remember dialing.

It's only after I hit send that I realize what I'm doing.

I press the END button and toss the phone down.

I'm walking.

My legs ache, but I'm walking.

My stomach is queasy.

My head throbs.

I walk until I can't walk any longer.

I lean against a building and close my eyes.

Tears flow down my cheeks.

Why won't the tears stop?

I take out my phone.

My fingers don't work.

I press one button, and the phone's dead.

I can't think of what else to do.

I need to call my parents.

They'll want to know what happened.

My head spins, and I stumble.

I hear someone coming up behind me, but I don't have the energy to turn around.

I try to steady myself on the building, but I'm too weak to stand.

I'm going to pass out.

"What happened to you?"

asks a voice behind me.

"Let me see your phone."

It's Aimee.

She comes around the corner, and then she wraps me in her arms.

"Oh my God.

Are you okay?"

"I'll be fine," I say.

She smiles.

"You look terrible."

"I had a run-in with a car."

"Is that what they told you?"

I shake my head.

"I've been in a car accident."

Her face drains of color, and she gasps.

"Dorian, how bad is it?"

I hate how the tears have come now, just as I was falling to the ground.

"Bad," I say.

She pulls away.

"I need to call the police."

I put a hand on her arm.

"No," I say, and when she pulls back, I try to hold her hand.

She pushes my hand away.

"How are you going to get to work?"

she asks.

"I'll call a cab."

"What about your car?"

"I'll get a ride."

I'm not even sure if the hospital's covered the cost of a cab.

Aimee's phone rings, and when she takes it from her pocket, I realize it's mine.

I press END.

I take out my wallet.

Aimee gasps.

"Dorian, I have money saved up."

I stare at her, shocked.

"Don't worry about it," I say.

She presses something into my hand.

"I'll go by the hospital and get your car.

It's not far from there."
