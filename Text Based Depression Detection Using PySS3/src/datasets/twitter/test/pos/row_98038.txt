My mom calls me names for stupid reasons Mostly it's just asshole and dickhead, and one of her excuses is "you treat people on ps4 like shit" which is a REALLY stupid excuse considering the prevalence of trash talk, and she just keeps on bringing up stupid shit which I did years ago, or how I treat my classmates, not only that but she let me be with my cousin (he was the closest thing I had to a friend since my mom didn't care enough to get me a better one) 

Todays my birthday, and hopefully my teen years won't be plagued with "I'm the adult, you listen o what I say" because I want to do something any normal teen does, and throughout my life this is still prevalent now, Im not allowed to go outside without an adult, since she also had 3 kids (discluding me) in a 6 year timespan, they are constantly  in need of monitoring, but since I'm 13 now, I will be the one watching them

 Now about my siblings, they are the most destructive little shits on the planet, they throw all their toys since they have tablets which also break, they have also broken hundreds of dollars worth of tvs, since they get tablets, instead of actual toys, they don't need to have actual toys, so they use their actual toys TO PELT ME WITH, which hurts, they would never have these problems if my mom never got them presents.

And overall my mom is the kind of person to argue over shit that can be easily answered by Google.
