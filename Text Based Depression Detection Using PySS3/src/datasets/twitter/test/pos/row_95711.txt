anyone got websites that let you make timelines and infographics easily and without signing up for bs newsletters? a timeline is supposed to be easy to make but unfortunately many ppl who probably made their â€œprofessionally designed templates if you sign up nowâ€ on something no better than ms paint or sum shit want me to resign myself to being spammed by their newsletter bots
