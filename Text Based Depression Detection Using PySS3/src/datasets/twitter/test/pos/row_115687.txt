Why do problems seem to resolve the moment I ask for help on it/mention it to anyone else? Assignment problems? can't fix it? Ok, ill ask the teacher. 

Then moments before the teacher responds I fixed it. 

Reddit not loading for me? Ok..make a small post about it, came back a few minutes later and reddit is working perfectly..

Just wasting everyone's time for problems I need help with but suddenly dont as soon as someone comes...I dont want to waste anyone's time. Problems just magically go away right when someone is about to help me. "whats wrong?" Oh, uh..I just fixed it. Just like that, poof...and I do try to fix said problems. Maybe I should just ask the air first or something. That could fix it. 

Also, DAE sometimes leave a game alone for months, then come back to it and feel like they suddenly got way better? Not always, and not just games...
