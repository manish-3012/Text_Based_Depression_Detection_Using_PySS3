in so tired and I just don't know what to do anymore I'm so tired of hurting and being in pain, I'm so tired of trying my best for people and the for them to just completely shit on me and forget about me and just use me, they just use me for whenever they need attention or help and then just forget about me right after, I am so tired of my life situation, I have no father as of right now, my brother is 2000 miles away and never talks to me, it feels like I don't even have a brother, he doesn't even attempt to talk to me, he promises to call me and but then never does call me, only person I have is my mom and she's not home that much because she's always at work bc she has things to pay off since she's a single mother and I live with her full time now and shit, I just feel so lonely and lost, I keep on trying to improve myself and love myself and I just can't, it seems impossible, I don't know what to do, I just wanna fall into someone arms and cry in their arms and just forget about everything, Im so tired of not having a normal family and I'm tired of all the trauma from my childhood and from my toxic and crazy dad, what do I do? when will the pain go away? when will people start to notice me as more than just something they can use and notice me as a human, that I'm a person that isn't perfect, but always tries to be perfect no matter what
