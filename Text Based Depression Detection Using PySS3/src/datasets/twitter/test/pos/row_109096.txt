Do Biden supporters genuinely think heâ€™s going to magically change the whole country just like that ? It takes a while for his changes to be implementing and take effect, also, you canâ€™t really change what people think of other people 

People are putting on a way to high pedestal before heâ€™s even started 

I 
got the feeling most of his supporters are gonna be annoyed and feel silly when he doesnâ€™t magically end racism
