Women privilege = being able to go within a mile of kids without being accused of a pedophile There's stories where guys were looking at their phone or taking a selfie, and people instantly assumed he was pointing it at kids and taking pictures of them and harassed him and called the police. That shit happens a lot. Just 1 example.

And I'm always trying to avoid kids when I see them out walking or in their yard and shit and go on the other side of the street cause I'm scared what people could wrongfully assume I'm doing.
