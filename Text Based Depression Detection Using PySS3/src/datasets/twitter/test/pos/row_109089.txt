I don't want a girl to change her beliefs for me So im friends with this girl, she's a really nice person and she even has the same humour as me, not planning to ask her out soon but probably when im 16 (im currently 14 she's a year older than me), im probably gonna get rejected but just incase she says yes in the future.

me and her are in different religions and for her to say yes would mean my parents would make me force her into joining a different religion, i don't really believe in my religion hoping to leave soon but if i do my parents would literally disown me because that's what my religion does to people who leave their religion but anyways i don't want her to change her religion just because of me.

Boyfriends and Girlfriends normally have different opinions on things and those are setelled just by loving eachother that they ignore those opinions and settle on just love and thats what i want to do with her, for us to have different beliefs but still be able to love.

(Will delete soon because i don't like talking about religion so i don't want this on my record)
