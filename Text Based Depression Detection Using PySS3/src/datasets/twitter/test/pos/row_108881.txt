Iâ€™m so frustrated Man Iâ€™m just so frustrated

Iâ€™m having trouble eating and the only feeling I have that makes me continue is so I donâ€™t feel like passing out

I have this feeling of cloudiness in my mind, my friend says this will go away if you exercise.

I tried to load up ring fit adventure, but my brand new controllers arenâ€™t working at all. It connect on the doc but then when I slide it out it wonâ€™t connect. I already had to wait 10 minutes for all of them to update...

I keep feeling like I should puke but thereâ€™s nothing to puke up, I feel ill and lightheaded

Also note that I took medicine to help me sleep last light but I couldnâ€™t, and I woke up an hour earlier than normal
