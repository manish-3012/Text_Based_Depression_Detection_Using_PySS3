Going to school again? Ventilation relying on windows only works properly if there is enough wind. I finished college this year and I just wanted to drop this here. Natural ventilation (windows), is in many old buildings the only ventilation integrated. You should know that this only works properly against corona if there is enough wind and a door in the room is open, allowing for the wind to push through more easily.   
If there's no wind, or it's blowing in the wrong direction, the teachers can call it ventilation all they want but it's going to be very minimal.
