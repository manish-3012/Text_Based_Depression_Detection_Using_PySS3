You asked for it, here it is, u/thespeedboi When 2020 hit us with the pandemic, I thought all hope was lost. I was never a social person, going out to events such as parties. I'd rather hang out with my nerd friends, watching anime and playing tabletop games. Needless to say, I never though I would get a girlfriend. Not until the very last few days of December.

Side note, I suck at telling stories. 

I guess I'll somewhat go into depth, since I have nothing better to do. Soo here's some context:

I met this girl through League of Legends about a year ago. She's from the same country as I am, except she lives in a different city, about 2-3 hours' ride away. We started talking and we were getting along really well. After three months or so (about when the pandemic started) I ghosted her. I don't even remember why I did that - I think she was starting to annoy me or something, but I haven't thr faintest idea. 

Soo about 7 months go by without us talking. Somewhere near the beginning of November, we meet in a LoL lobby through a mutual friend. Soo we started talking again, I think it was her who messaged me. Eventually she tells me that she apparently liked me all this time, when we weren't talking. I was somewhat surprised, but I didn't really feel the same. Either way, we kept talking. 

On the 23rd of December, she went to a party. Eventually, she tells me that at said party, she made out with 5 different people. For some reason, this bothered me *a lot*. Like, I got really mad for some reason, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. So the day after, which was Christmas Eve, I didn't really talk to her, because I was... angry, I guess? But I didn't even know why I was angry... 

Later that day, I told her about why I was so upset. I get really easily upset, btw. So we talked about it, we made up I guess? And it was all good. Soo eventually, at about 1 AM (now Christmas day) or something we were still talking, when I got to thinking: Why did I even get so upset? I don't even like her, why would I get jealous? Wait... And then it clicked. It clicked *hard*. It's as if I flipped a switch or something. All of a sudden, I felt like I had the biggest crush of my life or something. I hadn't really liked a girl before like that for about 4 years. So I told her, and a few hours later we decided to get together

That's the story. I kind of wanted to share with the world. I did it without leaving the comfort of my home, you guys can prolly do it too. Also, happy almost new year! 

Tl;Dr: I got a girlfriend right before the year ended without even leaving my home 

I ain't spellchecking this thing, sorry if you had to cringe at some questionable grammar
