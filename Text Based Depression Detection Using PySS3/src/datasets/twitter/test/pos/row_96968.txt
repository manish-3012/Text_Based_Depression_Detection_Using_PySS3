Soy old middle school bully died this morning, how should I feel about this? I really didn't want this to happen to him, despite him somehow being one of 2 people who have actually made me want to actively hurt other students, or myself. It was never physical, but I would be called a name and it would stick, and they'd get the whole school involved until I was known by that everywhere. It was something I hated, and one day when I retaliated, I stabbed him with a fork, and was then known for that. Another time I actually got so pissed back when I had anger issues, about 7th grade, that I actually had his neck pinned on a desk and a teacher pulled me off him but he didn't stop. Multiple occasions he got us both in trouble and his parents would just pull him out of suspension day 1. Mine would pull me out day 2 when they find out he was pulled out cus that's bullshit, but still. Point is, now we're seniors, and I still disliked him, never talked to him, and I had 1 class with him junior year where he continued to show he was an asshole, but I was way more chill and can handle myself now. I didn't have a lot of friends back then, and the bullying got really bad, but still, now hearing about his death Idk how to feel, I keep thinking, is this what would have happened if nobody got me off him in 7th grade? Would I have killed him myself? Would I have had restraint? This isn't something I wanted to happen, but yet I'm not sad about it. Just shocked that him, of all people died on my last day before going back to normal school (im on a 2 week quarantine.) I didn't know where else to post this, and I really just want to put this out there yo know how other people feel about the situation, and really typing it out to make myself feel better...
