Uh oh, I seem to have made a minor mistake, what should I do ? A) don't think too much about it

B) identify the cause and solve the issue

C) think that I'm not good enough for anyone and anything, get suicidal, get mad at myself for being such a sensitive dumbass, cry about it, throw up from anxiety that I will never achieve my goals, have a breakdown, and post about it on Reddit
