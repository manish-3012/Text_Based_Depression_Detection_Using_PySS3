I need help Ok, so basically a person at me school is a person but I canâ€™t tell the gender. They have the top-ish of a boy and the bottom of a girl. The obvious answer is tomboy but this light, this fucking light says FEMBOY. Iâ€™m very worried they are trans and Iâ€™m being a wee cunt. Then if I may have a crush Iâ€™m a straight, trapped or the fuck itâ€™s called. Help
