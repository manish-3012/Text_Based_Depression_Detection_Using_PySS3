My im14andthisisdeep moment So I was like 13 or 14 watching Dnews, they had pretty nice educational videos and it made me feel less bad for procrastinating and all. So at the end of their videos they had an outdo where theyâ€™d be like â€œif you liked this video which put this and that on the screenâ€, I used to usually click on another video, but this time I decided to scroll down to the comments. One of the comments was like â€œisnâ€™t it rude to switch to another video while the host is still talking?â€ and o was like oh shit, this is deep. Idk what young me was thinking but Iâ€™m pretty sure I started listening to the intros through from then on. The only reason why I remember this buried memory is because I just noticed I still have that habit of watching outros all the way through when searching for the next video to consume my time. Idk maybe I was 12 when this happened, I know for sure I wasnâ€™t under 11 tho. Everything before yesterday is a blur. Umm thatâ€™s all, thanks for listening to my Ted talk.
