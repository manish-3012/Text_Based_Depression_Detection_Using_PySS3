The feeling of being depressed after nutting. we know what it feels like after nutting, we feel depressed and then ask our self's, "why the fuck did I do that." (not sure if it's women feel the same way.) well I have the perfect idea of what we should call this feeling. POST-NUT-TRAUMA or PNT for short. (even though the feeling is temporary.) just an idea, tell me what you guys think.
