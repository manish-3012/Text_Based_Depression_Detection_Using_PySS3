Petition to stop "attacking" teachers and start appreciating them  Ok so many people have been kind of like "attacking" teachers. Attacking isn't the right word but that's all I can think of at the moment.

Anyways people you need to calm down,  they are underpaid, have to grade 8 classes worth of work each week,  and on top of that get called out by most people just for doing they're jobs.

Like most teachers only give one page of homework a day wich let's be honest it isn't alot most of us  could probably blow through most of it in an hour or two unless you have to write some essays wich at the end of the day they also have to read and grade too just that they have to grade 8 classes worth of it.

Also it isn't like they have much control over what they give they are most likely just following a textbook so they dont have a choice they are most likely just doing what they are told to do. 

Another thing is that they are struggling just as much as we are with the whole home learning thing, I mean most of us just turn off our mic and camera and just stay silent the whole class if we stay during the entire class. 
I had my Spanish teacher start crying during class because of the stress it causes like having only one or two people participating most having several missing assignments and some not even there.

We might have alot of work but they probably have tripple that that we don't see, so we should give them some slack. And start appreciating they're work instead of calling them out for things that they most likely have no control over.

BIG DISCLAIMER-  if you find anything that doesn't make sense or is repeated take it up with 8 am me and not 1:19 am me. Anyways have a good day and bye bye.
