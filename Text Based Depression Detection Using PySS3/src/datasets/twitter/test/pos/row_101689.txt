I'm done trying to be in a relationship. Now is one of the most vital times for me to start a career, and why should I waste energy trying to be in something that'll most likely end. I guess it's as Hey Look Ma, I Made It goes. **"Friends are happy for me, or they're honeysuckle phonies. Then they celebrate my medals, or they wanna take my trophies"**

So why should I even bother with something that isn't going to happen, and on the slim chance it does happen, it'll probably end. I'm not a very likeable guy be any means.

Anyway, I have a career to build. No boy is gonna date me, and the one girl I had a crush on has a bf already. Why just fucking bother.

I'm just gonna listen to Creep by Radiohead and tread through this misery.
