STOP BULLYING BULLIES SUCK WE ALL HATE THEM. THEY THINK "OH I'M JUST KIND OF RUDE I COULDN'T BE EMOTIONALLY SCARRING ANYBODY" WRONG. FIRST, STOP GLORIFYING BULLYING. KIDS ARE LIKE "OH WELL I CAN BE KIND OF RUDE BUT IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL" WRONG. DON'T TRY TO GET ON A BULLY'S GOOD SIDE SO THEY THINK YOU'RE COOL AND BEFRIEND YOU. YOU ARE JUST TELLING THEM THAT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS OKAY. SECOND DON'T NORMALIZE BULLYING. AS MUCH AS I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE PLAY THE VICTIM, IF YOU ARE THE VICTIM OF BULLYING YOU CAN PLAY THE VICTIM. IF THEY CALL YOU A COWARD FOR THIS JUST IGNORE THEM. WHY SHOULD YOU CARE WHAT A BULLY THINKS?? BUT NEVER LET A BULLY THINK BULLYING YOU IS NORMAL AND NEVER IGNORE AS MUCH AS INSULTING. JUST TELL THEM TO SHUT UP. THIRD MAKE CERTAIN PLACES WHERE BULLIES KNOW THEY'RE NOT WELCOME. I PLAN TO MAKE AN ART CLUB AND IF ANY BULLIES TRY TO JOIN I WON'T LET THEM. IF YOU HAVE A CLUB OR A FRIEND GROUP LET EVERYBODY KNOW THIS IS A BULLY FREE ZONE. IF YOUR FRIENDS WON'T KICK OUT A BULLY AND YOU'VE TRIED EVERYTHING THEY MIGHT BE BULLIES. PEOPLE WHO GLORIFY AND NORMALIZE BULLYING ARE NORMALLY BULLIES THEMSELVES. THANK YOU FOR READING.
