I just need to feel validated. minor trigger warning- i do mention suicide and some other possibly triggering topics

I am 13 years old, rather young to be here, but I put myself through hell everyday and no one cares because im "faking it, just like everyone else my age." I don't have any friends to talk about because my friendships are always so chaotic, I go from idolizing them to despising them, to feeling like they despise me and will leave me every time i talk to them, and i always end up shutting them out. its so exhausting because I do that with everyone i care about, and i can't take it very well. my school has been online, and it will be until late january, and it's so difficult because i need a connection with other people, and online school has left me unmotivated, anxious, and empty. theres been times where ive been suicidal, and its become more common everyday. im sensitive to everything, physically and emotionally, and it's often too much. I don't trust anyone close to me with my mental health, i feel like im too much, but also not enough at the same time. im scared they wont support me and try to get away from me, especially that im queer in a homophobic, religous conservative household. everything is so intense and i cant take it anymore. all of these recent events, even in the past 2 years have taken my life from me, and i dont know what to do, i just need someone to empathize and show they care. thanks, please leave a response, id really appreciate it ðŸ˜Š
