Question for United States University students studying in Great Britain, do you understand how some of you look to us? (Clarification in body) I live in a Northern Labour Party stronghold, the beating heart of industrial working class England and the Wider UK. I live in a complex with many other university students and the American sports lads look at people like me (piss poor locals) like theyâ€™ve never seen a working class person before? I know America is all about the middle class, but my experience with these people has been very souring. When they talk to us itâ€™s in that condescending way, as if weâ€™re unable to understand their oh so heightened intellect, and they are basically shitting money, real well off middle class American high school sports boy types. 

But the more i end up crossing paths with them itâ€™s became extremely evident that they arenâ€™t the least bit self aware? The way they act really seems like they feel above this place. I am by no means the only person this has fucked off around here either. But Iâ€™m yet to meet an American who goes here that doesnâ€™t seem to think or act like theyâ€™re above this industrial working class area and itâ€™s people and culture. 

I suppose Iâ€™ll open the discussion up, any UK students have good/bad run ins with Americans at your uni/ residence? 

Americans who study here (the UK in general), whatâ€™s your vibe of the place? And people?Preferably give a general direction of where (regionally) youâ€™re studying but nothing obvious personal details wise.

Iâ€™m interested to hear what people have to say! I by no means want to throw shade at all Americans, on the contrary actually, i long for the potential good run in with some, hopefully people here have stories like that!
