Idk what to title this Iâ€™ve realized during times of severe stress I just go completely emotionless. Like I pretty much just go dead inside. I donâ€™t want this to go any further into my daily life. Idk if itâ€™s some kind of psychological mechanism or what. People have told me I have no personality and shit and it really makes me question myself. Idk why Iâ€™m posting this tbh just venting
