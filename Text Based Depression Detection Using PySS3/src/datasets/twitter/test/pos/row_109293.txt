Opinions needed So when I was 6 my bedtime was 7:30. My sister who is six is 8:00. When I was ten my bedtime was 8:30. My ten year old brothers is 9. I am 13. Almost 14. My downtime (when my phone shuts off) has been 10:00 for a while, which I think is reasonable. But my parents just turned it to 9:30 randomly tonight. They wouldnâ€™t tell why. Do you guys think 10 is reasonable? And how can I get my downtime back? I miss talking to my friends...

  
it is 10:04 as of writing this, and itâ€™s weird because I would usually be logging out of Minecraft and getting ready. IDK, I want my 10:00 downtime back
