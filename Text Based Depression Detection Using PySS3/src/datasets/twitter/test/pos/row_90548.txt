It do be like that sometimes I feel so empty I don't know how to describe it, it's like a void idk I feel sick of everything ,  feeling so stressed out ,but I'm trying my best to hold it in but everyday I get more stressed .at some point I'll just bust .I don't really know what I'm talking about but im not feeling very good. I tried reading books, watching anime and long walks. But I still feel so empty and stressed , school is also starting soon which is even more pressure. This is my last year but it's too much, I'll be having classes 7 days a week . Thinking about it makes me more anxious and I need high grades to enter a good university , everybody is expecting too much from me . I don't want to let them down but I'm also scared of not meeting their expectations . I'm pretty sure that at some point I'll just have a mental breakdown .but yeah I guess life ain't easy after all , idk why I'm sharing this but yeah
