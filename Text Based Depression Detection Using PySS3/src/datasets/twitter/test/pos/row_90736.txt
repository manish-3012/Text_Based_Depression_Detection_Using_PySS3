At what time do you usually workout personally i just try to be randomly active throughout the day cause I donâ€™t know how to focus myself into a workout most of the time, which is really important to me because constantly forcing yourself to do something takes a huge toll on your mental health. iâ€™ve tried to get into morning workouts but Iâ€™m never feeling it or I sleep in. usually I start around 7/8pm so I can sleep like the dead even though they say you shouldnâ€™t do that. but iâ€™m typing this at 2am because I messed up my sleep schedule in the past 2 weeks. Iâ€™m wondering if I should use this opportunity to try and start a morning routine again
