Day 3, og afterschool One of the girls in my Group and I have A prank war going. Yesterday i walked into a bed full of popcorn. And naturally figured it was her, so today i went to the store and bought flower (even ecological cuz I be like that) to spread on her bed.  Got One of my roomies to check if her bedroom was clear. It was and i went in, opened the bag of flour.  Turned around and her roomie just came Walking in. So naturally i booked out of there and locked up the flour.


Flash forward a couple of hrs. Her and the roomie is kinda mad at me (idk why we agreed on a prank war and i havent done anything yet) and they tell me they didnt do the popcorn but that it was another girl from the room beside (idk if She has feelings or even if i do.) Who filled my bed with popcorn
