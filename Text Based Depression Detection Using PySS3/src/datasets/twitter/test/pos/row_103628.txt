Advice needed for sports Iâ€™m a freshman who plays soccer and I did very well in the first soccer tryout and everyone was being rlly nice. After the first cut a lot for the older kids have been cleating and fouling me every chance they get. No I am not exaggerating they say get up bitch when Iâ€™m done and elbow me to the face. I want to do something about it but I donâ€™t want to seem like a pussy either. Advice?
