i just broke down in class i don't know where i'm trying to get with this post, but after the shit my teacher said which completely went against what was in the books i fucking broke down crying trying to prove her wrong. i haven't cried for more than a year and now i've just embarassed myself like that in front of everyone... 
and she just ignored me anyways... so i feel like that was quite the useless thing...

...

i literally have no idea why i have, there wasn't a reason at all...
