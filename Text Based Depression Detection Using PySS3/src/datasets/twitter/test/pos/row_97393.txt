I feel like an asshole I was filling up my car at a gas station near my house and a guy who looked like he was in a bit of a bind came up to me asking me if I could spare him some gas. I obviously it said yes immediately and we walked over to his car, turns out it was an RV that he was living in. I started talking to him and he told me about how he has been homeless for a while now and where I live the housing living standard has gone up by a lot. I find out that he is not only homeless but also needs a hip transplant and he tells me about his troubles and how he's been living from his mobile home for a while now just trying to get off living off of his unemployment checks and I feel so bad I could have done so much more help I feel like. My mom is apart of social work programs and I am very close to my church community and I feel like I should have talk to him more got his information and help them out but I just I totally did not think about it now I feel like an asshole. Sorry I just wanted to rent to the events of the internet.
