Online school SUCKS. So my school district is doing this thing where half of the people are at school for one half of the week, and the other half are at school the second half of the week; everyone online on Wednesday for the schools to be cleaned to reduce the risk of a covid outbreak.

Iâ€™m in the second group, so Iâ€™ll be going to school in-person for Thursday and Friday, and for the past two days Iâ€™ve been doing school online. And these past two days of online school have drained what little sanity I had left after 5 months of quarantine. The teachers are supposed to assign like one or two things to do per online day, so I thought everything was going to be easy. But no. One of my teachers has been having constant technology problems with assignments being locked or not working, and Iâ€™m already a little behind on stuff. All of my other teachers have been mostly fine, but this one class has been diverting all of my attention to that class and away from my other classes, causing me to fall behind. And because of all of my attention being diverted to this one class that keeps having problems, I now have a lot more stuff to do in all my other classes that I donâ€™t want to do because Iâ€™ve lost all motivation to do anything in my other classes due to the constant problems. The worst part is is that I havenâ€™t even met half of my teachers and I have a million questions that I canâ€™t ask in person due to the situation weâ€™re in rn due to covid. And the questions I do have havenâ€™t really been answered or I havenâ€™t gotten a clear answer, so I donâ€™t know what to do half the time. Iâ€™m the type of person that functions the best when Iâ€™m in school 5 days a week, even though school sucks sometimes. In person school is 10x better than online school in my opinion. Online school, even though it seems easy, doesnâ€™t work well with me. Iâ€™m about done with technology at the moment. Itâ€™s great when it works, but it sucks when it doesnâ€™t work. All I want to say. This is my rant on online school.

TL;DR - Iâ€™m doing partial online school and this one teacher keeps having problems, causing me to divert my attention to that one class and fall behind in my other classes while quickly losing my sanity.
