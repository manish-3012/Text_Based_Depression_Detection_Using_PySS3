did you ever feel empty? (repost cuz original got lost in new) because i do. i don't have a lot of friends and the only friends i have are primary school friends who i barely see. my last 2 years i got bullied really badly and that made my feel like nothing is inside me. i changed classes now but it didnt get better because it is hard for me to find friends. in my primary school i also got bullied 2 times but then i still had my friends who supported me all the way. i never found someone who really understands me. i asked my parents about my problems and they talked about it but they didnt see it as a big problem. i tried everything to just have friends on school but nothing worked. and that makes my grades go worse as well because i cant concentrate when i try to get friends.

just something to know: THIS IS NOT KARMAWHORING. this is just sharing my problems to reddit.
