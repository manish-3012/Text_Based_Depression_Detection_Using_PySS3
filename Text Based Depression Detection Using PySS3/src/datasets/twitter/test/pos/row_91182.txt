Who wants to open a band? I have been playing guitar for nearly 11months now, been a singer since 7yrs old, and I'm really into old rock, country and jazz (Artist examples: Kurt Cobain, Frank Sinatra, The Animals, ACDC, etc.). I would love to cover songs with some internet friends and just have someone to jam with especially in those times where we have to stay at home. If you wanna be part of the band just leave a comment and if enough people like the idea we could open a discord server for our meetings. Have a nice day everyone!
