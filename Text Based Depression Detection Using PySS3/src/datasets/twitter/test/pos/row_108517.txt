My cat is letting himself die. My cat has always been really playful and super active. 
 Since 1 year ago, when my sweet grandma passed away, tho, he just doesn't eat. He is super week and bones can be seen with naked eye. This morning he couldn't even walk anymore. My grandma was the one who has always been with the cat so she was the cat's favourite person. I thik we will have to end his suffer.
