I know that nobody cares, but I â€œconqueredâ€ a fear today. Today, for the first time in 4 years, I finally gathered the courage to ride a roller coaster.

Last time I rode a roller coaster I HATED it. I felt like my head was going to explode. My neck wanted to fucking separate from the rest of my body.

But today, I presented with â€œFlight of the Hippogryphâ€ at Universal Studios. This is considered a junior coaster btw, but I was still terrified by it. 
Despite my entire body telling me to run away, I managed to actually get myself on the ride. 
AND I FUCKING LOVED IT!
I see why people ride these death machines now.

Then my mother REALLY wanted me to ride â€œHagrids Magical Creatures.â€
Once again, I was terrified.
I was literally crying at the thought of getting on.
Yet, I was able to push myself into the seat.
And oh my holy Jesus did I hate that ride.
But hey! I did it, and thatâ€™s all that matters.

Thank you, yes you, for reading my stupid rant.
I just kinda needed this opportunity to help myself process what Iâ€™ve been through today.
