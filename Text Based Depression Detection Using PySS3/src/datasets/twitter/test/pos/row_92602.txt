So I google translated CG5's I see a dreamer and this is the outcome Like a whip

I breathe a sigh (sigh)

Do you play with company or do you raise a white flag?

Because you never touched me!

&amp;#x200B;

Lord of the heart is everything (everything ...)

Victory is not a sin (victory is a sin)

I don't see the black and yellow power flying like a bee

Obviously, I am the only one in my group

&amp;#x200B;

He is a dreamer near water

But I don't have it, I don't have myophobia

I see my husband dreaming and I am ready to kill

But I don't have it, I don't have myophobia

Phobia, phobia, phobia (really!)

&amp;#x200B;

Hear the band army sing about my death, but I don't know the names

(What?)

I will not go back and follow the path I took

Wow, that's it

They will be on top and I see fire in your eyes

&amp;#x200B;

At least, I didn't get off without explaining myself first

Nana Nana Nana Nana, I have my own song to sing

The black and yellow power of the bee fly

Obviously, I am the only one in my group

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He is a dreamer near water

But I don't have it, I don't have myophobia

I see my husband dreaming and I am ready to kill

But I don't have it, I don't have myophobia

Phobia, phobia, phobia, really!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

No ...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The boat is full so why not swim?

Enjoy your pen, I'll enter

Find a hole near the danger

We all know: "I can do it, and I can ignore it."

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Do not fail

So beware of this warning

I have the same number as my little friend

If you can, you can finally defeat him! (Ha, ha, ha, ha, Sari!)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

He is a dreamer near water

But I don't have it, I don't have myophobia

I see my husband dreaming and I am ready to kill

But I don't have it, I don't have myophobia

Phobias, phobias, phobias
