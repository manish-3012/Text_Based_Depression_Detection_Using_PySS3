My friend is an asshole but I'll have no friends if I tell her (TW even though I'm not sure if I need one; profanity) I see that she's trying to intimidate me and lower my confidence. Everything from commenting on my home, to my face, to my academic skills- all in front of others. I see it all but I don't say shit because I know I won't have other friends to spend time with and she will call me out on that. I'm not getting fucking bullied by this twat. I thought I made it very clear to her that I don't fuck around. But I stay silent. Should I tell her to step the fuck down even though I know she won't take it nicely? I have issues too, I know.  


I don't like being underestimated- one of my greatest pet peeves. No, not a pet peeve- it's a fucking insult. I just want to sing to Barney about never letting the water run and pumpernickel bread, not deal with this bullshit. I want to grow a healthy mindset; to understand both sides. Sure, I am being a little bitch by not wanting my tough stronk man person reputation to be ruined, but at least I understand that. I sound mad but I will educate the bitch who called me an insensitive asshole and write her an essay using kind words and understanding tones because that's how you really win a fight and the world needs more educated people. Am I being complacent? maybe but I sure fucking know how to kindness the fuck out of people- trust me not one profanity or attack will be placed on her in our hypothetical conversation.

TL;DR

My friend is somewhat manipulative but (refer to title) and I will not entertain this behaviour. I will ask if she means it at first, don't worry.

Should I tell her politely in a civil conversation or keep my butthurt mouth shut until next year- where I will hopefully make new friends?
