So I asked my crush out today She was very surprised, which is good, I didn't want to be the weird guy (and also it'll be very embarrassing)

She said she'll think about it, which is also good, because I was 95% sure it'll be a no. It's gonna sound weird, but this is my first crush, so I'm counting that as a win.
