Iâ€™m nervous about drugs in high school I am about to rotate from online school into physical school. I never want to do drugs. I know it is bad for me and overall not worth it. All of my friends however are telling me there will be a lot of drugs and sooner or later I will definitely be doing it. Is this true?
