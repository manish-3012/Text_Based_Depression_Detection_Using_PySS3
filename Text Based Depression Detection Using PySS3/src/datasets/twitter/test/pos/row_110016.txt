Please help! Hey, thank you so much for checking this post. I'm a senior in high school and I am kind of freaking out, I have 6 external exams in may, 3 AP and 3 IGCSE, I am feeling so depressed lately and my parents keep pushing and pushing and whenever I do anything that makes me happy they shout and punish me, even if I was watching a video or movie for 30 mins. Tbh I do have suicidal thoughts every now and then and I do want to stop them but they haunt me at night and I cry myself to sleep almost everyday. Every study plan I make fails and I honestly feel like I am a failure. Can someone give me advice or some plan, before I either fall into some deeper depression or kill myself.
