It feels weird that people 4 years younger than me are gonna be allowed to be on here in 5 months oh my freaking goodness. I know how 2000 people felt when 2004 kids were on here back in 2017, but NOW I'm starting to see how it really feels. I know 2002-2003 people felt bad when they were on here back in 2015-2016 tbh lol
