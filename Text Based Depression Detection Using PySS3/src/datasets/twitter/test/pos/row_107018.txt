Should I tell my school counselor that I'm depressed and get myself in a huge mess again, or should I try and ride this out on my own? No, I'm not gonna talk to anybody else about this. I'm not about to ruin my relationships with people by worrying the fuck out of them, and/or make them not want to be around me because I'm a downer.

And my depression comes in "waves," so I know that it won't last forever. Still feels like absolute shit though.
