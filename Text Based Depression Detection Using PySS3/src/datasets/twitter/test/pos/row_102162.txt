Iâ€™m turning 15 tomorrow, and Iâ€™m kind of scared. Most of my life has been building up to now. Next year I will have to take exams. Next year I can start learning to drive. The next few years and the next hundred tests will set up my future. And I am terrified. Most of my life I have been told that how well you do in school is how well you are going to do in life, and although I get mostly good grades I am still scared. I donâ€™t know what I want to be when I am older, I donâ€™t know if I took the right subjects, I donâ€™t know which university I want to go, I donâ€™t even know if I WANT to go to university. I am scared. 
Advice is much appreciated.
