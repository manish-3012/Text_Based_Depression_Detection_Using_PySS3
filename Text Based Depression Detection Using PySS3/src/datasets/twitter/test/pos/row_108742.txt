Anyone want an interesting Minecraft challenge? Welcome to the EXPLORATION CHALLENGE! A challenge based on simple rules that really change how you play the game depending on who you are. 

Now what are the rules to this challenge? There's only 2 Main rules, with plenty of Optional Rules and other details that I've included in a pastebin link at the end of this post.

1. No Permanent Settlement - This is the big one. You are not allowed to make a house, or stay in one place for too long. By extension, this also means that the stuff you have is only the stuff you can carry on you. Inventory Management is Crucial.
2. Play on Hardcore Mode - What's the point if when you die you can just pick another direction? No. To make exploring world more meaningful, you can not respawn.  (Bedrock has no hardcore at this time, so play on Hard and leave the world if you die.

"Only 2 rules? Well that sounds boring." Indeed it may seem that way too some, but as a survivalist with terrible building skills, this is a great challenge. 

Now I have a ton of other things that I wish I could fit in here, but it would end up being a mess if I posted it here. So instead, here is a link to every other detail you need to know. This includes optional rules, Many extra challenges, and consequences. You can even make up your own for an easier or harder experience.

I hope you enjoy this hopefully interesting challenge.
