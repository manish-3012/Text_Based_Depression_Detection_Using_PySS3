MY DIARY. DAY 10: EVERYTHING IS GOOD...IG Yeah, i woke up and took a hot shower after that I started studying. Then at 13.00 i ate my healthy breakfast. Bit later i worked out and when my dad came home from work he said he was really proud cause i was working out everyday without any rest days. My mom just made a surprise for me and gave me 50 euros...just bc i am a good son...well mby most of you will call me spoiled but i think i am not.
