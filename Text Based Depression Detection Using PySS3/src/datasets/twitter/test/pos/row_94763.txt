I really wish I was high rn :( I have a headache, i nearly crashed my moms car twice today (1st time was bc we were on a really narrow road and there wasnt enough space for me and the huge ass truck coming at me, and the 2nd time was because i hit a really fucking nasty patch of ice), my cousin who lives with me got screamed at and grounded while i just sat in my room having a panic attack, then that cousin was messaging me about how they want to literally kill themselves, my friend group was supposed to play some video games and vibe but like three of them ended up arguing p much the whole time, i cant sleep and i have school in a few hours, and on top of that im doing fully online classes for the first fucking time and have all new teachers and no clue what to expect.

I just really want to be able to stop stressing, but my brain wont let me. At least i have animal crossing tho ig :/
