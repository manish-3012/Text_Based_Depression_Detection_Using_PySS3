Adults are bullshit Nobody wants the full story. Nobody. They don't ever want to know how you are. If they are being nice, they want something. Everyone else's fuck ups are yours. Got younger siblings? God they're so cute, aren't they just so sweet? They never argue, unlike *you*. You're just awful. You're horrible. You make everyone around you sad, and if you yourself are sad, you make everyone uncomfortable as well. You can't change even if you tried, why don't you just change, all you have to do is try. Life is garbage. Only once you are finally living alone with your own job can you have any kind of happiness or control, but then again, you'll never get a job, will you?
