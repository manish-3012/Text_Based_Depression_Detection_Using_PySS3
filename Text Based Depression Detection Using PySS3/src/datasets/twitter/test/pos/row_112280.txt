Can someone be my temporary girlfriend until 2020 is over Ive been so so so lonely and i feel that noone appreciates me anymore. Anything i do is deemed unworthy or uncomparable to my friends accomplishments and i dont know what to do. Im funny at times, curly hair, tanned, lowkey anime type body shape but can be vert insensitive. Im an alright listener. Idk what i would expect from this post but i guess internet do your worst? Hopefully i land someone. Btwvit dont matter if your a boy im bi :)
