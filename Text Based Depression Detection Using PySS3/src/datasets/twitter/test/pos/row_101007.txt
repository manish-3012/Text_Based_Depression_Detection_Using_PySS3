I have officially stopped So today I have officially decided to stop masterbaiting and here is all the details
For context some game characters got me into masterbation a few years ago and since then I've been a very heavy masterbaiter who averaged 4 times per day yet remained a virgin. 

Why i decided to leave:

1.Firstly I think its just a distraction, it used to be fun and all in the start but now its just a way to fill the gaps in life and now I've decided to devote that time towards studies and fulfil my dream to become a doctor.

2.The most common and dangerous disadvantage is your memory loss, its gotten to the point that I switched schools and many other of my classmates did too and now when they see and come to greet me, i dont know who they are. 

3.Last of all I wont go into very religious reasons but for me its a sin and watching porn makes the trouble double and it also arouses the need to commit premarital sex which will definitely wind me up in hell(You can ignore this since religion is a controversial topic) 

How I did it:

Just to be clear it has only been a week but I feel great. 

1. Delete any graphic or porn you may have saved on your device

2.Leave any groups or subreddits that may contain such stuf

3.Delete all the ways you can access porn like VPNs etc

4.Whenever you get horny try to ignore it and make yourself busy

5.If your friend group starts a conversation on such topic try to stop them, or distract yourself and if that doesnt work just straight up leave

Conclusion:

For last I will say that masterbation will get you no where, teenage is mostly the time when we develop such habbits and its the best time to leave them.I hope i can inspire other people to stop destroying their lives too. If you need anymore detail or help you are welcome to DM me. I will post my progressions each weak and peace out. 

Ps. I am not doing this for karma whoring or that kind of stuff cause I honestly dont even care about internet points which have no real value. I just wanted to put this infront of you guys.
