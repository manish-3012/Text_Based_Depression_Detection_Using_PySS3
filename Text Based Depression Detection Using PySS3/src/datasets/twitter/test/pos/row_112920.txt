I need a new home. Any of you people willing to take in an idiot? So I have a lot of group chats with different people to name three important ones I have my family group chat, friend group chat, and then a group chat between me and my siblings with one other friend that's like a sibling (that is also our kind of joke and drug chat) anyway I was going to jokingly text the one with my siblings and say "ay I got the coke if y'all down to meet me behind the shed" but my dumb ass clicked the wrong group chat. Long story short I texted my family group chat by accident. So the point to this story is who wants to take me in? If I go back home now imma get beat.
