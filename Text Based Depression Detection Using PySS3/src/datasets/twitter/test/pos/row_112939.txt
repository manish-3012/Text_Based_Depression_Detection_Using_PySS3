Anyone else scared of going down slides? Warning: long story ahead

Like even going down the short ones at playgrounds for little kids I always put my feet down so I donâ€™t go too fast. You never know whatâ€™s gonna happen at the bottom and itâ€™s always painful if your skin touches the slide.

Once when I was little my cousins and I were at this place with inflatables and a bunch of huge slides. I was wearing pretty short shorts and when we went down one of the biggest slides, the slide gave me a really bad friction burn that hurt the entire way down.

I was trying really hard not to cry but then my aunt said something to me and I just burst into tears and my cousins were all just staring at me wondering what happened.

I told my mom who got bandaids from a really nice employee who offered to put the bandaids on for me but then my mom had to explain to him that the burns were high enough that I had to take my shorts off which was really embarrassing.

Then my mom put the bandaids on and I stopped crying eventually. We were all leaving together and the nice employee from earlier drew a smiley face on my wristband to make me feel better. Except it wasnâ€™t me. It was my cousin and he had gotten the two Asian girls mixed up even though I was pretty clearly the one who had been crying for a while :/
