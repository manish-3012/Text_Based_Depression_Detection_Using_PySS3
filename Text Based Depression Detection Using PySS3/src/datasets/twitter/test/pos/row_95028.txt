i don't know why i can't be happy at all i went to a new school, made tons of friends who don't treat me like shit, got rid of my toxic exs, pretty much have a gf, lost my virginity, my birthday is tomorrow basically, have people who want me around and love me, but why do i still feel empty and hollow?

i still feel sad and alone on the inside and still have to fake a smile to get by. why am i not satisfied when i have everything i've ever wanted? why do i still constantly hurt on the inside?
