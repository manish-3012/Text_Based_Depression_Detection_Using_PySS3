My uncle has exactly 45 minutes left on earth. I know this is a random rant, but my uncle had covid and it damaged his heart and lungs. He got through it, but due to the damage it caused he had a random heart attack while driving and was admitted to the hospital last week. He's been in a coma and the doctors did a few tests and it turns out he's essentially brain dead. My aunt is deciding to take him off live support at 11:30 Central Time. I don't even get to see him either. I love him so much and I've looked up to him since I was little. I love you uncle Don, I hope you enjoy heaven.
