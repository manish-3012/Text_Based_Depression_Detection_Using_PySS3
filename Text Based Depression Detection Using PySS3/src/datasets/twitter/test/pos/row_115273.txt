I feel alone Most of my friends are 16-17 and they almost all have or have had a girlfriend/boyfriend while I never did in my while life (maybe except when I kissed a girl when I was 5). And this actually makes me feel bad because I feel alone and I think I'm too different from my friends. And I really struggle with this I need your help
