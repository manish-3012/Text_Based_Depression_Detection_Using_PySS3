I rickrolled about 100 random people So I went ice skating and they had a DJ apparently, so of course like the immature person that I am, I asked him to play never gonna give you up, and when it came on I was standing next to the DJ laughing (he knew what it was) and we were laughing as people looked at us in utter shame...
