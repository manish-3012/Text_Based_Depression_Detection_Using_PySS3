So I'm making a religion?? It's mostly for fun but I might end up taking it more seriously than I originally intended. I haven't made many solid plans yet, but it's gonna be sorta cult-like. Polytheistic. The gods want sacrifices, and there will be rituals. There will be sinners and saints. Run of the mill stuff. I'm just here to run an idea of a god by y'all.



Veritate, ruler of all life. Certainly the most important god. She is the queen of all gods, and will eat the heart of anyone who wrongs her (sinners are heartless haha).



[Here's my first sketches](http://imgur.com/a/Vhc5zqB)



Everything after this is me just rambling, so if you have thoughts about my sketches please comment. If you want to hear more about my dumb little project, then the rest of this post is exactly that. 


 _________________________________



In general, anyone who happens to see any pure being (a god or angel type thing that I haven't given a name yet) will be considered a holy man. They will be blinded by the "beauty" of the purest. The words of the holy men are to be transcribed. The holy men are to be sacrificed to the gods, so they can be accepted by the gods. They will become one of the angel type creatures.



Sex, nudity, and hallucinogens are pure things. They are blessings from the gods and they are to be appreciated greatly, not surpressed.



The only "afterlife" is given to holy men. Everyone else is reincarnated to whichever creature fits their level of purity. People who were very pure get to be a human once more. People who were unpure get to be insects or small animals.




and I'm gonna stop blathering on now. If you read this... Thank you. I don't know why you did, but thank you.
