Recurrent nightmare I had between 5 and 7 years old it started with me going to a decorations store and getting locked the first hours it was just playing around but when the lights went out it all went to shit , the thing I remember the clearest is that the manikins were corpses like slightly decay corpses with sawed in a smile faces , I remember the decay corpses , idk why but that imaginary corpses stay in my head , then for the fear of the corpses I ran in an elevator with a crismas tree in it and the decorations where just so nutter and boring but the elevator stoped and fall to the floor where the corpses where then I just saw my mom on the door opening it to get me out but that scared me and I ran away from her to like the back of the store that looked like my room and just crawl into a ball hiding from everything then wake up
