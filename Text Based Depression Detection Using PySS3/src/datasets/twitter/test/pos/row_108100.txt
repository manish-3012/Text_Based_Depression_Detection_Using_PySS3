I'm thinking of making a subreddit So since I started reviewing games I finished over quarantine I realised people do not really care about my negative opinion of the game in the games subreddit, so I'm just asking if anyone wants to make a subreddit just for making your own reviews of anything,  I looked around and I found r/GamingReviews in which they just link to youtube reviews. So idk if anyone wants to do that thatd be epic
