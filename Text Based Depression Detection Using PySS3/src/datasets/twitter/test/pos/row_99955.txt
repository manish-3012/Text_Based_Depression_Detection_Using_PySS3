another "i'm bored" post but kinda not i wonder what people's religious beliefs are here

i don't specifically believe in a religion but i believe that multiple gods, deities, and spirits exist, maybe even infinite. i also believe in things like manifestation and the chakras (i know the origins of that) and i mostly believe in astrology but i don't really believe in daily/weekly horoscopes as only the monthly and yearly ones are accurate. i also use tarot cards sometimes but not they much as i have to hide them from my parents. 

also please keep this respectful!!
