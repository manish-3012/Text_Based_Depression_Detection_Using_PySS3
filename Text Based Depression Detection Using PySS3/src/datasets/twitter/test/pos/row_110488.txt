My step mom made me cry I was complaining about my friend being transphopic and my step mom basically told me that it's okay to be transphopic. What's worse is my siblings agreed with her. She made me out to be the bad guy and the only one I could tell was my friend that was being transphopic. I feel like everyone in my life hates me and I just want to run away to some where safe. It feels like I can't go anywhere without someone against me.
