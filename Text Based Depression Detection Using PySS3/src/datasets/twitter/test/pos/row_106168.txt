Advice on not going to a meeting [Link to my previous post on here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/ixht7l/yesterday_at_the_park_maybe_im_exaggerating_need/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
It may sound a bit scummy but I really canâ€™t go to the meeting. In the previous post I talked about what happened last Monday with a friend of mine (I kinda pissed her off and she kinda attacked me. I mostly deserved it). Me, my friend and the subject of the last post have started to meet every Monday afternoon to chill in the park but I donâ€™t feel comfortable with going this week due to what happened last Monday. The scratches arenâ€™t why I donâ€™t want to go, they have healed almost completely, Iâ€™m just afraid that it will be very awkward for her since she probably calmed down and realized that attacking me because I was making fun of her old WhatsApp status was a tad too much. Although I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll have problems telling my other friend why I donâ€™t want to go (Iâ€™m also extremely tired and stressed out and I just want to relax for one of the few free afternoons that I have left) but I have no idea how to tell my other friend why I probably wonâ€™t come since sheâ€™s a pretty sensible (Is this the right word? Not a native English speaker) and I donâ€™t want her to feel guilty. Do you guys have any advice to give me? Also, I know that I should tell her the truth but Iâ€™m scared sheâ€™ll feel like trash and stop meeting with my other friend who seems to really enjoy going out with her
