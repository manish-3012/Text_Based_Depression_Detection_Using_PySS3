How do you get over someone For me to get the right answer I think i need to say everything, theres a girl that i like an unhealthy amount, sheâ€™s amazing, ive been going through multiple mental breakdowns this month and at 3 am sheâ€™s always been there to help me back on my feet, and shes so cute, funny and overall an amazing human. Anyway almost 4 months ago i told her i like her, nothing really changed when i told her, and she said that she knew it anyway. what i didnâ€™t say is that the mental breakdowns are because of how our conversations end and how much time ive had to think as of late. Ive decided that liking her is to much pain than its worth, how do i get over someone.
Sorry for any grammer and/or spelling errors
