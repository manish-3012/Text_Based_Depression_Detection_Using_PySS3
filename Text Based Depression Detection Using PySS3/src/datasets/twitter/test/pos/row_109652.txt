Not comfortable around my S/Oâ€™s genitals Me and my boyfriend were making out and he wanted me to see his vagina. I took a glimpse and it just kind of unsettled me. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s because Iâ€™m not used to the opposite genitalia or if Iâ€™m just not straight but Iâ€™d like to know your experiences and see if this is normal and if Iâ€™ll get used to it
