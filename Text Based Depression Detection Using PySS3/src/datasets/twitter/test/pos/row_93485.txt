I JUST MADE MY FIRST INDIE GAME!! - UPDATED Hi! It's me again. The last post I made was with a horrible trailer so I made a new one.

If you didn't saw my last post, I just finished my own Visual Novel game and it's coming out may 22nd.

It's about highschool, an insane Mom, dealing with teenagers struggles, school crushes and more.

&amp;#x200B;

The game contains explicit suicide and depression content therefore it is not suitable for all children.

With romance and physcological terror, here is HighSchool DS. (Link of the trailer below)
