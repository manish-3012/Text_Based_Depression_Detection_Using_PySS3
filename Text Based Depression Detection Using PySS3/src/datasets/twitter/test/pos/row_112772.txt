I Just Had a Really Bad Argument With My Parents Ok so I guess I kinda just have to get this off my chest so I can feel a little better about it. So I just had quite a bad argument with my parents, where they were very mad at me for missing assignments during online school. I get that they are really upset but I just feel terrible when they just team up on me and never seem to want to listen to what I have to say, they just shout. I just sort of knew that the best thing to do was kinda take it and do what they wanted. But then everything changed when they said that they would not allow me to talk to my girlfriend if I don't fix them. I really regret shouting at them like I did but I really just don't know how I would be able to carry on without her input on things, and she just generally encourages me way more than they ever have. I really really don't want them to do that, so I am not going to leave my chair until every single missed assignment is done. But I just want to know if there is something I can do to apologize to my parents or decrease tensions between us.
