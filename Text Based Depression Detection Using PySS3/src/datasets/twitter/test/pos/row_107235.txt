im going to try and start taking better care of myself last night i stayed up until midnight working on an essay and while writing, i drank a cup of coffee and consumed a bag of takis. it was disgusting but it kept me going. i probably got around 5 hours of sleep cause i started having bad dreams. anyways, this morning i ate a huge bowl of frosted flakes and coffee so sweet that i couldn't really taste the coffee and i just thought- damn, i need to take better care of myself. this isn't healthy for me. so, i put away the coffee and cereal, washed my face, made some green tea instead and now i'm going to eat an egg. wish me luck yall :)

ooh and im also trying my hardest to bring my grades up, read some more books, and write more
