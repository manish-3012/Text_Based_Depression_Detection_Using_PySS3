im litterally crying from nostalgia rn i was looking through my old spotify playlists and i played one that had classical music in it. First song, it plays, its good and all. Next song, its Nuvole Bianche. most of you may not know that piece but look it up and trust me, that is just... wonderful. i remembered listening to it whenever i would get ready to sleep. that piece is just amazing. it hits on a different level. wow the nostalgia...
