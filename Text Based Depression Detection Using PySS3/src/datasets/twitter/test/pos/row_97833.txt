Is it spoiled Am I spoiled or needy or whatever when I want to talk to someone, anyone

Even my best friend who talks to me the most hardly ever talks to me. 

I always feel like a burden when I talk to anyone. Iâ€™m bothering them. 

I donâ€™t want to be alone all day. Iâ€™ve got nothing else to do... 

itâ€™ll be even worse when school starts because my friends are doing actual school but Iâ€™m doing online. Iâ€™ll be left out of everything even more. 

My best friend asks me whatâ€™s wrong and if she can help but the only thing thatâ€™d help is just her talking to me. Which I already feel awful about since Iâ€™m bad at talking to people.

I sit in the dark crying because of how much of a lonely piece of shit I am
