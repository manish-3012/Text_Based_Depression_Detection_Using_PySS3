My girlfriend broke up with me, and now I feel like killing myself. Again. If you'd look back at my post history, you'd eventually find a post that says my girlfriend broke up with me and I feel like killing myself. Well, it's happened again. Same girl, different cause. Here's what happened:

I get a text from my former girlfriend asking if I have somebody's snap. I say no. She asks me to tell the person if "[they] knew what she meant." I, of course, ask for context. She says she'll give me the context if the person replies. I make a deal with her. If the person doesn't reply within two hours, she'll give me the context. She denies. I keep asking for context. She says that she "doesn't want to hurt me." I ask if this has anything to do with our relationship. She doesn't confirm or deny it, which to me meant a yes. I take a guess. Said guess was "You don't actually care for me and have feelings for [them]?" She says I'm half right.

Keep in mind this was my girlfriend for over *two and a half years.* I know posts like these are often faked, but I have nobody else to talk to. I've already told my family what happened, and they're doing the best they can to support me. I've been attempting to find ways to distract myself and avoid any objects that could cause harm. If anyone has any more advice for me, I'd be grateful.

TLDR: Girlfriend of two and a half years broke up with me because she likes someone else and I feel like dying.
