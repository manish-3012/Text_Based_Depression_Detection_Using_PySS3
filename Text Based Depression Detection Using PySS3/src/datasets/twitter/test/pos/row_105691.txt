My school is alright Ahem. You know, I've seen a lot of " fuck school" posts here so I'm gonna tell you why I think my school is alright.

The teachers are cool and nice. 
We get to do fun stuff like, going on trips, having a cooking contest and stuff. 
We actually learn stuff. (Not really useful stuff but meh) 
We don't do video calls classes. We just get assignments with instructions and tasks. 

I'm in 9th grade and don't know how highschool is in Norway, but there is a lot of hate on schools, so I thought I might share what I think about my school.
