I fucking hate being this skinny. I always wear a hoodie because my arms are fucking small despite the fact that I work out a lot and get very insecure about that. And I was checking out my body progress shirtless and noticed I have some ab definition and my pectoralis major (The male Brest muscle) and noticed that I also had definition there too. So I get very very excited about it and gain a whole bunch of confidence. Anyways I went down to eat some dinner and (It was a smallish pasta with white chicken and very healthy) and when I went back up to my room I noticed I had a gut showing through my shirt so I take it off and BAM I have a noticeable stomach without any definition and all self confidence goes down. Always wanted to wear a tight fitting shirt to show off my rather okay looking body that I'm proud of. This seems like an endless cycle of just nothing but confusion and disappointment. So any one out there that has gone through this and gotten out how? I am 5"4 and around 100 pounds if that helps at all.
