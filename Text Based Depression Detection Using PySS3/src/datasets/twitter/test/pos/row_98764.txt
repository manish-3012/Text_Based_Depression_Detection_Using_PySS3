I fucking hate the n-word and the r-word. I'm neither black nor mentally ill. I'm a white Brazilian, and though I have signs of autism, depression, adjustment disorder, borderline disorder, etc, I've never had the time or money for a diagnosis, so I gotta assume I'm neurotypical. So therefore, I don't even have the right to use the r-word. 

But I just hate both the n-word and the r-word...even if a black or mentally person uses them. I don't believe in "reclaiming" bullshit. Just seems like a roundabout way to further encourage discrimination. 

I heard one celebrity say, "Black people have it rough, get worse jobs, are treated like shit...so please, let me have this one word." And like uh...fair enough I guess, but I still don't like ANYONE using the word.
