Does anyone else feel like their lives are going nowhere? Like, you're losing interest in things you previously enjoyed, your sleep schedule is out of wack, you talk to your friends less and less, you're slipping academically, you feel more anxious, or you feel empty in general?

Idk man, I dont know if it's me or the quarentine getting to my head but I've been feeling like this for a while, anyone experiencing this?
