Give me a ship or scenarios to write a fanfic about I wanna write an enemies to lovers, slow burn, long fanfic and I need some pairings. LGBT+ welcome but straight couples also work.

Hopefully any ship from Harry Potter, Avatar the Last Airbender, Adventure Time, Undertale. Anything works, though. 

Give me some tropes or scenarios youâ€™d like to see.

Iâ€™ll let you know if I use any of your ideas.

Itâ€™ll be posted on Archive of Our Own (AO3) and Iâ€™ll make a follow up post.
