I'm really, really happy right now So I've been spending a lot of time with my mom recently and she was showing me her jewellery from some small bracelets to full gold and diamond sets. She was showing me these pearl and gold earrings and she saw that I really liked them and told me to put them on. She then told me I could have them and I'm just really happy and thankful right now.
