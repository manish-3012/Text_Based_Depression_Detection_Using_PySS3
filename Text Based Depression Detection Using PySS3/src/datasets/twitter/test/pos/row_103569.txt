Hey teens, do your parents do drugs? How and when did you realize? Adult here. I'm a 27yo mom of a 3rd grader. I also used to be a teenager. When I was a teenager I was very aware of my parents indiscretions when it came to drugs and alcohol. I dont remember exactly how or when I figured out my parents were doing the things I was being taught not to, but I do remember some of the feelings it caused. I started using various substances myself by 14 and eventually got kicked out of high school. That's a story for another time but I am very aware my parents choices contributed to mine. I make way better choices these days but am not completely sober. So now on the parent end, I wonder how much exactly my 8yr old is aware of, or when she really will start noticing little things. Tell me when and how you figured it out? What do you wish your parents would do differently?
