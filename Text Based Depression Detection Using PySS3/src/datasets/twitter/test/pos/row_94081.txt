I donâ€™t know what to study or what to focus on for my future. I currently live in Mexico, but I really want to move to Canada. I wouldnâ€™t want to live in the city, Iâ€™d love to live in whistler or somewhere I could snowboard and bike. I donâ€™t really know what job to get that would allow me to live there. I was thinking marine biology, but Iâ€™ve heard itâ€™s really competitive and it doesnâ€™t pay that well (also not a good job for the place I want to live). Iâ€™m looking for advice on what I should focus on. I am able to go to college.
