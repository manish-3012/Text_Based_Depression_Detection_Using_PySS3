I just had a disturbing Danganronpa daydream. It's where Hajime is unreasonably cruel, abusive and nasty to Nagito. He does all these terrible things, and nobody knows about it. The others start to get worried, and concerned for Nagito's safety, because he keeps getting more and more injuries. At some point Nagito stops believing in hope. It's awful, really. I had this horrible feeling in my chest the whole time I was thinking of it. Oh, yeah, at one point Hajime tries to light Nagito on fire. Just awful.
