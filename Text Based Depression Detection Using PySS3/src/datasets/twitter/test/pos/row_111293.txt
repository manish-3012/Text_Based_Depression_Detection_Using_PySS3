Is she a bad mother? My mum is a workaholic, like a huge one. She's always been working, and it never was a huge problem. About 2 months ago she started a big project at work and she was EVEN MORE at work. And that's when the problems started... I just started to see what's wrong. 

I wanted to talk and she was always busy or tired HOWEVER she had time to talk to her friend on the phone for 2hrs, get her nails done like every 2 weeks etc. Last month I've had the toughest time in yeaaaars. And she said that she won't take my to a psychologist because "it's not needed". Like wtf maybe for you.Â  Recently i also wanted to dye my hair and... well you were right, I'm "crazy and stupid if I was 18 I could do thatÂ  and also dudes look ugly with their hair dyed". It's not even about the hair. It's everything. I don't like the tshirt that she tries to shove up my ass - crazy. I want to throw away books that've been sitting in my room for like years and i dont even use them - wasteful. Like I just want a break.

Sometimes I think "ooooh you know its tough at work and she's tired" but sometimes I start to think that's it's been like this always. I just don't know what to do I even can't talk to her because she wont listen and just call me crazy. I just dont know what to do...
