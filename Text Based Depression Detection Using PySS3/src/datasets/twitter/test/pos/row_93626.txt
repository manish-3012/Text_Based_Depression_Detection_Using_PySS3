Body shaming Idk if u guys saw the picture or not but it was Billie Eilish without her like trademark baggy clothes. Creepy ass dudes most probably 30 year old men who live in their moms basement were basically body shaming a 18 year old about how she looks. How sick and disgusting some of the comments/ jokes were. Truly lost faith in humanity once again. Most of these men commenting are prolly insecure themselves so they make themselves feel better disgraceful tbh
