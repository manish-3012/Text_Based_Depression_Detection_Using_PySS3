Itâ€™s really annoying when nice songs gets covered to be more â€œsadâ€ Like I hear this cover of Creep by Radiohead and it sucked ass. It was basically played on piano and this woman was just singing it way slower. I also donâ€™t like the cover of Mad World (the Gary Jules one.) The Tears for Fears one sounded a lot more natural to me idk
