Hey everyone, I'm performing a brief survey on high school students for a school project, I would really appreciate it if you could take a minute of your time to fill this out :) I need at least 150 responses for this by next Friday, so I figured this would be a decent place to post. it is very short, only about six questions and it should only take about a minute total. Please only fill this out if you are around high school age (although that is arguably most people here). Again, I would really appreciate it if you filled this out for me, and feel free to send it to other people you know as well. Thanks in advance for your responses :D
