My teacher died Idk if it was today or yesterday, but my old science teacher died. He was the definition of a teacher. He loved his job, he was a mentor, he was someone to look up to, and a friend. We heard he had cancer about a year and a half ago. He was my teacher freshman year, and being a junior now...idk...i never had a chance to say goodbye. His impact on me and every student was incredible. He will be missed. Mr. P, i would give anything right now to sit in your classroom and listen to a lecture on earth, soil, topography, rocks...i miss you.
