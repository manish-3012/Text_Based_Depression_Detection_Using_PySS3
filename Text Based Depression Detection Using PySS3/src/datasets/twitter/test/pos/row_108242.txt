tw. have any of you guys self harmed? i self harmed about a year ago. the scars on my thighs still feel a bit painful and tight from time to time. theyâ€™re almost healed now though.

i only stopped because of the lockdown. with family around 24/7 i couldnâ€™t do it.


idk iâ€™m wondering how this would play out in the future..
