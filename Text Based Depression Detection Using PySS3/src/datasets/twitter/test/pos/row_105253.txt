My bf broke up with me i never post, but iâ€™m not able to talk about this anywhere else so i guess iâ€™m talking about it here. my boyfriend of 3 months broke up with me because he had to leave for college (iâ€™m a sophomore) and itâ€™s been 3 weeks, and i still donâ€™t feel better. i still cry every single day and i donâ€™t know what to do about it because iâ€™m starting to feel hopeless.
