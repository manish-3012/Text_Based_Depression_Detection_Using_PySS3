Home schooling is a better option. - We'll not be insulted or bullied if our race is different or if we are fat, slim, dark toned, short heighted, etc.

- Our innocence will stay inside us for longer period of time.

- We'll not be exploited by those long ass building which trap childrens for 6-7hours everyday. And force them to do things in their way.

- We can spend more time with our friends and family.

- We can focus more on developing our talents, skills or finding our passion, etc.

There are other reasons too. And for those who have studied via this method, do let me know if I am right or not.
