Putin is trying to make it look like hes decentralizing power he's adding a term limit to president of 2 terms and removing power from the president so the prime minister and parliament have more power, I hope this backfires and the united Russia party loses the majority of there seats in parliament, it is possible, a majority of Russians don't support Putin, yes his approval rating is over 70% but over 50% of Russians think there should be an age cap of 70 on president, Putin is 68, that would prevent him from running in the next presidential election
