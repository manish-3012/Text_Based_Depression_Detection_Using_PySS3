I need new shoes yâ€™all for school camp weâ€™re going to be walking in a foresty area and we need old/hiking shoes. all of my old sneakers are either small or the fabric was washed and now theyâ€™re too puffy on my feet and suffocate them (bro i ainâ€™t joking, it hurt to put them on) 

i know what my size is and iâ€™m willing to pay my own money to just get a cheap pair of basic nikes so i can have them for camp and when i walk the dog but my mum doesnâ€™t wanna buy them for me (sheâ€™s at work and could just get them on the way back from work) 

itâ€™s just annoying because i really need some running shoes. i ainâ€™t walking around with my old school vans- might as well just plan a funeral for them right then and there
