Is a gift worth $100 too much to give a teacher? Summary: I want to give my teacher $100 jo Malone perfume, would she feel uncomfortable?

Hi guys! Iâ€™m a high school student graduating VERY soon (so thereâ€™s so bribery involved at all). I had a teacher for 3 years and Iâ€™m really good friends with her. She helped me so much this year with personal things and I basically wouldnâ€™t be the person that I am today if it hadnâ€™t been her positive influence, sheâ€™s basically my role model.

I havenâ€™t really took the opportunity to thank her across the 3 yrs and because I am graduating, I want to give her a meaningful gift that she can remember me with because I am very sensitive to scent and I tend to associate memories with different scents. Because she means so much to me I also want to give her something thatâ€™s practical (not something like a mug because I heard teachers receives thousands of them every year). Iâ€™m also writing her a thank you letter as well!

The fragrance I want to give her is $100 and Iâ€™m worried that she might be uncomfortable and awkward with the price. However, I do not want to give her a cheap fragrance because I want her to use it. I am also going to give her an exchange slip so she can exchange it to whatever scent she prefers if she doesnâ€™t really like the scent I have specially chosen.

What are your opinions on this matter?

Fyi Iâ€™m 17 yr old girl and sheâ€™s in her mid 30s so nothing intimate, itâ€™s just as a thankful gesture for the whole 3 yrs :)
