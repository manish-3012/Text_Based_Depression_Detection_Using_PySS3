TIL redditors cant take a joke, and have to vent everywhere Like come on guys, I make a joke, you vent when nobody asks and be rude, just please go somewhere else to vent, keep ur opinions to yourself, y'know? Its just out of context and I don't want to hear that your aunt died or something in the comments section. Please go to a venting subreddit instead. If you hate my joke, downvote it then go away. Or give some constructive criticism. Anyways bye now. I just wanted to put this out there for certain people.
