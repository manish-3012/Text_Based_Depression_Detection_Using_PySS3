feeling kinda sad tbh thinking about how losing friends is normal but everyday i'm drifting more and more from my "best" friends who were there for me in the past but now we don't talk much because we barely see each other any more and i miss them but things just aren't the same

i moved to a new class this year and while i have some new acquaintances and friends, they're not THE ONE "best" or "closest" friend that i would trust completely and it makes me kinda sad 'cause 1. i miss my friends, 2. i miss having friends, 3. i don't really have anyone to talk to anymore
