Today I was thinking if teenagers should go on a diet for other than health reasons So me (19) and my younger brother (15) both started working out 6 months ago

One difference is that brother also went on a high-protein / low-carb diet and I continued eating the same stuff as before

Looking at us now, it looks like I made some good progress while brother just got more skinny

I don't think this is normal...

What are your thoughts on this?
