I'm a fucking mastermind  I accidentally nutted on my blanket while cranking it, so I had to get an excuse to put the blanket in the washer. So I took some running alcohol and I poured it on the blanket to make it look like a stain and sprayed a bunch of air freshener on it to cover the smell of the alcohol, but not enough to erase the smell completely so I can say it smelt bad. The blanket is now washing and there is no evidence that I nutted on my blanket. I'm a fucking MASTERMIND.
