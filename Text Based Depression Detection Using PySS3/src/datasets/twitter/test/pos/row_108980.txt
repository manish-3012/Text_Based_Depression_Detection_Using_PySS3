Why is this even a counter argument So the only reason my dad refuses to buy my little brother a phone is because " He is to Young and irresponsible " 

Also dad : Complains about home being addicted to videogames


If he is so addicted I'm sure he won't lose his phone
Do you hear smokers complaining about losing their cigarettes?

Plus he is a god kid he only lost a few pens pencil wich I think everybody dose
