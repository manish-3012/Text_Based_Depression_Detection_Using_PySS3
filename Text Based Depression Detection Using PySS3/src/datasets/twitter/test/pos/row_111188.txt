Iâ€™m fucking tired of the us First of all we have a shit president who didnâ€™t take covid seriously and he is homophobic and xenophobic who also made it legal to deny hospital service to trans people and thousands of people have died because of him not taking it seriously and also we have anti maskers who endanger everyone around them thinking they are better than everyone else and we have doctors and nurses doing 42 hour shifts getting underpaid for all the hard work they do and the shit they have to go through just to be 100k in debt for something that should be free since everyone needs an education and our education system is bad and we learn so much stuff we donâ€™t need we spend 32 billion on the military around every 32 hours but yet we canâ€™t put that money in the education system once and we are also ruining lives in other countries for oil we shot a fucking missile that killed 40 children in yemen and we didnâ€™t say anything about that and we need free health care no one ever asked to have a bad disease or a heart attack but if you do your going to be put in debt for a few years and people have died since of our healthcare system. 

even if one person sees this Iâ€™m happy i want to spread the word and sorry for formatting iâ€™m on mobile
