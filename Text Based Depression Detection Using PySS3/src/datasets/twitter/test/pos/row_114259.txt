Hopeless romantic Hi, just thinking back into my past relationships and I can't seem to stop having the mindset of settling down with each girl that I date, potentially seeing them as being my wife in the future. I've always had a "serious" mindset for relationships, maybe pouring my heart a bit too much into relationships. In high school, I've always wanted to "fuck around" but every time I get in a relationship, I just "love" the girl that I'm with. Not to sound emo but my mindset of love has changed over the years. This mindset has seemingly always fucked me over, I would get taken advantage, and in my experience, I'm always getting fucked over in the end. Does anyone else feel like this? And any advice so I don't meaninglessly think about marrying someone every time I end up being with them?
