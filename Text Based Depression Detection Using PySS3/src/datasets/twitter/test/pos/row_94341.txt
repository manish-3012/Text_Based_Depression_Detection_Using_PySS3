How to approach girls in class? So thereâ€™s this one girl in my math class that I like and I wanna start talking to her, we donâ€™t talk, but I wanna know how I can slowly implement myself into her life. The problem is that we have tables that seat multiple people, and so it would be kinda weird for me to just one day decide to sit on the same table as her. What can I do that doesnâ€™t seem creepy and needy to start talking to her?
