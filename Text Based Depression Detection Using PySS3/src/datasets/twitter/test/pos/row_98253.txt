I don't know what to do at this point (basicaly suicide note) I'm fine if you'll skip this post.

Disclaimer:no,I'm not trying to be edgy or quirky.

So.

I will try to get to the point as quickly as I can...

I wanna kill myself.

I feel so fucking terrible,I'm dying of lonelines and I can't get even slightest bit of enjoyment out of a day.

Nothing that made me happy or bring me joy,I absolutely hate every single part of me so I started slicing my skin.

Everybody I loved,young or old fucking died of kidney failiure or bunch of other shit.

I never experienced true parental love,since I was 3 years old social media raised me.

You can say shit like "ooooh it's just a mood swing",no it fucking isn't,I felt terrible for good 4 years.

I lived so long with this gulible thought of things getting better...well...sometimes your best isn't enough...

I decided to kill myself at my birthday which is less than 9 months away.

I can talk for literaly hours but I think that's enough for you to get the point I'm trying to make.
