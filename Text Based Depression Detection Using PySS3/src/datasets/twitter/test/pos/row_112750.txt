Why WAP grosses me out Aight, you probably know about the controversy of this song. It's old news, but I've noticed a lot of girls getting mad over guys disliking the song, yet no one is actually asking WHY they dislike it. They're just throwing around random assumptions about guys being "scared of female empowerment, or whatever.

For me, it's really representative of the loss of hope for the prevention of the sexualisation of women. People hate when men oversexualized women in raps. It's gross. It's rude. It's demeaning, but at least we knew it wasn't ok. No girl would ever degrade herself willingly like that right? All the girls in porn that are degrading are usually poor or being persuaded into doing it. The original "hoes in the house" were obviously considered bad, not as much as it should've been though, and if a girl or really guys as well danced to it they'd probably be told off. People knew it was degrading. The teacher played it in school and said "song = bad" and all that. I don't really know how to explain it, but a girl wouldn't want to dance to a song like that.

But then comes along WAP, which is 50% over-sexualisation of women, 50% a girl doing a guy a sexual favour and giving him a sloppy graphic blowjob, and suddenly 5-year-old girls are celebrating it and everyone is dry humping the floor in time to the beat. And it's a girl that sings it. It's like, oh cool so all those messages we were sending to kids to not like this kind of stuff, all of a sudden it's ok?? Like wtf.

Everyone is saying men are up in arms about it purely because it's a girl and not a guy, but no one is pointing out that girls are suddenly ok with it because it's a girl and not a guy. It just seems hypocritical. But that's just me though
