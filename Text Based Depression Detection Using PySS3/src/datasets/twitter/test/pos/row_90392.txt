I'm tired of all these vegan stereotypes. To start it off: I'm vegetarian. (Not vegan) Never in my life have I touched a piece of meat. Just wanted to disclose this.

  
Literally everywhere I see these memes about how 'vegans ruin everything' 'haha look the vegan' etc. But jeez! I don't think anyone who makes these jokes hasn't even met a bad vegan. Like, I get the animal abuse thing, those people are pretty shitty 100%. But these stereotypes leak into literally everything vegan related. I tell someone that I'm vegetarian and then they suddenly say a 'joke' about me being picky at parties when in reality I just A) am not a party person B) I bring my own food 99% of the time C) if I don't bring food, I don't complain about it. These people are genuinely surprised when I tell them this. It's pretty surprising all these jokes on the internet have changed the way people think about real people. 

 So, to try to help this stereotype issue, feel free to ask questions about being vegan/vegetarian. Please be respectful about it though.
