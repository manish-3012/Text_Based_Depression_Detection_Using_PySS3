My girlfriend Iâ€™m pretty sure is getting mentally abused by her parents My girlfriend (long distance) has been like mentally abused by her parents for so long, they care for her grades more than her mental status, theyâ€™ve taken her phone not caring that thatâ€™s the only way she can talk to me, and theyâ€™ve neglected her over her younger sister. I need actual help. My friends are saying to call CPS but Iâ€™m just worried sheâ€™d be lonely with foster care or be abused harsher by her grandma. I donâ€™t know how to fix this. If she runs away to me then Iâ€™ll be arrested. I need help. Please.
