It snowed in Australia The last time it's snowed in my town was 50 years ago. Im from Australia so it doesn't happen all too often. I was out on a run with my dog and it just started. Not really that heavy at first, but eventually coming in sideways and blanketing the ground. It was honestly the best experience I've had all year, and id thought I'd share it with you.
