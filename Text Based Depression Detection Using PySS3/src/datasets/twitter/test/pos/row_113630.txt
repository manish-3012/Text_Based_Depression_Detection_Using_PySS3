My cat was put to sleep Sometime last week I noticed something was wrong with her, Coco (the cat referenced) along with the other 4 we own usually have their â€œsnacksâ€ after we eat dinner, which has become a normal thing for the last 2+ years, except this time around she didnâ€™t eat any of hers. Normally this would just seem like sheâ€™s being slightly picky or just not in the mood, but it had been like that for the next 3 or 4 days. 

So I mentioned it again and my dad had decided to get it looked at: and even the vet couldnâ€™t figure it out until Sunday afternoon. Then we figured out that she had a tumor just beneath her tongue, in which made her not be able to eat and made her drool a lot.  She liked laying on their bed, or even my own sometimes (which was a bit irritating since she lays on a part on my blanket so I canâ€™t move it around) there was a slight period of time where she could muster up the ability to eat, but that was caused by the steroids they gave her. They estimated and gave her a few weeks to live, but we didnâ€™t want her to suffer more so we had her put to sleep.   

Rest In Peace Coco, I didnâ€™t know you for very long but you were a best friend to me. Iâ€™m just happy you wonâ€™t suffer anymore.
