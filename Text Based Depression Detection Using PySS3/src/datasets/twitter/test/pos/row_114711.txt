Any Celiac patients here? Hi everyone,

I swear I joined this place when I was a teen a long time ago and am not a creep.  I'm a student at University of Pennsylvania and I'm working on a project trying to understand the unmet needs of Celiac patients, specifically in adolescents. We are looking to understand the struggles that adolescent celiac patients go through, whether it be initial diagnosis, management, food labeling, daily life, social, etc. as they seem to be slightly different than adults.

I personally don't have a ton of knowledge on the condition and have only recently started learning more, so I would love to hear your stories and try to get a better grasp about what defines the condition for adolescents today. What can you tell me about being an adolescent and having celiac disease? If you are interested in sharing, I have attached an interview screener. Thanks again!
