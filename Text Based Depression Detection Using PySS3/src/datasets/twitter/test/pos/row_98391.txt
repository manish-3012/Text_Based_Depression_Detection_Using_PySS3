quarantine video project. plz help. so iâ€™m still doing distance learning. for my video production class i have to create an intro for a tv show, and it has to be about me or my idea. meaning i cant go around and film â€œa day in the life of my dog thor.â€ it has to include me lol. i need ideas. life is so boring, unmotivating, and uninteresting i have NO idea what to film. iâ€™ve had a huge mental block with this class from the very beginning online school started and thatâ€™s probably why iâ€™ve procrastinated on this project for so long. iâ€™ve thought about it for a bit but i donâ€™t even know what to do. anybody got any ideas?
