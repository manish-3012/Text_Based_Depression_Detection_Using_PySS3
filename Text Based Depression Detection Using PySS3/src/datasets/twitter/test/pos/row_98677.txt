my life is going to shit lol pls read im in 10th grade, and i'm so devoid of motivation that I don't even care about not passing my classes anymore. its ruining my relationship with my mom and my friends but i still cant seem to give a fuck. i really want to be the honor roll kid i used to be but now i dont even do easy work. i still cant even muster up the little voice inside of me to tell myself to stop being a lil bitch and just do it. the only work i do anymore is the work that my mom makes me do when she gets the occasional email from one of my teachers. id ask for advice on how to care more/have more motivation for school but i feel like its nearly a lost cause at this point. i feel empty man. its like even when someone scolds me or yells it doesnt have much of an affect anymore. i just started dating a girl too, and shes so nice and im going to have to stop talking to her for a while as punishment for my choices. i know if i dont find some solution, (ive heard it all) my future will go to shit right along with my life

idk why im making this but if anyone wants to share their 2 cents or get on me for not doing my work please feel free
