You knwo what I hate? When parents know, acknowledge, tell you, and even sometimes explain to you why they are the ones who did something wrong in a situation. And still get mad at you. Like, if you know YOU did something wrong, don't get mad at the other person. And also when they do something, not wrong or bad just something in general, and get mad at you for it. Especially when its when they say something. Like, I didn't make you say it. I was sleeping! I didn't make you say that. And lastly, I hate it when you are trying to be serious with your parents, but they are constantly joking around and not taking you seriously. Which doesn't let you say anything. But then they get mad at you for "talking so much". Like WHAT?! YOU WERE THE INLY ONE TALKING THE ENTIRE TIME!
