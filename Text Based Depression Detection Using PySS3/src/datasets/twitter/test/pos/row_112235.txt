im going to die Soooo im lazy af and i hate online classes so what i just did is that i wasnt paying attention in class i turn off the sounds and didnt expect the teacher to ask anything but she did and i (for obvious reasons) didnt hear it. Then my friend text me ,,hey man she asked you something" and because i dont want to say anything i just make it look like i have some kind of problem but now my other "friend" call i didnt pick up because i expect bad stuff to happen he then just text me ,,hey!!". And now i feel like im gonna have a problem with the teacher for the millionth time what should i do now i just want to hide somewhere and hope for the best.
