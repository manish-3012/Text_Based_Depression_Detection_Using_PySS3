Advice to all teens no matter who you are from a guy who will soon be 20 â€¢Focus on your grades junior and senior year of high school, they are the most important years to study and where you could end up going to college (if thatâ€™s your plan, otherwise vocational schooling is a big step up into any trade you want)

â€¢Even though studying is important, you shouldnâ€™t make that your whole life. Be social, get involved with clubs and online groups, make friends and connections that will last you, and them, a life time. Everyone that Iâ€™ve met when it came to their high school years always ended up regretting not being more outgoing with the opportunities presented to them

â€¢Respect and understand everyone you come into contact throughout the years, you donâ€™t know what kind of life they are living as the same it is back to you, you could end up helping others or even saving life with the simplest of actions of kindness or just being a shoulder for them to cry on or ears for them to talk to. Weâ€™re in this together. 

â€¢If you have interests you want to get deeper into, find work and save the money you get from it. Even if itâ€™s the fewest of dollars that you save, in the long run it will help you greatly finance any of the ambitions you wish to go for. 

â€¢Lastly, your future is important but your present is even more important. Live in the now and enjoy the memories you make, do your best to break out of your shell and try new things even if they scare you or make you uncomfortable, thereâ€™s so much to life when you keep trying. 

I hope this can help at least one person and sorry if this ends up being formatted bad (mobile loser)
