I hate when people constantly post over sexualised pics on social media. I got one friend who's dating someone. Like every pic they post. Someone's hand is on someone's ass or something.  He has his pants pulled up too much. Or  something to that effect. Like who u trying to impress cousin. I dont wanna open Instagram and see ur cock.  I see it in person already
