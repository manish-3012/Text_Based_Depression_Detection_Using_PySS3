Our cat has just been put down Itâ€™s weird to think that a few minutes ago she was still there... but in a matter of seconds she is just, gone. Now she lies there, motionless and cold. But it is better this way, she had breathing problems. She was 18 years old and lived a good life. I wont forget you mouse, now you are in cat heaven with unlimited cheese (she loved cheese)
