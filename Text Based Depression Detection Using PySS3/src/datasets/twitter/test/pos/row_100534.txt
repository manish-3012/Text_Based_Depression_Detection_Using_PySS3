I actually listened to a good song. I, like every other person on earth, have a playlist of music. Not to brag but Iâ€™ve got some serious bangers on there. Anyways, I would have this playing in the background while scrolling or working or anything in between and tonight I realized that I wasnâ€™t really appreciating these bangers. So I chose to just turn on the best song in the list and just close my eyes and listen. 

Holy shit, it was so nice. It made me really happy. Iâ€™ve listened to this song for years and actually taking the time to appreciate it just felt so nice. I feel happy. 

Thereâ€™s no point to this post. I am just happy that I took a small action and it brought genuine joy.
