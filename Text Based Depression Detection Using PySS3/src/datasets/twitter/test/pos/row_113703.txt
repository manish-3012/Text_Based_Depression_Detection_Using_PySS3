The corn award is really stupid Like seriously, 5 coins?!  
make the award 70 and the recipient get at least 30 to award someone else.(the 20 coin is premium so excluded)  
Like what can you even do with those 5 coins? Unless you grind them(not likely), you can give out those 30 coin ones and still its a waste, since it will take 180 coins, save a some more and just give away darn coin gift!  
look, i know its cheaper and makes gifting coins(and giving awards) more affordable but make its cost 70 and give away 30, at then something good can be done...  
and 70 coins is still pretty cheap for a reddit award when you compare to other ones.
