Car Update Post I talked about tinting my windows, and a few of you wanted to see! I love the hype and the love, but sadly the pictures will be getting delayed. Bad rain just hit my area, and even I haven't had time to fully bask in the glory that is my new tint. Genuinely I am sad due to the weather, but happy for the new details. I'll post as soon as possible
