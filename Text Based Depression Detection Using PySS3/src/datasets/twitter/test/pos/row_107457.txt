Am I doing OK? My older brother recently moved which makes me the next to be the responsible one. My older brother was raised far tougher than me. Iâ€™m scared and I Iâ€™m nothing near as responsible as him. My mom has been putting a lot more stress on me to help and take care of my younger brothers. I am being expected to act like my older brother which has made my mental health lack. My mom has problems of her own going on  so I canâ€™t fully blame her.  She yelled a lot at my older brother to the point in which their relationship isnâ€™t the best but now that I have to take on the responsibilities that he had I am the one getting yelled at. It has gotten to the point in which I hate myself and have anxiety about everything. My brother is able to talk back but Iâ€™m to afraid to say anything back to my mom so I just bottle up my emotions which just makes things worse. I just donâ€™t know what to do and I need help
