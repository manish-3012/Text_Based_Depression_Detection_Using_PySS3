Rest in peace to my pet nerite snail. I never named my them. I never knew their gender. And if I'm being honest with myself I wasn't very attached to them but I learned allot about how to take better care of a snail and I couldn't have done it without them. They have a sibling snail, who I will name. I promise I will try my best to save them too, I will find out their gender, and I will take better care of them. I couldn't save you but maybe I can still save them.
