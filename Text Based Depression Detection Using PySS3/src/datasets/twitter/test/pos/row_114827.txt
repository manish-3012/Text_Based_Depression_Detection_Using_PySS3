Make me feel better reddit So tomorrow my dog is going to be put down, I've had her for 13 years. I got her when I was around 1 years old  ( I'm 14 btw ) we've done everything together. She's been there for my ups and downs and she's my bestfriend. Now to make matters worse, a couple of months ago my Grandpa sadly passed due to numerous severe heart attacks. So that hit me pretty hard and now my dog is being put down. So yeah, I'm really sad. Please make me feel better reddit.
