why am i stupid my friggen dumbazz forgot I had math homework due this morning. I didnâ€™t even have math today I hate when teachers do that. Itâ€™s like apush all over, I was always up at like 3am wrapping up one of his 5hr-study guides because he made it due on a day I didnâ€™t even have his class. Iâ€™m just stupid, I need a planner or something because Iâ€™ve just been looking at the â€œto-doâ€ list on google classroom and going from there
