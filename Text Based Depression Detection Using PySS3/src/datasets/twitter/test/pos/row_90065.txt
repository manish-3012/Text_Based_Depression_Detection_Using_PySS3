Just want to vent out my feelings These last few days I have felt more and more angry, depressed, despaired, tired, lonely and hopeless.

These days it really feels like a rinse and repeat situation. Iâ€™ll wake up at the same time every day, go to a workplace that I donâ€™t enjoy, go home and play games without enthusiasm or watch anime without emotions, and repeat.

There is nothing i look forward to, no birthdays, no holidays, no nothing.

I spend most of my day either swirling with emotions or feeling nothing at all.

I just want all of this to end, I wish all these hardships and annoyances would end
