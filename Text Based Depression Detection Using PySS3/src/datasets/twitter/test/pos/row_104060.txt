It feels like my friends don't like me I don't have anyone to talk about this to or ask for help about so here I am, hopefully everyone here can help me. :)

Growing up as a little kid I struggled to make friends and often got manipulated (I was very gullible), and them abandoning me as a friend. This over time along with other life experiences lead me to become scared of abandonment of people who I make friends with. This lead to me to try to be a funny person and always trying to impress others as I felt that otherwise they would abandon me. I am now 16 and I feel that I have a really good group of friends that could maybe be my friends for life. Although, recently these friends have started to exclude me from things like talking with each other in discord calls, they no longer text me, they play video games without me, and when we meet in person no one pays attention to when I am speaking. Suddenly it feels like the only friends I have dislike and are drifting away from me. I have tried to confront them about it but I get scared and instead fear to deliver the question.  I don't know if they are excluding me or I am self-conscious over that I may lose my friends.  Advice would be appreciated!!!
