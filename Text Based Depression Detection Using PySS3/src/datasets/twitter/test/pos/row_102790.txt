Let's play a small game Idk, I'm just bored, so here it is:

Parent comment asks a question, child answers it, and grandchild finally asks a question that could be answered like that. Then repeat.

(In case you don't wanna play: Have an imaginary cookie ðŸª, a nice day and stay hydrated, guy, gal or non-binary pal!)
