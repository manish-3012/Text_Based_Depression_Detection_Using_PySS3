Social media and why Iâ€™m lowering phone usage You just canâ€™t get out of the trap. Itâ€™s constant bigotry and hypocrisy (hint hint this post is hella hypocritical). Itâ€™s people saying theyâ€™ll do something and then not doing it. People saying they like something and then switching sides when they see fit. Itâ€™s just annoying. 

This isnâ€™t the peopleâ€™s fault in my opinion. Itâ€™s just the nature of how social apps work. Itâ€™s self defeating in almost every aspect. 

The whole situation with lil nas x is what really put this into high gear recently. It just was so much wishy washy people making hypocritical points (not entirely even by their fault) and just hopping on one side of it and not understanding the other. 

Itâ€™s just generally not a good community to be around. And it doesnâ€™t make me feel better. So Iâ€™m not quitting. Iâ€™m just going to lay back a bit. 

Iâ€™m going to work on my school, Finish my projects, work on my dreams and aspirations and just have a good time in life. 

Stay happy my friends! And remember itâ€™s good to take breaks!
