Please take care everyone..... I saw the post of u/moondra15 and I wanted to share something..

One day I posted a meme which enabled others to vent over. It was a good experience for everyone. Then I met someone who is presumably a girl and she vented. Then I was being added to her group with around 20 members who talked only about porn, hentai and one guy even was sexually admiring his own mother! I mean its real life, not some stuck situations! I blocked them and reported them. Yes JoJo's Bizarre Chat I'm talking about you.
Many other instances are the onlyfans bots who are constantly hunting people. And I was once asked for feet pics. 

We should look out for all those. I might be sounding like a boomer but please take care fellow redditors.
