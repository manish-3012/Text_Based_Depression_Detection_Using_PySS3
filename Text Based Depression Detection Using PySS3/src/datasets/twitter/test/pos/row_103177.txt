PARTICIPATION AWARDS ARE MORE OF AN INSULT AND IT DESTROYS THE MENTALITY TO IMPROVE For me participation awards are a fucking insult, I go to a lot of competitions whether want it or not because I can do maths and I come from a non-English speaking country and sometimes my school forces me too or I want to go to the competition, it doesn't bother me but GETTING A FUCKING PARTICIPATION AWARD BOTHERS ME, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, I DIDN'T WIN AND I GET AWARDED JUST BY BEING HERE? A FUCKING DONKEY OR RACCOON CAN JUST SIT HERE TOO! AND FOR PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT MINDSETS IT WILL TRAIN THEM TO EXPECT BEING REWARDED BY DOING FUCKING NOTHING, WHY? "tO NoT hUrt FEeLInGs", FOR 3 YEAR OLDS? FINE BUT AFTER THAT YOU SHOULD NOT AWARD DUMBASSES FOR JUST PARTICIPATING  


Anyways that's my rant, gonna go back to studying, the prizes are pretty good sometimes
