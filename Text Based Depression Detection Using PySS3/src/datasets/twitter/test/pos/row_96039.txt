A rant about word counts I have to sacrifice all my pretty sentences for the sake of fitting into a set structure and it just makes my whole essay void of personality and finesse. I feel like Iâ€™ve ruined my essayâ€™s flow by chopping it up into a corpse barely reminiscent of its original life. And why do I need to do this? I donâ€™t even know? What benefit does word count serve? I understand youâ€™re supposed to fine tune your essay by removing unnecessary bits, but it should not be at the expense of the pieces flow. My essay now reads like a poorly structured piece of shit and itâ€™s extremely choppy. Sentences stop and start and thereâ€™s just no charm to it anymore. I canâ€™t believe that in movies the struggle was trying to make the essay longer.
