Help with script writing! Hello teenagers! So I need some help... I need to think of a story for a script I'm going to write.
The genre is Sci Fi.
And if at all possible I would like it to be quite silly.
I have been trying to think all day and the best I can come up with is a house turning into a spaceship and crashing (for some reason) I'm just not very good at thinking of ideas today!
So if you could help that would be great!
Thanks!
