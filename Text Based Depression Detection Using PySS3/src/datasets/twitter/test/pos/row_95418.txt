usd coin is a cryptocurrency with a 1 to 1 exchange rate with the us dollar if youâ€™re wondering why this exists itâ€™s cuz the government canâ€™t regulate usd coin. as far as the law is concerned usd coin is the same as anything else you own, so legally buying something with it might as well be trading candy bars that are worth exactly $1 for goods or services, the government doesnâ€™t take 10% of ur candy bars cuz it ainâ€™t money, and as far as their concerned no transaction happened cuz no usd was exchanged 

tldr: itâ€™s not taxed, and it has a fixed exchange rate with the us dollar, and therefore the value is effectively regulated by a government, so itâ€™s stable
