Help a fellow teenager out please? Let me explain the situation: we have a competition in our school about making school-themed memes and sending them to be posted on facebook. The main prize is a good laptop that would be very useful in times of e-learning for my brother. All I'm asking for is following the link at the end of my post and liking the meme. I would be very grateful if you did it.
