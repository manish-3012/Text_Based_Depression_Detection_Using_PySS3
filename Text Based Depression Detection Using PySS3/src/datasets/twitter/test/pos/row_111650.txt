An update on my last post Here it is: https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/jlxw03/i_had_momentarily_forgotten_that_to_me_my_mothers/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share for context.

So someone complained that I didn't elaborate.

Basically I met him back in the Summer of '18 and so my mom had to like, actually introduce him to me. She said about how he worked in "adult entertainment". I think he owned a club or something.

But what I was going to say for this follow-up post is that she asked how he was doing and he called me adorable :)
