My mom is amazing Me and my family were all talking about how Iâ€™m the weirdest person out of all of us. Iâ€™m the only introvert, the only autistic person, and... my Mom said â€œAnd youâ€™re the only gay in the village!â€ And I laughed super hard at that despite not understanding the reference at first. Yeah, Iâ€™m the only gay kid in my family as well.
