my birthday memory if itâ€™s someoneâ€™s birthday, my family always buys a cake. i remember when it was my birthday, they asked me which flavor i want. iâ€™m saying â€œi donâ€™t like chocolateâ€ to them for years. i said again. so they bought me a chocolate cake again, i couldnâ€™t eat my own birthday cake. they ate my cake, i sat in my room alone lmao. they even celebrated my birthday after 2 days cuz they wanted to wait for someone. i was alone at home on my birthday, i think being alone at home was the most amazing gift
