About Chadwicks Death. Iâ€™m sorry I have a tough time putting my words and how Iâ€™m feeling into my writing. People who say â€œoh Rest In Peace Chadwick I will miss you so muchâ€ for clout have only watched black panther and only talk about that movie. And yeah I also think he should be remembered for more than that movie, even if thatâ€™s the only movie everyone has watched. If you say that shit for clout and donâ€™t even know who he is, go fuck yourself scumbag.
