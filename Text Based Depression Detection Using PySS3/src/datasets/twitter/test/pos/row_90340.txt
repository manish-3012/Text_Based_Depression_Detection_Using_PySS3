I just wanted to happy vent about my day I've recently gotten out of a bad depression fu k which really sucked but oh man am I do happy right now. 

My only desire is to feel like how a teenager should feel, and today I feel that way. I've been listening to some good music from the 2000s which really brought me back and I'm wearing a really good outfit. 

Last night I went for a night drive with my brother just visiting different chill areas. Today I've had just the best day. I've talked with my friends for a while, saw my boyfriend, had some good discussions with my fav teachers, I hung out with a street cat, dance walked along the sidewalks, picked some flowers, eaten a ton of candy, and kicked a trump sign. It was so fun because people would smile as they passed me and the cat chilling together, they smiled when they saw me dance walking on the sidewalk, and a car full of girls all cheered with me when I kicked the flag

I'm just so happy and as I'm writing this I have a big goofy grin on my face :)))))). 

How have yall days been??
