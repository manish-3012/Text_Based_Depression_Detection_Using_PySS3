Sheâ€™s actually the one who broke me You know how when things end with a girl you dated, or even liked, all the shit you guys did kinda because tough to do again. Like listening to the songs she sent you or watching the same shows or movies or going to your regular places to hangout makes you kinda hurt cuz it brings everything back. Welp she officially broke me. I just donâ€™t feel anymore at all. I can listen to the same songs she sent me, I still watch the same shows, I go to what was â€œourâ€ fast food place and just donâ€™t feel anything. She drained the emotion out of me and itâ€™s honestly so much worse than just being in pain
