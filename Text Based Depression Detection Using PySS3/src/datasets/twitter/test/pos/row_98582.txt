I'm feeling discouraged I'm not sure how long or short this post will be, but if you read all of it, thanks alot!

I want to be a rapper, and I've been rapping for 6 months. My first song was named "EXCLAIM!", and next week I'm going to release a song called "Halloween", on SoundCloud. I think that I've made good improvement, from 6 months ago. But, I usually get told my songs are still bad. Obviously, I don't think they are bad, but that's because they're MY songs. Of course I think they're good. 

In my opinion, I can hear the fucking improvement, but I still get told that my songs are like 2/10. This shit only hurt me today, because someone told me "maybe your not meant for rapping" And let me tell you, that shit fucking hurt.  Alot.  I know improving takes awhile, but surely after 6 whole months, I should have at least 3, or 4/10 rating. 5 at best.

I enjoy rapping, and I don't want to live an average life. I want to rap as a career. I want to be famous. I know I'm only getting my foot in the goddamn water, but fuuuck I thought I would of improved by now.

But yeah, that's just my little rant. If anyone wants to listen to my music, I'll link in the comments (unless thats not allowed. if its not allowed ill dm it to you)
