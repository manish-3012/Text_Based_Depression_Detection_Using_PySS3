Can you, big frickers, shut up about the 9/11? I know that a lot of you epic gamers want to look nice by posting some diarrhea of thoughts and prayers related to 9/11, but seriously, it's been 18 years. Noone cares anymore, it happened, nothing can be changed.

In 2019 alone, 86 planes crashed (257 fatalities), in 2018 - 557 fatalities.

How about you focus on something else than the media?
