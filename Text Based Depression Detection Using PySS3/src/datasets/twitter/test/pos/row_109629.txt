Found out masturbating is actually kinda dangerous... This is definitely a personal thing, but a couple days ago I was... yeah, and I ended up holding my breath for some reason. I honestly have no idea why, not as if I was being held at gunpoint. I nearly blacked out, it was so weird. This probably hasnâ€™t happened to that many other people tho.
When people start asking â€œwhat was your near death experience?â€ I am not bringing this up.
