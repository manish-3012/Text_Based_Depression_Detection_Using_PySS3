love how sometimes when I ask or say something to my dad he literally ignores me yet yells and insults me if I dont respond to him luckily it's not everytime I ask or say something , and I guess it's better that he ignores me rather then yell at me ha . it's just really irritating and he's been doing this since I was fucking born . it's like ,, I *know* he hears me , I spoke loud enough and I'm looking directly him (but I'm too afraid to repeat myself since he'll get mad and I'm too embarrassed anyways) yet he jus doesn't say anything or even look at me . but ooohh nooo as soon as I don't respond quick enough to whatever bullshit he's talking about I automatically get insulted , yelled at and then he's just mad at me and doesn't even wanna talk to me anymore .(even though it's just him ranting) it also really sucks cause anytime any person doesn't hear what I said or acknowledge it I just get an overwhelming emotional flashback and all that dumb stuff . my mom does the same too except I genuinely can't tell if she hears me sometimes and she doesn't really yell at me . idk it felt kinda good to get this out . I'm reading this over and over again and boy I word shit weird
