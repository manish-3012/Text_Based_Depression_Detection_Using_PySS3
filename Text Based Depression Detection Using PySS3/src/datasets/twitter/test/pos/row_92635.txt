Writing short stories until I feel better about my writing. Day #4 The twist and turn of the sea, softly rocking a woman with soft blue eyes, and a slender waist. She was on board the Snowdrop, a small fishing vessel. The ship had seen many battles along the ocean, from the callousness of the waves. The woman felt at home on the vessel; it was as if this small ship was where she had truly belonged. She was not the owner of the Snowdrop, but she had been on board for a long time. The owner of this vessel was unknown, and she truly hoped they would not miss the ship. She sailed along the oceans, it being peaceful most of the time. The woman didn't know where she was going or why she had left her home. It just felt right to her. The ocean grew calm, peaceful, and came to be more friendly. She spotted the coastline from the cabin of the ship. The peace of the ocean made her feel oddly sociable, so she took a dark blue dress she had stored in a chest in the quarters of the previous owner. As she stood anchored, a storm that was larger than life drifted in. The ocean churning once again, the ship that had been home becoming a hazard without a moment's notice. The woman, now in her neat blue dress, walked up onto the deck to see the ship being assaulted by a force that felt unnatural, and yet all that more natural. The ship creaked and groaned over the battle it was having to endure, attempting not to capsize. The sheer white mast of the ship swung, clobbering the woman over her head. She stood in mid air, as if she were flying, the ship rocking more violently as she hovered near. The ship in all of her glory, shimmering white with her name painted to her side. She was beautiful, and yet repulsive. The ship slowly sank, water flooding her from the inside out. As the ship had become one with the ocean, the waves tearing her apart making the immense beauty of the vessel become unrecognizable. The woman slowly lowered into the water, letting herself be one with the ocean.Â
