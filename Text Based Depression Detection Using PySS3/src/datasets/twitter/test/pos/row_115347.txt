My brain sabotages me when I go to sleep and I canâ€™t get over my ex girlfriend because of it. It was actually scary, she sent me a letter and said she was moving across the country and I had until Thursday to say goodbye or whatever and I couldnâ€™t get away from anyone to go find her and on Thursday morning I finally left to hunt her down and when I got to her house it was empty but on her bedroom floor was the necklace she had that had my name on it and so I went and hunted for her but at some point I found my biological dad and I got to see my sisters. God i miss them so much I think that part hurt the worst. Anyways I kept seeing her but I couldnâ€™t ever reach her and I was getting so upset over it every time it felt like I was dying and then the last time I saw her she was outside in someone back yard and everything was super bright and she looked at me and she smiled and then I just woke up. I hate having dreams like that. They just remind me of how incomplete I feel without her. We broke up in september and i canâ€™t get away from the thought of her. I havenâ€™t even talked to her in months.
