We literally just accidentally killed two fucking birds. I feel real guilty. So there were a lot of mice eating our fruit in the backyard so we set up mousetraps with bait. For the first few days we caught a few mice. Then today I went to the park with my dad (with facemasks and social distancing ofc) and then we came back and my dad said there were two fucking birds in the mousetraps. They were the beautiful birds that had beautiful voices and flew around the garden and made us happy. And we fucking killed them.
My gosh oh fuck.
