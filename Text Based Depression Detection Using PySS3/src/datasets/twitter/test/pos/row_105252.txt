Endless Corridor. A poem written by u/Ytoppop (posting so more ppl see it) It was a sad day
Where I found myself
Lost in a hallway,
Just a hallway itself.

Then I looked in awe
Near the end of the way.
Suddenly I saw
Even I could be great.

The light there was bright,
Iâ€™d exceeded at last.
I had done life right,
All the hard times Iâ€™d passed.

I had seen my place,
And I liked that vision.
I would start that race.
Iâ€™d made my decision.

I got near the end
But the hall was moving!
No time would I spend
My life was improving.

But the hallway got longer
No chance it would stop.
I needed to be stronger
I could still be on top.

I still could be great!
I could do what I please
But Iâ€™d taken the bait,
I could not be at ease.

I started to run
But the hallway still grew
I couldnâ€™t be done,
But at this point I knew.

I couldnâ€™t make it
This ploy had me beat.
I decided to quit,
Nothing left but retreat.

Happiness left me
As I lay there in tears.
Iâ€™d never be free
From the thoughts and the fears.

As I lay there forgotten
I subtly knew
The knowledge Iâ€™d gotten;
Iâ€™d never come through.
