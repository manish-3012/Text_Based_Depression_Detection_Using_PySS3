Summary: My country is shit with streets filled with dogshit and corrupt politicians So i just learned that the department of education in philippines just lowered the summer break from 2 months to 2 weeks. 

How shittier can this country get? Students are stressed beyond repair because of school. The streets are filled with dogshit and homeless people, yet they aren't ashamed. I can't wait to move to a better country.

I'm already stressed enough from school and considered ending it when i couldnt handle it because i'm only 13. If you think this country is shit, just wait until you travel here. All the beautiful vacation spots and beaches cover up the fact that this country has so many corrupt politicians. Priests don't even get to pay taxes and instead the government pays them! THEM! They literally pay wannabe man of Gods to brainwash kids into thinking they will go to hell if you so much as make ONE sin.

If you even say you are athiest, you will get a lot of weird looks and everyone will beat you. There are so much methheads and drug addicts here the numbers just keep on rising. Churches are everywhere, and when i say everywhere, i mean literally everywhere. Everywhere you go you will either find people who have crosses on their motorcycle or shop. 

Honestly, fuck this country i'd rather move to Florida.
