Why are girls so heartless... Im not sexist, don't hate me for the title please ðŸ˜‚ but I'm gonna be straight up.

I feel like most girls have no logic when it comes to dating... I've been around so many breakups, and had to put up with so much heartbreak, it's exhausting

it's ALWAYS THE GIRL who decides she doesn't love the guy anymore. This time pissed me off so bad and I can't handle it...

My homie was planning on getting married to this girl he been dating for 9 YEARS! (They're both 22) and she turned him down...

All that work. All that time spent together, why would someone fucking do that??? What did it mean? Did it mean NOTHING??? ðŸ˜‚ I feel like committing a hate crime sooo bad...

Girls. Please. Let me give you some advice. Don't do this please. Let him KNOW you don't love him prior dating, or at least a little bit after. There's no excuse why you should put anyone through this bullshit
