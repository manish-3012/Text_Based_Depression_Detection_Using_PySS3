What should my Anime be? Iâ€™ve been trying to get into Animes for a minute now and Iâ€™ve been looking at a lot of the Studio Ghibli films, but I think I wanna watch a show first. So any show suggestions?(or first Studio Ghibli films, I guess)

Iâ€™m not really sure what anime is like and stuff...like Iâ€™ve watched some movies and I really enjoyed the Avatar series, but I know those arenâ€™t actually animes. Really just looking for some help, and if you have an questions Iâ€™ll be happy to answer. Thanks.
