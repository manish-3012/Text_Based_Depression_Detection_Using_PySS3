I wanna meet some æ—¥æœ¬äºº teenagers (Reposted cause im stupid lol)

Hello random person,
Im just a 16 yo dude who really wants to learn japanese but Iâ€™d especially like to make some jp friends to hang out, chill and play games with. You donâ€™t need to be good at English, thats part of the experience! (Though if youâ€™re reading this you probably do speak English)
I also want to make clear that i donâ€™t want you to teach me the language unless you REALLY want to (in which case i would probably teach you french if you want or something idk).
I just want someone around my age to do stuff with and experience the language and cool people around it! 

Thank you!

Also (as you may have guessed) im bilingual in french and can communicate in German if you want   :)
