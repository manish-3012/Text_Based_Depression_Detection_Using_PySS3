Donâ€™t really know what to title this, but thank you for listening. On the way home my mom said that my dad told her that he felt bad for the way Iâ€™ve been talking to her recently. I canâ€™t tell if she said that in a joking-ish tone or not, but I know he had to have said that to her. And now I feel really bad, kind of like the worst person alive. I really love my mom, so the fact that I wasnâ€™t speaking to her right just makes me feel worse.

And this is going to sit with me for weeks. Iâ€™ve been really trying to stay positive, but this month has been hard for some reason. I feel so stressed and like Iâ€™m not doing anything right, like thereâ€™s something wrong with me. I just got off of my period too so thatâ€™s probably not helping. I feel like I sound so negative when I speak, maybe I should just stop talking all together. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m good. I feel mean and I donâ€™t want to be mean.

I apologized a lot and she said it was okay, she kind of said it with a smile. But I still feel bad. I feel awful. I didnâ€™t mean to speak badly.  It all feels like itâ€™s too much, all of this.

Thank you x
