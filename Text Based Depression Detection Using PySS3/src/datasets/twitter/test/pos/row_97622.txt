I'm 18 and my parents never allows me to leave home without them, because "I'm a girl". Background: I'm 18, I have no friends, no job, and I am not enrolled in college. Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, and I graduated high school, all I ever do now is staying at home and just play on my phone all day. I never go outside or anything other then just shopping with my parents sometimes.

Anyways, today I asked my parents if I can go hiking somewhere near our house by myself. They insisted that they must come with me, because I'm a girl and it's "dangerous" for girls to go out in public alone (FYI: we live in a small suburban area in southern California). Then I told said to them that I'm 18 and I just want to go hiking somewhere near our home and I'll bring my phone. But when I said that, they then said "why don't you ever listen to us?". Then I just said "nevermind" and walked away.

This isn't the first time this happened; they've NEVER let me go out in public (other than school) without them, but they ALWAYS let my 15 year old brother do that, simply because he is a boy. What can I say/do?
