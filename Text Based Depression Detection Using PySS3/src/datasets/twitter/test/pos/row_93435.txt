Finished high school, not in college, in lockdown, how to friend? Okay sooo most of the people I know from high school have become super busy with college and stuff lately, and I've been even more lonely than I was at the start of the lockdowns.

Re common suggestions: I do freelance so my opportunities for colleague friendships are slim to none; it's corona time so sports clubs and stuff aren't going on; I'm not big on coop/mmo video games which sucks because I know that's a common suggestion; and Discord is just full of creepy guys in my experience

The only other thing I can think of is joining stan twitter even though I don't really stan anything?? but idk

Any advice would be really appreciated, thank you &lt;3!!
