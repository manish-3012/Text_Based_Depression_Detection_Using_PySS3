boyrfirend applications!!!!!  If you really think about it, part 4 is very similar to among us. Yoshikage Kira is the imposter and the duwang gang are like the crewmates trying to sus him out. But when he changed bodies it was like him venting away and now they need to catch him to report the body. You can also think of sheer heart attack to be like a sabotage from among us because it will force the crewmates to stop chasing him in order to deal with it. What do you guys think?
