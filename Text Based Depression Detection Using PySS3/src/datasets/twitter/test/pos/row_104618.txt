Lockdown is pissing me off So, lockdown, we are all used to it by now and would struggle to get back to the old life, but people are really pissing me off because I rarely go to my friends house and we can literally talk and play ping pong and that's it. Yet when I look at any social media I see the same people, right next to one another and completely ignoring social distancing. I have to struggle with just seeing my family and rarely my friend, and even when I see him I have to distance, yet apparently they have rights to see eachover without masks, distancing or anything
 It's just pisses me of that they have the audacity to do so.
