Vote for Pedro! Follow Up So earlier this week I made a post about me putting up posters from the movie *Napolean Dynamite.* Post linked [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/jar5vs/vote_for_pedro/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) Sadly, they have been taken down. But no one knows who took them down. I suspect the counselor, because my parents are good friends with the principal and he thought the idea was funny so it wasnâ€™t him. I didnâ€™t go to school today â€˜cause I was feeling sick, but I plan to put more up.
