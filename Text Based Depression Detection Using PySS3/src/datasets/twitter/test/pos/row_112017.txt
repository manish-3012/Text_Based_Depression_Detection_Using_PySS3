I want to die I was in English and needed to hole punch something thick. There was a line at the hole lunch and I was first so I went and tried to hole punch it. I put it in and press down but the handle was really loose so I thought I did something wrong and tried to look for a safety or something. Turns out it was really loose by design. I was pressing weakly because I didnâ€™t want to break it because it was loose as fuck and everyone thought I was an idiot.
