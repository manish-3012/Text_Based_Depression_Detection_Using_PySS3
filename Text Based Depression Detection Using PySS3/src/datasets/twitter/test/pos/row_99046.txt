Dont make my mistake. Don't listen to ppl on this sub For context it happened 2 months ago

I would do this on a throwaway but fucking bot tells me I need more karma. Every time I go on this sub I see people being like I finally lost my virginity or something like that. I that I would be fine when I t happened to me but I was wrong. I'm not going into details because it pains me to think about. I betrayed my parents trust by not following their simple rule and I don't even know if I can trust myself anymore. The guilt is slowly eating away at me and I can barely stand it anymore. I can't even be by her anymore without feeling guilty. It suck it truly suck and it is the worst decision I have ever made in my life and I am sure I will regret it for years to come. So please don't make the mistake I made. Don't make everyday a living hell for yourself like I did
