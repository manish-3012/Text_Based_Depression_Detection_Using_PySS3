I love my boyfriend. I love him very much. He makes me very happy and I am glad to be his partner. He's absolutely adorable when he laughs and he's so sweet and caring. My heart melts when I think of him. I am so happy to have him in my life.

That's all, bye.

Edit: thanks for all of your kind words, we really appreciate it.
