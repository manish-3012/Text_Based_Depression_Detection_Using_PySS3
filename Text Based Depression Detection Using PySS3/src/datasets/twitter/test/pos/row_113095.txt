I'm big sad You ever just keep in touch with ur ex cos she still wants to be friends but shes kinda hanging u on a thread saying she "might" get back with u so u dont wanna let go cos u miss her and u ask her how her day was and she says shes finally happy and u realise everything i thought about how i am as a boyfriend is bullshit and people just tell me what they think I wanna hear instead of telling me what's wrong and then I cant be there for them and ultimately u wasted ur time thinking that u could ever be a good boyfriend to someone?

Just me?
