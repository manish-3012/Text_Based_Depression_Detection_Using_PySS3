for the college kids and their zoom classes for those of u still begrudgingly attending classes as an undergrad via zoom... you could / hypothetically / pay someone to attend the whole 2021 zoom class for you as the teacher wouldnt know the difference, having never met you. or, if they do have a student id photo of you, you may need to hire someone with a close resemblance

(dm if you're into this or need a brunette female look-a-like )
