Just some thoughts I've been trying to do things that I want to more, and things that I don't want to less. I have this weird thing like, "I want to play video games but I also want to finish this video" and then I realise I might not want to actually play video games, but I thought I did because it was that time of the day. I've also tried doing things like speaking up and being more confident, even if it's hard. I have pretty low self esteem / confidence so I think I'll be judged for things. Eg: I thought about not making this post because I was worried I would be judged about something, but I wanted to so I am. 

This isn't directed at anyone, not you or anyone. I just wanted to write down my thoughts and I decided to do it on this subreddit. And this isn't really a rant.
