So I go to school on Thursday and my sleeping schedule is all over the place I need to get up at 6am on Thursday and I donâ€™t go to sleep until 3-4am anyway, so I donâ€™t know what to do and Iâ€™m sort of an insomniac and I want to be well rested for school, but Iâ€™ve been laying here for the past 2 hours trying everything Iâ€™ve heard to fall asleep and Iâ€™m more awake than ever, I havenâ€™t been on my phone in those 2 hours so itâ€™s not blue light itâ€™s just that I canâ€™t sleep. I try to set an alarm in the morning but I usually unconsciously turn it off and go back to sleep without even noticing it. Iâ€™m wondering if I could maybe stay up and late as possible tonight so I get a shitty sleep and then maybe tomorrow I could sleep well? It might not work if I crash at like 10am. That would be bad. Any suggestions or help?
