Hey guess what guys... Guess... C'mon, GUESS! G U E S S - Yeah you know what day it is, it's that one day of year. Thanks for the good year of reddit and stuff. It all started with just wanting to post one silly thing and now I'm staying, whoopee. Thank the good people of this site for the laughs and all that. I also made a meme but I couldn't post it here but whatever.

And that's it, thank you for listening to a 15 year old ramble on.
