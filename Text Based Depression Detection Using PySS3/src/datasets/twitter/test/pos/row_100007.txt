Haha, Iâ€™m a fucking failure. Iâ€™m trying my tucking best and miserably failing every class. Iâ€™m not gonna pass this year. My mom says Iâ€™m trying my best and thatâ€™s all that I can do, but if this all that I can do, then thatâ€™s pretty embarrassing. I donâ€™t want to get held back, but at this point it doesnâ€™t look like I have much of a choice, so thatâ€™s great. Probably another fucking year of school, but hey at least no one knows that I exist, so it wonâ€™t be that embarrassing!
