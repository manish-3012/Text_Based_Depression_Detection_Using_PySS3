I became a hero today I was sitting in my math class today (in school) when I hear a thump and a "jesus christ" from my teacher in the front. A girl had collapsed and was convulsing on the ground. She was having a seizure. I ran over and the teacher lifted her head up to cushion it from shaking and hitting the ground. I flipped her onto her side so she wouldn't choke on any saliva or vomit (if any came out). I told the teacher to call a nurse and she did immediately. I tried to keep the girl still so she wouldn't hit anything and hurt herself. The nurses came in shortly and took over. We went to a separate room and continued with the class while they tried to stabilize her. The teacher came to me and told me I was very brave and that I did the right thing. she even said in her 27 years of teaching, she had never had that happen. My heart still races when I think about it
