Help! (Sorry if wrong flair) So I'm in a relationship, I'm polyamorous and have a crush on this other girl in school too. I want to tell her how I feel but I don't know if she would be ok with a poly relationship and I don't want to ask her because I'm scared of that being too obvious I like her but I don't want to keep my feelings internal.
