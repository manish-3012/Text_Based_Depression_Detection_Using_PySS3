How to talk to girls Hey guys, so basically I met this girl I donâ€™t know her irl, sheâ€™s 2 years younger than me iâ€™m 17 and sheâ€™s 15, and iâ€™m trying to talk to her. I feel like my topics are so boring that iâ€™m boring her to death, I mean we just started talking yesterday but itâ€™s really boring stuff, I use snapchat mostly to talk to her, I met her on tik tok and commented on her post with her native language.. there arenâ€™t many danes living where I live and so I think we have something in common. The thing is I really donâ€™t know how to talk to girls.. I really need your help guys m trying to bag her ðŸ˜…
