People are so stupid, yeah mask donâ€™t provide any protection from covid There is a warning on the back of the box of mask that says â€œwill not provide any protections against covid-19 (coronavirus) or other viruses or contaminantsâ€ and anti maskers are using this as an excuse not to wear a mask, please donâ€™t be stupid, mask prevent air from going out but letâ€™s air in, that means it prevents you from spreading your virus but letâ€™s you breathe, you might feel good but you might have the virus and you might be spreading it without knowing it thatâ€™s why mask are important, it prevents people from spreading the virus
