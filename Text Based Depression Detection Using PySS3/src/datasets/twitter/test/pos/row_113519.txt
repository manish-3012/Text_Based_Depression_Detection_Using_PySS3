i got broken up with. I saw him on sunday. literally two days ago. he picked me up and spun me around, and he gave me a dried rose. we painted together and looked at the stars. he told me he loved me. this morning, I woke up to a text from him explaining that he was just using me for sex/character development. I was nothing to him. he was the only thing keeping me sane, i have no clue what I'm going to do without him. I've been sobbing since 9 AM, it's past noon now. i can't look at the rose he got me, i burst into tears when i see it. but i cant bring myself to throw it away. he was the only person i had left. its genuinely hard to breathe, I feel like a loved one just died. i don't know what to do.
