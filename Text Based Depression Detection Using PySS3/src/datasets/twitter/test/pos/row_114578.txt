The IDR website y'all are getting your personality assessed from isn't actually real science, as far as I can tell Title. A few tests are certainly based on some actual psychology research and studies (Michael Stevenson, Meyers and Briggs) , but the actual testing format is very biased and of low quality, which kinda makes sense considering they're free. Some of the claims on the site are ridiculous though, like their IQ test, which, besides having only 16 questions, DOESN'T ASK FOR YOUR AGE, WHICH IS THE BASIS OF AN INTELLIGENCE *QUOTIENT* TEST.


So yeah, take them for fun, but don't expect the majority of the "accurate" quizzes on whether you're a sexist or racist or radical Islamist to be actually legitimate in any sense.
