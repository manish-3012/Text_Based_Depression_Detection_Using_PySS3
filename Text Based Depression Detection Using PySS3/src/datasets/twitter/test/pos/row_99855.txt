I just wish I could talk like a normal person This is hands down my biggest insecurity. My voice is monotonous, quiet, and boring. I keep repeating the same shit multiple times and once I become aware of it, it just becomes even worse. Today I was talking to someone and I kept calling something â€œthingâ€ and I just felt like I sounded so stupid. I was asking a question and I had no idea how to phrase the question. I could hear it in the tone of the other personâ€™s voice, it felt like they were judging me. I know I sound stupid, the other person knows I sound stupid. I donâ€™t know why I canâ€™t stop.

I feel like I can every once in a while get really energetic about something and talk on and on about it. I donâ€™t feel like I sound boring because Iâ€™m actually in to what Iâ€™m talking about. The problem is then I come off as annoying. I also keep accidentally interrupting the other person and I probably come off as rude which is also not my intention. I just donâ€™t know how to find that good balance. I donâ€™t know what the right thing to say is in situations and it has gotten to the point where I just dread it.

I love listening to people and hearing what they have to say but I canâ€™t show that Iâ€™m genuinely interested. I canâ€™t even put in to words half of the shit I thought I knew. I sound like a dumbass and I wish I could just sound more confident and I could have a varying tone of voice. Iâ€™m seriously considering going to one of those people that can help me talk when I get older. I feel like itâ€™s gotten really REALLY bad.
