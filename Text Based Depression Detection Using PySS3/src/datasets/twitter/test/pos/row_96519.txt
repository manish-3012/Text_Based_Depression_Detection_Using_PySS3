I just read the wiki on "friendzone" and never realized anyone considered it a sexist thing Like seriously people, I looked it up, and all of them are twisting what it is to fit a narrative and none of it seems to make any sense. The entire argument of it being sexist is basically that is paints the man as deserving the woman and the woman as the bad guy for not liking the man, Okay, that's one thing, but then it goes into so many other totally pointless tangents that completely deviate from the original point of what a "friendzone" is: an unresiprecated romantic feeling. Of which these include: -Saying that it's not a good friendship if you can't be happy to just be friends even though you have romantic feelings for the other person, which seems completely illogical to call it sexist because you cannot instantly not like someone because they don't like you -Saying that it's bad for LGBT people because it... is a thing usually shown between straight people. Don't get the logic there. 

Overall, the whole thing is based off oversimplified and purposefully twisted views of the concept that make no real practical sense and why exactly anyone would be so involved in this line of thinking, I don't know.
