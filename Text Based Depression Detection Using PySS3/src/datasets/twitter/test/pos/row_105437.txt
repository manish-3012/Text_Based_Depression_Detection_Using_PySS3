Iâ€™ve been doing phenomenal recently. I wasnâ€™t doing very well for a long time due to my struggles with my autism and aspergers. Iâ€™ve been getting better and progressing and just being more me I guess if that makes sense. Iâ€™ve stopped masking in public, Iâ€™ve accepted that Iâ€™m different and I would never change that for anything in the world. I still have my usual problems with my anxiety, and my overall social skills but they arenâ€™t as severe anymore. Iâ€™m so thankful to the people who helped me get to this point and I donâ€™t know if I can express it enough. 

I just needed to express how I felt ig.

Thanks for reading, have a wonderful day homie.
