Hearing the Word â€œRa**â€ makes me wanna Get violent  just wanna clarify that months ago i was dating this girl online ( lets call her A) A was a nice girl and she had a best friend ( lets call him T ) T was in love with A and then when i got together with A in a relationship T became nice but then jealousy took him over and then one day i was texting A and then T came over to her house and he told me in â€œDisturbing Detailâ€œ how he was gonna RAPE a and take her virginity and at this point my emotions went beserk from feeling intense Rage and sadness but then something awoken inside me which was the scariest instinct to....Murder T and when T said this i told A to defend herself by biting on T Dick really hard until he backed off but this Incident Broke me Mentally and which it made me Call upon every Pain and Suffering upon him and i even called satan and all evil forces to kill him but then a few weeks passed he contracted Covid and Cancer and later Died but in the end it made me wanna have this Bloodlust Desire to Kill any rapist in the most horrible way possible but at the same time im scared about be becoming a Horrible Psychopath....

Now this pain Haunts me and now anytime i hear the Word â€œRapeâ€œ or hear anyone getting close to being raped my heart starts beating and my blood just starts to boil, i just wanna get this off my Chest because i know if i let it cling to me it would cause more damage then it initially did....
God help me.
