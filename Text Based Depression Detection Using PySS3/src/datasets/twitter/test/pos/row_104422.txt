a word about hobbies You donâ€™t have to do something to be good at it, or to make something nice. You do it because itâ€™s fun, itâ€™s relaxing, itâ€™s exercise - whatever! Itâ€™s easy to get discouraged if youâ€™re not good at something, but try to keep going just for the fun of it. Make that ugly plushy, draw unrealistically, start a wobbly crochet blanket!

Also: Hobbies arenâ€™t gendered! So many creative, relaxing hobbies are â€œdeemed girlyâ€. Many of them are awesome basic skills to have, like sewing to repair clothes, growing your own food, or learning to cook meals! Boys, you arenâ€™t limited to MEAT and SPORTS and CODE. And vice versa! Try something new this year, and see how it goes. Getting started on new things is hard but itâ€™s so worth it for the enjoyment.
