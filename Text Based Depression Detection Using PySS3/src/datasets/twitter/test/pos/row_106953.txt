Sorry for the depressing post, but i feel like i need to share this. Ever since i turned 18 i have been terrified of dieing in a war. Like any idiot can do something that would spark a war. Almost 19, almost a full year of this stupid thought. And i havent done anything with my life, had a stupid relationship, havent gotten my drivers licence, god knows if ill ever get my dream car. Hoping to get into college i like (psychology). At least i have an amazing mom and an amazing friend. All i want is a peaceful life with an amazing girl...

And this isn't even something i can control, some sicko pushed the big red button when he meant to grab his cup of coffee or something, idk. That's the worst part i guess. No control at all. I voted for a candidate that is anti war of all shapes. (Don't live in 1st world, Bosnia)

Anyone had a similar thought? 
If yes how did you handle it?
