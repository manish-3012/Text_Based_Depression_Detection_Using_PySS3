If you have a deep/high voice, what are some things people have said to you? Im curious to see if there are any creative ones.

For me, i have a relatively deep voice. I was on the phone with my friendâ€™s mom and when i told her my age (13 at the time) she went â€œoh really? I thought you were someones mom!â€
Of course i told my friends about it and they all agreed that yes, i sound like â€œa forty year old soccer mom that smoked one to many cigs before the gameâ€ 

What about yâ€™all?
