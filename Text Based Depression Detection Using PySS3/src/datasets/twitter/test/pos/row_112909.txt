For you guys saying super straight isn't transphobic It's the exact same as someone *bragging* that they "don't date black people" and getting offended when someone calls them racist.

Bros if you're not attracted to a trans person, no one said that's transphobic. Saying you're "more straight" because of it and showing off that you don't date trans ppl is the shitty part.

I don't care about your actual preferences, but calling yourself superstraight is the part that's genuinely transphobic. Or at least incredibly fucking rude AND inherently invalidating
