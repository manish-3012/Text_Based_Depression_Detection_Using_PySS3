My mom is really pissing me off She just came into my room when I'm just on my computer and I can either show her what I'm watching/doing and have her make some snarky comment about it, or I can turn off what I'm watching/doing and have her act all offended and call me rude for not showing her. Then she says I have to write 2 college essays by the end of the weekend since I have no homework, even though I was planning to relax this weekend, and plus the essays arent due until october, AND PLUS Im gonna go to community college so I dont even want to write essays to apply to 4 year colleges but for some reason shes making me. Then she says shes going to have me retake my senior pictures because I didn't smile good enough, which I knew would happen cause I was super depressed the whole week before senior pictures and I knew I wouldn't be able to bring myself to smile. But she just gets mad at me for not smiling because she thinks im mad at her and just doing it out of spite or something, but like I WAS DEPRESSED AND I LITERALLY COULDNT SMILE IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME BEING MAD. Then she asks what I want for dinner and I know we have some blue apron pork meal, so I said I just didnt want to eat the blue apron meal because I didnt like pork. But she said shes going to make it anyway, and I dont even know why she got it in the first place since I have made it clear I dont like pork. She says "oh but it tastes just like chicken" which 1: no it doesnt, and 2: I dont even like chicken that much and I would prefer to be vegetarian. But my parents just make whatever they feel like for dinner and get mad at me if I dont want to eat it, even though I tell them multiple times what I like and dont like so that they can account for me. Jeez
