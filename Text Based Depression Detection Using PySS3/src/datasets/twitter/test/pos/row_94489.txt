FINALLY SCHOOL IS OVER And yes, it is my last year of school. Also it was the 25th anniversary of my school. Yeah, big year it was until covid hit my country. This was the WORST year of my life ever. I didnt realise that until today. And it's not even because all of the prom things we have been planning have Home to shit. Its not because I couldnt see My friends, or because my family had to cancel that long awaited trip we have planned for months. It is because this year is a completely WASTED year. And i'm not going to get it back. The only good thing that has happened this year is that i entered uni. And i dont feel good shout that, because my parents have lied to me. They have been teasing me with the idea of taking a year off, trolling me I didnt have to worry much about having to enter uni once I finish school. But a week ago i overheard them talking about I should get a scholarship as soon as possible. Also my school has tried NOTHING to even make this year remotely better. All it tried is failed experimentation after failed experimentation, until they stopped trying at all mid year, basicslly telling us to fuck off. It even tried to ruin our plans to make a virtual graduation possible. I fucking hate that my school havent even tried after years of innovating and bringing something new each past year of school. This was THE YEAR. But they havent tried. 

And no mom, don't tell me to put effort in class when they don't want me to watch it.
