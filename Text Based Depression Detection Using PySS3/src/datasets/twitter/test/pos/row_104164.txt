What should I do when the girl I like wants to date another guy? I(M15)have liked this girl named, letâ€™s call her Kate(F14) for about a year and a half. We dated the year before but I had to break up with her because I was going through some bad stuff and I couldnâ€™t handle it all. I still have liked her though since we broke up and have been trying to date her since. So now Iâ€™m trying to date her again but she likes this other guy.


The only problem is I canâ€™t get mad at the guy because heâ€™s pretty cool. Heâ€™s this skater guy from Utah who goes to the beach a lot and seems really nice plus I must admit heâ€™s objectively a â€œhot guyâ€ (no homo). Although I do have a concern with the fact that the guy is only fourteen and heâ€™s already had sex. Usually thatâ€™s something a duck boy does but other then that heâ€™s a great guy. name is â€œTrevorâ€. Sheâ€™s only liked him for about a week or two though but she really likes this guy, like a lot. This guy is pretty much better then me in every way and although I like her a lot I donâ€™t want to ruin our friendship by telling her I like her. 

The only thing I have going for me is that he lives in Utah while she lives in California but even then she doesnâ€™t care and she wants to go over to his house for her birthday where quite honestly she has told me she wants to fuck the guy.

This is where my heart sank because I actually helped her with relationship advice because I just wanted to help but now I think Iâ€™ve helped her to date this guy. 

What should I do in this situation. Confess my feelings or let her date this guy?
