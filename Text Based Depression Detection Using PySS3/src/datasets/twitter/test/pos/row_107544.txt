I hate this feeling. I hate it so much. ever just see other people with a complete family and I'm here who doesn't have one

Although I was quite happy mom and dad seperated, but still. I wish there was a father figure in my life. 

I don't know how to do male stuff that well and sometimes I get ostracized by other guys. I show too much emotions too and I cry when I want to cry. But I get judged for it. Fucking sucks.
