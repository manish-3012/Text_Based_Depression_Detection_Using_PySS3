WHY ME Every time I send a message. Always in the back of my mind is â€œare you sure? What if people hate you for it?â€ I always try to put in a happy face to hide it. Every god damn time, I JUST WANT TO FIT IN AND HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS. ITâ€™S BEEN SO HARD. Iâ€™VE EVEN BEEN REJECTED SEVEN TIMES WITHIN A THREE YEAR SPAN BECAUSE I WANT A GF BUT **NOOOO** Iâ€™M NOT FUCKING GOOD ENOUGH BECAUSE OF MY DAMN AUTISM. Iâ€™M TOLD TO JUST GET OVER IT. YOU BE IN MY SHOES AND SEE HOW HARD IT IS. BUT WAIT, BE WITH ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS, I GOT TWO CLOSE ONES RIGHT NOW.
