IDK something dark I guess Sometimes I want to put a brick wall to good use, and headbutt it over and over again.

Sometimes I want to just poke my arm with a knife, until I break the surface to relieve the tension.

Sometimes I want to burn my arm just to calm down, and let my anger disappear.

Sometimes I want the world to end.

Sometimes I want people to acknowledge me for being a masochist.

For me pain is pleasure, but I just can't handle the pain in my heart.

I always knew life would be difficult, but I never thought it would be to this extent.
