(17m) Ok so When I was younger my parents always told me and my siblings that we have a set number of tears we can cry. 
Obviously I didn't believe her at the time but now it got me to think. Two of my uncles died recently. I was really close to the both of them BUT I didn't cry a single tear. I felt like pain and shit but I didn't cry. So I think a have wasted all my tears. What are your thoughts???.
