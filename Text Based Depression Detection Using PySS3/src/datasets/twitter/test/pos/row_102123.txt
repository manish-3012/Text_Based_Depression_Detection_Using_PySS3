What can I (14) do with my gf for a first date? We live about 40 minutes out from one another and we want to meet in the middle, but neither of us can make it, mostly due to our parents who donâ€™t know weâ€™re together. Should I ask her to come to me, as thereâ€™s stuff to do in my town, or do I go to her, as my parents are slightly more understanding? Either way, what should I do with her (small Australian country towns)
