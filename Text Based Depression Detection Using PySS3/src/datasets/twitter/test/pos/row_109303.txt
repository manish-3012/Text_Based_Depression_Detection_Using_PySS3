Goodbye teenage years It's offical, I am no longer a teenager. It's been fun and all, but I have now entered the depression 20s.


Some words of wisdom:


Don't go to college right away if you don't know what you want. I did and I spent my whole freshman year in constant panic. I figured out by sophmore year but it wasn't fun.


If you have any mental illnesses, please get help. I finally got medication as a 19 year old and it's changed my life.


I'm not good at advice so that's about all I got.


Best of luck you teens
