Goodbye reddit. Was okay being with ya. To be honest, reddit has mostly brought me major suffering, which the minor fun times i have had with it does not cancel out. Because of reddit i lost my social life, i joined a community just to leave it as a very well known bad person, and i gained a girlfriend just to get dumped by her. While these may be my errors too of course, i feel like if they weren't started by reddit, and if perhaps it was real life, it wouldn't have gone the same way.

So yeah, i'm leaving this account, maybe i'll make a new lurking account if i really want to some day.
