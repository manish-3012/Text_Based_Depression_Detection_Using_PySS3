WAP is literally the worst shit Iâ€™ve ever heard. I straight up left my apartment for a 10 pm jog in 30 degree (Fahrenheit) weather because itâ€™s so bad. Iâ€™ve been trying to figure out why people unironically like that. The best I can come up with is: people are stupid. I can get that everyone has different taste in music but that doesnâ€™t even count as music. Like Jesus fuck itâ€™s bad. I feel bad knowing that I was in a room that streamed that â€œsongâ€ and made whoever rested that abomination a few cents. I could go on but I can barely feel my hands
