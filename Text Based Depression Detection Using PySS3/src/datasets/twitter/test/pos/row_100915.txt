I have terrible teachers. I am ineligible because my teacher "accidentally" put the wrong letter in for my grade, she comes to me in class and says "Hey, I'm sorry that your ineligible, I
accidentally put the wrong letter for your grade, sorry!"
This was going to be the week where I was going to get my first points of the season, these teams are really good but I have gotten better. And the grade was religion, I know that's the whole point of a catholic school, but, it the easiest class.
