Why must I live up to other people's expectations I'm 18 and I barely achieved anything in life. The once little motivation I had was crushed by my mother because I didn't live up to her expectation. I just stopped giving a damn ever since then. What's the point of me trying if I'm never good enough to other people. There's no difference in me trying if they're still going to be disappointed in the end
