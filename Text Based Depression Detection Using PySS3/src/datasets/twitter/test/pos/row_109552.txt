Destroying my math teacher In 10th grade, our school changed math teachers and since I used to sit at the last seat in the class, he thought that I was a prick and wasn't good at his subject. I mostly didn't pay that much attention since he taught basic trigonometric functions in the first semester, he used to call me out all the time. Then when distribution of papers, he called out my roll number and did not believe I got 99 on 100. He was speechless and you could he his face! That was just like an anime moment where the protagonist holds on until the right moment to show his power lol.. he never crossed me again during 10 th grade...
