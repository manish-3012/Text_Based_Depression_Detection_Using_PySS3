Please donâ€™t do it guys There are soooo many people that care about you that you donâ€™t even know. The suicide prevention hotline worker, the stranger looking at Reddit on his phone, or a girl that liked you care. I care. There are so many people on this subreddit that can help for free. I know this kind of bitchy but I had a dream where I found out my mom overdosed, and when I woke up cried for an hour straight. It is not worth it. If the world you are living in doesnâ€™t want you, go to a different one, move out, get away from toxic people. Even worse when you have passed theyâ€™ll be â€œsadâ€ that you are gone. Everytime I hear about someone committing suicide, a gaping hole in my heart widens.
