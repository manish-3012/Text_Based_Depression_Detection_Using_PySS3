Big fat Chonky vent tiem Iâ€™ve always wanted to vent but I have no one. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m resorting to this- anyway 
So here are some details 
My parents divorced when I was around five I think 
They never got along and I never got along with my dad. I never liked going back and forward with houses and I found it annoying and extremely unfair. I donâ€™t care how selfish I sound saying this but I wasnâ€™t the one that fucked up in a relationship so why should I have to go through all the pain of dealing with it. When I was around 11 I walked to my mums house from school (it wasnâ€™t very far away) on a day that I was meant to go to my dads house. I had had enough as he never supported me with my extra curricular activities and his new evil wife would basically control him. After months and months of arguing I finally managed to stop going to my dads when I turned 12. By this time my mum had remarried. I never liked the idea of remarrying and i never liked her new husband. He had bad intentions and still has bad intentions. As my mum and her new husband moved in together, so did her new husbands two kids. They were both boys and are older than me. (Iâ€™m female) I already had a brother at this stage too so living with a male wasnâ€™t anything new to me. This simple life went ok for a while but then my mum and my stepdad had another child. I already knew this was bad as I knew their child is gonna have to go through the same shit as I do because I could already tell that their relationship was going to end badly. I didnâ€™t say shit tho coz my mum doesnâ€™t like it when I have an opinion and whenever I go against something she says Iâ€™m unGRAteFuL.

Although I felt uneasy and sad all through my life of going back and forward with houses and adjusting to new lifestyles, because I was fairly young I didnâ€™t really try and fix it much and the sadness wasnâ€™t too much. It was only last year when I started to feel depressed properly. I remember at the start of the year I was very self conscious about my body. One night I started crying and I didnâ€™t know why so I hid in my bathroom and basically wrote all of my feelings down on a piece of paper and hid it somewhere in my room.  Here are a few parts of it 

â€œIâ€™m starting to feel something deep in my heart. Itâ€™s like a void. A darkness trying to overcome me. I donâ€™t know what to do. I have no friends so I canâ€™t talk to anyoneâ€

â€œEveryone thinks Iâ€™m happy. Everyone thinks I smile. But the thing is. Iâ€™m not happy and I donâ€™t smile. Itâ€™s all fake. An actâ€

Then I go on rambling about how I was bullied and how my parents broke up and shit 

That was the first time I started to feel â€˜depressedâ€™

My step dad has gotten a lot more aggressive in the way he speaks and moves. He will shout at me all the time when my mums not around. Sometimes he will shout when my mums around too. Oh yea btw if youâ€™re still reading it by this point, thankyou for giving a shit about my life. Iâ€™m not used to anyone giving a shit so this is a nice change I guess. Ok back to what I was saying. Term three last year was the scariest time for me last year. My mum and stepdad were both very angry at me as I had tried to stick up for myself. My mum then grabbed me by the throat and pushed me against a wall. I was screaming and crying at this point, as well as being suprised as although my mum gets very angry I never thought that she would physically attack me. Screaming and kicking, I managed to get out of the position she had put me in and I ran down stairs where my stepdad grabbed me and was squeezing the living day out of me. It was so hard to breathe and I screamed. My mum came running down and got angry at me for diStruRbinG mY bRoTherS NApTiMe. I then went to school and had to pretend that nothing happened. After school I was still very shook by what had happened and I tried to ignore my mum so she wouldnâ€™t get more mad. She then made it seem like I was the one doing the wrong thing and I had to gET ovEr IT. She apologised the next day thinking that I would forgive her. Too scared to say anything otherwise, I accepted her apology and moved on. 

Now moving on to this year
My stepdad treats the whole family like shit and gets away with it. I tell my mum that she needs to leave him but she keeps saying itâ€™s cOmPlIcAtEd. One night, my mum and stepdad got in a massive fight and the whole house was filled with shouting and shit. I went to bed early that night just to stay safe. I went out to go to the toilet in the middle of the night and saw my step dad stumbling up the stairs and speaking weirdly. I could tell he was drunk so I quickly ran into my room to stay safe. I then heard him swing his bedroom door open and walk in. My mum shouted â€œdonâ€™t touch meâ€ and at this point I was scared out of my socks. My brother was also awake at this point too. Long story short my mum, brÃ¸thÃ«r and I had to leave the house and stay in a hotel for two nights, Yet my stepdad expected me to just forgive him. 

I have so many stories just like this but I ainâ€™t got the time as I am currently feeling extremely suicidal, venting my ass out while hiding in the bathroom. 

I just want to run away. I want to run away to a far away place. Away from my parents. Away from all my toxic friends. I keep telling myself that death isnâ€™t the answer but maybe it is. I donâ€™t want to suffer. I know shit is just gonna get worse in the future. Maybe death is the answer. I have nowhere to go and Iâ€™ll just have to spend five years locked in this prison called my parents house. I donâ€™t want that. I donâ€™t want to suffer. If I run away I know there gonna report me as a mIsSInG chULd and Iâ€™ll end up having to go back. I just want to disappear. I want everyone to forget I exist and start fresh. 

Great. I can already hear my mum and stepdad shouting as Iâ€™m typing this. When will this end. 

Also I ainâ€™t gonna read through that whole thing again so sorry about any grammar 

If youâ€™ve read this far, thank-you. I appreciate it
