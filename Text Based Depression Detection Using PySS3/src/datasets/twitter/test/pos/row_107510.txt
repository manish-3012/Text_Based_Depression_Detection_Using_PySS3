I had at the indoor pool contact with a pedophile. (probably) i was 8 at the time.  i went to the indoor pool with a friend and our parents.  my boyfriend had to leave a little earlier so when we left i was alone in the shower.  So when we left, I went into the shower, there was a man there, about 35 years old, thin and wearing these short swimming trunks, those that these professional swimmers always wear.  I went to the other side to shower but he came right after and stood next to me.  Of course I don't like to undress next to someone who is also much older than me.  So I took a shower without taking off my clothes, but the man pulled the upper waistband with his finger and said I should take off my pants!  I was 8 but not stupid so I didn't because at first I thought he wanted me to wash myself properly.  but of course it wasn't!  i didn't tell my mother that either because i had forgotten it again.  but a year later I remembered it and realized that he was actually a pedophile or something like that!  In retrospect, when I remember it and think about what else could have happened, a cold shiver runs down my spine.  if i had been smarter i would probably have just screamed for help.

Im glad nothing happened!
