Big Bruh Moment at my oldest sister's apartment Backstory: My older sister and her boyfriend lives in an apartment about like a few steps away from a nail salon (like literally infront of her). 

This happened a few minutes ago. I was siting in the living room and my sister in high school said their was a lady walking to our door so my sister said " Hey there is a lady walking to our door to me and my sisters boyfriend (my oldest sister was at work). And since we didn't lock the door she just open the door and said "is this the nail salon". All of us just stood there for a few seconds and then my oldest sister boyfriend told her where to go and I stood there think how the fudge she thought a place with a freaking oven, exercise equipment and a sink. I just wanted to call her stoopid.
