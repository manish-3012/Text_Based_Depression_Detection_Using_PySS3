Writing out my thoughts as a 16 year old high schooler boy  I'm 16. Everyone in my age starts to get relationships, starts losing their virginity and im starting to get the fear of missing out of something. However, I have opportunities with girls, but i dont feel like i could maintain a relationship. I dont know how to explain it but i dont feel like i need or want somebody yet, but society tells me that it will be better, i will be okay then if i get a girlfriend etc.

Its really hard to explain because my mind is a bit messy currently.

A bit backround of me. I started improving myself a few months ago, i started working out, i see some gains, i started reading, and i'm more mindful overall.Aaand its lockdown in my country so going out meeting people is very very limited.

TL&amp;DR  i dont feel like losing my virginity or jumping in a relationship, but im afraid i will be seen as a lonely loser if i dont do that
