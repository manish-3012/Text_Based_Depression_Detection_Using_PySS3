I hate some kind of people I hate the kind of people that are arrogant and think of themselves like the alpha of the room and think of themselves and highly intellingent individuals. I was talking to a friend of a friend today and we entered the discord server and we both said hi and then shut up. I think to myslef hmmm i m going to say a funny story and he laughs and he continues the conversation, which is what i would do. I tell him the story and all he says is "okay". But that kinf of discracesful ok. The kind of okay you get when someone tries to say hmmm yeah, but who asked. Then, suddenly he says mannn, girls suck. I give my opinion on this subject and we both shut up. Then i try to open up again and tell him that one of our good girl friends is starting to bully another friend and then i get the same okay. I ask why is he sarcastjc and he says sth and doesnt continue the conversation. Then i heaf another discord call in the background amd he leaves without even saying goodbye. God how much i hate these people
