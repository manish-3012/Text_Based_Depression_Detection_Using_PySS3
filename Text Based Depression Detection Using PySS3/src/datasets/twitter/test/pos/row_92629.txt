Need some advice Iâ€™d appreciate if people wonâ€™t wonâ€™t be super aggressive towards me on this, but thatâ€™s out of my control 

So about 6 months ago, I cheated on my girlfriend, I told her very shortly after (I already feel like shit about this you donâ€™t have to remind me to). Weâ€™re still together but it comes up every so often, and itâ€™s getting worse. We want to stay together but the thought just lingers. Is there any way we can get some closure on this so it doesnâ€™t come up again?
Thanks in advance, hope yâ€™all donâ€™t hate me too much.
