guys what do you think of this fanfic idea it's a crossover , sonic and friends get chaos controlled to another world , with master chief , the covenant did something weird to him , now he's somewhere else . commander keen gets sucked into a wormhole for no reason , doomguy finds something weird , samuel hayden and dr eggman and the covenant work together , cortana argues with vega and stuff , keen and tails build something and i don't know.
