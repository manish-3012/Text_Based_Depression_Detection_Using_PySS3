Worst mistake of my whole life. Few years ago i deleted all of my old videos.
I recorded them on my phone as a kid and uploaded it to youtube. There was a lot of cool stuff that i want to watch it now, but i cant. I remember few of them, and i want to cry. Most of them was infinite minecraft pe videos recorded with mobizen.
