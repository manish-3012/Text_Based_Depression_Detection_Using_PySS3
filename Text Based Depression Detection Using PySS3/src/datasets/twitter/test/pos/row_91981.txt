I want to drop out of college but don't know how to tell my parents Working full time and taking 20 credits (normal full time student would take about 15 max)  is a lot, and I dont have time to do stuff I like anymore. I don't need the school for my career, and my current job pays pretty well for a fresh high school grad ($14.50 an hour ain't bad) and I want to focus more on my hobbies. I want to be an artist, the eventual dream is to freelance out of a tiny house in the woods with all my cats. I don't necessarily need art school, right now I'm just doing generals at a community college so I can get a design degree at a university. I don't know if this is gifted child brain quitting as soon as things get hard or if its actually a logical decision to drop out. And if I do decide to drop out, how do I tell my parents without them thinking im a failure?
