Yeah, it has been 3 years since i lost you as a friend but do you know that i still blame myself for whatever that has happened?

do you know that i became even more afraid to interact with other people or open up to them?

do you know that almost everyone whom i thought i could trust turned their backs against me because of our friendship drama?

do you know that because of what happened, i start to overthink every action i do, wondering whether i screwed things up or whether what i did was weird?

how could you say "hi" to me with that smile on your face after whatever that has happened, and more importantly, how painful it affected me?
