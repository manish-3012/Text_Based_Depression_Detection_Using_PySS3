I don't exactly understand what I really am when it comes too, well, mental state? I am a simple gal, I'm not exactly, down in the dumps, I feel I'm already beyond that, I'm extremely calm and mostly unreactive, I've gone through things I rather not speak of publically, they've hurt me, and I'm mostly a bitter, angry person, I'm not a bad person I'm very calm and understanding, stated by my friends, I am a decent and I don't have any screws loose, but I don't understand, what the hell am I? What does it mean when I'm just so, emotionless and bitter, empty, but yet others see me, as well as well as myself, as a decent human, I don't get it, I'm not exactly the brightest on my own self, so can I get a bit of help/advice? I just want to understand, what the hell am I.
