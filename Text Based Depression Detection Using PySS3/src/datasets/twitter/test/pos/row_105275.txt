I hate it I hate sitting here moping about how lonely I feel but I don't do anything about it.

I hate sitting here moping about my weight but I don't do anything about it.

I hate sitting here moping about how I have no future plan but I don't do anything about it.

I hate not fixing my problems but I don't do anything about it.

I hate not knowing how to fix myself. 

I want to change. I want to be a better me; but I don't know where to start.
