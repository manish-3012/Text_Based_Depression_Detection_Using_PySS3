Please judge my relationship! -(Follow-up to my previous post.) As a beginning, there are many flairs that fit this, so I chose discussion because I felt it fit best. For consideration, I am one of those awesome 14 year old males. Believe it or not. 

My relationship is working, I think? I've been in one relationship before this one, and it was very toxic. My previous girlfriend wanted a strong man, someone to start a family with her, someone to settle down with. Simply put, that isn't me. I suffered much trauma from this relationship, whether this was deliberate from her or not is unknown. Though, the worst of it all, without competition, is, "Jester Anxiety." Which, I have mentioned previously, in my last post. Now, what is jester anxiety you might ask? Constantly feeling pressured to perform, be interesting, make jokes, and put in all the work socially. There is much more to this. I'm not sure if this is historically accurate, as I haven't read up on the subject much, but jesters were killed if they were not humorous enough? Please, educate me if I'm incorrect. Now, this relationship, it's online. She's two states away. So, texting and calling are all we have. We both have busy schedules, with overwhelming school work, her soccer practice, it gives us two short windows in which was can talk: one immediately after school ends for three hours. One for as long as we can stay up once she returns. We talk, we laugh, though, I'm not sure if I'm good enough. Please, people with experience, I would love to keep her as my girlfriend, and advice on how to maintain an online relationship would be adored. We call, we even called around an hour ago and played a video game together. I honestly have feelings for her.. the jester anxiety, though, I'll shortly elaborate; it dries my throat, gives me a headache, and causes me to feel humiliated. Anytime she doesn't act entertained, or I'm not making her laugh, my jester anxiety will flare up. I will begin overanalyzing every little thing she says, or texts, (similar to how I manage my work in school) which leads to horrible presumption and inferences, which leads to a terrible mood, which leads to a worse conversation- it's a spiraling out of control sort of thing, which recently has caused me to sob six separate times during a day, and proclaim our relationship couldn't last to her. We have very similar interests, we both share very similar world views- overall, we're incredibly similar, though how would I capitalize on this? I need to maintain this relationship for multiple years, until we meet, and I'm not sure how I would do it. This is incredibly important to me, please, any advice. Thanks, whoever you are. I'll try replying, but I'm going to bed soon, after I finish this next chapter or two in a book about geography (I love geography).
