I donâ€™t have the confidence to go on my date I have a date with the most beautiful girl in the world on the beach tonight. itâ€™s my last day of vacation so it is very probable that i will never see her in real life again. She has expressed that she wants to kiss and cuddle and whatnot, and I adore her. I just donâ€™t have it in me to do it. Weâ€™ve been talking 24:7 on the phone for the last 4 days and like she has told me so much stuff she hasnâ€™t told anyone else before. I have never had my first kiss, or ever cuddled a girl. Pls help
