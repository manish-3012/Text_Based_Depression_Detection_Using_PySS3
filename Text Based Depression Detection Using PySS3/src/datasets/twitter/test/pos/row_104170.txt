Can gaming be a passion? Iâ€™m 17 and since i can think i loved video games, and everything started with my first nintendo ds and pokemon SoulSilver. I played video games all my life and loved it so much, either it was on a Wii or a playstation. I had my â€œpeakâ€ about 2-3 years ago with my ps4. I played mostly games like R6S, Cod but also stuff like NUNS4 etc. and even if iâ€™m not the best at any of these games i just loved to play them. I played everyday and everynight. 
After i finished my nine years of school i started my first Job as a floorlayer with 15 (i live in Switzerland) and i slowly stopped playing videogames anymore. One reason was definitly the more limited time now but there was another. I slowly slipped in the â€œhustlerâ€ and â€œself improvementâ€ scene and more and more i had different interrests. I started working out, started reading more, set goals, started to search my passion, just more â€œqualitiy timeâ€ you know it. With all this advices from people such as a garyvee etc, i started thinking more and more that the videogames was just a waste of time...

Anyway, after two years i realizied that a lot of this stuff they told me wasnâ€™t really helpful and that the scene often is based on lies. So, i just picked out the things that are really helpful such as excersice etc. and will continue with those.

I quitted my job a week ago and i will start my new on october 1st so this means i still got over 6 weeks of vacation. So, yesterday i thougt: â€žwouldnâ€™t it be funny if i install my ps4 again and play a round? you know just for funâ€ So, i did it and it instantly felt like two years ago...

I still knew everything like, i played 5 minutes and boom, it felt like the old times when i played through a whole weekend with no pause and i absolutly enjoyed it. I played for about 3 hours, went outside and was so excited to come back and continued to play.
While i searched for my passion the last two years i never felt that excited so now i asked myself, could this be a passion or is it just a addiction and an alcoholic would feel the same if  he would start to drink after two years of abstintence?
