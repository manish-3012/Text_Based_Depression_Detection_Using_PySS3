Iâ€™ll give gold to the least upvÃ²ted comment So yeah, I currently have another one of these running in the same sub, so go comment on that one too if youâ€™d like. I have just enough coins to give two golds

So just say whatever will be the most painful to upvÃ²te, and the comment with the least upvÃ²tes in 24 hours gets a free gold. (Obviously only parent comments)
