I have to create a chatbot from scratch for my school project. Can anybody help me or give some tips? So I'm having a hard time with my chatbot because I really suck at coding and was wondering if any of you guys are like HTMl/CSS/Javascript gurus or something, because my stupid project is due next week and I only have like 100 lines of code down smh.
