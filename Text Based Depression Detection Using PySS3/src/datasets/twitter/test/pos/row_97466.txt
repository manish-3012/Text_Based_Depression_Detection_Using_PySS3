I have an idea What if, this is a big fucking if. What if man kind just stopped killing each other and united under one flag, and we all just put our money into technology to try and scour the cosmos and CRUSH ANY HOSTILE XENO SPECIES THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF THE IMPERIUM OF MAN! *clears throat* ahem, sorry the warhammer came out in me. But legit if we stopped killing and hating each other for simple differences we could be living on other planets in a few hundred years easy. We're all still human, and we shouldn't harm our own race.
