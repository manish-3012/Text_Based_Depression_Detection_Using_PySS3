I'm at an all time fucking low right now I have a mini fridge with some random crap in it. I'm supposed to be asleep right now. And I've made some hershey's syrup about an hour ago. I'm not able to go downstairs and grab a cup bit I really want chocolate milk so I'm taking a sip of milk, taking a sip of chocolate syrup, and swishing it around in my mouth. I hate everything about this situation
