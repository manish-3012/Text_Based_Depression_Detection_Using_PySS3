idk how to feel f15, bisexual.

came out to my mom about a year ago. been paranoid about telling anyone else in my family (aunt and grandmother specifically). turns out my mom told them already. didn't ask me for permission, just shared it with them. only just learning about this. was scared of the idea of coming out to them, because my whole family is super religious. I wanted to tell them on my own time.

is my mom in the wrong?
