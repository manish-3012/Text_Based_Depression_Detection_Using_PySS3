Im not sure why but i can feel again. I genuinely feel sad for the first time in forever I think I genuinely loved that girl and i hate myself for taking her for granted. I wish i never did what i did bruh. I wish i wasnt so fucked in the head. Now im all by my lonely, sad, depressed, idk. I kinda wanna just go but i know im not done with whatever i was put here for. Idk man. I just feel, something.
