Im Crushing on Him so Badly Bruh Im crushing on him so much it hurts. Honestly being around him makes me so happy. I really like him. Im such a pussy tho. Asking him out is impossible for me. Im really bad with relationships and crushes and all my past ones ended horribly.

What if I ask him out and it ends with us never talking again like the rest of them???

I really like hanging out with him and being around him. What if me asking him out ruins everything??? Im crushing on him so badly but what if it will end the same as all the other ones? I like him so much. I wanna be with him so badly. This hurts. Im so scarred of rejection but Im even more scared of not having him even as a friend.

Crushes really do crush you huh :((((((
