I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll ask my family to refer to me by they/them pronouns We donâ€™t have a *bad* relationship but itâ€™s confusing. I donâ€™t like to bring up serious topics or anything like that. For example: when I come out to my mom I couldnâ€™t even say it. After like 45 minutes I just wrote it down on a piece of paper and showed her. So I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m gonna ask them to use they/them pronouns when referring to me. I really want to ask them but... idk, Iâ€™m pretty terrified of like everything
