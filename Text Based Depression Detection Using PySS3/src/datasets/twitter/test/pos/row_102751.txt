Half days So my school had a half day, and it perplexed my. Classes are an hour, yet for a half day they made it 50 minutes. And lunch is 25 minutes, but now its ten. How does that make any sense whatsoever? Can you even call it a half day? If any of you have normal half days, please tell me the schedule because this is preposterous.
