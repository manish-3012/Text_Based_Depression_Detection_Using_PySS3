My mathematics degree belongs to the kids with learning disabilities who smarter than me but canâ€™t do school There is kid who is my age who did not get into any he applied for. He has ADD and cannot focus on homework. He is now painting because he canâ€™t find an engineering company who will accept his autocad licensure because it is not from a university. 

This kid scored 780 on the sat math section. If I were a manager, I would hire him and put him on a fast track to become an engineering director. 

Credentialism screens out people who could do incredible things with a credential. 

Why are we like this?
