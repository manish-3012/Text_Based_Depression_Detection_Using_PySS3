Conflict Resolution So there's this kid in the grade below me that I thought was my friend and he's talking about my girlfriend and I and it's really weird. He keeps talking about my ( Â° ÍœÊ– Â°) to everybody acting like he's seen it, which he hasn't. He's not saying it's small or anything but it's still weird he talks about it. On top of that he shit talks my girl and this weekend I'm confronting him about it. What's the best way to convey that I'm not playing around with him and that I'll smack tf out of him if I hear anything else he's said?
