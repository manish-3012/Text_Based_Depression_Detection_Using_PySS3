So I did a newbie mistake I, a 16 year old high school boy who goes to school but does hw online, manage to fuck up a $1000 HP laptop by cleaning the most important part of the computer with water. Yes Iâ€™ve heard all the warning about how dangerous it is for a liquid to have contact with electronics and yet I still did it because I was tired after the PSATs. My laptop was dirty so I cleaned it but I forgot to be cautious with the keyboards and I strait up wiped it with a wet sponge. For those who donâ€™t know: water + keyboards = get fucked, and thatâ€™s exactly what happened.

I donâ€™t have many important stuff in it but I take computer science class in school and I have many coding homework in my computer but because I murder my keyboards I canâ€™t do them so I have to download my homework and move my work to my other computer the Dell shit box ( the shitty computer you first get as a kid) and that might take a while so ... crap. 

Anyway I got the HP laptop for my birthday less then a month ago so I still have a warrant to replace it so Iâ€™ll do that tomorrow but in the mean time while my folder full of homework ( not porn ) is being moved Iâ€™m gonna play age of empires which I can just play with the mouse.
Iâ€™ll keep an update on what happens to it.
Not much of an interesting story but eh itâ€™s something that just happened and I wanted to say. Itâ€™s also an advise to not just strait up wash the computer with water but instead put water in a cloth or something and clean it.
Sorry for being long...
