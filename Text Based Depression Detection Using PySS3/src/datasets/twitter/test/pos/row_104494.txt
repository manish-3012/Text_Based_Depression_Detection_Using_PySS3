Shrek Meme PSA People use the meme, "like that will ever happen" when referring to something far-fetched, such as a kid telling their mom about economics. Now it's an alright meme, a little old, not to overused.

But there's one glaring issue: if you actually watched shrek, it does happen! So you're basically that the event did in fact happen, just not immediately. Anyways, thank you for coming to my public service announcement, stay in school, don't do drugs, epstein didn't kill himself
