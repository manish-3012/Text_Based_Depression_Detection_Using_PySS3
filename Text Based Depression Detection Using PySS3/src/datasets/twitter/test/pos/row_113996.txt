some people actually just enjoy being rude and shitty people i will never understand why like there is a difference between being strong willed and confident and actually just being a cunt and theres such a fine line between the two they may as well not bother. sure sometimes i enjoy being a little bitchy it can be fun, but man, people who do it every day and make it their personality actually need a slap in the face and to grow up lol. it really ainâ€™t that hard to just be nice and considerate of others
