There's blood! I went to the bathroom, started peeing and then it hurt, I saw that the liquido was some strange color, I got so scared that I stoped, Now i'm sitting in my coach. I'm still scared, why did this kind of think always happens to me? Should I Go to a hospital or should I just wait and see if no thing happens next?? :(
