A problem just came up I need help So my older brother who is the grade above me and his friends took a video of these two kids in my grade making out when they didn't know it, and that is such an invasion of privacy, and I'm really bothered that he would do that. this one girl I know, who's one of my best friends told me to get that video for her and her friends. I said I don't know, as I hadn't seen it at the time. Then, somebody asked  my friend Where she saw it, and she lied and said that I had it. Now, people are telling me to get the video to them, which I am so not going to do. I don't want to lie, or tell that she was lying, because I don't really want to ruin her social life. What should I do to get rid of the issue?
