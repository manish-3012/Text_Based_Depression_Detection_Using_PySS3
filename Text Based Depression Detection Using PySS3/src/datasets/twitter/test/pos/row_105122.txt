I feel bad for all the people that think this Everyone is saying that biden will take our guns. Now let's see the likelihood of that actually happening. (NOTE- I am not saying republicans or democrats are bad I'm just explaining a common misconception) So the second amendment is the one about guns and people think it will be revoked with a new amendment. Now amendments are kinda hard to make, so hard in fact that there has only been 27 in the ~250 and more than half of them were made in the first 20 years of america being a independent country.

Also to take peoples guns you would need to override another amendment which has only happened once, the one that revoked the prohibition.

Then we have to mention that the second amendment is part of the bill of rights which this cannot be amended using the topical 2/3 vote from both houses. Since there has never been a amendment to the bill of rights there is no instruction on how to even change it. So how would they change it? They won't, so stop worrying about your guns.
