Everyday is the same I wake up. I shower. I walk my dogs. I go to school. I get out of school. I do chores. I eat dinner. I play video games. Then I go to bed. Rinse and repeat. This has been every day since quarantine and online school, and Iâ€™m sick of it. I often have trouble remembering what day it is or what thing happened on what day and Iâ€™ve gradually become more depressed because of it. I donâ€™t even know what to do to fix this problem. Goodnight all
