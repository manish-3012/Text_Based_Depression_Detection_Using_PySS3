Somebody come shoot me in the head. Not actually but a hug would be nice So I was messing around with this guy tonight, sending photos and all that jazz. Then my sister barges in my room, tells me to "put some pants on weirdo", then left. So im laying there mortified with my face on fire. Pretty embarrassing but you know, everyone gets walked in on at sometime. At least it wasn't my mom. But then my ex found out that I've been doing stuff with with other guy.

Well im sure you're thinking, "he's your ex, why the fuck should you care if he's hurt or not?" And the truth is I shouldn't. I shouldn't feel bad but I feel like the juice at the bottom of trash cans. Disgusting. I never wanted to hurt him, the only reason I was even doing what I was doing was to get him off my mind and maybe move on. And the whole time I was doing it I felt sick.

I dont know man I just dont know what to do. These last 30 minutes have been a rollercoaster
