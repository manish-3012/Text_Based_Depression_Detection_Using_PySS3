This is advice for all yâ€™all If youâ€™re one of my trans brothers or sisters, go be yourself. Youâ€™re cis but want to dress as the other gender? Do it. You hate politics but keep on getting stuck in conversations about it? Tell them youâ€™re uncomfortable and gtfo. You matter. Your opinions matter. Your body, spirit, and mind matter. I love you. Be yourself. And if you disagree that people should be themselves, you can kiss my ass. See you all around
