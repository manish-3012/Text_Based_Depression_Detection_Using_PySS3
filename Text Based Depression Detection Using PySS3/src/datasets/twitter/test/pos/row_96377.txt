Posting something till I get a bird #8 Posting something every day till I get a bird

 Iâ€™ve seen a lot of people posting â€œposting something every day till I get a boyfriend/girlfriendâ€. Sounds fun. I have a girlfriend though. Sheâ€™s wonderful. I want a bird too. Birds are cool. So hereâ€™s day 1.

Day 1: I made sushi for lunch today but ended up eating at 4 because turns out it takes a while to make

Day 2: holy shit i got some awesome comments on #1 specifically u/bird_is_god thanks again. anyways today I ate some pizza and played lacrosse. still no bird yet.

Day 3: just found r/skamtebord. I have been audibly laughing for 15 minutes

Day 4: have any of you guys watched lost? The show about the plane crash. I just decided to rewatch it, itâ€™s a great show.

Day 5: gf just got back from a camping trip. Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing her again. Also I finally got around to killing the dungeon guardian in terraria.

Day 6: learned a new song in the piano today, a car a torch a death by twenty one pilots. Also, have you guys ever had a tomato basil mozzarella sandwich on a baguette with olive oil and aged balsamic vinegar with salt and pepper? Because thatâ€™s my favorite sandwich to make itâ€™s itâ€™s really fuckin good.

Day 7: stripping paint off cement was easier than I though it would be. Pretty cool. Also Iâ€™m posting this for a second time because Iâ€™m stupid and thought this was day 6 again

Day 8: I went on a bike ride with my girlfriend today. That was nice. Also, if any of you guys are good at math, math tutoring is easy money. You can charge $20/hour and a lot of parents will pay that if you help their kid with math.
