I'm in shock Someone I did consider a close friend just sent me a video of someone stomping on a chick. It was on snap and it was two things the first was just a picture of it the next was someone doing it I feel like I'm going to throw up I even responded aww to the first message. I've never removed someone as a friend so fast in my life I feel so disgusting. The worst bit is I'm pretty confident they made the video. Fuck that last frame of it I can't get it out of my head it's horrible.
