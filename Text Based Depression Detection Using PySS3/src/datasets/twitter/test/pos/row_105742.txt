Is it worth it to spend hours on a stop motion even though I want to use copyrighted material? So I want to make another Persona 5 LEGO stop motion. I want to pair up the animation with a Sony from the game. I would want to post it to YouTube but eventually it will probably be copyright claimed. I want to make the video, but is it even worth it?
