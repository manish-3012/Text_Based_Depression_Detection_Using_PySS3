I'm so happy I did the study guide/practice I finished my test 30 min early :). Also I know for sure I would've forgotten how to do the last question if I didn't do the study guide. And thank you u/Sax-n-violins190 for telling me to space out my work...yeah I took two pages for only a few questions but I caught a few stupid mistakes *before* turning in the test this time and I'm sure it prevented many other stupid mistakes.

Or maybe I'm speaking too early....I didn't even get my grade back yet..........
