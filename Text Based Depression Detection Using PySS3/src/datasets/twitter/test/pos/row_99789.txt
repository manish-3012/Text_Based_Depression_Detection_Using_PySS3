I have a friend who has a crush on me but wont make a move, what should I do. She started liking me around 2 yrs ago and she is still into me. There have been many opportunities where we were alone together and she didnâ€™t say anything. I think she is cute and nice but I donâ€™t know what to do. Should I make the first move?
