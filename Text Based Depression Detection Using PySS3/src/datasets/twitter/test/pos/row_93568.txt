Losing hope I know Iâ€™ve made these posts a lot, but this is my only form of active therapy at this point and it hurts to keep this in.

I just had a really beautiful and amazing day with my girlfriend, and I thought I was doing good and making her happy. I got on a call with her less than an hour ago, and she suddenly got really quiet and hurt sounding and said she had to go.. I donâ€™t remember doing or saying anything hurtful, and she wonâ€™t even tell me what it was that I did :( she just goes cold on me and then bottles it up, and I know sheâ€™s gonna explode eventually and itâ€™ll be unforgivable to her what I did.

Iâ€™ve gotten past my depression and personal emotional and mental struggles just to be me again, and sheâ€™s still not happy with me :( she gets so hurt and upset by me and I have no clue how to be better for her. Every time we get over one problem or I fix one thing about myself, thereâ€™s always another problem. She doesnâ€™t feel appreciated, respected or cared for by me and Iâ€™m doing so so much to make her feel appreciated, respected and cared for. It seems like Iâ€™m never enough, and just by existing, just by being me I hurt her somehow..

I donâ€™t even know how to talk to her about this anymore, it never goes anywhere productive. She thinks I lie when I act better and she never lets go of any mistakes Iâ€™ve made and already apologized for. I canâ€™t change the past and Iâ€™m constantly haunted by it. Iâ€™ve never cheated, intentionally hurt her or used her in any way. Iâ€™ve only done my best to show my love and care for her and to protect her. I canâ€™t ever be better because my best isnâ€™t enough.

Iâ€™m losing my sanity trying to figure it out. Iâ€™m not even demonizing her Iâ€™m just sad that nothing I do even matters at this point. It makes me feel useless and like a bad boyfriend. I canâ€™t comfort her or act right no matter what and Iâ€™m trying so hard :(
