15F Iâ€™ve been feeling pretty awful lately and Iâ€™ve been losing a lot of friends (toxic ones but still) and I just want people to talk to because it helps me cope through out my day But first be warned Iâ€™m super clingy and need a lot of attention and affection. And I also get paranoid that people donâ€™t love me a lot so I need a lot of reassurance that you care about me. 




Okay anyways. Hey, my names Katie. I should probably tell u stuff about me so yeah. I like writing, drawing, and music. Iâ€™m also a furry so I hope that doesnâ€™t bug you. Iâ€™m from the US and yeah. If youâ€™re willing to put up with me Iâ€™d really like some new friends.
