I shot my shot. And I failed. Howdy, everyone,

It's your basic depressed teen again, coming back to you live from mommy's basement.

Away from the jokes, as I title says, I shot my shot, and I failed. I was able to bring up the courage enough ( with help from my best friend) to ask a girl out. While she let me down softly, I still feel so sad. Every time I do something like this, it fails. And now she said "can we still be friends?" I still want to, but seeing her every day is like seeing my failure walk by every time. I'm worried I'm not going to find anyone for me, and die alone. Please send help.
