What is it about siblings that make them want everything you have? My sister (10) keeps climbing into my bed (and before any Alabama jokes start, I'm a straight girl. She's just doing it to annoy me.) She's claiming that my bed is more comfortable than hers, but that's bullshit. We have the exact same bed frames and the exact same mattresses.

As I'm typing this out, she's calling my stuffed animals rats and hitting them over and over again against the wall.
