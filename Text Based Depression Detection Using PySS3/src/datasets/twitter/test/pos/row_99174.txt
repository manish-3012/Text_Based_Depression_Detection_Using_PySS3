So we had to write a poem in english class using 5 random words that we got, and I'm kinda proud of mine  

Kidnappers

&amp;#x200B;

Our objective is to kidnap him,

It says right here his name is Tim. 

These descriptions are really vague, 

We also have to kidnap Craig.

Sneak up on them, begin the rotation

Weâ€™re the best kidnappers in the nation.
