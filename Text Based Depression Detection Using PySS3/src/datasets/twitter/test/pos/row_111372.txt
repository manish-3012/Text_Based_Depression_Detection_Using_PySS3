I have biggest formal exam in couple of months, what could be the best suggestion,tip or advice? Hello guys

Okay so i have an exam in couple of months, actually pretty far away from now, because it's in Summer and i have to prepare for it.

I want you guys to give me some advices about exams if you had it, of course.

P.s I'm talking school exams(in Maths, English and so on).
Btw its really important because in my country it really plays important role.
If i pass that thing, I will be able to study in University.
