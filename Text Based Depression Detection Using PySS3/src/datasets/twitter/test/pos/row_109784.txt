If 2020 was a person, I would chuck that fucker in a meat grinder and force his/her kids to eat it. As many of you know, Chadwick Boseman has died of cancer. I don't mean to offend other legends like Kobe, Juice Wrld, or Grant Imahara, but Boseman's death was the first celebrity death to actually make me feel really sad. Black Panther was one of my all-time favorite superheroes. Boseman left us too soon. Rest easy legend.
