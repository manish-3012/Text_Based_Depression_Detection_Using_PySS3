Anyone Down to Play Super Smash Bros. Melee? Been wanting to play with some peeps around my age, since most players are older and it's a little weird to play with them. Besides that, I'm down to play with anyone in any skill range (if you're brand new, I'm more than willing to teach a couple techs, although I don't know many lol). I'm on EC of the US, so Central to EC would be most preferable to play with.

Send me a fr on Discord at AdmUp#3137, and we'll talk about the Slippi details there.
