I like y cut g young supposedly African American male is playing a digital video game on a cellular deviceÂ old supposedly African American male walks up to him while recording on a cellular deviceÂ Supposedly older African American male : Oh, I see and understand that you (younger African American male), are partaking in the enjoyment of playing the digital video game made by mojang studios widely known as Minecraft. I particularly enjoy your new haircut, g. I will now proceed to slap you in the back of your cranium with the palm of my hand.Â older supposedly African American male proceeds with the action he said he would doÂ younger supposedly African American male proceeds to shriek at a very high pitch with his vocal cordsÂ the video recording then ends, with the younger supposedly African American male screeching


This is humorous due to the fact that the slap in the back of the cranium is very unexpected, and also the unorthodox conversation as â€œoh you playin Minecraftâ€, and, â€œI like ya cut gâ€. Overall, this is a 7/10 on the humorous scale.
