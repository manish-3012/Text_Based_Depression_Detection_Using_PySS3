It's my friking 16th birthday And my parents forgot to wish me , again, 3rd time in a row now, what a day to be alive

Even my friends, who are awake for 1 to 2 am didn't thought of putting an insta story or just dm me , 

Hardest birthday possible now , thank you if someone here even thinks to wish
