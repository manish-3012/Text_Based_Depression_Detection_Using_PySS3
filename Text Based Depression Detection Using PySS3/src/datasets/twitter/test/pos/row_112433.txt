Anyone remember watching mariomario8989/TheCuteMarioBros? Currently watching them at 1am, Hopefully someone on this sub has watched this channel before. I canâ€™t figure out if the later seasons are ironic. It seems like the first few years of the channel were just 2 kids making videos with mario &amp; Luigi plushies, but around the rock band with the producer and the 3rd movie it seems to become self-aware. If you havenâ€™t seen this channel out please do I want more opinions on how self-aware it is
