Why do people expect 18-25 year old to be â€œgrown adultsâ€ when we arenâ€™t. I mean yeah we are legally but technically youâ€™re an adult at 13-16. I literally have more in common with a 16 year old than a 26 year old. We literally have the same brain development. Oh and they treat like children at the same time. Sorry Mr Johnson you want my respect now you got to deserve it you immature middle age asshole.
