A thing I want to talk about So recently my news feed informed me of a thing happening  to MAPPA studios. For those who don't know, MAPPA studio is the studio responsible for the animated adaptation of Attack on Titan, the deal started in 2013(I feel like a fossil) and is set to air its final season this year. The animation will be the main thing that started this drama. Just a heads up, Animation isn't cheap and even if the animation of the 4th season isn't as detailed as the first three, it's  as good and dynamic as the older seasons. Now MAPPA posted a tweet on their twitter saying that the animation is like this due to problems ( I don't recall the specific problems now, but, if you do then write them in the comments). Now, as a mature fan what would you do: A) you understand that the studio has some problems and a reduced budget or B) Get unreasonably angry at the studio, ignoring the problems that they themselves told to have?

As you might've guessed many people took option B. I will be serious and say, don't be angry at a studio for dumb reasons like the animation being slightly worse than the last season, they're on a limited budget and are trying to deliver the thing you like. And if you're one of those people who chose  option B then... stop it, get some help
