I got a faulty gift card I've been wanting to get a visa gift card for a few days so I can continue watching a show so I went down to my local gas station, speedway and got one. I head back after grabbing some food also and get some food. I get home and came in my room and sat. I tried putting it into my Xbox and it didn't work, of course I was confused on why it didn't so I changed the address and stuff and that didn't work. Then I tried on my phone and it didn't work so I go back to speedway and I forget the receipt and go back. then I go back and they say that the last numbers aren't the same. I then see they aren't which is weird because that was the receipt. They say they cant do anything then they tell me to call customer service so I do I called them they said they'd make a case and they put me on hold. then I tried putting it on speaker and I hang up on accident. then I call back and she says that sell make a case and that's where I am now.

I know this is very petty but I wasted 30 dollars that's a lot for me because I haven't gotten a job yet.

TL:DR I lost 30 dollars from a screwup
