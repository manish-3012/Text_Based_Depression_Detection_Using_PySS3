Does anyone have any ways I could make my speech better? Once A Lion, Always A Lion.
Keeping School Pride Alive.





Walking through the hallways of our great school, I hear people say how they would love to leave Chandler and go to a bigger school with more people. I donâ€™t know how anyone could possibly want to leave our school, we have made so many great memories together through the years, it doesnâ€™t make sense to me that anyone would give that up to go to a fancy school in a big city. Most of our parents and even grandparents went to school in Chandler. Itâ€™s more than a school, itâ€™s a community, and family too. We need to remember where we come from and we should be proud of it. That is all I have to say, so remember, we are all parts of different cliques, but we are all the same in one way, we are all Chandler Lions.
