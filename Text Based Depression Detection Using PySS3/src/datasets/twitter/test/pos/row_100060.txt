You realize it when you stop 11 days ago I was in the lowest place of my life, I had a porn addiction without realizing it.
I hadn't felt anything towards anybody in my life and I couldnt gave a shit to anyone, that day I also decided to stop watching porn.
11 days have passed and I just realized how addicted I was, I have never felt this depressed in my whole life.
I know im probably overreacting but I couldnt keep it in my head so I had to at least write it somewhere...
