Having a roommate you get along with is so much fun Like my roommate and I will just sometimes announce things to each other like â€œIâ€™m gonna make leaf juiceâ€ anytime one of us is gonna make tea. And sometimes weâ€™ll both just lie on the floor after school and collectively die internally.

Also we both like the Aircon cold, thatâ€™s very important.
