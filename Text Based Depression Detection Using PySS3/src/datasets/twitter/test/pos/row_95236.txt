Writing a thoughtful text about life :) Make your bright smile. Iâ€™m just your average guy livin a basic life. I wanted to write this for my B day!

Donâ€™t stress to much about homework, and also to those who are reading this without doing homework, please do ur homework :it helps a lot using death note on homework: :) I want u to be proud of what you have become in quarantine since the beginning of your improvement!

Those who are struggling stay strong Kay! Wish you love â¤ï¸.

This song made my lonely moments turn into dust a bit. Sorry for rambling but... I remember when I was in elementary school, I felt lonely without any friends. I felt like I had no one. There was this person who said â€œWanna go play a game?â€ I replied â€œnoâ€ . I wish I could have said yes to this day ðŸ˜­. One time I was catching crickets in the grass and my teacher was like â€œstop catching cricketsâ€ I was like -In my mind- â€œbish I wanna catch crickets not hang out with people.â€ Iâ€™m an introvert btw.

Many years later in middle school... Wow I realized Iâ€™m super lonely ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­. My awkwardness with talking was like giving a speech at a ELA speech kinda.

High school Now - I still felt lonely in the beginning of my first year in freshman. I eventually found great friends in choir who made me feel loved! I love them too! I didnâ€™t hang out with them outside of school which kinda made me feel lonely.

Second Year - I found more more friends who I related to :) There was this guy who was wholesome, he spread joy when no one else did in some ways. He was and is relatable.

I met a cute guy who became my friend. We related so much! It was like we were best friends for a decade â˜ºï¸. Iâ€™m so glad to be friends with him.

Quarantine - I feel a bit lonely, but what keeps all of us strong is by staying happy. We will get through it. I know we can! 

Try and talk to make a club for online school. It is possible for that to happen. Find friends who u think are cool and say â€œhey! Female/dude/Non-binary/etc Wanna make a friendship? I feel lonely ... etc.

This beautiful music peace perfectly captured the feeling of being lonely and how tough it can be. The pain of loneliness is like drinking soda/eating cake/ while eating pizza. Thatâ€™s kinda how bad I felt in school. Itâ€™s hard trying to talk to people in lunch because of how hard is it to find someone who cares about the persons feelings and emotions.

I hated being alone in the bus for years. Thankfully I sat with a friend who is cool in high school.

If my school asked to talk about emotions with paragraphs I would write this.

And in conclusion I hope yâ€™all find amazing friend who want to care for your emotional well being, understanding in conversations.
