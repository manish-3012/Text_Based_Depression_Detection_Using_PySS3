My high school single handed my shut down all of my school systems servers for a week.      So this started one night, a week ago. The Yearbook team sent out their 5 surveys for this years yearbook, but made a fatal flaw. The email was sent to everyone, but with replies left on. Being typical high schoolers, they all saw this as the perfect chance to spam the whole school. I remember getting over 500 emails in the first 30 minutes alone. Within maybe 2 hours, the server admin finally tried to fix it,  but the damage was already done. 
     By the time they got to it over 50,000 emails were already sent, and every time the servers came back up thousands more came through. It was complete and udder madness for a week where we literally got nothing done because we couldnâ€™t communicate. They finally just fixed it literally 5 minutes ago, after nearly 200,000 emails were sent. 

I hope the darn yearbook club learned their lesson.....


TLDR: 2 students in yearboook club sent out a survey while allowing replies. The school systems servers crashed for over a week whilst nearly 200,000 emails were sent.
