Yâ€™all should play Fallout New Vegas Itâ€™s such a cool game once you understand what youâ€™re doing and that only takes a bit and if you still canâ€™t figure it out then you can always go on YouTube and find out. You get to side with three factions with different ways of siding. For instance I sided with the legion but still helped Mr. House when it benefits me. You can go in guns blazing or just play it like a some spy. Itâ€™s pretty fun and all of you guys should play it.
