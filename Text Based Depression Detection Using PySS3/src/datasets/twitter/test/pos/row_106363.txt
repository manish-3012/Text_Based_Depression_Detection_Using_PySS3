Parents still wonâ€™t take this virus seriously. All my family except for me are high risk and my brother is showing more symptoms of this virus but they wonâ€™t get him tested. Now, I always wondered what being an orphan or an only child would be like, but, ideally not at the same time.

Theyâ€™re passing off this symptom because he has it every few months .. like.. he was coughing now a few days later heâ€™s showing this? I donâ€™t buy that itâ€™s just a coincidence.

I share a room with him and now Iâ€™m showing uncommon symptoms but I also have a cough... This would be the second time Iâ€™ve shown COVID symptoms. Last time in April my breathing lead to my eventual collapsing on the floor which they too passed off and told me to stay off the computer.. yeah they blamed video games for me collapsing on the floor struggling to breathe and doing extremely bad damage to my back.

What in the hell do I do now ?
