I have found my goal in life I am a 15 year old male high school student, I suffer from diagnosed ADHD (please donâ€™t comment if you know nothing about adhd) This past year Iâ€™ve been through a lot of physical, mental,  and maturing growth. For about a month now Iâ€™ve been in a state of thumb twiddling, as in I didnâ€™t know what to do next.
Being in the military has always been a desire of mien and as of tonight it has become a purposed GOAL! 
I am going to meet all the requirements to serve in the US military, and I will serve my country. And if not, Iâ€™ll become a Chaplin or something
