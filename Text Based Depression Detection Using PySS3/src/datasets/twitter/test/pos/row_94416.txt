You ever had to take a shower with hand soap? {Storytime} So me and some of my fam went to a lake with some cabins on it to stay there a few days. I decided I was going to take a shower one day and me being an idiot, I didn't bring any soap or shampoo with me for the trip. When I got in the shower, I had then realized I had no shampoo. So here I am getting out of the shower with the water still running to go to the sink to get the bar of hand soap they had for us when we got there. I ended bathing with that and went smelling like hand soap for the rest of the day. Over all, it was a fun trip. I ended up going fishing that day so that was fun.
