Clinical Opportunities/Shadowing  Hi, I am looking for Clinical Opportunities/Shadowing so I can demonstrate that I know what it like to be a medical profession for my bs/md application. I don't have any networks I can utilize. I am working on volunteering at the hospital in the spring but any other suggestions?
