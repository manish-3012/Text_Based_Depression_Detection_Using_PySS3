Itâ€™s too late I had a sudden fascination for gymnastics around 12 years old. I didnâ€™t want to do crazy gymnastics, just some basic stuff. 

I did front and back flips on my friends trampoline, but it was never enough for what I wanted.

Now Iâ€™m too old to start. I could try but it would be way hard.
