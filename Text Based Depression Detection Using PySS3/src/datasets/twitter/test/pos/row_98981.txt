I am visiting my father after 13 years Tomorrow I am going to see my father after...well you read the title, right? 
My father passed away when I was 2 years old, and my family sort of kept me away from the fact that I even had a father and now I feel so strangely transcendental.
I wouldn't even know a single thing about my father's family if it was not for my mom, who decided to tell me everything after 13 years. 
Anyway, tomorrow morning I'm going to visit his grave and I just don't know what to say, because I have absolutely no memories of him. I heard he was a good father who was proud of his children, but who am I to say anything  if I don't even remember anything about him?
well, I guess I'm just gonna say what's in my heart tomorrow

wish me luck

( sorry for bad english )
