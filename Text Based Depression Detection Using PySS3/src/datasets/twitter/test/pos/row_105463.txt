I am very excited, and you might not care, but I just wanted to share this with you My first language is not English and finally, after 7 years of learning the language, I am going to take an advanced (C1) English proficiency exam the day after tomorrow and I am so excited and nervous that I can't sleep.   
^(Can you guys please calm me down?)

^(Thank you. \^\^)
