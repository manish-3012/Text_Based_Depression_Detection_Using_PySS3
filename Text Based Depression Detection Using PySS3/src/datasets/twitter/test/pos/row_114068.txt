I love going for walks and eating food outside. But it makes me so uncomfortable when people are looking at me. I'm very insecure about how I look. Like completely because I'm fat and look like a guy, when I want to be a girl. It takes a lot for me to go out, go to the store, cross the street etc. Wearing masks has helped me a bit but not completely.

When I'm walking on this path people will legit just be standing there like idiots and looking at me. Or if I'm sitting down and eating there's sometimes people who just show up on their bikes and just chill right behind me like wtf.
