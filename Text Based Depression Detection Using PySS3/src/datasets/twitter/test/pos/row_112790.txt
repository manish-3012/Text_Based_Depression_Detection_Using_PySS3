Anyone has had this problem throughout their lives going to school? Now I know that everyone here is young, I am too :) However this is 1 problem I seem to have coming back. Especially during the months when you need to prance around with a jacket or any clothing that protects you from the cold weather. 

Itâ€™s where in the morning itâ€™s cold out so you take yo jacket with you, but coming back itâ€™s warm as fuck and you feel uncomfortable wearing your jacket back, and you often donâ€™t wanna have one hand occupied or your bag disturbing others as its length increases BECAUSE you threw your jacket inside. That sucks. I have had that coming back multiple times, probably over 50. 

But I guess this is because thereâ€™s a lot of more sunlight from what I recall reading something either hours between 10am-to 3pm or from 10 to  12 to 2. But Idk. Let me know what you think.
