Let me explain my orientations Hello i am a 16m and i started being atracted to both genders and i was told into my rEliGiOs family that i need to find a female to be with her but from what i experienced so far i feel like guys are more good than females but my whole thing with girls is like no girls like me cause i am fat cause my genes from my family look like a fat boy and girls are making fun but the guys understand that yes its a gene problem and had some help from a few to explain to me that the weight is not the problem and i need to find someone that accepts me for who i am but that is in my mostly guy friends but i get shamed by a girl that i like before and some more girls and started feeling like shit but and i still try to find that girl but i dont know what to do and my best friend we werw into a gray area both cause we were acting kinda gay with eachother (cause i have a big butt and some small tits) and i started falling for him and a girl started apreciating me as a friend and idk with witch one to ask first tho
