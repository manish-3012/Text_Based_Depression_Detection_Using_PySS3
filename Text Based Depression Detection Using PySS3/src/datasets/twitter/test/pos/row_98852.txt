Idk what to put so uh filler I'm so fucking mad at my introverted self bc I had a chance to date someone when they snapchated me that they like me. But my introverted ass just sat there brain dead at the thought and just left her on read. Overall what I'm trying to say is if a girl likes you try to hook up with her instead of being lonely ur whole life.
