Unpopular opinion on mainstream feminist and other equality advocating pages/organisations Many many mainstream feminist and other popular pages who advocate equality very often say "if you bring up men's issues saying men also suffer from this, only when some incident has unfortunately happened to a female, then you don't really care about men's issues". While some people actually don't care about men's issues and say such stuff just for the heck of it, there's also many people who do care about their issues and sufferings.
 
These mainstream pages say all this often, but they themselves don't do anything for men's issues at all, they don't talk about men's struggles as much as they talk about female issues. Suicides, paternity problems, war deaths, false rape accusations etc are problems that men face, most people can't name even one. While females all around the world do have a lot of problems, and we must make sure they're solved asap, if you say you're for equality but never talk about men's issues, trans issues etc then you surely aren't for equality. People gotta understand and work towards equality!

Thanks for listening, good day! :))
