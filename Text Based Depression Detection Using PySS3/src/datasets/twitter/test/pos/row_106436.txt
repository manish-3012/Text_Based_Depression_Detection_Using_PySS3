What's one of the best dreams you've had? I had this one a week ago, I was living in a cabin with most of my online friends (Haven't met them yet)

It was snowing, so we mostly stayed inside. Having some really delicious soup, and laughing at some comedy show that I don't exactly remember (Might've been friends, ironically)

I miss that dream.
