You ever just remember that you used to be bubbly and friendly when you were younger? Then high school (middle school for u Americans) happened and HOO BOY did it ruin like 80% of kids. Super hard stuff that is useless in the long run, stupidly high expectations from teachers and parents, that one kid or group that never shuts up during any lesson. WHY must this world SUCK for us?!
