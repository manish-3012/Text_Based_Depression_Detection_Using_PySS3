There are a lot of posts about thinking someone deserve to die is bad so here is my opinion It's not about Trump. It's about all the bad people in general

So some people really deserve to die and there's nothing wrong about thinking it. Like if a president ruins a lot of lives by on purpose because all he/she thinks is money then I guess there is nothing wrong with wishing him/her to die. 

Just think in this way a rapists goes and rape a woman and then another finally cops will catch him, ok they catched him he is in prison know there are 2 senarios he would take the younger people in prison or he would get out of prison by help of his relatives and continue to rape. Why don't just kill this person he ruined so many lives.


And let's talk about "if you kill a murderer you're not better than him". Bullshit, there is a difference between innocent lives and a murderer's life. Like that murderer killed a little girl, middle aged man, one women but he raped her then killed her. And there is you, you killed a man who killed innocent people. I don't see anything wrong with it it seems you just prevent more deaths.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk
