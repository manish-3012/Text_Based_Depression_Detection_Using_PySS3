This is me. Accept it. Or go away! Right. I am 13, bi-romantic, (I like all genders),  and non-binary/transman. I use they/them, sometimes he/they. 

I like MyChem, PierceTheVeil, FallOutBoy, Nirvana, GreenDay, NIN, SmashingPumkins, Panic!ATD, TwentyOnePilots, Blink-182, BMTH, AliceInChains, AllTimeLow, Paramore, FooFighters, IronMaiden, and so forth. (I have a playlist, just search GERARDWAY on Spotify, and I have a very long playlist of ALL my bands... 300 hours long... ahem.)

I  ageregress. (only when I'm really stressed, sad, or if I'm comfy around people at school. I never regress at home/around family, only at school.)

I self-harm. 4 days clean! :)

I love dogs! I have a Chihauha called LittleMan, I used to have a doggo called Ebby, (Ebineeza, how I called her), but we had to get rid of her, she litterally went to a friends farm, I'm not even joking. We knew the guy who took her. 

I am autistic, and I have ADHD. I am 'less' autistic than the kids at my school, and I'm -hopefully - going to get into a mainstream school, soon! 

I'm quiet, and only speak to people I want to. But- I am good at socialising. 

I play guitar, too! If you touch my guitar, I will.. I'll... umm.. I'll do- something... I'll whack you over the head with a frying pan. NO ONE touches the guitar, apart from my girlfriend.

This is me. And, to be honest, I don't care who accepts me anymore. I'm never changing. I don't need to. 

Who are you?
