I could easily cancel contact with anyone I know without being sad, worried or angry. Still, I feel like an asshole when thinking about that. I have some friends I've known since Kindergarten and I have so much memories with them, but still it wouldn't make a difference for me if I wouldn't have contact to them. Why is it like that?
