My boyfriend broke up with me yesterday We'd been dating for 3 weeks, and he was my first kiss. I hate him and I love them and I miss them and I'm so fucking sad and angry but at the same time I'm okay. I'm angry because he didn't talk to me about how he was feeling, I'm sad because I miss them, and now he's taking a break from talking to me and I'm so fucking upset
