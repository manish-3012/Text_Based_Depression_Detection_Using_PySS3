Developing a new break up strategy what do you think ? Recently I feel like me and my crush are sorta not ever gonna happen..even tho she keeps teasing me and ahi and I haven't told her to stop. 

But I still feel pain in my heart from her, and it's the type your able to think about and smile while feeling like crying. 

Everyone handles breakups in 1 of 3 wayss.  #1. You deal with it like a petty b$%@ 

You take it like a real man/woman/grown person and treat them with respect, dignity and understanding.  


Or 3.. you just feel like breaking down and not functioning for a few months, thus handling it pitifully.


If someone is about to break up with you and you know it try asking them to say they hate you. I've noticed dealing with feelings of hatred, is easier more tolerable then feelings of sadness and heartbrokenness. Dont say you hate them, ask them to say they hate you. I think it would hurt less afterwards 

Anyways that's just me thx  for coming to my Ted talk
