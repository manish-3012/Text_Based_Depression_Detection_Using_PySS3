The legendary bottle So every single time I bring my water bottle to class after class every one asks where I got it from and ask me if I would sell one to them and every time I tell them that it's from Ireland (I used to live there but I'm not from there) and then they make some sad face like it's my fault I have a bottle. Wow this went on for more than I thought sorry for waisting ur time just wanted to get this off my back.
