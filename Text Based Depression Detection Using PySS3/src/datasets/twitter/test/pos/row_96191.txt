I need help. I need to talk and I have nobody to talk to. (I think I might need a psychologist, I have some weird thoughts lastly) I REALLY need people to talk to.

.

I donâ€™t want to talk to strangers.

My friends are all studying and doing high school/colleague things.

My family is basically transphobic in every meaning (and this is important for what I need to talk)

So yikes. Big big yikes. Guess Iâ€™ll just play Minecraft.
