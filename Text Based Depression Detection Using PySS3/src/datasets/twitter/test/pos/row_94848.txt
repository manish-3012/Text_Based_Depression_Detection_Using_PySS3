We should have a system that automatically indexes users Reddit already does this but imagine going a step further say you have a bot. The bot checks the users score from Reddit. If the score in a certain category is above a certain level letâ€™s say controversy because thatâ€™s controversial a moderator will review that account and decide weather or not that account should be allowed into the subreddit. You could take it a step further by using special word list that would identify someone as someone you wouldnâ€™t in your subreddit. The bot would review the user with these list instead of the moderators making the process much simpler and The more the bot does it the more fine tuned it becomes and the more difficult it would be to gain entry into a particular subreddit.


A more simple way of doing it could be:

Pull all comments and posts from a user that doesnâ€™t meet a certain criteria and automatically sort it on to two spreadsheets . Because nothing you delete on Reddit is actually deleted all this information will be available one way or another we will just have to access it. We could then use a similar process to the word list as described before but make it kinda like a filter to try to filter out the content and divide it into the two spreadsheets as accurately as possible then the spreadsheets could be archived with the userâ€™s username and reviewed by a bot who reads the value of each spreadsheet and decide weather or not that actual user should be allowed to use whatever you where indexing them for.
