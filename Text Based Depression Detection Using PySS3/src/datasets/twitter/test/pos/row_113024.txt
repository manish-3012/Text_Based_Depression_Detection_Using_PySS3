My problem with generalising (making title longer ) For some reason it really pisses me off but sometimes itâ€™s necessary. Like my teacher told the class some time in November that all the boys were beaten in some kinda progress test which pissed me off because moments before she said I had the highest score. Most of the boys were beaten by the girls but I wasnâ€™t so itâ€™s simple to avoid just put some/most/minority/majority and other words meaning amounts in front of a group itâ€™s that simple.
