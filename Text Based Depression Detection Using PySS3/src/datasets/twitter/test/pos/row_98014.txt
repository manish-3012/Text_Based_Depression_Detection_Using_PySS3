lol what have i done???? so i was bored and within a few hours i kind created a concept for an entire cartoon???? basically it stars one of my characters and its sorta his fight back and forth with the concept of the fact that hes literally gonna die before he turns 30 (i would put the entire lore behind that but it will take me forever to type and i dont feel like it, in short he will die when people need him the most), so so the show is him taking in wisdom from all of his family friends who have been through hell and back, actually bothering to make some friends, sorta discovering his own identity, LITERALLY GETS ARRESTED but he gets out dont worry, all while keeping an audio journal on his phone so he can listen to it before he dies, as well as its there for his friends and dad to listen to after hes gone. on the last episode he realizes that he will always be needed, and becomes very weak until he finally comes to terms with the fact that death can't be feared, so he decides to do the last few things he thinks he needs to do before he gets home, where he tells his dad, "im tired, im gonna go take a nap." hugs him, and then walks into his room, lies down, and turns on the first recording of the audio journal, and the credits start.

what have i done??????? help lol please
