Do you guys think it's bad or weird to get a blowjob from another dude just for the fuck of it? Like why not? Long story short I'm a straight dude who's not having too much luck with the ladies right now.

I have a good friend tho, he's gay and has kinda had a open crush on me since I've known him

He uh...

Offered to give me a BJ as a joke but I think he was hinting that he was actually pretty serious about it.

And like... I'm kind of thinking to myself.... why not?

I mean. A blowjob is a blowjob.

I can just say no homo and be done with it right?

Right...?
