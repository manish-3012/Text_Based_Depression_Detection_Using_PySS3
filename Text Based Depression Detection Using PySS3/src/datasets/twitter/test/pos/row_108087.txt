I know this doesn't sound like much but it means alot to me Today while skated I talked to a girl I've never met I'm usually a social person only around people I know.  So me being able to go talk to a girl meant alot for me. I was gonna ask if she wanted to be friends but I lost her. But hey I tried :/
