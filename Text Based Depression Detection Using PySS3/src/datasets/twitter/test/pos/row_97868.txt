What do guys really like? Can y'all keep a secret? Don't tell my bf ;)

I (18F) wanna do something for my boyfriend (17M) as a surprise, I love seeing him happy and excited.

So I'll come here and ask teenage guys (and girls can contribute too) what do teen guys like?

For example, an experience, a cherished moment that will become a lovely memory. Or an item/object that will be cherished as a physical memory/symbol of love. 

Surprise picnic dates? Movie night? Favourite lunch/dinner?

He likes music, instruments, video/computer games, Pokemon/Magic cards, crystals, exploring, and heaps more. 

I love him so much, he's so cute and an amazing conversationalist, clever, wonderful and so precious &lt;3

Thank you for reading, and in advance for your answer/s xx
