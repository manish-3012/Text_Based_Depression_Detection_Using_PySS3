So Iâ€™ve been on reddit a year now So this has been kinda a weird year I guess. I mean... it was normal until earlier this year. And Iâ€™m really glad I found this site. Since the beginning of quarantine Iâ€™ve been logging on constantly, just going on different subs and enjoying watching people be happy. I came on to this sub not too long ago but itâ€™s one of the most wholesome places Iâ€™ve been in a while. I told some of my teachers that I go on reddit and some go on tangents about how bad it is but honestly... subs like this make me feel all warm and nice inside. I hope everyone reading this stays happy and healthy during this weird time. And Iâ€™m looking forward to more years on this amazing platform. 

Tl:dr; Weird year, weird teachers, wholesome sub Reddit
