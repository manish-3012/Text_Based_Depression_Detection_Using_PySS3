Subreddit for Online School Some friends and I made this sub, r/OnlineSchoolLife, for people who are taking school online due to the pandemic. If you have any memes or stories that relate to this topic, stop on by! The sub is lacking memes lately, but as we gain a bigger following Iâ€™m hoping weâ€™ll have more good content.
