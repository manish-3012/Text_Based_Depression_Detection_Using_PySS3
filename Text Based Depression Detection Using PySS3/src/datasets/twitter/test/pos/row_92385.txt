Margaret and her self-destructive behaviour Aight so let's say my name is Margaret and I'm responsible for having self destructive behaviours and it's getting to me because I'm in a important phase of my high school an beacause having desi parents  is an added... uh..thing.

I want to stop ruining my own life and I'm trying my best. I just hate the fact that I use sleep as my escape factor, let it be stress, work or anxiety. I literally slept thu my english orals and I hate the fact that not only did I make my mom pissed, I fuckin dissapointed my teacher too + probably lost my grade.

Our school has a counselor, but I don't think that's a good idea since she might gossip with other teachers. I dunno what to do, I'm tired and want to kill off that part of myself that is fricked up.
