Scared and lonely Hey, I'm an 18 year high school junior, and I was falsely told by a staff at my school that I was dropped, turns out this wasn't me and they got the wrong person (idk how tf that happened) so after 2 fucking weeks now they tell me that it was a mistake, so now I'm trying to make up 2 weeks of work for 8 classes and I'm panicking classes, and I'm scared that I might get dropped, I'm anxious af and really don't know what to do
