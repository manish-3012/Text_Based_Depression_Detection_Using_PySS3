I just found out the girl I am super attracted to and practically in love with has a boyfriend I have severe anger issues from ptsd and I donâ€™t even have the energy to be mad or punch something. All I can do is just sit in my bed and listen to AJR (my favorite band). All of the daydreaming I did about holding her hand while walking and her resting her head on my chest while watching Netflix are crushed. 

I found out the majority of my friends knew and didnâ€™t tell me and I have practically no one to talk to. I just needed to vent.

Sorry for wasting your time.
