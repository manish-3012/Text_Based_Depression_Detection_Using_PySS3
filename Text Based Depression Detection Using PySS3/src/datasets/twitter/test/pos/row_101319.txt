Iâ€™m kinda sad now Do you ever go to do a group project with your best friend and their other friends and realize.. you are the side friend , you are the friend they talk to when the others arenâ€™t able , you are the friend they donâ€™t add to the group chat , you are the charity act friend , that they only hang out with you because they felt pity , that they donâ€™t miss you when you donâ€™t go to class that you are the â€œ other â€œ friend
