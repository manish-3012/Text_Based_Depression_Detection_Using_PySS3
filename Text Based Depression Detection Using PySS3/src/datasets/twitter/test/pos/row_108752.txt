Asked my crush out thanks to the help of redditors and she said yes this is an update to this post right [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/infw6e/theres_a_hottie_a_grade_above_me_who_likes_me_and/) go read that so that there isnt any confusion

anyways I followed some of ur guys' advice and started the conversation with a hey and she said heyy and I said wyd and it continued from there. turns out we actually share a lot of the same interests as me, including our terrible sense of humor. I asked her if she was free tomorrow but she had to go to a relatives, so instead my friends girlfriend who I talked about in the previous post is throwing a party so we r gonna go to that. 

honestly tho personally I am really proud of myself. I used to be a huge weeb and kinda annoying, but more importantly incredibly socially anxious and introverted. Like very very socially anxious. However, one time at a summer camp I had a friend who wanted to get this girls number so I thought it would have been funny if I got it before her, and then I got carried away and got like 11 girls numbers and now I am a lot less socially anxious, which Im really happy about, and this experience was another huge step forward. also I wanna thank you guys from the past post who helped me, because if it werent for you guys I wouldnt have found a really nice girl who I love talking too and is flaming hot to boot.
