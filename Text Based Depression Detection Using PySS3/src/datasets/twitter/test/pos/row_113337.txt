Today I start taking care of myself more I know I probably should but I havenâ€™t had much care for my personal hygiene. I sit in a bedroom that smells like cat pee for 9 hours every day and then donâ€™t shower for 2~3 days. Sometimes I donâ€™t brush my teeth, this all sounds bad but today it changes. Iâ€™m getting the realization that I want someone in life and I want someone to have my life with. It all starts somewhere and this is me saying I am going to start being cleaner.
