Hey PSA right here right now Just as something because unfortunately over the past couple of days there has been an increasing amount of suicide posts. I just want you all to know that are thinking of taking your own like to remember, life will get better. You have your loved ones to turn to, your friends. They care about you. You just need to power through this and remember that people care about you and life is worth living. I hope that this can get out to you guys.
