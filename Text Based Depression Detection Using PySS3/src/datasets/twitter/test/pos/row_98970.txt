A follow up from my recent post that blew up my inbox 1. We're e dating
2. Our relationship stemmed from a really good friendship that started from August 2020. We've kept each other up on our hardest and worst days, and we're still doing it to this day. 
3. Our relationship is hardly sexual for now. Idk, whenever we're horny we uh, as cringey as it sounds, sexually roleplay as our characters.
4. I'll admit it, it sounds weird to have a 2 year age gap, but as long as it doesn't step out of the 3 year bound, I'm fine with it.
