If only there was an anti social flair Iâ€™m doing a group project in school right now and Iâ€™m and online student and my partner isnâ€™t, so weâ€™re on a zoom meeting. That wouldnâ€™t be an issue except for the fact Iâ€™ve never met this person before. Also this person is a girl. So far I have said one sentence to her and I donâ€™t know what her voice sounds like and weâ€™ve both sat in a zoom meeting muted with our cameras off and we finished the project without almost ever talking to each other. I feel really awkward because I want to talk to her since the sil now is really awkward but I donâ€™t know what to talk about...
 
School ends in 3 minutes, I think Iâ€™m just going to endure the awkward
