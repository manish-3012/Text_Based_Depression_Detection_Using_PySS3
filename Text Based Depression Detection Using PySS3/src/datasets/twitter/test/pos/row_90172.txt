Y'all ever get sad after you've had a great day? I get this quite a lot. Where I'll have a great day, truly splendid. I woke up in a good mood, laughed with my friends at school, enjoyed the work we did. But then came home, still in a great mood but suddenly getting struck by The Big Sad. It always happens right after I've had a great day and Idk why.
