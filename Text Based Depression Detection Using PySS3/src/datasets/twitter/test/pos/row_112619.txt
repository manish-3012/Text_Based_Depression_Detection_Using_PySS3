Okay, Okay I may be in a harem anime, but I HATE IT I got to school, a girl complimented my clothes, nice! So I walk into band class (1st period) I get greeted by this girl SINGING A GOD DAMN SONG ABOUT ME  (It was a nice song), My... errr, um girl, I kinda like, was on vacation tho, and I mentioned, in spanish class, why she wasn't there (she was on vacation) and she told me, last Thursday, she was goin on vacation, cause she felt like telling me! WHY ME, I'm 5'7 and a fat ass, I don't look above average, I look kinda decent, but there are guys in the school who look better than me, so this is pobaly why, I am the main character of a harem anime
