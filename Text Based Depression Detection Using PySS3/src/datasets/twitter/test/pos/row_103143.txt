The future is bleak af Climate change being fucking unstoppable, pandemic level viruses and such becoming more prevalent, a bunch of alt-right and anti-intellectualism really doesnâ€™t make me look forward to the future. It really feels like gen x is going to end up living in a quiet dystopia. 

You can order artificial â€˜cleanâ€™ meat, but you have to specify and the meat industry is still prevalent. You havenâ€™t been directly affected but the issue of immigration and alt-right thought is being pushed because of the hundreds of refugees fleeing foreign countries and drowned cities from your own country. I just feel like things will never be the same and that this time right now will be the greatest luxury humanity will have for the rest of my lifetime.
