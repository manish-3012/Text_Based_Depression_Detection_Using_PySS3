How do I make an outfit or find my style? My parents have always provided me with clothes but they have a pretty bad fashion sense and whenever I go out I look pretty stupid. The problem is, I really don't know what I should buy and wear for myself cus I'm kinda stupid. So how should I go about choosing a style and constructing outfits?
