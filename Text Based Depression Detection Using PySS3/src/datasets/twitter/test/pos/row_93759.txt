shit i accidentally flirted with someone and i think she likes me now i keep accidentally flirting with people that im not actually interested in and itâ€™s kinda fucked me over a few times

real quick for context this girl that i accidentally keep flirting with prints out selfies that she has with her friends and pins them to her wall, her whole walls full of them. anyways she just sent me a snap of a bunch of printed out photos of me and her and captioned the snap â€œi guess i have a thing for gingersâ€

im ginger
