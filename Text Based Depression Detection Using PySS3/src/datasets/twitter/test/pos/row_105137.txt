I tested negative for covid and i am unbelievably happy. I know it's not a big deal, and all my friends keep telling me, "did you expect to test positive?" Well, I actually did. My parents have been going to a lot of places lately even though i advised not to. I was occasionally feeling slightly sick and I went to some places where people on the sidewalk werent wearing masks. about a week ago, my school said 10% of students were gonna get tested, and i was picked. My family didn't want me to get tested but I really wanted to. I got tested on wednesday and the results came yesterday that it was negative and now I'm so happy! 

If you're about to get tested, the throat test is way better. You're gonna gag for a second but it's really short. my friend got tested a while ago and he said the nose test is horrible since it makes you want to cry. If you have a choice between the two, choose the throat. if you can get tested, please take the chance.
