School makes me feel worthless and stupid I hate school with a burning passion, it makes me feel like a loser, makes me feel dumb and it makes me cry. I stress out over school so much, every year, even before high school, I would stress over school, I would fail so many classes, I would just barley pass them, and when I would check on my grades in classes, I would see how low they where and I was hit with low self esteem, I would tell myself that Iâ€™m a loser and a huge failure. But, My school offers mentors, to help students with Academical problems, and we hired a mentor just Recently. We thought she would help, What the mentor does is help me with Organizational problems, and help me not stress out and forget to do school work. I thought it was helping me, me and her created a calendar and put all of my work that I have to do on the calendar, So I can check and I have everything in one place. Me and my parents where really Confident that it would work. Until just today where I checked my online grade book, and saw very shitty grades. At this point Iâ€™m starting to think its just me being really stupid. I feel like I have zero knowledge in any subject because of school. Nothing in school makes me happy. School makes me sad, feel dum, and feel like a loser.
