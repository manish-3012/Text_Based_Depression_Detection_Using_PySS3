Groupthink w/ a British Provocateur (Books to Video) Provocateur Douglas Murray takes big swings in his brand new international bestseller, The Madness of Crowds. The Overton window is shrinking as our allowed topics of discussion are increasingly chose from top down pushing more people towards the socially engineered fringes. Race baiting has gotten so obvious that for the first time in 70 years a record number of minority votes went to a conservative candidate. The progressive agenda is skipping over inherent human rights violations like sovereign drug consumption and instead is campaigning for reparation checks and to disallow airline travel. A traditional liberal Brit, Douglas, admits logical consistency and ethical constitution arenâ€™t part of the social justice warrior lexicon. 

From a gay author, this dense read tackles homophobia, transphobia and racism: the latest accusations of a nonbeliever in the public square which are neither provable nor disprovable. Murray shows it isn't a good versus evil battle but a software versus hardware misunderstanding of what it means to truly be in a minority. Douglas has no reservations bringing up post operation suicide rates and â€œpsychosexualâ€ witch doctors as the new conversion camps convincing young men to lop off their cocks. While this book hits every inflammatory topic imaginable its imperative to remember what John Stuart Mill famously said, â€œFree speech is necessary for a free societyâ€. Today we hear the ideas of a homosexual man writing openly about the tendencies and hijacking of his own community. Weâ€™ve entered a postmodern age of cultural marxism where he who feels most oppressed has more value than he who works hardest.
