it is time to start NoBlanket hear me out

so i really really fucking hate cold showers that i have been doing recently

before it was one of the small parts of the day where i could truly just relax and enjoy myself

now it's just suffering and i want to get out as soon as possible
there was a study saying lonely people shower longer because it is a comforting feeling similar to a hug that they are missing out on

so i think coldshower is good because it forces me to get that comfort from somewhere else (ideally drives me to self improve and get in relationship, similar to nofap)

however i found that i am finding entirely too much comfort in my bed. sleep is important, but i need to make it less comfortable for myself

so i think i will start sleeping without a blanket. i would sleep on the floor to introduce more discomfort but my parents come into 
my room before i wake up a good amount of the time

so noblanket starts today basically, and i continue nofap and coldshower

eventually i will be so horny and comfort-deprived i will have no choice but to improve my looks and start approaching

life is suffering

you have to live it
