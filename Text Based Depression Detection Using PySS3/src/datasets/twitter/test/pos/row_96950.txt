Gym bros who've had corona hit their gains hard, come sulk with me. Deadlifts were previously my strongest lift by far. I seem to just have really strong quads and glutes that allow most bars come flying off the ground. I was ecstatic when I hit 500ibs - deadlifts became my pride and joy, similar to how a mensa kid will go from normal to insufferable once he finds out he's 1/100. 

I went to the gym today and hit a fucking 315 2x5 and FAILED on my THIRD FUCKING SET. My glutes are no longer existent. They're flat. They're deflated. My ass is the equivalent to the 16-year-old skinny goth girl who cuts herself to feel something. 

I struggle with getting the right amount of calories that my body needs too, which made me lose 20 pounds over the corona season. I'm literally a fucking stick now. Sitting here at 5'10 152ibs feels fucking rough. 

The only thing that didn't take too bad of a hit was my bench. Managed a 225 single RPE 9-ish despite that day only having 6 hours of sleep and eating nothing but a bowl of oatmeal.

Lowkey hurts. I get I'll get it back soon because of muscle memory or whatever, but still. I feel like a child.
