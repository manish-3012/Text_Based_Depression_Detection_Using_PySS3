I like this girl but I blew my chances with her help?! So thereâ€™s this girl in my school that I have liked for at least a year now, Iâ€™ve tried to get over her but I canâ€™t. At the time I was hanging out with some other people and her and her friends pretty much everyday would come, be it to watch us play basketball or just talk. I started liking her probably a couple weeks after this all began. Thing is now that I looked back at it my gut tells me she was into me too, she would sometimes separate me from the group (with a friend sometimes) and just talk to me, always ask who I liked, whenever she was talking to her friends I would always catch her looking at me. Iâ€™m not saying she was, itâ€™s just thatâ€™s what my gut tells me. Well I was basically too stupid to acknowledge any of these things and never asked her, and I remember once when she was talking to me with one of her friends, I got so embarrassed and quite frankly shy, I ran off to carry on playing basketball with my friends at the time. Well about halfway through October I had a fallout with these people (I  started talking to them again after a couple months) and basically didnâ€™t really talk to her or her friends anymore after that. Itâ€™s been ages and weâ€™ve still talked in school but barely and Iâ€™m just trying to get over her now since Iâ€™ve pretty much blown any chance of ever getting with her. I could start messaging her but I feel like it would be a bit weird or creepy to just message her out of nowhere. Can anyone help, itâ€™s really sad thinking about what couldâ€™ve been and how much of an idiot I acted with herâ€¦
