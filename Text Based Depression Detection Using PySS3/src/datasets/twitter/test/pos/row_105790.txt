I am walking my mom down the aisle My mom is getting remarried! And my grandpa cannot make it because he broke 5 bones in his neck, and cannot fly up to where I live (I live in the Midwest he lives way down south). 

My mom was dating him for over a year, then he proposed to her after a bike ride.

I am so excited! Though we have had our ups and downs, I still love her. My brother is going to walk her down with me. And to the people who cannot make it (my grandpa and a few others) they are going to be there on a zoom call. 

I am so excited!
