So have you ever wondered why twitch.tv is the only major website with a .tv domain name? Like seriously why not use, say, [twitch.com](https://twitch.com)? Well, for science, I decided to visit [twitch.com](https://twitch.com) just to see what's on there, and I have made a GROUDBREAKING discovery. Ladies and gentlemen, [twitch.com](https://twitch.com) REDIRECTS to [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv). WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. Ok so think about this for a second. The people who own the incredibly famous streaming website [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) also own the domain name [twitch.com](https://twitch.com) SO WHY THE FUCK DON'T THEY JUST HAVE [TWITCH.TV](https://TWITCH.TV) REDIRECT TO [TWITCH.COM](https://TWITCH.COM) INSTEAD???? JESUS FUCK I FEEL LIKE I'M LOSING MY GODDAM MIND
