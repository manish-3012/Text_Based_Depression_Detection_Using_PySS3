i am sorry Hi..... I just need to get this stuff of out my system.....originally was going to post on throwaway but i dont have karma on that one to be able to post.....and this is giving me severe panic/anxiety so im posting on main. If you know me irl please don't talk to me about this.  
 Well before the story begins, you must know something about me.

I am an introvert.....at least that's what everyone has called me. It's not like i don't talk to people at all, i do talk to people....It's always beneficial to have connections in your class right? But in real life i have only 2 people who have been my friends for years (one for 7 yrs, the other for 11-12 yrs) but even to them i can't open up completely....infact i had never opened up to anyone till mid 2020....

I have various problems, like depression, very low self worth, social anxiety, big insecurities about stuff like my voice etc etc.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well in comes 2020 lol, i thought 11th grade would be splendid because now we are going to study stuff i want to study (no more social science ;D) but corona came and all my dreams went away. i'll be honest, i spent the first 5 months of 2020 doing nothing.....just goofing around (me stupid)BUT around August i met a person on a discord server. I'll call them **H**

Well me and H became very good friends...we used to talk 4-5 hrs lol...every day (yea we cut it down to 1-2 hrs later on tho lol).....and i found out i could really open up to H...finally i found a friend i can open up too :D YAY!!!

And then you wouldn't believe it, i met another person on discord....lets call them **S....**Me and S also became very good friends!!! S lived in the same city where i was born and which i used to visit every year....i talked to S everyday for 2-3 hrs....*.(i got the time because i slept really late because of a reason i wont go in here)* I couldn't believe that these wonderful people came into my life :D

I slowly started to tell them about my irl problems too *(not always of course...sometimes)*.....I didn't want to trouble them or burden them with my problems tho you see...i was scared of losing them. In my country, we have these very hard entrance examinations for college and people start studying for them superrr hard from 11th and here i was....already wasted 6-7 months lol and i was depressed....everyone was zooming ahead of me but i hadn't even started lol.....*(actually H was preparing for one of these examinations too)*. **S** was five months younger than me so S was in 10th grade instead of 11th, thus they weren't preparing for college entrance but for their 10th grade final examinations (think of something like the British GCSE)

Well these people supported me during my depression periods a lot. They motivated me whenever i was down. These 2 people became my precious friends...i was still scared that I was imposing on them by telling them my troubles....but they said it was okay...

As time went on, we started focusing on studies....S said that they are not gonna be able to talk at night much because of studies but i could talk during noon...they told me that i shouldn't think that they are trying to cut me off and of course i understood, people have their own life...so yes i said sure i understand...and i started talking less to them.H also increased their studies....and my conversations with them reduced too daily good night messages lol. I also took a break from discord for sometime....

I also met another person **B** *(met on discord, but talked with on telegram)*  who i can say that is one of the kindest person i have known *(not because they did something for me, but because how they behaved with others)* Well B was interesting to talk too...but B disappeared one day. Their last message to me was something like "see you later" so obviously i was concerned about them...like what happened to them.. They didnt reply to me for days ..... so i went back to discord and i saw there they were...talking with people on a mutual server that we share.

Of course, my self worth plummeted lol....I kept thinking about what had i done to make B ignore me ;-;......I became depressed again. I lost interest in studies and everything really.... I thought that everyone i care about abandoned me *(&lt;-- my biggest fear tbh)*

BUT things changed.. :D.. H came back :D and we started talking again... it was wonderful to talk with them :) . I had also shot off a message *(after 19 days of no talk)* to S to ask them how they were faring *(hadnt received a reply)* and now S replied too :D yay!! and we started talking again

Everything was getting better :)......and then guess what????

Since B and I were in the same server, I had blocked B on discord because i couldn't bear to look at their messages for some reason...thankfully i decided to open the blocked messages and saw that B was calling out to me, so we talked in DMs about this stuff and i found out it was just a misunderstanding lol. B had deleted Telegram because of a fight they had with someone on there and had forgotten to inform me :/ lol *(B also gave proof that they hadn't talk to anyone with 13 days on tele, tho it wasnt necessary)*

I WAS SO HAPPPYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY :D

for exactly one day.

You see on 11th Feb, i got a message from S. They said something like this:

"i am getting very busy so i am going to talk to only a few people now. i am giving my account to someone else. I am removing the friends,  ig it was nice meeting you goodbye sorry"

This was 4 days ago. It destroyed me, and i cried a lot. Infact i still cry when i think about this.

But I was very concerned about S....since this was so sudden..... i had their spotify and songs are a pretty good indication of a person's state of mind, so i went to see what kind of songs they were listening to after they sent that and the songs were sad (one even made me cry) but then i am no psychologist right? so idrk for sure...

I have no way to contact S now, i mean i can contact on instagram but i wont because they dont want me to...... I will never get answers you see......Why did this happen? Is **S** okay or is there something wrong?I dont know what i did to make S not like me this much....was it because i imposed on S? Burdened them with my problems? ......If you were really busy S, why could you not tell me this? i wouldn't have talked to you till your exams or till whenever you wished...What was the need for you to say good bye forever?

Well S is gone now and we will probably never meet again,

I am scared....my mental condition is trash now...i can't do anything..i might fail my class 11 finals or at least get trash marks...i literally can't do anything.... I am afraid.....will my other friends leave me too?

It just hurts a lot....S, i don't know what i did but I am sorry...i genuinely am....Thank you for all that time you stayed with me....i wish you had given me time to say this before removing me forever :(  


Also all my other friends, If I have ever done something to burden you, offend you, hinder you then please accept my sincere apologies.

i bet you people who bothered to read through this must be thinking...who is this weird dude crying over internet strangers and writing about his life on an internet forum where no one is going to read it anyways? hmmm

i suppose i am the idiot in the end huh? :)

Good bye!
