Hereâ€™s how my dad giga-brained his way into naming both his sons hunter My dad: Can I name our son (me) Hunter?

My mom: Sure

(4 years later) 

My dad: Can I name our second son Hunter?

My mom: No pick something different

My dad: How about chase? 

My mom: Thatâ€™s a good name, sure

My dad, knowing that Chase means Hunter in old English: You fell for it fool &gt;!Thunder cross split attack&lt;! !
