Quick vent. If you guys don't want to listen about other people's problems,please skip this post.

So I feel horrible,I'm constantly stressed and tired and I can't keep going with school.

I feel constantly irritated and my mental state is getting worse in matter of hours.

I become so sensitive and fragile that even smallest things make me incredibly angry and sad.

To the point where a small error or failure makes my day bad.

I can't handle all this stress,tirednes,angrines and sadnes.

I just feel horrible.

I'm starting to miss how good and calm my life was 2 years ago when I was a happy and social person.

Boi,it's bad
