The time I scared my class, nurse, and the ER because I was a dumbass So this story takes place in an old house my mom used to live in with her five children, which we called, "The Blue House.". My younger brother(3-4 year old) and I(a 7-8 year old) wanted to prank my older brother because children are little gremlins. 

Our plan was simple: Sneak in while he was at school, cut open his pillow, put shaving cream in it, and skedaddle. But when we opened the pillow, the shaving cream had Aloe Vera in it, which I'm highly allergic to. I try to back out, but my little bro convinced me to do it. 

The plan went well, until that night when my and my bros had to be painted, and we had to crash in my older brother's room. He reported later on that he felt his pillows be a bit squishy, but was only weirded out.

The day after, I go to school, my little brother and I not have telling anyone about the shaving cream prank. Now, being allergic to a medical herb, you train yourself to determine what's a bug bite, and what's not. And when I saw hives, I immediately went to the nurse, asking to see my Mom. The nurse just handwaved it, saying it was a bug bite, and sent me back

Big mistake

As the quarter hour passes, my body starts swelling everywhere, hives growing and clustering, then lapping over each other. The teacher sends me back to the nurse looking like something from Silent Hill(fitting, because of the game's themes), and calling my Mom to come pick me up, saying, "You're child looks like a monster"

My mom and I get to the ER, and the receptionist takes one look at me, and gets me to get an EpiPen. For those without allergies, you lucky ducks, they're essentially a thing you take when you have a severe allergic reaction, and Benadryl can't stop it. And even though I have a high tolerance for pain, that thing hurt like hell.

TL;DR: Children are stupid. Keep you things out of reach, or else Silent Hill will happen
