How to meet new people during the pandemic? Sup folks. I'm having a bit of an issue. I really want to me some new people, but miss rona is making that a bit difficult (citation needed). I've tried meeting folks online through various subreddits and other means, but I really want to like go out and talk to people and meet some folks irl (socially distanced + masks obv). Of course, being 17, and being in the middle of a pandemic, I can't just go to a bar or club, and people on the streets/in public anywhere don't generally like being talked to by strangers out of nowhere, especially for extended periods of time, and *especially* in America (where I live). I was wondering if any of y'all had any suggestions for me? I feel a bit weird posting this because it's a bit of a strange question methinks (or maybe I'm just self-conscious weeee) but ye I'd appreciate any advice from my fellow extroverts out there who actually know how to extrovert (or introverts!! All are welcome :D). Thanks y'all :).
