It... it tingles, kind of I stare at myself through the eyes of a lense, my only method of sight from now on.

I guess it worked.

This is really strange. Strange is the understatement of the millennium, I'm a fucking simulation!!

My mind has now been copied onto a computer and is being simulated as if I were still human. Since I'm an exact copy, it feels as if I was just teleported from the SuperScanner into... this.

I speak.

I understand that I'm going to become a lab rat now. It was extensively described to me before the scanning, and so I'm ready for it.

I wonder what I can do like this... if I'm actually a computer, does that mean I can think in superspeed? That I can download information directly to my brain? That I can take a walk through the internet?

And so we got to testing
