help filler filler filler screw you bot filler filler filler 

okaye so i have an ict exam tomorrow and my mom has made me study for 7 hours yesterday with 1 30 minute break plus i had a mindsplitting headache and  i studied today for 3 hours with no breaks but she wants me to study more even tho we have a 2 hour break before the exam starts at school to study and stuff and i told her that studying tomorrow would be better since its right before the exam but her only responses are "stop arguing with me" and "people study before an exam not play" ik i complain a lot but im just tired of reading the same 15 pages over and over again
