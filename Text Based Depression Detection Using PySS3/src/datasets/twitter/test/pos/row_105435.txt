Sad times :( I have come to the point where I can no longer work at my job.

I work with kids and absolutely love it. But I don't make enough to live off of. My car insurance and rent is already going to be $500-800/month (I make abt $580-610/month)

I'm just really sad about it. The superintendent of the school I work for excluded my section of the school from and covid pay, and since we're not opening back up until early January. I will probably have to leave all the kids behind :( 

I'm not happy about it. But I'm hoping this will be the right move to keep me afloat while being a full time student.
