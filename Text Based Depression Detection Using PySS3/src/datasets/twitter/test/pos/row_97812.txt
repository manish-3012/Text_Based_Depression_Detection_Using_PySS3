I have never actually met an annoying vegan 
I know a lot vegans/vegetarians. Theyâ€™re all pretty cool people and donâ€™t care when people eat meat or dairy. Have never really met a *triggered* feminist either, and I know a lot of those too. The stereotype can be funny, but I think acting as though theyâ€™re common things is a bit unrealistic
