2 years of being a virgin There ya have it, I own two blue pieces of cheese, they're so moldy, my father came in and beat me with a belt. Anyway, I am here to tell you to love yourself, you are most likely a pretty radical dude. If you feel depressed, remember: there's like, 80 more years of your lifespan, average, and a lot of things can happen in one month, let alone a year. You genuinely matter, and you've genuinely made an impact on so many people, before you make any rash decisions, please visit a therapist or talk to someone on the phone, you'll get through this. 

If you're struggling with sexual orientation / what you identify as, there's plenty of communities to thrive in, the first step towards happiness is acceptance (if you have discord, Teamagers is a hella good server, even if you're cis and straight). If your friends won't accept you, they're not your friends and they're missing out. If your family won't accept you, if they're smart, they'll come around, if they're that ignorant that they won't, family isnt bound by blood, so it's up to you what you want to do and what will make you happier.    

If you don't enjoy school, find a hobby, or a (when Covid dies down) afterschool activity, or join a club. Finding things you love and others who also love them is an amazing feeling and will make your days faster and more fun.      

If you're struggling to find a relationship, you're &lt; 20! Dont rush things cuz your friend got a wholesome relationship or a beneficial one, and I can tell ya, a beneficial relationship isnt as good as it might sound, especially if you never even kissed someone.  It'll be better if you wait until you find a better community if you're in a crappy one.   

If you wanna build a gaming pc, AMD is cheaper and better than intel, at least for budget pcs.  

If you wanna get into guitar, Fender makes squeir (butchered it) guitars for cheap prices, and if you change the pickups on their strats, they'll sound pretty close to an American strat, also, a $200 guitar sounds better on a $500 amp, and a $1,500 guitar wont sound as good as that $200 one if you're playing it on a $100 amp, that's for electric, I've got no clue when it comes to acoustic or bass. There's also A Modern Theory of Guitat vol 1-3 for like, $20 and it's so good for teaching yourself guitar. After all that, it's only a matter of finding inspiration and practicing every day.  

Alrighty, what else can I spit out of my mouth before the mods ban me for being a boomer? 

Uhhhhh

Ranking system for men, coming from a bi boy. 

&gt; Hot &lt; Playboy &lt; Handsome &lt; Cute &lt; Twink &lt; Femboy &lt; Catboy &lt; Witches, anything after cute will attract the wrong crowd most of the time tho if you're straight.

Also, pedos, yes you you fucking curly haired boomer. Liking minors is hella sus, basically everyone here hates you, thinks you should burn, yadda yadda yadda. Anyway, go seek some psychological help, they wont arrest you, and you're seeking help to be a better person. Once you're a better person, you dont have to resort to children to get off, you could have an actual wholesome relationship you dreamt of when you were young and couldnt be drafted into war.
