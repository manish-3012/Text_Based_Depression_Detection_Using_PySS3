Writing something positive about my day, day #290 So basically Iâ€™m going to this boarding school but I havenâ€™t been able to go physically because itâ€™s in another country and couldnâ€™t travel because of covid (the school is open though). Today I dun sky landed in the country the school is and went through immigration and got test and all that. Iâ€™m being quarantined on my own for two weeks (my parents couldnâ€™t come with) and itâ€™s a pretty nice hotel so I think Iâ€™m gonna be fine
