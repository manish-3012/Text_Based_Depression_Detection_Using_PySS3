Do you guys ever feel like you just lose either way? Like am i gonna live with the loss just to save other it and just die in side or do i let someone else take the loss for me but i still take the guilt of not taking it.


Its really like im fucked either way unless i just pretend like nothings happening but sooner or later its all gonna come back to me just to tell its my fault
