I regret it So I finally moved from my couch to eat breakfast and decided to eat cereal because I was to lazy make anything else. So I was about to eat when I thought to get a cookie and dip it in the milk which was a bad idea. When eating the cookie my cereal got soggy and started to taste bad. I then realized that the milk was expired which could lead also have made cereal taste bad with the cookie. I am now sad and probably triggered multiple people in the process. 


TL;DR Ate cereal and dipped cookie in cereal which made it taste bad and milk was expired. Also triggered people and I became sad.
