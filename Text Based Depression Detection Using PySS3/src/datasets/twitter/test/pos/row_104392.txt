So I was scrolling threw my reddit home page when I see something saying to Google the 50 most popular women and look at number seven (it was Justin Bieber). I smirked at it and even in the face of all these previously stated observations I thought to my self, "I should tell my dad about this it would be fun". But then he goes on a tangent how there are only two genders and whatever. But I'm sitting there next to my 8 year old brother.
