What's up danger? Yo guys. I just wanted to say to those of you who visit this sub asking for advice from people, don't blindly follow wtv someone tells you. It's alright to take people's opinions but don't base your actions just on these advices. Think, and act accordingly. Speaking from experience, there's no way people can know the exact 100% backstory and you don't even know if they're actually concerned about you. So yeah, consider everyone's opinion but act only after thinking it through. Don't be impulsive. 

Thanks for joining my ted talk.
