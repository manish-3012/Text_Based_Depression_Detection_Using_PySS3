Not to get political or anything... No, thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s the post. Iâ€™m sick and tired of literally everything being about politics. Iâ€™m at the point now where I donâ€™t care who you vote for or what your stance is, I just simply donâ€™t care. The closest to a political conversation I want to get is AMD vs Intel / Nvidia or the prequel era aka the best era in Star Wars cannon.
