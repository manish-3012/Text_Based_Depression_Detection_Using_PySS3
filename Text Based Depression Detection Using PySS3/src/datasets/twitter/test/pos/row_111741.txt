vent update?? idk so they did show up to the birthday call but I couldn't get a word in. I can't blame them for being excited but they all talked over me. I hope I don't sound entitled but none of them even mentioned a happy birthday except for one. kinda depressing but I'm angsty and my mood swings are going brrrrr
