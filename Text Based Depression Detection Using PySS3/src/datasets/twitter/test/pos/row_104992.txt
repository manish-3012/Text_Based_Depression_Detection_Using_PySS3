I'm a genius       I'm about to ask my crush in the most big brain way.


      First I'm gonna tell her that I'm gonna need advice on how to ask someone out.
      Then I'm gonna play along with her advice and stuff and actually use her advice to ask her out the way she says it.
       Profit (hopefully, most likely not, no one likes me)
