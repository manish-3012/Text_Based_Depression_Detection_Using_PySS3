WHAT THE FUCK In my school you have to bring in a chromebook and have them "configure" it so you can use it in class. This basically means setting up the app bans, blocked sites, etc.

So I got a new chromebook for school so I brought it into school to get it configured, and they told me that they would have to "deprovision" my old chromebook to configure my new one. I told them to go ahead because I couldn't exactly refuse and I didn't know what "deprovisioning" is anyway.

 So they configured my new chromebook and I went home and opened my old chromebook and BOOM. White screen. It asked me to "set up my account" and had me log in. Basically they factory reset my old chromebook. Without my consent. Keep in mind this isn't even a school chromebook this is a chromebook bought with our own money. 

Fearing the worst I went to my files and yep, they were all gone. ALL OF THEM. ALL MY FUCKING FILES. I HAD REALLY SENTIMENTAL AND IMPORTANT VIDEOS ON THERE. I HAD CHILDHOOD VIDEOS AND VIDEOS OF FAMILY VACATIONS AND STUFF ON THERE. ON MY PERSONAL ACCOUNT. MY FUCKING SCHOOL WENT INTO MY PERSONAL ACCOUNT AND DELETED MY FILES WITHOUT MY CONSENT. THERE WASN'T EVEN A WARNING, "DEPROVISIONING" MY ASS! YOU RESET MY DAMN DEVICE AND NOW MY FILES ARE GONE. I CAN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
