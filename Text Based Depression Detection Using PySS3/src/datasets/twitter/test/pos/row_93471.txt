is this coping method healty? I haven't been having the best couple of months recently, and I cant get shit out of my head. I've literally been talking to so many random people on snapchat it's insane. ik nobody cares abt this but my snapchat views went from 50 to 200 in a single week. I've developed friendships with some of these people.
