Well my school fucked up for the first time. Mobile, blah de da de da. My school just changed schedules. We went from 4 hours *max* online (plus about an hour with homework) to OVER 7 FUCKING HOURS ONLINE, PLUS HOMEWORK.
I don't even know why they decided to do this. Not only that, but if you take a zero period like I do, the start times of the week range from 7:30 AM on 0 Period days (0 is only on Monday/Wednesday/Friday) to 9 AM. (Tuesday/Thursday) 
I just can't see the logic in this, aside from maybe wanting to fill in the normal school day. But that doesn't fucking work! Spending a full day online is gonna fucking kill me when I can barely tolerate 4 hours. (I know that's kind of a low tolerance considering I'm a teenager in this day and age, but that's the way things are for me.)
