Probably not the best place to get advice But I'm not sure who to ask at this point. If anyone knows a good subreddit for this, then please tell me.

I've recently found out that I have a craving to block out old bad memories... which I think would be great, if it didn't also make me forget everything else. For the past 2 years, I've had no memory of some issues that had happened in 2016, despite then being really traumatic for me... The only reason I know about it now is because my mom brought it up. I'm honestly wondering if there's something else I'm repressing.

But anyhoo, my question, if anyone can answer it: how do you stop running from bad memories? How do you recover them, if it's even possible?
