Donâ€™t you hate it when you talk to someone and then a few days later they donâ€™t want to talk to you. I was talking to some guy like 2 weeks ago and we were having some good conversations but then for at least a week I donâ€™t hear from him other than him sending streaks.

Then today I thought â€˜oh I havenâ€™t spoken to him for a while might as well speak to himâ€™ so I sent him â€˜hiâ€™ and he replied and Iâ€™m trying to start up a conversation with him but he just left me on opened. Like bruh I wanna talk to you
