I feel like my family canâ€™t let me just feel sad. Even though I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety about 2 years ago now I donâ€™t think my family understands what it means. Im always feeling down and over all just sad. There is little bit of exitmwnt or happiness I feel but they never last. And because of this I always kind ajust look sad. Most people I know just accept it and undertstand but not my family. I think my family just assumes that something is bothering me but I canâ€™t just say â€œI donâ€™t know. I just feel kinda down right nowâ€ because then they would say, â€œWell you should just be happier because if your sad all the time nobody will talk to you and youâ€™ll never get a girlfriendâ€. I hate this because it makes me fee like I canâ€™t just be sad. I always need to be faking a smile and acting exited at things like family dinners because it embarrasses my parents if our family sees me sad anytime we get together and itâ€™s just so damn annoying. I get that they want me to look presentable to others but if they are my family they shouldnâ€™t care they should just be fine with me being sad a lot of the time.
