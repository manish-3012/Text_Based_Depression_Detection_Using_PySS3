Can you give me reasons to live? I'm standing at the edge of a bridge, under me, there's a river and I doubt someone will find me if I jump there and drown. 

I don't wanna jump, but I see no other option, so please, if you could just give me a hug or something, say a wholesome story or anything really helps. 

Or if there's better sub, lemme know, I don't wanna bother you anymore
