I tried breaking a world record I tried breaking a world record of fastest typing all alphabets a-z with space (3.37 seconds)  but I was able to do so in 6.31 seconds. I am still trying to break the world record but till then can someone break my personal high record of 6.31 seconds?

Will upload an screenshot as proof that I did so in 6.31s tomorrow as today is sunday at my place and we can't post photos in this community in weekend.
