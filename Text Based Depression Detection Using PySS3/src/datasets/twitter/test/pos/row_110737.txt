Story time This is how I got into a fight on the capital steps in Washington DC. 
So we where on a school trip to dc and me and this kid we where friends but he did this thing where you would run up and ram into the side of someone, so we did this on the capital steps, and this one kid did it so hard that I went flying down, but I was fine with that, but
This other kid did it and idk why but I completely overreacted and went all of started fighting this kid everyone was laughing except for the teachers and faculty. And we where getting along we where fine we where paired in the same room and the teachers separated us like bruh we were getting along and they just ruined everything. My parents noticed something was of and I didnâ€™t tell them they only found out after my school called my dad. Lmao funniest day.  My parents got me a therapist, didnâ€™t talk much cause I didnâ€™t think much of the fight it was just a plain over reaction, this was back in February 2020.
