How to convince my mom to let me play M-rated games even when I turn 17? In a few months, I will be 17, so I asked my mom if I could get Ghost of Tsushima since I will be old enough to play it according to the rating. She said as long as sheâ€™s
approves of the game itâ€™s fine, so I made a whole presentation about the mature content in the game so that she feels more comfortable letting me play it. Ghost of Tsushima isnâ€™t as intense as The Last of Us games or GTA games so I wasnâ€™t worried about being upfront with her about whatâ€™s in the game. But still, after I finished my â€˜presentationâ€™ she is still very reluctant. I donâ€™t want to go around my parents backs or anything, just get them to understand that yes, these games are rated M, but yes, I am mature enough to play them. Any tips?
