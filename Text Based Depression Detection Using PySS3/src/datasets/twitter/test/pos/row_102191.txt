I think people should stop being upset at their crushes when they reject them I see a lot of kids on this subreddit complaining about their crush for rejecting them, as if its a crime or some insult towards them. People have different tastes in different kinds of people. Maybe she/he just didnâ€™t think you would be right together, and you need to respect that. 


Because really, getting mad at your crush for just not wanting to date you is kind of a dickhead move. Just donâ€™t be a douchebag and respect when people donâ€™t wanna fuck you.
