I have a crush on my classmate I have got a huge crush on this super pretty girl in my class. I am in the final year of school which will be ending soon (I got around a week) and I may never see her again if I missed this opportunity. I don't wanna regret later, so I am asking here for some advice. 

How do I even talk to her in the first place? I haven't talked to her even once in the past except things like "Can you pick up my pencil for me?" I have a benefit that most of the guys in my class are my friends so I should have no trouble seating myself in her proximity.

I have also got her number but I am hesitating from texting her out of the blue. Although I am pretty sure she is aware of my existence. 

So, please give me some advice on how do I proceed further? 

Thanks for reading my post
