So I just had to write about 300 words worth of filler... So finals are this week and for science we had to write about an issue we were investigating and how it addresses human impact (for example, how does polluted school water deal with human impact etc. etc.). Easy for me, but it had to be at least 350-500 words...

I couldâ€™ve written that out in 4 sentences. Dear God the amount of filler I put in that â€œessayâ€ would make Kylie Jennerâ€™s lips quiver. Why the hell is this allowed? Wouldnâ€™t it only encourage kids to bullshit through half of the assignment and be a pain to read? Itâ€™s a fucking assault on my eyes.

I donâ€™t understand schools...
