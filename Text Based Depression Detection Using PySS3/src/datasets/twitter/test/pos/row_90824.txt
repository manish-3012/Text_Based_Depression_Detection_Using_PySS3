I hate myself so much (TW) I hate everything about me. I hate the way I look. I hate the way I speak. I hate the way I act. I just hate me. I just want to die. I want this to end. Noone loves me. Noone cares about me. Noone gives a f*** if I'm alive or not. Every time I look in the mirror I can't help but cry. I have tried to end it multiple times but I chicken out every single time. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't live like this anymore.
