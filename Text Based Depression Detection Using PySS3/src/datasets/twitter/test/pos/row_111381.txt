I really screwed myself over by chosing calculus So, basically as the title says. Last year i decided to choose calculus instead of normal math, because i expected myself to know it. But lo and behold the grade for my first test comes.... 1.8 (18% i believe).

I literally lost any motivation to continue because i studied hard for this test, and believed i knew everything. Then here it comes and screws me over.

Like for real i had a hard dedication to go to school every morning, study good, but now i just don't see the point of it anymore. I study and try to get good grades because i have to, not because i want to.

Don't get me wrong, i know that school is extremely important for the future n shit, but at this point -1 month into the new school year- i'm already lost all motivation to do it.
