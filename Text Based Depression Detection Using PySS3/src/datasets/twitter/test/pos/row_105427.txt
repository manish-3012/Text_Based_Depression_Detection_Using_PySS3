No one in my family really cares, so Iâ€™ll celebrate here! I got a 4.0 GPA! Worked all semester! I had a semester long HTML project and I slammed that till I got a 98 overall. Got praised for my work looking amazing and my ability to present! I got offered a chance to tutor kids taking first level accounting, because I nailed that class too!! The classes I thought I would struggle in are actually where I flourished most, which is surprising to say the least.

I could almost cry looking at that 4.0! Itâ€™s like seeing the sun! Iâ€™m still walking on air! All the hard work amounted to something!
