My friend came back to life and now I fancy her????? No, I'm not high. I kinda wish I was though, seeing as how crazy this story is.

So, youse all mind my post a few weeks or so back, when I talked about my internet bff committing suicide? Well, boy have I got news for you.

So, she's not dead. She posted on her community tab that she wasn't dead, and that she was in hospital. I was so relieved, and all my suicidal thoughts packed their bags and flew out the bloody window.

And now, for the even more confusing part.

For context, I'm really clingy. I latch onto people I have an emotional bond with, and I depend my life on them. It's a really bad trait that I've got, but I really can't help it. A lot of the people I was attached to left me, and now I've become more clingy than ever. I get very stressed if they don't respond for a day or so, seeing as I can't see them irl. I need to time my messages so that she'll reply to them, usually when she's online or just commented on something.

Now, back to the story!

We talked a lot more, and I began to feel a lot of feelings that I didn't really like much. After lots of soppy romantic films, I finally came to the conclusion that I fancied them.

Okay, time for the difficult part.

She recently went through a breakup, with her internet bf breaking up with her via his mother. Not the classiest way to pop your clogs, in my opinion. Now, she's still recovering, and I don't think that me bursting into her dms yelling
"Hey mate, I'm kinda in love with you. Wanna go out?"
is a good way for her to get over him.

So....is my love doomed, or is it dead? (Yes I just used a Gnomeo and Juliet quote, shut up)

Please bloody help me. I highly doubt Macca's will let me hide in their deep fat fryer.
