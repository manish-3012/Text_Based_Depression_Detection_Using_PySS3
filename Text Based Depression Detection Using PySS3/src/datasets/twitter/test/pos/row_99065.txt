Help! I formatted an external sd card as internal and it still says storage space running out and won't let me install apps or transfer apps to the sd card Yeah I spent 28 dollars on the sd card and it won't let me do anything to it. I formatted as internal, in my files all it says that I have 120 gb of free space on my internal storage, and I genuinely don't know what to do. It's a Moto g7 power. Help please
