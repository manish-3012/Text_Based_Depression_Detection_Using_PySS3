here's a brief poem i made in four and a half minutes i look into your eyes and i find a kaleidoscope of watered-down hurt

i look into your eyes and i see my reflection off the faux tears once again

i look into your eyes and i discover one last lie you haven't told me yet

i look into your eyes and i notice a bit of green in your special shade of hazel
