Story time again! So when i was about 5 years old in reception my class had this point system where weâ€™d put marbles in a jar. The bigger marbles were worth 5 points and the smaller ones worth only 1. 

One day when our class was watching a song video on youtube the teacher thought we were being particularly good so she gave me one of the large marbles and asked me to put it in the jar.

Now i wasnâ€™t very bright as a child and so the first thing that went through my head was â€˜Can i for this in my mouth?â€™ and so dumb 5 year old me shoved the marble in my mouth. Bear in mind this is one of the slightly larger ones, maybe about the size of a 2p or just smaller. 

So the teacher obviously freaked out and started shouting at me to spit it out. I was only a kid so obviously i got scared and, well, i swallowed it. I remember the pain of almost choking on it but i did manage to actually swallow it so i guess thatâ€™s an achievement. 

I did also manage to pass it out when i went to the bathroom so we didnâ€™t need to go to A&amp;E or anything. 

TL;DR- Dumb kid me swallowed a big marble.
