Cant Think Straight I currently live with a roommate who is a cool guy. Hes helped me out a lot and can hold a conversation but something about him that ruins all of that is the way he eats. Ive never fucking vented on a reddit before but I cant think straight with this guy having any meals in the same room as me. He chews with his mouth open, slurps, chomps, breathes through his mouth, grunts and rather than biting things like cereal, soup, or noodles he inhales it. I hear him breathing in as hard as he can. Ive never seen someone inhale frosted flakes and then, out of shortness of breath, breathe as it they just ran a marathon. He rarely puts forkfulls of food into his mouth and rather sticks his tounge out to get the food into his mouth quicker. Its disgusting hearing his eat any meal. Ive heard him moan and snort while eating his dinner and gulp down partially chewed food while shoveling in more and more into his mouth. Ive stopped eating as much because now eating disgusts me. I cant think or focus when he eats. I feel nausous and indigestion kicks in when I hear him from pure stress. Its revolting. 

If you're reading this please be self aware of how you eat. Chew with your mouth closed. Keep your damn tounge in your mouth. Dont chomp your teeth down. Dont chew like a fucking cow.
