I listened to like 8 minutes combined of The Caretaker dementia album and i already feel thrown off. I didn't believe this album actually required the right state of mind, so i started listening to the album, jumping forward in time and seeing how worse and worse it got... Like I know I'm gonna dream something REALLY OFF tonight. Anyone wanna pm me? I hardly have any friends and explicitly need contact with other people. Have a nice one
