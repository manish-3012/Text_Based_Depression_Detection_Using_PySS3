I had the best night of my life Call me a karma farmer but I donâ€™t care really. Yesterday was the best night in my life and I just wanna get it off my chest here. 

My whole life till 2020 has been full off failures and disappointments. I have been rejected many times. I have got betrayed many times. I have had anxiety problems. But I always knew that it was gonna get better. 

The year of 2020 has been the best year in my life so far. Despite the pandemic, which sucks, it is still the best year in my life. I have my own small business which makes me enough money to live my best life at this point (iâ€™m 18). I became a lot more confident than ever before. 

Yesterday night me and my friend, who has been with me from the very beginning, went out and spent the entire night partying and having fun. I lost my virginity last night. I had never had so much fun before yesterday. 

It is crazy man. Life is crazy.
