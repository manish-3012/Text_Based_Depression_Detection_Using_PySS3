Need help So for Instagram status when someoneâ€™s Instagram activity goes off itâ€™s because they turned it off themselves right? My girlfriend is trying to tell me it turns off by itself and that she isnâ€™t touching anything so Iâ€™m giving her the benefit of the doubt but I would like to know, does anybody else experience similar problems with others Instagram activity going off or am I the only one? Because if thatâ€™s the case then Iâ€™m obviously getting lied to
