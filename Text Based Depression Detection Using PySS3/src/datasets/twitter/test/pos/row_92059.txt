Question, What is Prom? What happens in a Prom? Do you really need a partner for that or what? I'm still in 10th Grade and have insanely no idea what's that. I heard that there will be one when i'm 11th or 12th Grade.   


If it's a party, I'm planning on bringing my Gaming set and play all the time.
