popeshayman Daily facts until I forget to put another one #4 (switching to real facts now) According to a random [statistic](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/how-many-people-lgbt/) I found, 3.5% U.S citizens are geh. According to [subredditstats.com](https://subredditstats.com) there are  2,363,499 r/teenagers members (from the time I wrote this). that means 82722.465 r/teenagers members are gay (82,722 are fully gay while one person is 46.5% gay) or 3.499980325779702% of r/teenagers members

Thank you for coming to my Ted^(x) talk

(the reason I used the US statistic is because it was the easiest to find, I myself am not in the US but I feel like most here are)
