Help a lesbian out, please? This is it. My lesbian ass is going to ask out my crush. We've had crushes on each other for a few months now and have been on dates, but we haven't really been *dating* if you know what I mean.

Her brother has been feeding me information and pushing me to ask her out, and I'm going to call her within the hour. What should I say? He's pretty positive that she'll say yes, but my worry is that my stutter is bad when I'm nervous and I won't be understandable.
