I procrastinated the whole day while doing homework, god my brain HATES freaking school. Side note - IF YOU WANT SOMEONE TO TALK TO ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS, Iâ€™m here for you! I want to comfort you okay! - Iâ€™m in USA time so I might not always be there but hopefully we can talk about your feelings!

Y O U R G R A D E S DO NOT DETERMINE YOUR INTELLIGENCE. AS LONG AS YOU HAVE a good heart and actually want to become better person, and hopefully make good decisions in life your good.

If your struggling with anything, I HOPE IT GETS BETTER FOR YOU. I B E L I E VE IN YOU!

DONT LET BISHES ONLINE/IRL BULLIES GET YOU. YOU ARE BETTER THAN THE MEAN BULLIES

Try not to compare yourself to others. Your beautiful JUST THE WAY YOU ARE! As long as you want to be healthy in the best way you want to be, your good! If your struggling I hope it gets better! It better to leave social media for a while and become the very best that no one ever was, to catch them all, I know itâ€™s your destinnnnyyyy pokemon!


THE SCHOOL SYSTEM IS TRASH. THE HOMEWORK IS TRASH, except the actual subjects that are interesting OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL. Thank you brainly

I wish I didnâ€™t freaking distract my self. WHY DID I go to REDDIT THATS ALSO DISTRACTING ME ugh. ðŸ¤¦â€â™‚ï¸

I WISH I COULD CHANGE THE SYSTEM. WHY DOES SCHOOL ASSIGN SO MUCH HOMEWORK ON EDGENUITY? Edgenuity is so 2010s. LITERALLY.

Thankfully School doesnâ€™t give us fear in the pandemic right? RIGHT? Of course they do. ITS NOT LIKE SPAMMING â€œ YoUr GrADEs MaTtER â€œ will help. Thanks school for giving us more homework in online school /SARCASM .

I agree that grades kinda matter in order to BE FREE FROM HIGH SCHOOL!

Thatâ€™s all I gotta say PEACE OUT.
