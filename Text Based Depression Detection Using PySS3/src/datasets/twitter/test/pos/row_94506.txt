whenever i wake up in the morning i get really upset and start counting down the hours until it's over i really just dont want to live my life like this anymore LOL 

&amp;#x200B;

like when i open my eyes my first thought is how much im dreading the day and how i just dont want to deal with it, and i'll start thinking like okay twelve more hours until i can be asleep again, just get through it 

&amp;#x200B;

there has to be more to life than this right??? 

&amp;#x200B;
