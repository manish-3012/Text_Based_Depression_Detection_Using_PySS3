You ever just... ...lay on your bed thinking about nothing and everything for literal hours before you realise "oh shit it's 4 am and my school starts in 3 hours" and then spend another few hours wondering what the fuck is wrong with you and your life and if you'll ever get out of this confusing loop of not understanding anything and not even understanding what you need to understand and everything is just confusing and you don't know what to think until you eventually just distract yourself with meaningless entertainment on the internet?
