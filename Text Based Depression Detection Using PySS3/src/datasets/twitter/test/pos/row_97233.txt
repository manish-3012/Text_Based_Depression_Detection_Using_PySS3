So I ate the pie and here are my thoughts The crust was great it was buttery and held up

The filling was good the apples tasted great but it was a waste of amazing apples and I need to cut down on the cloves next time

The cinnamon and sugar thing the dough just should've been a bit thinner

That was it so for a first attempt at making a pie from scratch it was great
