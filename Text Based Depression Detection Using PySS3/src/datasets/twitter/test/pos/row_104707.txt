Thank you, Ruth Bader Ginsburg Iâ€™m not sure where to post this, but I thought a lot of you would understand and relate to this. 

As many of you may know, United States Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg (RBG) sadly lost her battle to cancer recently. She was a key voice in the fight for marriage equality and same-sex marriage. 

As a bisexual male, I couldnâ€™t be more grateful for what she did for the LGBT community. Because of her, I am going to be able to marry the man I love when I want to. Because of her, I canâ€™t be refused a job or acceptance to college because of my sexuality, something that so many people before me experienced. 

Without her, my life would look much different. Obviously, there is still so much work that needs to be done to make members of the LGBT community truly equal to others, but we wouldnâ€™t be nearly as close as we are today without her, so thank you RBG. You have changed my life and made this world a better place.
