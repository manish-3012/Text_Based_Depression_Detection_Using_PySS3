Mom saw reddit with some *rad* memes I was going through reddit. Got a call for mom. I went out of the room for a second and bam. The call had ended and she, as a parent does, started scrolling through the screen.
You know what was on the screen? Memes.
Very explicit talkin' memes about my bisexual ass. Memes about self harm. 
Today is a fun day. 
I'm pretty happy she didn't have her glasses, but I still don't know how much she saw and read. But I did find her staring intently at a meme talking about how we bi people can't choose between pussy and y'all know the other option.

ALSO I had no idea what flair to put in. You can suggest. Sorry lol.
