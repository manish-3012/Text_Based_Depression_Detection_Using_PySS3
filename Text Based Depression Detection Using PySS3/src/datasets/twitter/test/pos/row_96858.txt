I scheduled therapy for the first time today! Been a redditor for a while, just wanted to share this story that happened over the course of the past few months. 

I have suffered very bad anxiety over the quarantine, which has left me feeling like crap. I didnâ€™t see ANY of my friends for five months, and my household has been a little crazy. I was sick of staying in the house for so long, and I started to mentally, emotionally, and sometimes physically hurt myself. I was so sick of it and I just wanted it to end. Today I had enough and expressed my concerns to my mother, and she and I scheduled a therapy meeting with a counselor next week. I am proud of myself for having the courage to do that, and I really hope it helps.
