Help me Hey everyone. I'm living on the US West Coast, in Washington State, and currently, we're in danger  thanks to low humidity and wildfires. There's so much smoke in the air and people's power is going out because of a "historic wind event," where huge gusts of wind are blowing off of the Rockies creating gale-force winds measuring an 8 on the Beaufort Scale. Already a tree has been blown over at my grandmother's house, and it wasn't a small one. Currently our houses are not in danger but fire danger is through the roof air quality is horrible and the wind is crazy. 

I might get back to update if more things happen. If there are any other Washingtonians, Oregonians, or Californians here, stay safe.
