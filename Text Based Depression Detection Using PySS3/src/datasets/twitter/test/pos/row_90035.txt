I have a mouth yet I'm unable to scream Currently on Day 2 of being ill with (and recovering from) a sickness here that is *not* Corona, but still pretty severe in that it's made my throat *incredibly* sore and raspy. Because of this, I'm *completely* unable to speak or yell or, well, do *anything* with my mouth that isn't eating and drinking.

And you what? It sucks. Quite nightmarish, actually for someone as talkative as me. On the plus side, I at least now know how it feels like being a mute person.
