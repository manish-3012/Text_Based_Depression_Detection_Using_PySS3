Any shows you guys could recommend that I could safely binge with my mom but still be interesting for the both of us? So like... no sexy scenes lol 
She also doesnâ€™t like bloody scenes which is in all the shows I watch but I could be fine without it. She watches The Good Place and the Boss Baby Series (yeah ik itâ€™s a cartoon but she finds it funny lol).
