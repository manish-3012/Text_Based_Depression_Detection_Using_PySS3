I sit by a band kid and itâ€™s awful Think of a band kid... thatâ€™s pretty much who I sit by in psychology

Always makes weird noises, makes weird references about some random show nobodyâ€™s ever heard of, shows me softcore among us p*rn, does roleplaying on discord, hisses after every sentence and screams every time the bell rings 

I mean just this lesson she screamed â€œI WROTE 17 INSTEAD OF 3â€ and full on slammed her head into the table

Of course weâ€™re all sitting there like wtf and itâ€™s just silence for 10 seconds

God help me
