Crazy obsessed 'friend' There's a girl who lives on my road and she's like 9 years old. She's attention seeking and always trying to start arguments.

Yesterday she came outside when me and my BFF were playing and she was obviously trying to show off this stupid hover board that she can barely ride. She then stole the scooter I was playing on and made it so I was left sitting on my own while her attention seeking ass played with my friends. No one noticed that I went inside for an HOUR. To top it all off she kicked my football into the bushes. 

She tries to get me pissed off then play victim because my best friend hates it when I'm angry. I can't just avoid her because she has a window overlooking where we always play and comes running. We can't play in my garden because dog crap and we can't play in hers because she has a window overlooking my best friend's garden and comes knocking on the fence. 

This has been going on for like 3 years at this point. 

Honestly the hell am I meant to do? Any ideas, I'm sick and tired of her ruining my fun whenever I try to see my bestie.
