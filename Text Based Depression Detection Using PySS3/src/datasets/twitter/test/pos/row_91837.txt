What do you guys think? Hi, I've been at an event for the past few days. 


The first day, this boy walks up to me. He starts a conversation and we talk for a few minutes until I have to go help my sister. I asked him how long he'd been doing the event for, and after talking we found out he was a year younger than I am. I was surprised since he's pretty tall for his age and just looks a bit older in general


After that anytime I walked by he would smile or wave. He eventually gave me his name, asked for mine and shook my hand. Ever since then he'll walk up to me anytime he sees me or if he's with his friends and passes by he'll point at me.


I was with my sister after we did a certain event. Right after I was done he smiles at me and tells me I did well. A little while later I was with my family, he asked me what I placed (didn't pay any mind to sis), I told him I did bad and he said that he's sure I was fine.


My sister also said she over heard him and his friends making some suggestive "remarks" about me more than once too.


He seems nice, but I know it's probably an act. I've had this happen once or twice before. They're your friend for around a week or so, they ask you out, you say no and they don't care for you afterwards. I'm hoping it isn't the same with him but if he's all sweet to me one second and then the next he's talking about me like that to his friends, it's unlikely that he's being genuine. I'll keep at it and I'll still act like I have been since you never really know anyone's intentions until the end, but I'm not getting my hopes up.
