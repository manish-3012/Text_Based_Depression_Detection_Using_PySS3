FOR WHEN I'D LIKE TO LIVE IN THE SOLUTION [a rant]. Better than the noose i tied and anchored to the doorknob of my childhood, their childhood, their futures, mine. My end, my adulthood. I'd like to live in the problem diminished, no the problem set aside, no the problem resolved, no the problem rejected. No! I want to live in the solution. No noose, no chlorine, mixture of any chemicals at all. These are not solutions, there is only one -- and this is the turning point: Live in the solution, or. Die.
