I'm a lonely failure and I hate myself No friends since I was 9 years old. Barely passing high school. Can't talk to my old friends on Twitter because my account got banned for a tweet that wasn't even that bad, and everytime I try to make a new account on it I automatically get banned. It's like they banned my IP or something

Just got banned on Instagram for absolutely NO REASON, where I was talking to some people from my area who I thought I could potentially make friends with. 
I don't know anyone's Snapchat because I haven't used it since 2016, so that's out the window.

I'm very close to turning 18, and have spent the ages of 10-18 being lonely, depressed, watching my family fall apart, and accomplishing nothing.
