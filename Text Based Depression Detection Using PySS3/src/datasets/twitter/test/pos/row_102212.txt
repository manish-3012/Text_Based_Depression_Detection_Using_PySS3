Call me a psychic cause My dad left my family back when I was 12 because he lied to my mom about being in Auburn, AL for a business trip. My mom found that he had lied and bought gas somewhere else and went to the beach. After that, they soon broke up (they weren't officially married yet so they can't divorce). Ever since that, I've gotten better at figuring out the lies from my dad.
