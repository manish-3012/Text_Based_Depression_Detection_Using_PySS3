I met my wife today AL. I know youâ€™re reading this. Itâ€™s me, John. 

It was an among us game like any other. In the lobby, me and a random player named Al convinced everyone to put a cherry on their head, and at the end of the game, I confessed my love for her. Or him idk

The next game, we had a beautiful wedding. Nothing could separate us. But then, disaster struck. Al killed a man right before my very eyes, and another player reported the body before I had time to process it. I asked her why she did it. She said she was sorry. I told everyone to vote for me instead of her. But they didnâ€™t. Not even she did. 

Unable to survive me grief, I called a meeting and begged to be voted out so I could be with my beautiful wife. They granted me a merciful death, and I was reunited with my beloved Al. 

The third game, it was wonderful. We stayed together, we watched each otherâ€™s backs. And we caught both impostors. We were so happy and so confident of our victory. But then, disaster struck. 

The original owner left the game, and the new owner was the vengeful importer we had caught. I was typing my last message to al when I was banned from the game. Curse you, BlackSanta, for ripping me away from my beloved wife before I could even say goodbye. 

I will always yearn for you, al. The way that wonderful cherry rested on your head. The way youâ€™d run in circles in the lobby. 

I miss you dearly. 

Love,

J o h n
