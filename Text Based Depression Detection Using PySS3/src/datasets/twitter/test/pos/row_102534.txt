Having a younger brother sucks My little brother came in to my room like 3 hours ago and threw a fucking stool at me then blame me for throwing it on him. Even though the stool is besides me he gets fucking praised and i get punished. so now I have to let him use my pc whenever he wants for the next two weeks as a punishment for getting a stool thrown at me. That mother fucker is twelve years old. Man life is really unfair
