i fucking hate myself i failed this trimester in the most pathetic and miserable manner after promising myself to do better, because that fucking admission exam made quarantine hell on fucking earth, and yet here we are, with a goddamn "did not present" on history, on fucking history, my favorite subject and the bane of my forsaken existence. jesus christ, i just want to fucking die, i hate myself, i hate school, i hate grades, i hate wasting time on games, and i specially fucking hate this fucking pandemic
