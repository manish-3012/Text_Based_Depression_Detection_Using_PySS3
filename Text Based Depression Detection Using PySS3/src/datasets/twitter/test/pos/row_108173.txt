My friend was hospitalized after a covid-19 induced asthma attack and is in critical condition. GET WELL SOON, u/SmokkSammon.  Just a quick rant: this man was my best fucking friend since kindergarten and we have done everything together, from soccer to projects in school(if we could). He has supported me through the toughest time, like when my mother and sister died in 2012 and it was only my father and I. If he dies, I don't know what the fuck I would do. Without him, there would be know weekly skateboarding sessions, late-night league and life would be a lot less fun. Get well soon, man.
