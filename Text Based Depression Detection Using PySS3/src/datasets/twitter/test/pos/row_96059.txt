Here is a python program that says a random quote from everyone's favorite wholesome man.     import random
    
    quotes = [
        "If you win, you need not have to explain...If you lose, you should not be there to explain!",
        "If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough, it will be believed.",
        "Do not compare yourself to others. If you do so, you are insulting yourself.",
        "I can fight only for something that I love, love only what I respect, and respect only what I at least know.",
        "The stronger must dominate and not mate with the weaker, which would signify the sacrifice of its own higher nature. Only the born weakling can look upon this principle as cruel, and if he does so it is merely because he is of a feebler nature and narrower mind; for if such a law did not direct the process of evolution then the higher development of organic life would not be conceivable at all.",
        "Think a thousand times before taking a decision, but after taking decison never turn back, even if you get a thousand difficulties!",
        "The leader of genius must have the ability to make different opponents appear as if they belonged to one category.",
        "The state must declare the child to be the most precious treasure of the people. As long as the government is perceived as working for the benefit of the children, the people will happily endure almost any curtailment of liberty and almost any deprivation.",
    ]
