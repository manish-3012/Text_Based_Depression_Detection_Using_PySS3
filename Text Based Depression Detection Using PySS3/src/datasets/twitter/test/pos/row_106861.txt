I feel like my parents don't care about me sometimes A couple of months ago my parents found out i was cutting my self(i stopped and I go to a therapist btw.)  Anyways when they found out my parents grounded me instead of trying to help me through and I was in a dark place and it hurt when this happened they wanted to take away video games when I felt like I wanted to die and it felt like they didn't care about what i was going through. Anyways I just needed to vent nobody probably cares though.
