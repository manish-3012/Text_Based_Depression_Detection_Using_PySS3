No mom, Iâ€™m not trying to appease the opposite sex No, whenever I want to wear a smaller cut bathing suit, it isnâ€™t to attract teenage boys.

No, whenever I put on makeup, Iâ€™m not trying to impress someone.

No, just because I have a friend of the opposite sex doesnâ€™t mean I want to date him. 

I donâ€™t know about you guys, but in my moms eyes, everything Iâ€™m doing is to impress boys, even though Iâ€™ve never shown the slightest attraction to them around her (little does she know Iâ€™m actually bi). When will she realize that I dress and look my best for myself, not others, and definitely not men?
