YOU AREN'T DATING IF YOU DON'T GO ON DATES If you hang out with someone that you kiss, it's not dating. It's just being friendly. Get a job and a car first so you can afford to treat the people you care about nicely. Imagine taking your crush out to a fancy dinner but your parents are sitting next to you the whole time. If you do more than kiss, you might have made a mistake.

TL;DR if you don't take your gf/bf out on dates then it's just friendship with kissing
