is it safe to take energy drinks/supplements after taking Adderall? so I started Adderall about two/three months ago and before I started I was debating trying a gaming supplement (g-fuel, sneak-fuel, nue energy, etc). but since Adderall makes me less energized and the supplements would make me more energized I was wondering if I would just pseudo speedball and burnout. also to anyone else who takes Adderall, how do you deal with the appetite loss. I was already quite skinny but I've been losing too much weight due to a lack of eating as much?
