Rant about fear of robots taking over Im mad rn so pls excuse any typos or repetition of points made. Also nerd rant. 


1: AI fear Mongering

Im so fustrated with all the fear mongering about AI. I cant even enjoy videos of technological advancememts without seeing dumbasses everywhere in the comments saying "Have you see what happened in Black mirror!?" And "why are we doing this to ourselves" . 

Videos of advaced AI (for example Sophia) get fucking harrased in the comments due to people fear mongering about how robots are going to end the world. Just go to some robltics courses and you'll understand the concept of AI. Its all fake, a simulation. Simulation of happiness, anger, sadness and sometimes a sense of humor. 

Sophia made a joke many years ago about how she wants to destroy humans and people are taking her seriously. Its been programmed into her to have a sense of humor or she could have learnt it since she learns from the internet. We joke about how robots are going to destroy humans and we joke about how we would destroy humans due to climate change and nobody thought that she may have learnt it from there?


2: Fear mongering robotics

People are stupid. We all know that. Some more than others. The amount of fear mongering online is crazy. A video of advanced animatronice doing their thing and people in the comments go "Oh no robot look scary. Ooga booga. That means its bad". 

Not to mention how negatively Spot by Boston Dynamics was taken. People keep mentioning Fucking Black mirror. Here in Singapore it was used for checking if people upheld covid safety measurements. It was controlled by a security officer and had a camera and microphone and thats it. 

Its no stronger than a cop. It cant stop you. Its just there to look and see if you do anything wrong without risking the cop getting covid.


3: Competetiveness

People always fucking bring up Honda Asimo when theres a new humanoid robot, saying " 1999 Honda Asimo was better". Like fuck off dude. For example, the robot Romeo. It cant walk well but it has amazing "eye" capabilities. 

It was made to test the ability to make cameras on robots similar to human eyes and it had arms and legs to make it do stuff. It has round eyes that can rotate and looka round without moving its head, which is already impressive but it has amazing tracking abilities and let me remind that it was made to test what it can do at the moment. 

But no, Asimo is better because he can walk better. Fuck you Jerry.

Everyone compares everything in robotics.

You think Asimo was made perfect first try? No it was not.

Romeo is still a prototype dumbass and they're just posting videos to track and show progress.


4: My personal fear

I personaly feel that if the fear continues people will try defund science or robotics in the future. In a time of idiots i genuinely think it could happen with all the fear surrounding it. 

People are scared of things they dont understand and  its normal. I just hate the fact that so many people are blindly fearing robotics as a whole. 

Id say in 5 more years when robotics gets more mainstream in our society and get more advanced some people will try defund it. 

5: Notes
Im mad rn, so if anyone says something opposing what I said in the post please know its nothing personal. I'll probably delete it once I cool down.
