dunno who to talk to abt this because my friends are asleep, but iâ€™ve just been really sad and tired the past few days the past 3 nights iâ€™ve passed out in the clothes i wore to school because i havenâ€™t had the energy to change or shower. i feel like iâ€™m going back into a depression episode, which fucking sucks because the last one lasted like a year and a half

i donâ€™t know how to ask without sounding really pathetic, but would someone be ok with talking with me or something?
