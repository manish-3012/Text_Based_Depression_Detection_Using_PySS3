Worst Christmas Eve ever Before all, I need to tell you the context. My mother started talking to a crazy extremist catholic thatâ€™s been using her for the past 10 years. Her objective is to make my mom think that everybody wants her dead including me. My father and I tried our best to show her that sheâ€™s evil but she wonâ€™t listen. And today, while we were eating with my grandma, she started getting crazy and it ended up in her insulting me, my dad and her own mother. Never have I suffered so much from only words. Worst christmas ever
