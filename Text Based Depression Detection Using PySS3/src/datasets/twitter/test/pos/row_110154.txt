Life sucks and I blame school Why the fuck are we going to school? I'm in Canada and school's gonna start next month, but seriously. Does the school system expect us, teens, to stay *contact free?* the same teens that do weed in the bathrooms and stupid shit all around?

We have family members who are at risk, family members who go to work, any of us can be infected

and for kids that are struggling or those in advanced programs like AP, IB and gifted, why the fuck are we going to school? we have stressful, rigorous and tough programs that require really good teachers that we can talk to when we need to

and then there's mental health, school doesn't give a shit about us as long as we get through it

It is estimated that 10-20% of **Canadian** youth are affected by a mental illness or disorder â€“ the single most disabling group of disorders worldwide. Today, approximately 5% of male youth and 12% of female youth, age 12 to 19, have experienced a major **depressive** episode.

20% doesn't seem like a lot but that's about 600,000 of us or about 30% of the members on this sub

teachers don't give a shit except the good ones, most of us have parents who have high expectations and think mental health is bullshit and we need to "deal with it" cause when it comes to guys, no one cares bout mental health

I hate the way school doesn't try to fix our issues when we're young only to highlight it when we grow up. They expect us to deal with adult problems as, lets face it, teens not adults.
