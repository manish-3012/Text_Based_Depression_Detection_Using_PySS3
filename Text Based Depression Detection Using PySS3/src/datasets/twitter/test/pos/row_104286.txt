Bruh I felt so bad the entires time in my history class talking about the slave trade. So we had an assignment in my history class. We were split into groups of 5 and had to answer 6 questions together and all of us were given certain tasks. I was the â€œleaderâ€ so I had to be the lead in answering questions and stuff.

The only person thatâ€™s not white was in my group and they were staring at me the entire time I was answering the questions.

I went into shit about how African Americans lost their cultural and ethnical identity because of the slave trade, and that many donâ€™t know their roots because of this, and that itâ€™s why movements like Black Power and blm came to be. I went into how Black power is really the only justifiable unity between all people consisting of a race because in countries like America, with African Americans having their identity lost the could only find identity through their skin color hence the creation of black power.

Fuck I felt so stupid the entire time I was saying that because they were glaring at me for a long time but also didnâ€™t say a word.
