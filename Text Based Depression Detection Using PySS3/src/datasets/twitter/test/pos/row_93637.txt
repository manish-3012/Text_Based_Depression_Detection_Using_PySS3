Is something wrong with me? I dont know if something is wrong with me or not. I was lying down at like 3 am thinking about deaths and shit when it hit me. I have seen many family members die and even very close friends die. I always thought that I would react in an overwhelming way whenever they does however...it doesnt affect me at all.

I was in the 3rd grade when my best friend died from an asthma attack. She was 9. They gathered us in the gym to honor her and everyone was looking at me. I didnt care. At all. I spent so long with girl and I didnt care when she died. Another time wasnt too long ago. We had a dog. He was 14 years old and I loved him. He passed and when I was told, i didnt care. I had thought about him dying before and figured that i would freak out, but I didnt.

When I was 7, I was shown a picture of soldiers with their heads cut off by my dad. He didnt want to show me, and my stepmom kinda forced him too. He thought I'd freak out but i didnt. Gore doesnt bother me in anyway. I used to look at gorey pictures for fun when I was 10.

I find that I have to fake many emotions so that people dont think I'm weird in these situations. I'm practically a pro at fake tears. 

I know that anti social personality disorder is a thing, however I am definitely not a sociopath. I'm the type of person who feels bad for the bad guy in a movie when something goes wrong. 

I just dont know if this is "normal" or not. Should I talk to someone?
