I probably have existential OCD I suffer from existential cirises lately since i got too much time to think in quarantine, but it wont go away and it makes me really scared on a daily basis and i feel sick by it... 

It started as a fear of death but it got so worse i second guess even my own existence and how and why theres a universe and how the universe can be infinite or not infinite

And all this effects everything i do and like 

And the OCD means it doesnt go away and i dunno what to do... i dont wanna live like this
