I really miss my close friend I'll keep it short. 3 months of a bestfriend ship. Sometimes we called, but she's been struggling and told me sorry that she was distant but that didnt make sense to me because in may/june/early july she struggled and i was always there to help her. And i just feel somewhat incomplete, I just miss her man. She was there for me when my other best friend ghosted me and she promised me she wouldnt do it to me and she was a bitch for doing it. Yet shes doing it to me. I understand she's struggling but she's actively on snapchat so im starting to think she's only being distant with me. Last night she texted me and i was kinda dry with her but i ultimately opened up to her and told me im still here for you and i woulnt ditch or replace you. She told me she was sorry and goodnight.

Just looking at our screenshots/texts I really do miss it. I'm planning to text her in like 3 days. Should I do it and give it time?
