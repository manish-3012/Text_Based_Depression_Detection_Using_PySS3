Removing myself from this website Reddit sucks. Iâ€™ve been here for two years (this is one of four alts I use) and absolutely excruciating. This site has made me so cynical, stressed, and angry, that Iâ€™m concerned for my mental state. Reddit isnâ€™t a fun communal hangout space which I was lead to believe so many wasted months ago. I joined because I have nobody to speak to in my actual life and I assumed this would help. I handled it well for a while but now every time I get argued with for half an hour or told to kill myself Iâ€™m punching walls and kicking over furniture. Iâ€™ve cried several times and Iâ€™ve got no sign of mental stability left. Adios Reddit, youâ€™ve literally drained the life out of me.
