No, being broke or ugly is not the reason why you are single. Men usually complain "eh.. I cannot get a girl because I'm not rich, or handsome".
Most of the times looks or money isn't the key thing though. But we hear it from most of man and think that its true. When in reality we hear that because most of men lack money and looks and once they fail with a girl they blame that to their ugliness. I believe that you have seen not so beautiful boys having so pretty girls, or broke ass people getting nice women. Your attitude is the problem.
Change your perspective and don't blame your failure to something you don't have, because that might not be the real problem. Its easy as duck to blame the problem to the first reason you identify. 

Also, "just be yourself" and "be a nice guy" does not work as others tell you. Do not get advice from older generation.
