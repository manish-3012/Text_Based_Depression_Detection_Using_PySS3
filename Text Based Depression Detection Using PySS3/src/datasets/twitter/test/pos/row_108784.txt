Idk how to feel anymore... So I logged onto Minecraft today, in a server I used to play years ago. Coincidentally I see one of my closer friends on the server. We used to always play with each other back in like 2016-2017. I havenâ€™t seen him in years and here he is now. I hit him up asking to play some games and thatâ€™s when I found out that the guy I used to play with died from a car accident a few months ago. His brother was playing on his account and told me all of this. I wish this was a joke I just donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m feeling right now, this is the first time Iâ€™ve experienced a death of someone I know. How do I get this off my mind?
