One of my friends broke up with her best friend for me (flair?) 
Now the thing is my friend (a) and her best friend (b) , i used to have weist long hair but i cut it  super short (because closeted trans do be like that ) and dyed it bright red (because crisis ), the first day my classmates saw me through a zoom meeting I expected reaction because Iâ€™m from a tiny kinda conservative school in Mexico and you almost never see â€œgirlsâ€ (not a girl) with short dyed hair , everybody went to their classes and I didnâ€™t heard much about it but today (a) told me that she isnâ€™t friends with (b) anymore because he started to call me whore â€œjoking â€œ the thing is he only called me a whore at my back and I have a horrible relationship with that dude ( HES A FUCKING DICK ) so (a) stoped being friends with him , I donâ€™t have a lot of friends and ether does my friend so I told her not to break a friend ship because of me but she insists on it , should I keep insisting her on going back to her friend or should I let it break for my fault? Itâ€™s not a big deal people had called me worse things and Iâ€™m used to it but my friend (a) isnâ€™t , I think she is over reacting I get that she tries to defend me but she is the type of person who chooses not to have a lot of friends and is not used to one of her friends getting called names
