How does one get a girlfriend? I'm 16, and going to be a junior in highschool. I would rate my self as a 5/10. I haven't had a single girlfriend yet, or a kiss or even hugging a girl. I stutter and don't know what to say when I see a cute girl. I don't even want one just for sex. I just want to be loved and go on beautiful dates. How can I get a gf before I graduate?
