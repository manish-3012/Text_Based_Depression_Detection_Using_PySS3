That fucking happened So for context I am in the process of getting my house remodeled and the living room and every room except for my parents my room and my sisters room is empty. It was about 5 am and I woke up to use the bathroom but before I got out of my bed I hear faintly the sound of pounding on what I assumed at the time my parents bedroom door. But after that I heard from literally outside my room in the hallway something metal hit the ground, making me nearly piss my fucking pants. I donâ€™t know what it was it was the first time something like this had happened and my dad said the night before this that he heard ponding on his door too but he thought it was my sister doing it but she denied it. I have no idea what the fuck it was and it hasnâ€™t happened since then. But it was only two nights ago so maybe Iâ€™m in store for more but I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this. And just so you know I didnâ€™t sleep the rest of that night.
