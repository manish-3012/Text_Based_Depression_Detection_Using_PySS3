Are my feelings valid? I'm a straight guy btw. 

Before COVID I used to go to a traditional school, homeschooled no. Multiple girls, at the very least there are 30 that I know of, who I though were friends but they actually m had a crush on me, and I'd have a feeling of it but I'd ignore it because I was seeking platonic relationships. A month or two later they'd tell me but I felt bad for rejecting them. Then there was the guilt. Because it becomes SO awkward especially when one of them later became my best friend. Because I love her like she's my little sister but there's this awkwardness when we go near the topic of crushes, etc. 

I don't want to have a relationship now at my age because I feel like it's not genuine?! Like they're crushes I feel at times are like what they think of "true love" but in actuality it's just attraction to my looks or my personality. 

And I'm not even rooting my own horn because like I look so weird. From my face shape to my physique nada. Nothing attractive. And like I'm usually confident but like jeez I know I'm not attractive. Though I think it's how I treat them? Like compared to most guys in my school I'm usually more open and treat them like people instead of treating them like they could be the "one". Some guys are just mad disrespectful though. 

Like is it fine to feel this way?

And don't get me started on this one girl who stalked me, etc. So creepy. Like there's no respect of privacy.
