My mum will die before I turn 18 how do I make the most of it. This has been an emotional post to make and I got the news the other day. If you want the details I can say but it is an incredibly rare brain disease. My mum is a very loving and incredibly nice person who has done so much for me and I do not want to lose. I hope people here can help me make the most of her last few years.
