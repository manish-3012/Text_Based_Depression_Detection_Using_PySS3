I think Iâ€™ve become a weeb without even watching a single season of anime in my life What I mean is: I play Japanese video games, I watch Japanese vTubers, listen to some Japanese music, and am known to view too much hentai, but Iâ€™ve never actually finished a full story arc of an anime, let alone an entire show.

So wow Iâ€™ve managed to wiggle myself into being a weeb without knowing a single thing about anime congrats to me ig
