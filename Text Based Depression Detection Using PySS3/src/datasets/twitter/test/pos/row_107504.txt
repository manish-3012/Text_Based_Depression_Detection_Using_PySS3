History Time This is an important piece of history which everyone should know.
The Battle of Teutoberg Forest, the year is 9CE and Varus is leading 3 Roman legions deep into Germania. An auxiliary commander under Varus named Arminius, who was of German descent, had quietly left a few days before. Roman agents warned Varus that he was walking into a trap set by Arminius, but Varus refused to listen. The agents were right, Arminius had formed an alliance of Germanic tribes and a trap had indeed been set. Varus walked right into it. 3 legions were annihilated, up to 30,000 men dead. The Roman emperor at the time famously shouted, â€˜where are my legions, Varus!â€™ as his last words (?). It was a great defeat for Rome and they never did manage to conquer Germania. It wiped out a third of the entire Roman army at the time and the three legions were never replaced. Varus killed himself by throwing himself onto a sword.

Theory: It is most likely the reason that Germany today doesnâ€™t have a Romance language i.e. French, Spanish, Romanian and instead has a Germanic language. If the Romans had invaded Germania then its language today (and culture) would be very different.
