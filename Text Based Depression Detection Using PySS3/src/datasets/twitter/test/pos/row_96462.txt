Ahem here is a hot political take If a man is raped he should be allowed to do the following;

\-have 100% say on if the baby gets aborted or not (Shouldn't have to be a father if he chose not to)

\-Automatically get full custody of the child (if he doesn't abort it)

\-entitled to child support from the sick fucker

Now before you rustle you jimmies, the same should go for women and it does. The problem is we never hear from the other side, and these pro choice movements never talk about and discus these circumstances for men. I know I am going to get comments saying I am suppressing women's issues when I believe as a society we are all close to gender equality I feel it is okay to talk about the issues men face too. Please be civil in the comments.
