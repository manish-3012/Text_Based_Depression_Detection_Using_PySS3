whenever i'm talking to someone.. whenever i'm talking to someone and they tell me about something that happened to them i always tell them about something that happened to me that's similar to what happened to them. i do it as kind of a "oh hey yeah this happened to me so i can relate to what you're going through" but i'm always afraid it comes out as "oh yeah well this happened to me so clearly i have it tougher than you" or "i'm done talking about you let's talk about me"

i swear i don't mean it like that...
