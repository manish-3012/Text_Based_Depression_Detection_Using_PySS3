What is it with teens and hoodies? Am I just the only one that doesn't get it? You guys want to sleep in hoodies, sit in hoodies, fuck people in hoodies, like every color of hoodie. It's gotten to the point where I'm genuinely confused with how many people like them. I wear old 80s track jackets and people like it, but I just don't get what it is that makes people comfy, attractive, and relaxed all at once.
