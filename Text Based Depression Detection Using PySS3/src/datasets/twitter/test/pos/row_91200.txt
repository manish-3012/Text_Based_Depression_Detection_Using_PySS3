As someone currently in the middle of a degree in education, your complaints about high school teachers are often misguided. Disclaimer: there are obviously shitty teachers every once in a while, Iâ€™m focusing on complaints I hear that are perfectly normal to expect from the school system itself.

On the topic of grading, itâ€™s perfectly normal to wait 2-3 weeks to get a paper or significant assignment back. Roughly 30 students on each class multiplied by 3 classes means teachers have about 100 students to grade if theyâ€™re lucky. Also, these people have families, and their contracted hours only end 30 mins after school. Thatâ€™s not a lot of time to grade. The ones that get it back to you fast are probably spending hours extra every day that they donâ€™t have to. Some of yâ€™all mfers expect the shit to be graded by the next day or something, itâ€™s just not realistic.

Donâ€™t complain that the topics youâ€™re covering are boring to the teacher. Teachers donâ€™t get to choose the curriculum they teach, itâ€™s up to the government and teachers arenâ€™t involved in the decisions much at all tbh. While you may think the War of 1812 is ridiculously boring, they have no choice but to teach it to you. If you want a change then take it up with the higher ups (your congressmen or people that actually work on creating curriculum)

Also, the workload youâ€™re receiving isnâ€™t always their choice either. Often, teachers are assigned a minimum amount of assignments they need to give student each week by the administration. Plus, you guys exaggerate the workload too. I graduated almost 2 years ago and never had â€œ7 essays and 16 assignmentsâ€ due all at once. Colleges will likely increase whatever workload you had in high school, so get ready. There are some times in high school when youâ€™re going to get stressed with the workload and thatâ€™s okay, many of you will face a similar feeling after going into whatever career youâ€™re planning on.

Donâ€™t expect every teacher to go above and beyond to the extent movies make you think (ex. The School of Rock). Itâ€™s a job for them, and they get burnt out sometimes too. It sucks, but itâ€™s reality. They canâ€™t grade for 3 extra hours every night, hell, some of them have second jobs they have to go work at after school or on the weekends. They canâ€™t do everything for you either. Students have to give real effort to learn if they want to understand it. Itâ€™s not always the teacherâ€™s fault you failed because they didnâ€™t teach you right.

Overall, the American school system has its pros and cons. Weâ€™re never going to perfect it in our lifetimes most likely. Do what you can. I know you guys have limits and struggles teachers canâ€™t see, but if you genuinely try and work with the teacher, itâ€™ll come out better in your favor more often than not. Iâ€™m working on a teaching degree and see how much you guys hate school sometimes. Iâ€™ll try my best in a couple years once Iâ€™m a teacher and hope I can do you guys proud.
