Cree slang I learned from my native relatives in the rez Hello my children from all over the world.

It is I Mama Lux come to teach you the slang of The Cree, one of the largest groups of First Nations (Canadian name for Native Americans) in Canada.
Why? Cause Iâ€™m bored thatâ€™s why.

(Keep in mind this is coming from someone who visits the rez once or twice a year, I may be slightly wrong about the definitions.)

Slang:
Rez: itâ€™s basically short for reservation. 
Holay!: Itâ€™s basically just the word â€œholyâ€ with a rez accent, itâ€™s used as an exclamation of surprise. I have never heard anyone use that word in a religious context.
Chuh: This is basically the cree version of â€œbruhâ€.
Eversick: Depending on the context and tone this word is used in, it could either mean â€œdisgusting!â€ or â€œcool!â€ (Iâ€™m a bit uncertain about this definition, I donâ€™t hear a lot of people use it very often, but this is generally what I assume would mean from the way people have used it)
Deadly: If a native person calls you this, take it as a compliment. It means â€œcoolâ€ or â€œawesomeâ€.
Melum: Moron.
Tuguy: Itâ€™s quite literally the word for â€œdickâ€ my cousin once told me to call my dad this when I was 8 and got yelled at.


And now you know these terribly useless terms, say thank you to Mama Lux, now.
