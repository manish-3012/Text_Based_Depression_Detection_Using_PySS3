I WANT HALLOWEEN SO BADLY Like I've never had Halloween in my life. I live in a city in the netherlands where they don't do Halloween. Since I was a kid I've always wanted to trick or treat and dress up and stuff. Now that I'm older it sucks that I've never been able to do that and I just want a Halloween party. So this year I was planning to do a Halloween party with all my friends and all dress up and maybe even a fucking costume contest or something but I never even got the chance because of that dumbass Corona virus that was like "Hey let's fucking ruin the world"
