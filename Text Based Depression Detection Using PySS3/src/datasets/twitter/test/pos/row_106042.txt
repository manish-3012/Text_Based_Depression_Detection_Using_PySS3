Would you trade this life for a perfect one where youâ€™re perfect in every way and life goes the way you want it to, but... Everyone you know and love will be replaced and not exist in the new reality. All your friends and family wonâ€™t exist, but youâ€™ll keep your memory of them.

The people you like will disappear, only existing in your memory but you get a perfect life in return.

Would you do it?
