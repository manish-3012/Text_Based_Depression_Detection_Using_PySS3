We may be putting down my dog... I have a Bassett hound and sheâ€™s getting old. She doesnâ€™t have any problems that I know of, but she is 12 and they usually live to 13. We donâ€™t really have the money to keep her alive over the winter, and itâ€™s really weird to think that her time is coming up. I love her and all, but itâ€™s just hard to take care of her. And I know how it would just kill her if she was given away, because she loves us too, I just donâ€™t know what to do. She has lived a great, happy life, but sheâ€™s getting old, and it starting to show.
