(M) Any advice on what to tell people abt my body count? Background: Ended up starting at a young age and just so happened to grab my 11th body 2 weeks ago. At first, the thought of a lot of bodies was cool but then whenever I hit around 6 i realized the consequences. 

Question: Iâ€™ve kinda wanted to settle down for a while now but I donâ€™t know what to tell the girls that Iâ€™m messing with abt my body count. I know I should be honest but if I honestly told a girl that itâ€™s anything above 5 then they see me as a hoe and donâ€™t want a relationship. This leads to the point where I have to make up a number anytime I talk to a girl (usually say 3 but they say something abt itâ€™s probably higher). Any advice on what I should say in regards to when a girl ask for my count?
