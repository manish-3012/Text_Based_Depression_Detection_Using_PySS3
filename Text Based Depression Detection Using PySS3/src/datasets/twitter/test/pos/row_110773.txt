About to Turn 18 in 1 min, so Iâ€™m looking Back on it all. Itâ€™s kinda crazy to think that now my childhood in a way will be officially over. Just thinking back on the mornings before elementary watching Cartoon Network with some Eggoâ€™s by my side. Like our first 18 years are mostly care free. Nostalgia is such a strange feeling lol, much love and just remember â€œgrowing old is mandatory, but growing up is optionalâ€-Chill Davis
