So I was in a shit mood, then I was happy for about 10 seconds I was mad that someone was unintentionally rude to me, and then I got something in the mail, which made me happy. Then I realized that I fucking hate it, but I can't say anything, and now Im on the verge of tears because of *clothing being the wrong colour* and I swear to God I'm gonna throw it at the wall. Not that anything will happen, but like jesus man
