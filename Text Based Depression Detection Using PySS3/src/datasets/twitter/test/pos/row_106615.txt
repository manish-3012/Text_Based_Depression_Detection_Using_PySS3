Alright so I fucked up this morning and now my body feels like the pubic hair of a 15 dollar hooker I'm really big into caffeine - I got addicted when I was in grade 10. I really liked the feeling stimulants give you and it made working out addicting as a motherfucker. I still am addicted to caffeine and sometimes I'll take pre-workout in the mornings as a substitute for coffee because it's faster.

Today I took a half scoop of traditional c4 - typically rather mild and has a high relative dose of caffeine compared to other things. I take the shit and today I just got shit luck..

My fucking scoop consisted of like 85% beta-alanine. If you've ever taken pre, you know sometimes it makes you itch. Beta-alanine is the thing that makes you itch.

So now I'm sitting here on my computer trying to get fucking work done but I can't because every five seconds I have to scratch my nose or my hands like developed a more subtle version of chickenpox just designed to piss me off.

I guess you know what they say, play stupid games, win stupid prizes. I just never thought that it applied to me :L
