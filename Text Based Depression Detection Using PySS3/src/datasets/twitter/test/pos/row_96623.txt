That bastard snake friend ðŸ. When we were in 4th grade I had two best friends the snake one became my friend later. So that dude shifted from friend to friend to use them to get their help by saying things like we are best friends and stuff. So once we were going to play in the park and he and I were going to invite the other one to play with us, on our way to his house he said "you are my best friend" and I was like ok.... But Aditya is MY bestie and since that day our friendship only weakend and eventually he shifted friends again and now he tries to roast me in class with his NEW friends.

he has been doing this since 2nd grade! Like planning to move from 1 friends to another like it's nothing. So anyway now it's been 9 years since I became friend with Aditya and we are still besties. We are really happy that he removed himself from our friendcircle. Everybody needs a friend like Aditya and not like that ðŸ snake
