The old man profile picture wanting to brag 5K subs is fake! The channel is fake! I heard this channel from memes I scrolled through and I thought it's wholesome. I searched through his channel and the name was very suspicious. From what I know, it is supposed to be 5k, but it's now 25k, clearly begging for subscribers.

I screenshot the profile pictured and search through tineye.

It had 7 results, one of the result is from Reddit  
A selfie by OP's dad is clear and big. Unfortunately, I can't send links.

So clearly, something is wrong.

It may not be true and you are allowed to disagree

Please help spread the words, thank you and have a good day
