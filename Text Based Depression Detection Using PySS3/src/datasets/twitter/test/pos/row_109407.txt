I..I think I have a boyfriend now? This guy Iâ€™ve known for about a month and a half told me he liked me yesterday, and so today I told him I liked him back and now I think I might have a boyfriend now, itâ€™s super scary but also amazing at the same time, we spent over 4 hours just talking about how much we liked each other haha, Iâ€™m really happy rn
