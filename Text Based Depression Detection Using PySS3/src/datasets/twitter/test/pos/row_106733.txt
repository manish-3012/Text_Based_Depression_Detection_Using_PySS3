School advice First, I'm writing this because I've seen and increasing number of people complaining about school and how it's horrible. So I'll just share my   experience. I might repost this later on so a maximum number of people   see this. You can skip the 3rd and 4th paragraph if you're impatient.

A   little bit of background: I have been in numerous school systems (french, IB, British, bilingual Canadian (in Quebec) and Dutch) in numerous different schools, in numerous different countries. School has   always been very easy for me in the subjects that don't require much knowing by heart, because I never studied. I usually had (#/20) more than 17 in physics, chemistry, math and foreign languages (I hated class   on the language the school was in, literature basically) without studying. I skipped 2 years in high school to study in university faster, where i study engineering.

People always say that school is horrible because they feel bad or depressed etc... from my experience in different school systems, the problem  isn't  school itself. It's probably the school system. For example, the  french  system is **EXTREMELY** rigid, they force you into a box named normality, and if you put one   hair out of that box, you're a bad student, weird, stupid etc... My teacher hated my guts, I don't really know why, and I was new in this   school, so I was a black sheep in the eyes of the other students. No   need to say that my experience there was horrible.

When I studied in the IB and English system (in a different country), the   mentality was very very lax. Most of the parents didn't give two sh\*ts   about their kids, so they had nannies taking care of them. So as you   could imagine, the teachers and school itself was very lax too. My   teachers gave me work from higher grades to keep my interest, and the   school always had new students, so I wasn't a black sheep anymore. My   time there was very enjoyable, I was lightly bullied by the somewhat   popular kid that had self-esteem issues, but I didn't really care as   there were other people.

As  you  can see above, in the different schools, I had very contrasting   experiences. So if you have a problem at school, try (I know that people don't necessarily have the possibility to) to change school or school   system.

When I was in grade 8, I always thought it was ridiculous that we had to learn stuff we weren't   interested in (in my case english literature etc). When I look back  upon  it, I want to hit myself.

These   seemingly boring subjects have a high importance. Now that I'm  studying  engineering, I see that they helped form my personality. Even  if you  forget what you learned after a month, you still subconsciously  make  comparisons. Try to imagine how you would be if you were someone  that  had no general knowledge. You wouldn't be able to hold a long   conversation. You wouldn't be able to realize the impact and   consequences of what surrounds you.

To   those who hate sciences. Even if you forget taylor series, or derivatives, or the gravitational force exerted between two objects of a certain mass. Your brain still 'remembers' the reasoning you had  behind  them, it helps you build your understanding and critical  thinking.

Two quotes that sum up what I'm trying to say:

"Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think" - Einstein

"The educated differ from the uneducated as much as the living differ from the dead" - Aristotle

School also allows you to make connections with people and socialize. To the   people that are going to say 'I have no friends, or I don't socialize',   you do. Talking with people is socializing. Imagine what you would do  if  you didn't go to school. To some, they know already (I know someone  who  became a blacksmith), to most they would be lost. School is a tool  that  helps you find your calling in life. For me, sciences always  interested  me in school, and now I know that I want to do engineering.

Now I know that some people feel they have too much work to do (homework for example). Believe me, you probably don't (some school systems do exaggerate on homework though). Right now, I have 8 hours of classes a day (and it's university hours, there's a lot that is taught in a short amount of time, there isn't any simplification). On top of that I have to clear up my notes, do some assignments, review what I didn't understand correctly etc... That much work is something that you will have to do everyday for the rest of your life. So homework could be considered a good "preparation" for adult life.

So   if you feel depressed/sad/tired. Don't start to blame school directly.   Look at your life and think about what could make you sad. If you're really   depressed, go see a psychologist, it isn't shameful. If you have an   unhealthy lifestyle, blame that. Sports go a long way for a healthy   mind. If there are problems with your family, go see a psychologist (if you don't have the money, a teacher you like is good too).
