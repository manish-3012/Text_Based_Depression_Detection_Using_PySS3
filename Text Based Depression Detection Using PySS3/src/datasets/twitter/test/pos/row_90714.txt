My parents don't belive in Covid and being at home with them and not saying anything is getting very frustrating. My mom got angry the other day, because they had a new policy at their work that they have to wear masks from now on and my mom came home and had a field day about it in the middle of the kitchen and I just stayed quiet, but she asked my thoughts about it and I said 'Well I think they should've been mandatory for a while now.' And she explained to me that the virus isn't real and that the flu is more dangerous. And my step dad agreed, and I just looked at them, like 'Are you guys virus deny-ers?'. And they said 'Yes.'   !

And they make a comment about it everyday and I just keep quiet cause I figured why bother fighting with them, I could never change their views about anything so it would be useless.

And today my step dad joked about getting Covid and my mom said. 'At least I would actually see someone who got the virus and I wouldn't be a virus deny-er.' - she said kinda mocking me. And I said 'Maybe because all the people who are in a critical condition are in the hospital and not on the streets or at the grocery store.' And they just brushed it off. It's getting very frustrating. ðŸ™‚ I really wonder where they get their news from.
