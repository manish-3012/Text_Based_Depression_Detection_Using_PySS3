A title with more effort than last time  

As a sophomore in highschool, i genuinely enjoy my classes have fun in most of them even if I'm online. Most are either fairly easy or the work is fun to do. But there's one class that has actually driven school from being actually fun to being fucking hell. World History AP, worst mistake I've ever been was listening to my world geo teachers advice in actually taking the class. There is... so much i can rant about her and how shitty of a teacher she is but I'll try to split it up to the best of my ability.

~~Sorry for grammar mistakes, English is my first language but I'm kind of stupid.~~

The teacher seems nice, though that might be because its the only good trait she has, that she can put on a smile despite most of her class failing. Though its not an uncommon problem, at this point it just feels like she's doing it on purpose. She constantly has technical difficulties, always having to resubmit or modify something mid class. This isn't unusual, especially since I'm her 2nd period. Though, its getting out of hand. More than 3 or 4 months into the school year she still has problems that makes us have less than ten minutes for a twenty to thirty question quiz. This has happened multiple times and you have to be immensely lucky to actually be able to finish it. Not only that, but even with her technical difficulties she doesn't give us more time. And whenever there's a problem she doesn't accept that there is a problem until at least half of the class has complained about it. It makes the whole process of her fixing her mistakes that much longer.

She blatantly tells the class whenever someone failed a quiz or a test. Though she doesn't outright say it, she basically has a line that we have all accepted as 'they failed'. She says 'did you study', which most people say they did because we did. But its just getting absurd how much she just asks most kids in the class if they studied and I just don't see what's the point giving out this information to the public even if it isn't 'obvious' that she is.

I go to her classes every day, i do all of the work. Not ONCE has she told us how to actually study for her class. What she does instead is give us a huge online text book then give us 40 - 60 pages (a whole chapter) to read and figure out what important info we need. She doesn't give us hints or information on what we need to make sure to make notes on or anything, we have to completely figure this out by ourselves. She doesn't even show us her copy of the notes until the day BEFORE a major test. Meaning we have to go over her notes which are usually 2 documents with 90 pages in one night and study that. I understand AP is a college level class, but it gives so much unnecessary work that we'll get wrong anyways because its almost fate that you'll forget to note down enough things from the text book that you fail the tests.

I've emailed her multiple times about my problems, believe me that was one of the first things i did. But a few weeks ago i had a schedule problem and was set as face to face instead of virtual which i wasn't told about until Thursday of that week. So i missed out on almost a whole week of work. So i emailed her on how i can catch up since it was the beginning of the fucking nine weeks and my grade was a 12 in the class because of that. Its been two weeks since then and i sent her three emails. Not a single one has been answered. I've tried to leave the class multiple times but I can't until the first semester is over (so i have to be in it until January).

This class genuinely gives me anxiety and panic attacks. Even thinking about the class puts me in a panic out of nowhere. I KNOW its effecting my mental health when i straight up have a panic attack when i even think about the class coming up or the next quiz. Its not natural, even on the hard classes i've had before I genuinely have never panicked out of nowhere about a class.

I'm sorry for this long rant, I just needed to get it all off of my chest. Yes, I could've left the class earlier but my mom didn't want me to lose the college credit.
