Apparently I can't wear a tie Tomorrow in class we have to present a project and we were asked to dress formal, so I decided I would wear a tie given that I actually don't have any formal stuff safe for a button up shirt I would also be wearing. My mom found out and wasn't happy, so she went to tell my dad to make sure I wouldn't wear it, and their reason is I can't wear a tie because I'm a girl and will become a laughing stock if I do.
