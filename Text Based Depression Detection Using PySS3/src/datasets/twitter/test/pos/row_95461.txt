Why has this sub suddenly gotten really political and offensive Believe me I like a dark joke but holy shit you guys are saying a lot of homophobic and sexist stuff and I feel like you donâ€™t even realise it. You canâ€™t say this stuff in the real world, it can be really bad for your career and personal life. Please take some time off the internet or just all these mainstream subs and realise what harmful stuff your saying.
