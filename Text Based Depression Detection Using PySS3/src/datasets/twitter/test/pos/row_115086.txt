I'm insanely paranoid rn someone hear me out pls, I need to have a convo with someone. Okay so ill put the story short, 

My life has never been great ykno, always tried to vibe my way threw insane amount of mental bs I had, bullying in school, etc etc. everything made a huge stomp on my mental health and as I always been talking to my psychologist and leaving the room without giving a single damn, my mom showed me "list" of things that are/might be happening with me and uh

Bipolar, BPD, PTSD, Antisocial disorder, social anxiety, anxiety disorders and depression.

I felt lighter without hearing these out tbh I feel like after reading it, it got 10 times worse. Like... something really THAT wrong with me? Idk people id just use a simple conversation/friendship. If anyone around down to talk no dry/ghosting, id be super happy 

thanks n peace
