is it just me or are yt ads getting longer? ok hear me out

like 5 years ago, you'd only get an ad like half the time, and it was only like 15 seconds. later, you'd get ads like 80% of the time, but you could always skip after 5 seconds. then, you would get an ad like 90% of the time and it would be either skippable, but 10+ seconds, or unskippable, but like 6 seconds. now i'm getting 2 ads per video, and only sometimes can i actually skip them. 

really, youtube?

really?
