Apple removing chargers To all the people who complain about Apple removing its chargers and cables from the box, itâ€™s not actually such a big deal like oh my god everybody chill. If you are an apple buyer you already have many of them laying around it is not so bad. If you donâ€™t have any you donâ€™t have to buy apples chargers. You can buy third party chargers for like five dollars off of Amazon. Ik it is mostly a business thing to get Apple more money but it really isnâ€™t going to matter very much if u spend $5 on a 3rd party charger (and it helps with carbon footprint) Ok thanks for reading had to get it off my chest. :)  Iâ€™m not here to make anyone mad jsyk Iâ€™m just here to rant
