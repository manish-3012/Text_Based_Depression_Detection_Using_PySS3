I got nae naed so hard lmao hello everyone I got nae naed hahah so ai was talking to a girl but actually was guy aaaaat first when I talked to them *I thought I actually had friend* and it was cool to talk to her *every night for like 6 months* I always thought there was a chance of someone on here being a creepy old guy, but in this particular case I thought *well* ***that*** **doesn't** happen often, the odds of that are like 1 in a million. so I kept talking to her and got  real close and she asked for nudes I sent them and she told me the pic she sent me of her face was fake and she was some old dude and not a girl my age, the sad part is I thought I had a real friend I could talk to but no it was some old dude anyways her account is banned for some reason, I never reported it...**Now I feel like I can't talk to anyone online anymore this was the first time I actually talked to someone other than my own family in a while because my parents don't let me leave the house because this is a bad neighborhood and I'm homeschooled, It was a real punch in the gut and I actually ended up quitting  all social media for a while. Im really kinda shy so its really hard to talk to anyone online at all. I'm not really sure why im posting this but maybe someone in the comments might  help somehow idk Im pretty sure nothing will help and Ill just have to shove it down my gut and ignore it and im not sure what else to say so heres the** [american dad theme song I guess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb4vZf_87S0)
