It's been years and I still think about it I sitting in glass in year 11, there were three boys talking about me, I overheard my name mutiple times. I couldn't hear what they were saying but I did


 "she's actaully really ugly"



One them even asked me out later on and got upset when I ignored him. 






I'm disgusted by those boys and now what they said was wrong but it still affects me to think that others see me as ugly as well.
