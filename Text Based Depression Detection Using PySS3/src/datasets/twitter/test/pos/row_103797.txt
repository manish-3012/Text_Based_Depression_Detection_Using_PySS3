i have 44 assignments to do in spanish alone. i havenâ€™t done an actual assignment for any of my other classes since the turn of the semester, with the exception of tests and quizzes (which i actually havenâ€™t done horrible on). iâ€™m just unmotivated but iâ€™ve always been a good student and itâ€™s weird not being on top of everything. iâ€™m in a state of limbo, just floating above it all. i do well on all of my tests and stuff still, i just literally canâ€™t bring myself to do the smaller assignments unless my parents actually tell me to do specific ones.
