Just a mini rant about this sub So I am u/theycallmefingertips alt bcs I donâ€™t want some friends to see this and *im the big stupid and forgot the password*. So I donâ€™t get why you complain about getting rejected it doesnâ€™t really matter. And if you really liked them youâ€™d know all you want is for them to be happy. Ik for a fact that if someone I liked got a bf they truly liked and made them happy. Iâ€™d be happy in fact thatâ€™s happened a few times and me and her were still close. Relationships are a bit dumb and itâ€™s just weird to me how you can complain about rejection when the person let you down easy and said you could still be friends. Just slow down and take it slow. Not everything is about pushing an agenda. Oh and I made a goth gamer girl smile.
