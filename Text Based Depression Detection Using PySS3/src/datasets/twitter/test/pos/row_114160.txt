Random question for the nonvirgins of the sub So I was just thinking and I realized that I don't know the exact date that I lose my virginity. Not the day, shit not even the month.
  
So I'm just wondering if anyone knows the exact date that they lost their virginity.
  
Basically, is it normal to remember or is my memory just awful.
