my neighbor has a hyper-sensitve car alarm set to ALL THREE OF HIS CARS some low-down clunker (probably low down only because the suspension was shot) came down the street blasting pop rap and then all three cars just started blaring for a solid minute in a cacophonic symphony of fake siren noises 

It even gives the little "Watch yourself" kind of chirp-chirp when I *close the car door* across the street from it.

And you know what's even funnier about it? They don't even work. They go off so often through the night that everybody just ignores them. One time we got up in the morning and some homeless guy was asleep in my neighbor's car. He must have set off the car alarm getting in and everybody was like "there goes wayne's cars again".
