Does anyone wanna peer edit my essay? We had to do an essay on a TED talk and I did [this](https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_the_next_outbreak_we_re_not_ready?language=en). We had to write a "reflection" essay on it. I can send it to anyone who is willing to help me out. My language grade isn't the highest so I can use as much help as I can.
