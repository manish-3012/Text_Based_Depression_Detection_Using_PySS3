Reviewing random things every day until I get a boyfriend: Day 43 Day 43:

Ok listen, I may or may not have missed the past 18 days, BUT THATS OK cos none of you have seen my other posts or honestly know what the fuck is going on so Iâ€™ll just continue as if itâ€™s any other post :)

Ok so today Iâ€™m reviewing quarantine. So basically I already quarantined for 6 months since March until September and honestly it was THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO ME (other than actually getting sick of course) and now I might have to quarantine again for 14 days because of my friend and she is honestly so annoying.

So basically I have a lot of anxiety (I started my GCSEs and all that and Iâ€™m a really â€œuptightâ€ person) and missing school is the last thing I need right now, but my friend keeps on telling me how quarantine is great and you get to do nothing, and Iâ€™m like WELL GOOD FOR HER IF SHE DOESNT CARE ABOUT SCHOOL BUT I DO COZ EVEN WHEN I AM IN SCHOOL I FEEL LIKE IM FALLING BEHIND (Iâ€™m rly not Iâ€™m considered one of the â€œsmart peopleâ€ itâ€™s just my anxiety levels that are absolutely through the roof that wonâ€™t allow me to appreciate the fact that Iâ€™m literally ahead in like most of subjects but whatever)

This probably made no sense but itâ€™s ok I just needed to vent for a second ya know?

Well overall score of quarantine is still 10/10 even though I hate it coz itâ€™s fucking important and the people who donâ€™t quarantine when they have the symptoms fucking suck 

Anyways I hope you have a lovely day guys &lt;3
