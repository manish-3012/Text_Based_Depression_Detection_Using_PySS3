I fucked up my bed to find a remote I didnâ€™t find So now Iâ€™m stuck with a bed I canâ€™t fix, a remote I canâ€™t find, and a terrible morning

EDIT: MY FUCKING FAT CAT GOT STUCK UNDER IT UPON ENTERING MY ROOM AND EXPLORING MY NEW BED


edit 2: he somehow got his fatass unstuck and left the room without me noticing
