When you hear a theme song of a show in a translation and then listen to the original It's weirddd. And kinda funny when the teanslation sounds better. I just watched SicÃ­nÃ­ SpÃ¡is sa SpÃ¡s (Space chickens in Space) on tg4 cause Im bored and the theme song is amazing. Then I looked up the original from Space Chickens in Space and ot sounds way worse. Like the words have the totally wrong stress and just don't sound good.
