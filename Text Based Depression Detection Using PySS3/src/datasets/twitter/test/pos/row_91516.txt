Questions for guys I'm too scared to ask irl; part 10 Well guys we reached 10 questions! Pretty nice if you ask me.

Do you have any unwritten rules that every guy knows?

For example we have this thing where if a girl comes up to you at an event or something and pretends to know you you always pretend to know her back. There could be someone following her or someone she thinks wants to hurt her, and by pretending she's there with someone they could lose interest or she could ask for help.
