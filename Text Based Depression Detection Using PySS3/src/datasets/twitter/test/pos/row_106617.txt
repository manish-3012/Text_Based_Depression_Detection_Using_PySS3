Senior year Just wanted to see how other seniors are holding up this year.  Iâ€™m feeling really bummed out the more I realize what weâ€™re missing. The only thing my school plans on doing is graduation and they havenâ€™t even really said how thatâ€™s gonna work. Idk just wanted to see if anyone else is feeling the same.
