Teenagers just about to enter sophomore years or Junior year, PSA For the love of god and everything holy, DONâ€™T join IB, Iâ€™m in it, and I fucking hate it, all of it, Iâ€™ve been doing this shit for three years now(I also did the middle years program and thatâ€™s a whole different can of worms), I PROMISE you the moment I leave Iâ€™m flipping off the entire school. And Iâ€™m not saying this because â€œyou arnâ€™t smart enoughâ€ and I know youâ€™re thinking â€œitâ€™s such a great learning opportunityâ€ and it is, but the only reason you are doing it is for the IB diploma that most colleges donâ€™t even recognize (besides like the major players in the college game) another thing , IB is so dammmn competitive between students , you also have the THOUSANDS of papers you will be writing, Iâ€™d say for about the last month Iâ€™ve written an average of 5-6 papers a week. Trust me when I say this, just take AP classes, great for GPA , reasonable amount of homework, and it teaches good time management. Trust me , donâ€™t be too afraid to try out some of those classes, most of the time youâ€™ll get some kind of super nerdy teacher or a really chill guy/girl whoâ€™s Very well cultured and understanding.
