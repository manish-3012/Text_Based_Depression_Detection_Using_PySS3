Parents' double standards? Is that the right word for it? I don't know if it's just an Asian thing, but apparently pArEnTs aRe aLwAys riGht, and to argue with them would be like challenging a god. Nowadays, whenever my parents and I encounter difficulties or have conflicts, I tend to just keep my mouth shut. 

When there is a problem, I'm the kind of person to be like ok let's bring it to the table and discuss it. I will listen to your opinions with the condition that you will listen to mine. Hopefully we can then come to some sort of middle ground, or agree to disagree. However, with my parents, if I firmly believe in something and keep trying to get them to understand, they will just say I am stubborn/ naive/ haven't experienced enough to debate with them. But then, if I choose to ignore them to prevent further conflict, they will say I'm being immature for not being upfront. 'Condescending', even. 

Ok, so apparently teenagers can never win. Whether you debate with them or not, you are wrong to do so. Whether you are right or not, you are wrong. 

I understand that it is important to be patient with my parents and be grateful for what they have given to me, but really. This just isn't fair.
