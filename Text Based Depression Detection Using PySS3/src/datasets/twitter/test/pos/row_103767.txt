My cat probably just killed a coyote She slipped out without me noticing and then came flying back in later that night. She had blood on her and I was fucking terrified. I realized she had zero cuts and I saw a coyote run through the fence gate I left open so my cat could come back in when she got out.

The coyote is almost definitely getting an infection since there was a ton of blood. Harley you fucking badass
