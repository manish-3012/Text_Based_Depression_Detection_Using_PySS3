Once I went to a class for an entire semester and then at the end I realized I wasn't in it Lol no cap. IDK I was a clueless fuck in 7th grade and was new at the school and didn't know shit about how stuff worked there. Somehow I must've gotten my schedule mixed up and towards the end of the semester I looked over it and realized I had been to the wrong class the entire time. At that point I didn't care anymore so I just finished the semester in that class.
