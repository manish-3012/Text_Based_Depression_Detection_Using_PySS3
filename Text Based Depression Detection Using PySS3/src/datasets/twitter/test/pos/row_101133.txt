Why would someone ask: Why do you like me? Hello! I have this friend, we met some weeks ago and I wanted to be honest so I told him I liked him. He then asked me why, so I told him the truth and the things I liked about him.

Of course I know this is not a "it's something mutual" answer. I'm just curious about why would someone ask a question like this. ðŸ˜³
