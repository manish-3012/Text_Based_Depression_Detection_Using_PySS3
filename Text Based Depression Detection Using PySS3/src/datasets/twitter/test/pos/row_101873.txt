I have a girlfriend I met a girl on league and met my gf through her, we started playing ALOT together and I catched feelings pretty quickly, she hinted that she liked me  but I still wasn't sure, so abt 8-9 days ago I said that she was my crush. 
(and yes I know what she looks like) She said she liked me back :) after a day or two we talked about us, I asked what she wanted but she was too shy to tell me so I had to guess... 
well anyway, I asked if she wanted a relationship and see what would happen from there and she said yes. We've been talking alot and she doesn't even live that far away (abt 45min on car) so after Corona dies down I'm hoping I can meet her :)).
