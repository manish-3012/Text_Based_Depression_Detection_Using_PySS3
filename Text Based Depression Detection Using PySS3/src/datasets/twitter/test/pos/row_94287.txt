I need advice on how to break up with my girlfriend. My girlfriend and I have been dating for over a year, but since quarantine started our communication has gone downhill and iâ€™ve frankly lost feelings for her. At this point we are barely talking and i feel like the absolute worst for ignoring and ghosting her for periods of time. I am incapable of seeing anybody in person until after quarantine ends, so I need advice on how I can break up with her without us talking it out in person. THANK YOU
