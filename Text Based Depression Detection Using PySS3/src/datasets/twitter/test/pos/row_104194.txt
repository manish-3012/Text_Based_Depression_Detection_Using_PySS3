There is an a normal a mount of woman in new The reason I say "abnormal ammount" is because it probably does not reflect the statistics of the subreddit as on the internet in general there is a majority of men however sometimes there are anomalies as women are generally more social and tend to firm stronger bonds meaning that the communities which do stand out begin to stand out even more which might be what is occurring in New on this subreddit although I cannot say for certain as I do not have access to its statistics also most of this is bullshit I am spewing out using my thumbs but make sure this is read in a monotone yet interesting voice to at least get some value out of this as the voice I am reading this is is somewhat entertaining also the no punctuation in this post is intentionally as I find it to make it funny for some reason anyways thank you for coming to my Ted talk and have a good day
