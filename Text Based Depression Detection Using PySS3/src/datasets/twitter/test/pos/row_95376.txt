Hey so I need help with math homework If anyone can help, this is the problem. â€œYou have $75 in your bank account. Each week, you plan to deposit $9 from your allowance and $15 from your paycheck. The equation b=75+(15+9)w gives the amount b in your account after w weeks. How many week from now will you have $190 in your bank account?â€ If you are able to, the work for it would help a lot too
