What does gender fluid mean? I have a friend who just came out as genderfluid and when I asked them what it mean they just laughed like it was a joke. I canâ€™t ask my parents cause they are very conservative and would stop allowing me to hang out with them, and I googled it but I still couldnâ€™t understand too much. So could you help me understand what it means so I donâ€™t call them by the incorrect pronoun. Thank you
