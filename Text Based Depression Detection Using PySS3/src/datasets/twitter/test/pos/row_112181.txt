Whyyyyy so confusing? So this was a story from last year, and just came to my mind:

So this was in art class, and we had assigned tables, the girl I liked was sitting at my table and her friend. (Her friend's bisexual, the girl I like is straight, might be irrelevant but whatever.) So then for like one class they were talking about the types of boys they like, and I just sat there like ðŸ˜¶. And they were having very \*descriptive\* conversations, and I guess I somewhat am how they like. But yeah, what did this mean? I just thought of this, was I being dumb and was my crush giving me hints?
