Why is everyone hating on America today? Look, I know us Americans suck and all that, but why are we getting so much shit today? I sorted by new and I've seen at least 3 posts talking about how overly humble America is, but...why? It's 9/11, 19 years ago today the twin towers were crashed into and collapsed. 

So why hate on America today of all days? Save it for tomorrow, there's always time to hate on our shitty country. Just...now's not the time
