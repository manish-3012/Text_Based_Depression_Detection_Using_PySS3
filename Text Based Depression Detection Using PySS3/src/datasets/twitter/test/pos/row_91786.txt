Gonna vent instead of shitpost for once... My mind is a maelstrom of thoughts, negative, positive, memories played on loop, simulations of various fictional scenarios, this vortex of chaotic thoughts makes me want nothing more than to scream...
but i can't. My emotions, at least the stronger more overpowering ones, i locked away deep inside the depths of my mind because if i were to let them take control i fear that i would never get it back and so I'm trapped with myself, with the constant headaches and the desire to scream or cry but it never leaves the realm of desire for i do not let it out. Out of fear, fear of myself

Tldr: depression be hittin hard rn
