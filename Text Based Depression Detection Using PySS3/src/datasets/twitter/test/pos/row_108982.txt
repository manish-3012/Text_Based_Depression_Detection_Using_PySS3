I wanna draw but i cant think of what to draw. I have been drawing but it all comes out wrong  :/


I try to draw a silhouette of a demon and it looks like dog shit.
I could do space stuff like I've done, but its really basic and i don't want to.


Rn im just learning abiut the constitution, bc school said so. 
Its not fun or interesting at all.


Idk why but I've lost motivation for almost everything. 
Other than talking to my friend. I could talk to her all day.


I think im gonna post a list of my fav songs later.
Maybe. Idk tho. Tbh it depends entirely on wether i remember to or not.
