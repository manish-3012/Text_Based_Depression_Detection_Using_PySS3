Intro to lit is the bane of my existence I have an A in literally every class except for English where I have a C. I just donâ€™t get it, what is the point? You just read books then answer really vague questions that barely have anything to do with what you just read. Not only that but we keep doing group projects which is one of the worst parts of school. I was hoping that we would have less this year because of COVID but NO! We have more than last year. Also Iâ€™m very concise, usually can easily answer a question with one to two sentences but in order to get a good grade I have to write five to six so I end up just putting in a ton of filler and getting a bad grade anyway because it makes my writing sounds like it is being written by a third grader. In conclusion fuck English, and fuck conclusion sentences Iâ€™m switching to the standard galactic alphabet. ãƒªð™¹âˆ´ â†¸ð™¹ ||ð™¹âš á“­á’·á’· â‘ð™¹âˆ´ á’²âšá“µâ‘ Ê–á’·â„¸ Ì£ â„¸ Ì£ á’·âˆ· â„¸ Ì£ â‘â•Žá“­ â•Žá“­?
