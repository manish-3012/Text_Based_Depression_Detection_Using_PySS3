My teacher just emailed my dad. Time to die I really fucking hate this bitches class and don't do anything for it because it's a waste of time. Idc if I fail because I have enough credits. And I have no need to go pursue  a post secondary education. 
I really hate her class. Shes a 60 year old white bitch that indeed in a farm house. 



Hi, I just wanted to reach out and try to connect with you aboutÂ TheRealBilluBhai Â Tech class right now in Quad 3.Â Â 
I am Ms. Teacher. I am having a difficult time gettingÂ TheRealBilluBhaiÂ to hand in his best work so far this quad.Â 
He is already missing multiple assignments and activities. And what he has handed in is below a LEVEL 1. I was hoping that I could help or find out if there are any problems causing difficulties and we could solve to get him on track.Â 

TheRealBilluBhaiÂ often does not follow along with what we are doing in class, and does not follow the due dates or instructions for assignments. He has handed in work for some projects but it does not follow the steps or instructions we have been working through. For example, there was a Photography assignment where I asked him to take a bunch of photos with his phone. When it was handed in late - he didn't take the shots, he handed in shots that I think were old one's off his phone.Â  The assignment that was due today. He left class without handing it in and even small activities he leaves online class without handing them in.Â  I am very worried about his credit. It is at risk. We do have supports at the school to help him.Â Â 

I have spoken to him about what is most important to hand in.Â 

I wanted to write an email so you can more easily contact me.Â 
Thank you for any help.Â
