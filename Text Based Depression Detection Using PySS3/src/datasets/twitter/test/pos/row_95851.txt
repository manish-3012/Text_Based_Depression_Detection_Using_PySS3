Hey guys, there is this big psychology assignment. I have to do a survey on a matter that has/hasn't been tested. They said I had to get at least 20 people to do it in order to get accurate results. From friends/family. But the thing is, I only live with 6 people, and I only have 2 friends at school. Would anybody be willing to take it? It doesn't ask for information that you can't share online, it just asks about sleep, sleep schedules, and health. It is called "does sleep affect health?" The teacher gave us a link to SurveyPlanet where you can create your own surveys. It would be very helpful to get some volunteers. Here is the link if anybody is interested:
