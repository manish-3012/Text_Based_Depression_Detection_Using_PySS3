After 3 years, I think I got a... date? Met this guy in 8th grade and we talked a lot together. He's the first dude that I didn't feel nervous to speak to at all. In fact, I felt so natural around him that I... accidentally confessed about my crush at the time to him in 9th grade. 
Felt intense guilt for 2 whole years because we didn't have any classes together and I never got closure. Now, after pacing and fretting and crying and getting pressured by my friend and even my own mother, I have asked him for ice cream next Saturday and he has accepted. 
Wish me luck. This is all new to me and I am so terrified I may puke.
