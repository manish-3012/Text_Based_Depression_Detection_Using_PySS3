not feeling very good these days, cheer me up? the mix of COVID, my inability to adjust well to online class and now I only have a few days left to finish my modules before the second semester starts, becoming fatter since I can't stick to a regular exercise schedule, not being able to see my girlfriend as often as I would like right now (she has Major Depressive Disorder and Dysthymia and she's in a really tough time right now. I love her to bits and I just want to be there for her 24/7), and just life in general have made me stressed about life. Maybe a couple of wholesome memes can uplift me to power me through the week?
