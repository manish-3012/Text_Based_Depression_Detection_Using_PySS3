How do I tell my friend that he's overreacting? For those of you who don't know, Biden won the election. My friend said that he is going to die and that Biden doesn't know what he's doing. He says that they're going to take his guns and that Biden will abolish the prison and police systems.

I say that he's overreacting, and all of a sudden I get a notification that says my friend has left the party. How do I get him to come to his senses and realize he has no proof that Biden has dementia, wants to take guns away, and abolish the police system?
