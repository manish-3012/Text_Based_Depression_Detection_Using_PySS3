god I am such a dumbass so I saw this post on reddit about covering an egg in chocolate sauce, someone bites into it thinking it was a chocolate egg and then they get yolk in their mouth. Late at night I sneak to the kitchen, grab an egg, a bowl, and chocolate sauce. I try to put it on the egg but it comes out in globs and a lot of it is being wasted. Every time it is covered, when I pick it up it comes off, so my dumbass keeps on trying again. I give up, put the half chocolate covered egg to the side, and realize what a dumbass I am. A bowl of chocolate sauce, a half chocolate covered raw egg, three chocolate covered forks I was using to try to pick up the egg, hands covered in chocolate, and chocolate on the counter, and then my dad hears me being in shock and comes up to see what is happening.

fuck.
