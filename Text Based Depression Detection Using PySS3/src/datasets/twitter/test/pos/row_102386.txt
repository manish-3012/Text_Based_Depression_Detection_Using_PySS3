Bro, I overthinking things and fantasise way too much over the smallest shit Flashback to the time we were doing a thing in groups on class and a friend layed her head on my shoulder (as she did often) and said "sorry if it bothers you when I do this, but I can't help it, you're really comfy"....my heart skipped a beat right then and I still think about it like a little virgin


Edit: I just realized I wrote the title wrong, fuck autocorrect
