do you guys believe dreams have meaning? Iâ€™ve always believed dreams have meaning and Iâ€™ve always been really into studying dreams. I woke up today and I felt so weird and heartbroken. I had a dream about my ex who although itâ€™s been 7 months since the spilt I still believe was my soulmate, losing him has been the worse pain of my life. Today I dreamed about him again but I finally got to ask him the questions Iâ€™ve been dying to ask over the last few months. I think my brain is trying to give me closure but it just made me miss him more. I got answers to all my questions and I believe theyâ€™re right but man. I really need to accept my time with him in this life is over
