MY MOM SHOWED ME A PIC OF MY UNCLES BALLS So I'm sitting outside on my phone looking at reddit when my mom calls me over. Not wanting to get in trouble, I hurried over and asked what was up. She showed me her phone and zoomed in on a facebook post of my uncle in a speedo. 

His balls were out...

She gave me no warning, no explanation. She laughed as I stood there traumatized, trying to make sense of what just happened. I walked away slowly and sat for a while trying to get the image of my uncles bare nuts out of my head. Alas, it hasn't worked.
