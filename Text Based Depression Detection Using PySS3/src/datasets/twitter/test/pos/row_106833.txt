Spotify truly is something interesting I clicked shuffle play on this rock band I like

Instead it started fucking playing one of the suggested tracks. It was a fucking Ariana Grande song

The band I wanted to listen to is completely underground and not mainstream at all. How ariana grande is in any way similar to them is strange to me
