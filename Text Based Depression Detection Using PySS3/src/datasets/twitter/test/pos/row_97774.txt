Tired of boring, normal religion? Introducing cabbageism! What is cabbageism, I hear you say? Cabbageism is a religion which revolves around the Cabbage Merchant from Avatar: The last Airbender. We gather every Tuesday, and shove one cabbage down our throat, and one up our ass, for balance of course. Cabbage Merchant is our God, and the creator of the glorious religion and subreddit is our Pope. Or Dalai Llama. Or whatever. The guy who made the subreddit has three accounts, and I have no clue which one actually has the pope power, but rest assured he will enforce the will of the Glorious, beautiful Cabbage Merchant. Any one who insults Cabbage Man will be met with an IMMEDIATE and permanent ban. We also need the numbers on the back of your parents credit cards. We just do. So, come on down, and give up your soul, and join r/cabbage_man
