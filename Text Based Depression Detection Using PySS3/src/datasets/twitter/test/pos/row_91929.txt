What should I buy/save up for? I have Â£300, black Friday is in 47 days, by that time I wouldve saved up another Â£54. I was planning on saving for a pc, but I realised after awhile that it's pretty expensive and it's not gonna happen.


Should I just save up and wait for something to come up that I like so I can get it? Or should I just spend it on stuff I like on black Friday?
