I'm starting to dominate my mobile game's hardest level Title

The game itself is named Dancing Line and the level is named The Racing

[here is it](https://youtu.be/Q5VvAiu6K84)

It's very stressful and you need pixelpoint accuracy. And you can't know if you're close to the hitbox because you are between 2 cars almost the whole thing

Everyone calls this level hell
