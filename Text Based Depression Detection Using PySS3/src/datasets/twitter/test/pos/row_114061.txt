Am I the only one who thinks the office is overrated? Like itâ€™s alright but itâ€™s not spectacular like itâ€™s made out to be. My friends said that I need to watch the hole series to get the humor and that watching individual episodes with them doesnâ€™t get me the full enjoyment. That would make the show worse if I have to watch every episode once to get the humor when I watch it again. That makes it too much effort for not enough pleasure. Was the origination if thatâ€™s what she said jokes? I really donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t really like how itâ€™s worshipped even though it doesnâ€™t even have a story. Itâ€™s like Napoleon dynamite, a sequence of events and stupid humor most of the time.
