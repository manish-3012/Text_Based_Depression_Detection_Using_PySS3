i cant do anything cause of school iâ€™m not allowed to dye my hair, iâ€™m not allowed piercings, iâ€™m not allowed jewellery and i have to wear a uniform. my mum wonâ€™t let me just go against the rules and dye my hair or get a piercing and itâ€™s pissing me off. i just wanna look the way i wanna look. she said iâ€™m only allowed to dye my hair in a holiday as long as it washes out before i got to school. iâ€™m so tired of this man
