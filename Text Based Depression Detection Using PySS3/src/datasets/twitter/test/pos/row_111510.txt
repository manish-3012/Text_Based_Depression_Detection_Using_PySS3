Some cultural appropriation and Halloween costume advice? For starters, let me say that Iâ€™m a fully Hispanic teenage girl, and my white boyfriend and I are Halloween fanatics. My boyfriend is also a huge geek, which led to him deciding on a Batman costume. However, heâ€™s gained inspiration from a few action figures and would like to incorporate Day of the Dead sugar skull face paint. Iâ€™m personally not offended by him wanting to do that and would love to help him out, but would totally understand if others would see it as cultural appropriation. 
Iâ€™ve read numerous articles about this because I was unsure, and the responses are all pretty mixed. This is also my first time having to personally deal with a situation like this. To my fellow Hispanics, should I tell him that thatâ€™s a bad idea?
