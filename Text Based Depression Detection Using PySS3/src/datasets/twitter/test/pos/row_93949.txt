How do you guys endure boring classes? I don't mind going to school, I actually prefer it to sitting around all day at home, but 80% of my classes is just the teacher repeating stuff from previous periods, as well as rants. I thus get to work like 15 minutes per class, while I sit and listen for around 45 minutes. What would you do in class while having nothing to do? Slowly getting tired of being stuck there while I could do something else, more productive maybe.
