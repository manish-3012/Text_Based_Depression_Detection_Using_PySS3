Uhh friend's bday is coming up next week and I wanted to gather like a bunch of birthday messages/pictures for her and combine them all in this  artsy gift idea thing.

This might be kind of a weird request but if anyone has a spare second to just scribble a message down on paper (like a "Happy 17th EM!" or something haha) and DM me a picture, it would be really cool! Fanciness and artsy-ness are a plus, but literally anything would be appreciated sooo much!
