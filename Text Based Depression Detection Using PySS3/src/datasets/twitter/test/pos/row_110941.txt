The lgtbq is bad and contradicts itself Now hear me out before you hate me. A bisexual girl made a video saying she was going to be conservative instead of democratic and within a few days she got nothing but hate from the lgtbq and the only support she got was from conservatives and her non lgtbq friends. Now you may be prepering your hate comment on how I "should not compare a whole community to a few".. this was not just a few tiny people hating her. 1K+ lgtbq members bashing her in her comments for being conservative. Soon videos of full hatred towards her by lgtbq people. And now you must think "it could've been anither reason you don't know everything" if I didn't say before people from the lgtbq and a bunch of comments said "we don't want her conservative ass" and a bunch of stuff hows shes a "traitor" and that bs. Then she made her last video. She got bullied to the point she broke down. Now I know some people in the lgtbq arent as stupid as the idiots who blatantly hate her but as acab says "if you support cops you support a corrupted system" so in that logic if you support lgtbq you support the idiots who harassed someone for the lone fact of their ideology.
