How 2020 ruined me Felt like reflecting on the past year so here's a list nobody asked for about the ways 2020 has bitten me in the ass: 

~Overall less enjoyable school life that still hasn't gotten better 

~My first &amp; only girlfriend left me and it now feels awkward to talk to her 

~Covid-19 causes me to get laid off from work in March with still zero sign of me getting back in (even though I'm in a small town that was at 0 cases within 90km for the longest time) 

~Nobody in the area is fucking hiring 

~Dad walked out of his job due to anger with his boss, now with his new job we can't afford the house and need to move out of town 

~People were (and still are) so goddamn persistent that Covid is a hoax that cases in the area skyrocket 

~Tried to start Twitch stream but my computer can barely run Task Manager let alone OBS 

~Computer mouse? More like fucking broken lmao get rekt 

~Seemingly everything I looked forward to either got cancelled, ruined, or was just a complete letdown 

~Was recovering from diagnosed Major Depression. Keyword; 'Was' 

~The reputations of some of my favourite YouTubers get fucked by grooming accusations 

~Cancel Culture makes me want to knock someone in the head daily 

~Got glasses, first thing I was told is that I look like an impersonator of Dwight from The Office 

~Grades start to get harder to manage 

~My social life starts to struggle, and I always have less energy to see anyone 

~The girl who kept trying to manipulate me into a relationship attempted to manipulate me more and more often until I had to cut her out completely 

~Graduation in half a year and I still have no plans, nor do I feel ready to fend for myself 

~Enthusiasm? What enthusiasm? That dissapeared at the beginning of the year 

~Truck insurance company unfairly bounced my bank account 2 times in a month, costing me $90 in overdraft fees 

~Truck insurance also went up, despite my record being clean and promises it would go down. What the fuck? 

~My trust gets majorly betrayed by friends in the most heartbreaking way possible 

~Ace + Heteroromantic + Fetishism = CONFUSING MESS OF FEELINGS 

~The aggressive/crybaby nature of the internet (cough cough Twitter) caused me to close myself to any political conversation with anyone and everyone 

~Starting to question at what point alter-ego turns into false personality 

~School's IT teacher gave me a free computer without the hard drive, just for a 'friend' to tell me it's 13 years old and more useless than the one I already have 

~Sparked interest in Initial D, now I talk too much about the Toyota Sprinter AE86 Trueno and Eurobeat 

~Trying my hardest to work up approx $1,150 for parts for a new PC before May which likely won't happen 

~My closest two friends for years started dating and later decided to cut me off for things I didn't know I was doing, causing me to look for counseling 

~Was going to be featured as the voice actor for the 2nd main character in a friend's indie game, later to find out that wasn't happening due to the previous reason 

~Why do people suck to talk to in general now? 

~And to top it all off the last time I drove my truck in December a rock put a fucking chip in my windshield



Anyway how you guys doin? :-)
