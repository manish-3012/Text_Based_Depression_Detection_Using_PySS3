How do i get my friend to open up? So I (15f) have this friend (15m) who is quite emotionally constipated due to being friends with exclusively boys his whole life (the kind of boys who don't talk)

The thing is, I'm kind of worried about him. It's nothing specific really just little things like for example, one of my other friends has a crush on him so she gave him a note telling him. It's been 4 days and he hasn't said anything to her about it, at this point it's clearly a no but he refuses to talk to her even when she asked him outright when they were alone.

I've tried to talk to him but it doesn't really work,his conversations are just so surface level. I really want to help him and give him somewhere to talk about his emotions and stuff, any advice?
