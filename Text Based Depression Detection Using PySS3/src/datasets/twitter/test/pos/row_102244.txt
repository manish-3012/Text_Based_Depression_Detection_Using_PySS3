How tf did this happen So this just happened. I was in the kitchen with my brother and he told me his friend got a core i9 and a beamer(projector) for his birthday. I don't know why but when I walked in the hall I repeatedly yelled "beamer" for fun I guess. My dad who is in ANOTHER room screams angrily "Did you just call me beamer?" bruh what?! I told him that I didn't yell it to anyone specifically. Then he said that if it wasn't directed at him he didn't want to hear it. BRUH, DID YOU SERIOUSLY GET ANGRY AT ME FOR YELLING FREAKING "BEAMER"
