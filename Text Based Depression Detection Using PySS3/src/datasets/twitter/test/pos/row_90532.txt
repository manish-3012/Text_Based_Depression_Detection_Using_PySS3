â€œGuyâ€™s canâ€™t hold a conversation for shitâ€ alright, hereâ€™s my entire summarization of the entire fucking history of China; There is so much more to it than this, this is minuscule in comparison to how much I could talk about it in person.

So it started with the Qin Dynasty. Qin Shi Huang (the Emperor of said Dynasty from 221-210BC) didnâ€™t do too much, and his dynasty only lasted around 11 years, yet it is still widely regarded as the first Chinese dynasty. A funny story actually is that Emperor Qin thought that mercury would give him immortality, so he drank it. This quickly drove him into insanity and later death.

The Han Dynasty quickly took over after the Qin. This Dynasty lasted for much longer (206BC to 220 AD) and is regarded by historians as the most influential Dynasty in Chinese history. Literature, Architecture, and other innovations flourished under this dynasty. This is also when Confucianism was established, which, even almost 2000 years later is the way most Chinese live. Confucianism establishes the way Chinese were expected to act, treat their elders, work for their community, etc. confucianism is tightly bound by honor, so honor is very important in their culture, especially honor to their parents.

Iâ€™m skipping a few dynasties here (Xin Jin and Sui)

The Tang dynasty was also very influential over Chinese history. It is considered a Golden age of Chinese arts and culture. The Tang Dynasty quickly established Chinaâ€™s culture and arts across most of Asia, and made them much more known. Also during this time Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty took land in Mongolia and was Khan of that region. Buddhism was a large factor of this dynasty. Itâ€™s one of the first times where mass outside influence affected the people in China. Buddhism quickly grew, yet it was still relatively small and without major influence over most of China.

Now we get into the Song Dynasty, my personal favorite. (960 - 1280AD) The song Dynasty is probably when China was at the absolute height of economic and technological growth and development. Here we see things like Gunpowder, Fine China (porcelain pots and plates) paper money, and 

#the compass

These inventions would change the world, especially the compass. The compass revolutionized navigation, and years later would open us to see things like the great Indian Ocean trade. The number of things the Song Dynasty gave the world during itâ€™s time is insane.

The Yuan Dynasty was a dark point in Chinaâ€™s history. This is when Genghis Khanâ€™s army was at itâ€™s height. This dynasty ruled from around 1270-1368. The Mongols actually did not interfere a huge amount with Chinese culture, yet still caused it to lose itâ€™s touch, yet were still extremely brutish and violent. The Mongols promoted trade among few other things greatly, which is most of what this dynasty is know for. The Mongols are famous for rebuilding the silk roads.

The Ming Dynasty. The Ming Dynasty (1368- 1644 AD) heavily focused on returning into China culture which had been forgotten during the Yuan Dynasty. This was multiple Generations after the last people of the true Previous Chinese Dynasty died( During the Song). Even after the mess that was the Yuan Dynasty, Chinese culture and economics once again started to flourish, and in this time you will see great fleets like that of Zheng Heâ€™s Treasure fleet sailing insane distances, even far enough for Zheng He to bring the Emperor a Giraffe. The main thing to take away from this dynasty is that it was very traditionalist.

The Qing Dynasty. The Qing dynasty was a huge change and kind of led to a large downfall. This Covers 1626-1911 so iâ€™ll try my best to summarize it. China still kept itâ€™s traditional values, yet isolated immensely. This means it shut off trade with all other countries practically, and focused on being strong in itself. This Dynasty believed that China was better, and didnâ€™t need any outside influence. This isolation led to a downfall during the industrial revolution. With the Industrial revolution starting in the late 1700â€™s, many European countries came out as superpowers, and it wouldnâ€™t be long before China saw for themselves. Certain European Countries, Britain Especially, started feuding with China. There were rhe Opium wars, which pretty much toppled a large portion of Chinese economic power and authority. With Britain having influence over certain parts of China now, this led to a great decrease in Chinese Economics, Culture, power, and influence. Many European countries then formed spheres of influence over parts of China, practically crippling it. 

This pretty much ruined the Qing Dynasty, which fell just before ww1.

Thatâ€™s how far iâ€™m willing to go for now.
