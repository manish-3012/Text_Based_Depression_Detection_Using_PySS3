how much chores is too much? first of all please bare with any mistakes I make. 

I am 17 female and live with my parents and my siblings (14f and 9m). Until last year I had to clear the table and wash the dishes every night after dinner, it wasn't so great but I can do that since it's not much. 

Now that I turned 17 my parents decided that I have too many privileges (going out, sleeping at my boyfriend's, seeing friends) so they gave me more chores to do. Now I have to wash the dishes, clear the table, do the laundry, hang the laundry, put away the laundry and make dinner once a week, everything related to the laundry is on Tuesdays and weekends (Tuesday bedsheets and weekends clothes). I personally think that it's too much since I also have to take care of my brother on the Wednesday afternoons, have to help him with his homework and have my homework done everyday. I'm having a mental breakdown because I already know it's too much when school only starts tomorrow! I don't know when I'll have time to see my boyfriend and friends with all this and I feel really sad and mad about it.

am I overreacting? is it normal to have that many chores?
