Guys, I have a problem Okay so I met someone on an app to talk with foreign native people. The app said that she knows english, which I want to learn, and persian which I find interesting. We start to talk for a bit and soon enough we can't stop, I even stay up to 2am to talk to her. It's kinda amazing, we like the same thing (litterature, foreign cultures, languages, even cooking), she is so sweet and kind, I think I developped a crush on her, tho I'm very unsure about that, we live so far away, I don't even know if we will ever meet irl, I'm both real happy and sad.
