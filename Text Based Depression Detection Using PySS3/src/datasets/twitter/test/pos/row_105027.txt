Yeah I delete comments and posts Iâ€™m ashamed of, maybe Iâ€™m a pussy I keep seeing people saying that â€œI stand by what I said so I wonâ€™t delete anything I say even if it got downvoted a lot.â€ I feel like if my comment gets downvoted to a certain level, it means that it wasnâ€™t okay. I mean if youâ€™re just on some political sub where itâ€™s just a huge echo chamber where people donâ€™t a accept contradicting thoughts then maybe youâ€™re okay. I think itâ€™s completely okay to delete a post or you donâ€™t like anymore bc I donâ€™t see why itâ€™s necessary to just stick with what you used to think
