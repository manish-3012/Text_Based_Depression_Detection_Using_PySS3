Iâ€™ve always been a painfully dry texter I literally have no idea how to text. Essay writing? Piece of cake. Physics thing? Easy. Texting like a normal person? Nope.

This is actually starting to become a problem. For example, whenever I try to talk to a girl I like and know in real life (I canâ€™t always talk to them due to Covid) I was come off like a freaking robot. Itâ€™s actually gotten to the point where people comment on it. Due to this, Iâ€™m never really sure whether to just respond with a one-word answer or to go into a full on paragraph.

An example is that I was such a bad texted that one of my friends only talks to me in real life or by calling me on discord. 

Yeah, Iâ€™m that bad... So, any advice on how not to text like a robot on tinder?
