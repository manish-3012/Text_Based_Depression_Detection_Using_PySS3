My mom fought with my boyfriends mom and refuses to let me see him ever again. So what happened yesterday (yes during COVID, we both quarantined in advance) so me and my boyfriend of three years were studying for our geometry test on Tuesday (today).  And we were just straight vibing and my mom storms in and goes "Mercy we're leaving, pack your stuff" and I was confused and she dragged me into the hallway and goes "She was talking about politics" For a note, my mom is hardcore antivaxx conspiracy theory Trump, BLM are terroists yada yada. And his mom is very Anti-Trump, BLM, LGBT rights are human rights. I believe in the latter and so does my boyfriend, my mom doesn't know that though, she thinks I support Trump as well. So my mom drags me out after I had packed and we go home. I'm pissed because I needed help for geometry and it just isn't the same in person, also the fact that I had quarantined for 2 weeks to be over for 20 minutes. Then his mom calls and my moms flipping out at her when she's trying to deescalate and my mom decides to cut off all connection with his family. She said we could still talk and stuff but we aren't allowed to see eachother, through facetime or in person. I'm in so much pain and this is killing me. I love his family and him. I wish my mom wasn't such a bitch. She's been abusive for years and its terrible. They were my only escape. Now with covid I barely got to see them and i've been stuck with just my mom and now I have nobody and nowhere to go. I'm heartbroken. I'm also moving states in December so I won't see him for 3 years.
