Affording back to school clothing!! Even though school is mostly online I still wanted to revamp my wardrobe for back to school but i didnâ€™t feel like dropping $300 but i did some research and found this thing call fetch rewards and signed up with the promo code BGW56 and I was able to get free gift cards to pay for online shopping. it really helped me so i thought i would share it on here especially considering some peopleâ€™s families are going through a hard time with the pandemic hope this can help!!
