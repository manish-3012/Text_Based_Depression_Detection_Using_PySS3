Highschool American football players, i have a question. What position would be best suited for me... im going into freshman year and am considering playing as i love the sport. I am on the tall amd skinny side (not to skinny but skinnier than the average person) I can run fast at short distances but my endurance could use a little work. Im not sure what my 40-dash time is. I have good hand-eye coordination, I have zero expierence playing football on a competetive level, but havs played lots with buddies outside of school and i have a good understanding of the game.
