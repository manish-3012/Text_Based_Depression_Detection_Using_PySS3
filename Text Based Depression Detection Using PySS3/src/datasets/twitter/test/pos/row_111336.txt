Iâ€™m Thinking About Getting Braces // sharing Thoughts / Experiences with them encouraged Hey, Iâ€™m thinking about getting braces. My teeth arenâ€™t wonky or anything, theyâ€™re fairly straight, but there are gaps between around 6-8 of my teeth on the top row. What is braces like during / after? Iâ€™m fairly self conscious about my teeth because of the gaps now, and want them gone. Thoughts?
