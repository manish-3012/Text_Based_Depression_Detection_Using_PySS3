so for some reason, for the google meet we have to do today, I can't sign in with my school account so I'm doing it with my personal account, and now I'm afraid my English teacher will see my cringey pfp (it's the same one I use for reddit, Countryhumans America with sunglasses saying 'gay man')

I guess whoever set it up was incompetent, I'm still waiting to be let in
