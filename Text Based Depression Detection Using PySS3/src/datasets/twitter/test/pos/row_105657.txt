That time i got a compliment  It was 2 years ago when i was wearing a hoodie that i though i didn't like it was blue and it had a weird patter of dark blue and light blue combined when i went to school there was this girl who i kinda liked and she looked at me and said "nice hoodie you look cool in it" and that was the last compliment i have gotten since. i still remember that moment and when i remember about it i smile.
