Feels good to play Minecraft again after 4 years 
It feels good to go back to playing a classic. Years ago, (most likely 2014) I first started playing it when my dad decided to abruptly buy an Xbox 360 for my brother and he got Minecraft too. However, I spent most of the time on it.  I spent most of my days in the ONE bedroom our apartment had with a TV in the only bedroom playing it for hours. I don't recall much, but at some point I built an entire fortress on one edge  of the mountains on the map using stone bricks. I wish I could show it, but I'm afraid there was no option for me at the same to save it for future reference...

I had it on my phone in 2014 too at 11,  I got it because I went to someone's house and they somehow was able to download it on my phone (I don't know how, he didn't even waste any money) but the problem was that I couldn't do any updates. In 2015, someone bought a iTunes gift card to my 12th birthday party and I used that money to ACTUALLY buy the game on my own Apple ID and GTA San Andreas too. It was GOOD. However, I had no phone storage on a 16GB phone, so that was painful. I stopped playing somewhere in 2016, most likely because I lost my phone and I switched to using a Samsung phone, plus my brother was using that iPad I had used previously. I completely stopped in early 2017 when, I got a PS4 (Was for my brother, but once again I used it the most) and I just started playing GTA 5 instead. 

I'm surprised I even was able to do what I could with the backstory. Quarantine has broken me, so I decided JUST an hour ago  to use my new iPhone SE (a lot more storage) to download it and play it again. Hopefully that'll get me through quarantine.
