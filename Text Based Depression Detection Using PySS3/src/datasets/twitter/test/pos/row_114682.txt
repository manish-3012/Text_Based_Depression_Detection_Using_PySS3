I'm so confused right now So basically during class our teacher made us do a Google forms escape room with some weird theme and I have no fucking idea what happened. they were talking about houses and stuff. Am I just stupid or is this shit like something everybody knows about because a lot of people seemed to understand the terms they were using and I was just sitting there like "Yo what the fuck is a flufflepuff"
