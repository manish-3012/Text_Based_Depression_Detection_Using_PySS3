Okay so no one who knows me is using reddit so I have to confess: I went shopping with the popular girl and now I know everyones secret and idk I just have to let it out. We're not super close, but I have a trait (idk which) which makes most people just... tell me all their secrets, idk why but they just do and I listen.

Anyway I(14F) learned about her family problems, which girls and even guys have bulimia and anorexia, about how a girl who is considered the smartest in class (also 14) wants so much male attention she sends out pics of her pee hole and all the pressure she's under and so many issues with her mother. Idk, It was a lot and I'm not telling this to anyone irl so I might as well let it all out here.
