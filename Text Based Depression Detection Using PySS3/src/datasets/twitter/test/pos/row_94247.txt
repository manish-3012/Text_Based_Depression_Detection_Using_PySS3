Guess who just got back with their ex for the third time Me and my gf were dating for 3.5 months, then she broke up with me bc she was like super stressed abt school and stuff and all that. Then we were talking again this summer and decided to try again and then she ended in a week saying that she wanted more time so I kept preserving and now iâ€™m back with her a third time and itâ€™s going great. Boys, all you gotta do is show her that you love her and that she means everything to you still after everything and just hang in there and preserve and hopefully everything works out in the end.
