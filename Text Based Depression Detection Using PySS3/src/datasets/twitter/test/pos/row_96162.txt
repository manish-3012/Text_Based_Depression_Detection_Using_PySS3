i need relationship advice  \*for some context before i begin i should mention that my mom just gave birth to my beautiful babysitter that just turned 1 month old. she has no immune system. because of the pregnancy being at the same time as the pandemic quarantine has been so so hard on us. i haven't seen him in 6 months. and because my mom has ocd she won't even let me go in our backyard. i haven't left my neighborhood in 6 months. it's been incredibly hard.\*

last night we were on the phone after not getting to talk much that day. i start asking him about his day and out of nowhere he just starts going off about how corona is ''just the flu'' and that if my sister got it that it wouldn't be that big of a deal... even if my sister got a fever because of how weak her immune system they would have to do a spinal tap on her. for those of you who don't know what a spinal tap is thats where they stick a big needle all the way through your skin and into your spine. it is extremely painful and traumatic for even adults. 

this pandemic has taken 6 months of my life that i can never get back. but the only thing that is keeping me going is knowing that me sacrificing my mental health and isolating for 6 months is at least protecting my sister. and he really has the nerve to say that i am doing all of this for nothing. he kept yelling at me that i ''don't understand the human immune system''. he REALLY has the nerve to say that when he can't even spell some 4 letter words and he learned anatomy from an anime.... 

he even makes his mom call my mom every time they go out to try to ''convince her'' to let me go out with them. my family is doing exactly what the doctors told us to do and they can't respect that in the slightest. 

his family gave up on quarantine after 1 month. he goes wherever he wants and sees whoever he wants. and he rubs his freedom in my face. he has asthma so he still has a big risk for the virus but he doesn't care. he doesn't care who he would infect if he gets it. when i bring this up to him he just says ''yeah i like to live on the edge'' and laughs. ITS NOT A JOKE   

i have been nothing but kind to him. i watch him streaming video games for hours even though i hate it. i always give him what he wants. i always ask him about his day. i do what he wants me to. i show him my body even if i don't want to. i stay in the call with him even when he's literally ignoring me. i try everyday to be the best i can be for him. and he just picks me apart

even if he is right and it has no risk. i cannot control whether i leave my house or not. my parents do. bringing up this ''covid is not that bad'' crap is not going to help me in the slightest. it just made me feel even worse. why would you do that to someone you love?
