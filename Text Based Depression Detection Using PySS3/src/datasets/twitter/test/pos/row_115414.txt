A random vent Yknow when like...u just feel sad for some reason. Like just for no reason at all. Like, I have reasons to be sad and I've been sad and depressed about this one thing but like...for some reason tonight it's really bothering me and I'm just like extra depressed despite the fact that literally nothing has happened or changed. Idk...why the hell do I get like this sometimes...
