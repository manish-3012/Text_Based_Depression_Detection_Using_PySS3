Hereâ€™s a story of my middle school crush When I was in 7th grade I was kinda ehhh. I didnâ€™t look good, but I still had the same personality! I had a friend at the time who was WAY prettier than me and when I told her about my crush she asked him out and they started dating. Needless to say, she wasnâ€™t my friend anymore. They broke up and then he goes â€œI heard you had a crush on me.â€ And then my ex friends friend was like â€œyeah why donâ€™t you ask her out.â€ And then they both laughed so hard they were literally crying. I was extremely embarrassed. Well now letâ€™s fast forward to high school. I had some what of a glow up, but I was still the same me as ever. I was smarter too! I ended up having the same math class as him and he didnâ€™t understand what was going on so I had to help him. Enough being said, he was like â€œI shouldâ€™ve asked you out in middle school. I like you OP.â€ And then I kindly rejected him. I think he still likes me till this day, but Iâ€™ll never forget how much of a fool he made of me.
