Im not crying you are Well, today is officially the end of my hard classes. I started the term thinking I was not  going to do well but wow! I am going to finish off half of the year with a 4.0 GPA. I am going to miss English, band, math and yes even physics. Next month Im starting my easy classes, taking my PSAT, and getting my drivers permit!! I know youâ€™ll never read this but thank you to all my teachers for continuing to teach us and just being there to help us, I want to thank you for the passion youâ€™ve put in to to teaching us despite us still being in a pandemic.
