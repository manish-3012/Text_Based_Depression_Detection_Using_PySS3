Teachers logic .... (My maths teacher) "I already told you that I will not tell you again, study yourself." Or "I already told that question, i will not repeat it again, can't you listen?"

So by this logic, a policeman would say, "I already caught that theif, i will not catch it again, so do it yourself."

A firefighter would say, "I already put the fire off in that place years ago, i will not do that again. So take care of it yourself."

And doctor would say, "I already treated you, why would you come back? Go, i will not do it again."

Sometimes I can't even believe why they are even taking money for.
