Iâ€™m bored so hereâ€™s a story â€œHello, is anyone there?â€ I called out as my legs sank into the ground.

â€œThis canâ€™t be the end!â€ I shouted as I reached out to grab the air.

I felt a push on my back, it was someone kicking me down.

â€œPathetic. Thatâ€™s all you are.â€ A little boy said as he kept shoving his foot into my back.

I grasped for a final breath, there was a flash of bright light, and I open my eyes to see me floating in the sky surrounded by light and clouds.

â€œOh, hello youâ€™re dead.â€ An angelic voice said as it looked up from a desk.

â€œWhere am I?â€ I asked as I found myself in a chair.

â€œOh, well like I said. Youâ€™re dead.â€ The voice said as it pulled out a clip board.

Itâ€™s form was non existent and it shined as if the sun exploded.

â€œSo, where shall we begin.â€ The voice said as it started to take form of a business man.

â€œUhm, what do you mean? Who are you?â€ I asked as I scooted my chair in.

â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter, but where shall we start?â€ The voice said as it clicked a pen.

â€œUhm, what?â€ I asked as looked at it confused.

â€œWhere shall we start in your life?â€ The voice said as a screen came up showing my entire life.

â€œHow about my birth?â€ I asked as scratched my head.

â€œOoh sorry, but we already did that.â€ The voice said as it scribbled something down.

â€œWhat do you mean?â€ I asked even more confused.

â€œOh right, weâ€™ve done this an infinite number of times, listing every good, bad, and mediocre thing youâ€™ve done.â€ The voice said as it put the pen down.

â€œSo, what is this?â€ I asked as I looked at the pen.

â€œThis my friend, is purgatory.â€ The voice said as it adjusted their tie.
