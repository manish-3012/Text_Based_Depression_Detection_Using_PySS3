Am I being a idiot? I'm scared to fall in love again.

There are 2 people who I really loved and both got hurt(not taking about the breakup but that's also bad)

I'm scared of hurting another person just because I want to be happy.

Maybe I'm cursed and I should accept that about myself.

I don't want to be selfish and hurt someone for my happiness that's just wrong of me and messed-up.

I can still live a happy life whit friends and meaningless one night stands but...

I want have love I want to do all the cringy shit couples do but I don't want to hurt anyone else.

So am I being a idiot?
