Some of my close friends &amp; family members don't give a shit about racism, lgbtqia+ phobia, feminism &amp; the hole pandemic. I don't even know what to do/say because I've known my friends for nearly 7 years &amp; I didn't know they think like that. They say homophobic/ transphobic things like it was nothing and when I say something about it they're like "it's not a big deal" but it is. 
For example, one of my friends, told me that someone was a trans woman (I don't even think I should know it, but it's too late now) and she said she (the trans woman) wanted to "become a real woman" and she kept misgendering her, she kept saying "he" even tho she says she's a woman and I told her she should try to say "she" &amp; she told me that it doesn't matter because "He still has his man body". 
The same friend said "Aren't you a little bit feminist?" like it was a bad thing. I said "Yeah, wtf? Of course I am", then I had to explain to her that it's not a bad thing &amp; that I think everyone should be treated equally no matter gender, sexual orientation, skin color, religion, etc. 

My family does the same shit, they say racist/transphobic things and when I say something about it they're like "it's not racist/transphobic, it's just like that" and it makes me so angry. Every time it ends up with a big discussion where they try to prove they're right but I know I (mostly) am. 

I posted this here because I needed to tell this to someone, even if it doesn't change anything it feels better now that I talked about it
