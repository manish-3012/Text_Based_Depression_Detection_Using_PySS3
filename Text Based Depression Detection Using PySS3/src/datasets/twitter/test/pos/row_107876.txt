Fellow redditors, I need your help (15M) So hear me out

I'm into this girl, and it's great cause we're both great friends and we do flirty stuff a lot... but here's the thing. I can see us in a relationship, but nothing actually romantic happens... so here's what you guys gotta tell me.

Where do I start with this? I don't wanna do anything big, I wanna take it slow because I'm very inexpirienced. Anything I should say or do? 

Thanks fellow virgins
