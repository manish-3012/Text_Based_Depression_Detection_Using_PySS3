my dog is going to pass away soon alright so first off my dog is a Labrador retriever which, according to google, lives about 10-12 years 
my dog is about 15 human years this year. He had an accident last year where he was scratching himself and accidentally tore a blood vessel. The vet managed to fix it but itâ€™s still a worry if he scratches there again. I donâ€™t know how long he has but Iâ€™m worrying about him
