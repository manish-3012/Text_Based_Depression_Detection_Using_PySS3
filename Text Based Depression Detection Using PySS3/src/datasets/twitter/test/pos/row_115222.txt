Iâ€™m bored. Made some rhythms More rhythms because Iâ€™m bored

Why am I forced to go though this pain? Shit makes me want to put a bullet through my brain.

Depression attacking me from all sides like a horde, but I make shitty rhythms like this because Iâ€™m bored.

My will to die is big and it keeps getting bigger. Thatâ€™s because Depression has me being my own killer.

Everything I do is a miss. Why canâ€™t I be normal and do good? I canâ€™t live like this.

I guess this is my final goodbye. Iâ€™m going to follow the voices and die.
