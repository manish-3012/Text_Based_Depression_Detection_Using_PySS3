finally able to block on my ex boyfriend After like twoish months I am finally able to block my ex boyfriend on all social media and on texting messages and I am now feeling so much better and feeling like myself again, I am so glad I can now block him without feeling guilty or anything. I am happy now that I blocked him, now time to move on with my life and get things going with my life. I was able to bike riding with myself for the first time since my ex ended the relationship.
