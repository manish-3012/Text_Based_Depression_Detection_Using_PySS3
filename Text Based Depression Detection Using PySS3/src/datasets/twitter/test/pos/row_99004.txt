Haven't done this bad in school in a while. So I am not a bad student, neither am I a A+ student. I try to take my work seriously and at the very least put in some effort. 

   Though recently I have been having health issues regarding my intestines(had to go to the ER and spent 3 days in a hospital due to inflammation). On top of missing a whole week of school due to my health and already being behind when said event took place- it really made catching up afterwards difficult. 

I somehow managed to not completely fail all my classes as I have D's is all of them im pretty sure. 

Anyways, this past six weeks has been really tough and now I am going to have to work extra hard so I can at least have a decent average for the first semester. 

I'm done complaining now :).
