I need help with my crush cuz I have no idea what to do. So, this year I switched schools and now I'm in a completely new class. Last week I noticed I have a fat crush on a girl of my new class.(No, there's no Iockdown in my country.) Now I don't know a lot about her. Ithink she's a bit shy, but not too much. Also I should say that I'm in some kind of group with her. (Once in a week these groups meet up to talk a bit and stuff. It's hard to explain since this is a thing only my school does. Btw these groups consist of four people.) 

I know this is a bit early, school started only five weeks ago, but still. Now my question is: What can i do to get to know her better and when should I make the first move? What are things I shouldn't do? 

(Forgot to mention it but I think she lives on the other side of the city which is another problem.)
