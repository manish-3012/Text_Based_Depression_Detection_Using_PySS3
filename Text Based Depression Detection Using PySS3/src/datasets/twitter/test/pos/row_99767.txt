How do you actually do Fellow Teens? So like I actually turned 13 today, I've been on Reddit for just a year like pretending to 13. So how do you do fellow teens? I got some cool stuff for my B-day like a telescope, an RGB mouse, and a cool ass laptop. I'm doing great rn.  I thought I would post this  lmao.
