Cannon horses 
So I was wondering how we were supposed to defend ourselves when the civil War2.0 comes around and I had an idea. Basically, under US gun laws black power rifles are not considered firearms and not federally regulated by the US government meaning that a teenager can legally own one. You know what is also black powder? Cannons. So what we do is get like 2-4 horses from the horse girls and make essentially a carriage with a cannon sticking out. That way when the come down the streets with Tanks and military vehicles we can pull up with our cannons and blast em.

What do you guys think?
