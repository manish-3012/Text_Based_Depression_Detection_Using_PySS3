Day two of posting classical music for my fellow teenagers For the new year I chose to post one piece of classical music each day. Yesterday i brought you some Rachmaninov, today let it be Beethoven.

The piece i chose today is [the third movement of the 17th sonata of Beethoven (called "tempest")](https://youtu.be/hKkR4YFtyJk). I thought this one should summarize the tempestuous airs of the past year and the uncertain time in which we wail. 
I must say i really appreciate this piece, as it brings this mixture of sadness, unrest and slow acceptance.

I wish you all a great day and see you tomorrow!
