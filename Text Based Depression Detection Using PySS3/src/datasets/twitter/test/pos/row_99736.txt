I gotta be better day 1 I have not been eating well (or at least not enough exercise to counter it) and my parent sand I had a long talk about self improvement and things Iâ€™ve been doing wrong, after a good long cry, I decided that things needed to change. So Iâ€™m posting this on here to help with the accountability of my actions(even though literally no-one will follow up) this is just for me, I got a calorie tracker and my health app open and my goal is to lose 20 pounds by the end of this year. Today I still had over 300 calories left in my budget and Iâ€™m only a little hungry so see you guys tmrw if I remember.
