Im bored, any advices? I kinda feel like I want 2/3h break from technology so I dont wanna use my phone or pc. I just sometimes want a short break for w/e reason. But I'm extremely bored at the same time. Mostly I just look out of the window and admire the nature because I live like next to the park so I have view on trees. Anything else I can do irl rn?

Btw its raining so I dont wanna go outside.
