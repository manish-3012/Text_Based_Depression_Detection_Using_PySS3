My dad got a girl pregnant, and I'm both worried and excited. I don't live with my dad, because he wasnt able to take care if me, I live with my grandpa. However, I have a very close relationships with my dad and adore him. However, he's not the best person in the world. Hes very aggressive and does a bunch of drugs, and as a result of these things. As a result of him trying to parent me, I have a lot of trust issues and abandonment issues, and I just hope that my little sibling wont have to go through the same thing. My dad also chose a drug enabling girl over me, his own daughter...when I was 10. However, I've always wanted a little sibling and this might be the chance. I just dont know what to think. He's living with his sister, because he can't afford his own place, and I believe that that is where the baby will be raised. I'm hoping that my dad will learn from the mistakes he made with me and will do his best with this child.
