I think I'm about to go through a growth spurt I've been feeling pretty hungry today, and my dad says that I've usually started eating a lot and pudging out right before every time I've had a growth spurt

also I got growing pains in my left thigh

HELL YEAH BABY, I was already 6'1", now I'll look like Lurch from the Addams family. or Paul Bunyan. Or Nancy Archer
