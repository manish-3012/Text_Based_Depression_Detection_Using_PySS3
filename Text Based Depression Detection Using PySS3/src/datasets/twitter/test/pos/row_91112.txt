I just wish I would be ok. Iâ€™m sat here in a bus shelter realising that Iâ€™ll never be okay. I donâ€™t deserve sympathy either. Read my last post and youâ€™ll understand. I donâ€™t deserve to be okay tho tbh. I just wish I was. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any point in battling to be ok. Iâ€™m fucked. Thank you to anyone that tried to help me.
