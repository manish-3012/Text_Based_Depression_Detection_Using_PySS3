Just asked my crush out! Posted this on r/CasualConversation first but it got taken down and here I am. 

So, I started college a few months ago now, obviously online. And well one thing led to another and soon everyone managed to make a friend group almost by chance.

Now, in my main group, there's this girl I really hit it off with, we flirt often and since we live in the same city ended up meeting. About a week ago I realised I have a crush on her. So I thought of what to do, and to make it somewhat memorable I decided to write her a fairly long (e)mail, confessing my feelings. That's just my style I suppose. After spending a couple nights on writing it out, it was finally complete!

Today I finally sent it to her. And well, it's been over three hours since she saw my message telling her about the mail. It's my first asking someone out and I am getting super anxious now. Ahhh! I feel like shouting out loud!
