[serious] there are many freaks running around and taking inappropriate pictures of people. unfortunately my younger sister [12 yo] has been a victim of one of these freaks. me [male] and the rest of my family were all born in saudi arabia and are still living here. help? im writing this instead of my sister so that her identity can be more protected

basically  a freak took some nude pics of my sister \[12 yo\] changing cloths and  from what I can tell, it's in her room. we have walls all around the  property so it must've been hard to climb over, unless the door was or  has been opened for some reason. I know that they cant really blackmail  her and I as she is fine with me dealing with the situation but my  parents are def going to be mad and she's going to get very embarrassed  and upset. I just dont want the images to be leaked on the internet or  my parents seeing them. any advice?
