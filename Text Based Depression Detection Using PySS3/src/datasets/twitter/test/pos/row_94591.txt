The kid who played anakin in the phantom menance got bullied so much for it he went insane n got arrested for beating up his mom The sad thing is that it isnt really his fault, no amount of acting could make george lucas's horrible dialouge sound good. Oh well thats show business for u. Feels like a plotline out of bojack horseman ahahah
