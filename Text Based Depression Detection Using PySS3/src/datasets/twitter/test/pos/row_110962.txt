Hypocrisy at its finest I'm 15m and girls say it's weird when an older guy is looking at their Instagram and commenting like "Wow your sexy".Because the guy commenting is 20 and he's saying a minor is sexy,that sounds pretty weird to me and I would understand if a 15 year old girl also doesn't like it.But if the guy is handsome or looks good they wouldn't care.It just doesn't makes sense to me.And there's this girl in my class and is dating a 21 year old,is that right or wrong?.
