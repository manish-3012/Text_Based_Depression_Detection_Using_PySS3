This sounds bad but hear me out I am a reaallly good liar. I don't think I've ever been caught lying by my expression or my words, if I do get caught its always them getting physical evidence, like an empty worksheet. Idk why I have such a good unintentional poker face. I feel like I sound like a bad person and maybe I am, but I'm just, so good at lying.
