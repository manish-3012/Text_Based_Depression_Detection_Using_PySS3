Thoughts on this phrasing? Really need help My best friend that I kinda like is in a relationship. We were talking about stuff and she used the phrase "he's not cooler than you ðŸ˜ he just has a crush on me and you don't" do you think there's an underlying message there? Or am I reading too far into it
