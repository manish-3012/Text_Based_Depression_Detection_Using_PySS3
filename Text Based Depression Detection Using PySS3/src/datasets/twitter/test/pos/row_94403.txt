**Quantum mechanics** is a fundamental [theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory) in [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) that provides a description of the physical properties of [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature) at the scale of [atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom) and [subatomic particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle). It is the foundation of all quantum physics including [quantum chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry), [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory), [quantum technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_technology), and [quantum information science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information_science).

[Classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics), the description of physics that existed before the [theory of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity) and quantum mechanics, describes many aspects of nature at an ordinary (macroscopic) scale, while quantum mechanics explains the aspects of nature at small (atomic and [subatomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle)) scales, for which classical mechanics is insufficient. Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale.

Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy), [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum), [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum), and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to [discrete values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics) ([quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantization_(physics))), objects have characteristics of both [particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle) and [waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave) ([wave-particle duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave-particle_duality)), and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle)).

Quantum mechanics [arose gradually](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_quantum_mechanics) from theories to explain observations which could not be reconciled with classical physics, such as [Max Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck)'s solution in 1900 to the [black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation) problem, and the correspondence between energy and frequency in [Albert Einstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)'s [1905 paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_papers#Photoelectric_effect) which explained the [photoelectric effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect). These early attempts to understand microscopic phenomena, now known as the "[old quantum theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_quantum_theory)", led to the full development of quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s by [Niels Bohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr), [Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger), [Werner Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg), [Max Born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born) and others. The modern theory is formulated in various [specially developed mathematical formalisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formulations_of_quantum_mechanics). In one of them, a mathematical entity called the [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function) provides information, in the form of [probability amplitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude), about what measurements of a particle's energy, momentum, and other physical properties may yield.

**Overview and fundemental concepts**  


Quantum mechanics allows the calculation of properties and behaviour of physical systems. It is typically applied to microscopic systems: molecules, atoms and sub-atomic particles. It has been demonstrated to hold for complex molecules with thousands of atoms, but its application to human beings raises philosophical problems, such as [Wigner's friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wigner%27s_friend), and its application to the universe as a whole remains speculative. Predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of [accuracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy).[\[note 1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-6)

A fundamental feature of the theory is that it usually cannot predict with certainty what will happen, but only give probabilities. Mathematically, a probability is found by taking the square of the absolute value of a [complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number), known as a probability amplitude. This is known as the [Born rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_rule), named after physicist [Max Born](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Born). For example, a quantum particle like an [electron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron) can be described by a [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function), which associates to each point in space a probability amplitude. Applying the Born rule to these amplitudes gives a [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) for the position that the electron will be found to have when an experiment is performed to measure it. This is the best the theory can do; it cannot say for certain where the electron will be found. The [SchrÃ¶dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) relates the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to one moment of time to the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to another.

One consequence of the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics is a tradeoff in predictability between different measurable quantities. The most famous form of this [uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle) says that no matter how a quantum particle is prepared or how carefully experiments upon it are arranged, it is impossible to have a precise prediction for a measurement of its position and also at the same time for a measurement of its [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum).

Another consequence of the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics is the phenomenon of [quantum interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_interference), which is often illustrated with the [double-slit experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment). In the basic version of this experiment, a [coherent light source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics)), such as a [laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser) beam, illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits, and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate. The wave nature of light causes the light waves passing through the two slits to [interfere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation)), producing bright and dark bands on the screen â€“ a result that would not be expected if light consisted of classical particles. However, the light is always found to be absorbed at the screen at discrete points, as individual particles rather than waves; the interference pattern appears via the varying density of these particle hits on the screen. Furthermore, versions of the experiment that include detectors at the slits find that each detected [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon) passes through one slit (as would a classical particle), and not through both slits (as would a wave). However, [such experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment#Which_way) demonstrate that particles do not form the interference pattern if one detects which slit they pass through. Other atomic-scale entities, such as [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrons), are found to exhibit the same behavior when fired towards a double slit. This behavior is known as [wave-particle duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave-particle_duality).

Another counter-intuitive phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics is [quantum tunnelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling): a particle that goes up against a [potential barrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_barrier) can cross it, even if its kinetic energy is smaller than the maximum of the potential. In classical mechanics this particle would be trapped. Quantum tunnelling has several important consequences, enabling [radioactive decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_decay), [nuclear fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion) in stars, and applications such as [scanning tunnelling microscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_tunnelling_microscopy) and the [tunnel diode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_diode).

When quantum systems interact, the result can be the creation of [quantum entanglement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement): their properties become so intertwined that a description of the whole solely in terms of the individual parts is no longer possible. Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger called entanglement "...*the* characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought". Quantum entanglement enables the counter-intuitive properties of [quantum pseudo-telepathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_pseudo-telepathy), and can be a valuable resource in communication protocols, such as [quantum key distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution) and [superdense coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdense_coding). Contrary to popular misconception, entanglement does not allow sending signals [faster than light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light), as demonstrated by the [no-communication theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-communication_theorem).

Another possibility opened by entanglement is testing for "[hidden variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_variable_theory)", hypothetical properties more fundamental than the quantities addressed in quantum theory itself, knowledge of which would allow more exact predictions than quantum theory can provide. A collection of results, most significantly [Bell's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem), have demonstrated that broad classes of such hidden-variable theories are in fact incompatible with quantum physics. According to Bell's theorem, if nature actually operates in accord with any theory of *local* hidden variables, then the results of a [Bell test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_test_experiments) will be constrained in a particular, quantifiable way. Many Bell tests have been performed, using entangled particles, and they have shown results incompatible with the constraints imposed by local hidden variables.

It is not possible to present these concepts in more than a superficial way without introducing the actual mathematics involved; understanding quantum mechanics requires not only manipulating complex numbers, but also [linear algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra), [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation), [group theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory), and other more advanced subjects.[\[note 2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics#cite_note-18) Accordingly, this article will present a mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics and survey its application to some useful and oft-studied examples.
