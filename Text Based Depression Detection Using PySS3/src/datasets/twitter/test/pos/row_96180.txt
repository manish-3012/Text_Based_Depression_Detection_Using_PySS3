I have been in a relationship with a girl, but she dosent pay me much attention. Like I have been together with this girl for a while (4 months) and like in comparison the attention I get is nothing compared to what I give her. Like each time we meet I hug her, give her a lots of conpliments and stuff like that. She really likes it but like what do I get in return. Basically nothing. I have gotten one random unexpected hug from her in summer. We are now on a break due to covid. But this whole thing was in summer where it started. I started to notice the attention she gave to me. And when we talked about it she would go "Don't worry babe next time I will do the things u told me that u wanted" it all was a lie. I waited desperately for something in the next date but nothing happend. She didnt even notice I got a haircut. And this went on and ok for like 3-5 times. And in the end of the summer she wanted a break. And when we started to talk about it she would say that she paid me attention. But since I really want to memorise stuff I made a blank snap and just wrote a date and what happend then. She didnt even tell me "I love you" one time in our whole relationship.
And now she wants to start over. But I just dont want her to break me again. I will come up with something but I would like some more help from u girls with experience.
