Early Christmas So I ordered a curved monitor during Black Friday, it was 32â€ and freesync and all that, and it just arrived yesterday, but I then saw that I accidentally ordered 2. So the next day I called my friend and told him to meet me outside our grade 12 classroom, and gave him the box with one of the monitors in it. And needless to say he was overwhelmed. So ya, thatâ€™s my Christmas story.
