Fuck i think my depression is coming back No no no no no no no no FUCK I WAS DOING SO GOOD.

I've been going through depression since I was a young kid, and last year especially it hit really hard. Every day was a living hell, tried suicide, failed, moved on. I stopped feeling too depressed around november and I've been feeling pretty good since then.

But for the last week I've started to feel depressed again. Extreme loss of appetite, no sleep, and feeling shitty all the time. I really don't want to start this up again, the thing is, I have nothing to be depressed about. Things aren't like they used to be, I currently have a better than before relationship with it mom, things aren't physically abusive anymore. I have a stable group of good trusted friends, I'm in love with the most beautiful amazing girl I've ever met and she lives me back, life is good, SO WHY THE FUCK AM I STARTING TO FEEL DEPRESSED AGAIN??? IM WITH MY FRIEND OR IN A CALL WITH MY GIRLFRIEND AND EVEN THOUGH I WANT TI HAVE FUN I GET HIT WITH THIS HUGE WAVE OF SADNESS AND EMPTYNESS AND I CAN'T ENJOY ANYTHING ANYMORE. FUCK I DON'T WANNA DO THIS AGAIN I REALLY DON'T, WHY THE FUCK DOES MY DEPRESSION HAVE TO BE SEASONAL LIKE THIS FUCK.
