I have decided that before trying to find a relationship, I'm going to focus on my physical health first. I'm an overweight guy, always have been, but recently started to lose weight by exercising frequently, in fact my belt size shrunk down below 50. I actually need an extra hole in my belt. I've been really lonely lately, but I figure if I start exercising, I can lose weight slowly but steadily. I've also been eating less than I normally do, and not really eating candy or sweets all that much, which I think really helps a lot. I also read that an occasional piece of dark chocolate can help with fat loss. Sorry for this little rant, I just needed to say something.
