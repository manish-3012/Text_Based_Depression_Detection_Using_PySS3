I've got my last final in 9 hours I'm not nearly as worried about it as the last one I took, but I'm still hoping I at least get good sleep tonight. On my last final I only slept a couple of hours, I was up pretty much all night trying to sleep. Hopefully tonight I can actually get some sleep but who knows. Usually it takes me hours to fall asleep anyways
