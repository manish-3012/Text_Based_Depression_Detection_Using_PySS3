Discord Server Anyone? Not many of us on here (like 10 or something) so you can get to know the people there and stuff. Ik thereâ€™s a lot of these but this is different trust me.

So itâ€™s like this chill hangout semi-rp server game-thing where you all have â€œjobsâ€ and try to get the most money and stuff whilst also being a gc. It doesnâ€™t need anything complicated like characters or plot or whatever bc itâ€™s not actual rp. Overall probably the only good thing Iâ€™ve done in my life so if you want a server to cure your boredom where teenagers run society and you can do basically anything from owning a shop to being dictator of hell this is prob the place. Aight cya there I guess.
