Ugh why do you do this? Our teacher is making us record a flipgrid on something and I really donâ€™t want to

Itâ€™s not that itâ€™s like tik tok I couldnâ€™t care less itâ€™s just that I hate being on camera in general, and I want to throw up thinking about it being replayable by everyone in our class

And then the teacher shared an article on what to do if youâ€™re camera shy

Like bitch Iâ€™m not camera shy Iâ€™m dysmorphic and see myself as still morbidly obese instead of slightly overweight and hate myself with a burning passion
