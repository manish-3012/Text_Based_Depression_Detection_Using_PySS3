Life kinda sucks tbh To start this off I just want to say 1) I love my mom sheâ€™s great and 2) excuse my grammar Iâ€™m dumb and donâ€™t care. So Iâ€™ve been feeling like shit for about two years now, quarantine certainly hasnâ€™t improved my mental state in fact the opposite. Now I feel like mega shit. Anyway I wanted to go see if I had some mental illness so I asked my mom and she immediately shot down the idea. I always act like Iâ€™m fine around her because Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll just add more stress for her because my brother already has ADHD and depression I think Iâ€™m not sure. So that sucks and I really donâ€™t want to tell my mom â€œoh yeah please send me to therapy the happiness you see is an act I put up that only falls when Iâ€™m super tired and alone in my room or with my brother when you and dad arenâ€™t home!â€ So to wrap this up my life for the last 2 years has been depressing and since quarantine started the only emotion I have felt has been extreme mental anguish. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk
