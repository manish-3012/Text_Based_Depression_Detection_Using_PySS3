I think my mom will disown me when I move out Because I'm not a Trump supporter and she's a heavy Trump supporter I'm not even a Biden supporter. Before anyone tries to say you would if you grew up conservative you would be. For one I did and for two I didn't agree with their bielfs. I don't know who I truly support 100%. I'm not sure I truly care tho because sure I was raised without knowing my bio mom most of my life and now getting to know her. I know I don't believe most of her beliefs. While on the other hand my foster mom I agree with most her beliefs. She was conservative and changed after I lived with my friend. So should I care? I'm not sure I should
