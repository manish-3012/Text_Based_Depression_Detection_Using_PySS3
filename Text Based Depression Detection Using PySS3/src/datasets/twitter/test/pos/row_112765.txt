Wikipedia is overrated Please don't hate me for this but, I'm starting to hate wikipedia. Everyone I know really likes it and are the kind of people who use it in their assignments before getting scolded. But i feel like it has gotten very very complex and crammed. For example, you wanna find something specific about the cold war. But search it on wikipedia and you'll get this long ass library of an article. And the headings don't even help especially if its very specific information you're looking for. You'll have to read paragraphs and paragraphs to find what you need and even then it is written vaguely or not given enough importance.  

If you feel the same please add to the reasons why in the comments. If you dont agree, please tell me why. I like hearing all opinions. Thanks.
