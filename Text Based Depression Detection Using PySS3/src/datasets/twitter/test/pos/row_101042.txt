Does anyone have any ideas for what I could write about in my journalism class? Hi I am required to have an article idea by tomorrow morning and IDK WHAT TO WRITE. Iâ€™m kinda freaking out since I do not want to write about politics or any subject that I have to do a large amount of research on. I donâ€™t have time to spend hours trying to find something to write about, since Iâ€™m overloaded with other classwork, so if you guys have any ideas, pls tell me since that would help me sooo much. Pls no politics, celebrities, or anything like that. Iâ€™m kinda looking to write about a small event but i canâ€™t find any since thereâ€™s crazy stuff overshadowing all that shit. 

One example of a good article idea is the asteroid that was headed towards earth on Election Day (I wrote about this on November). It was easy to write about since it was a small but relevant event, and it wasnâ€™t time consuming. 

Any ideas would help thank you!!!!
