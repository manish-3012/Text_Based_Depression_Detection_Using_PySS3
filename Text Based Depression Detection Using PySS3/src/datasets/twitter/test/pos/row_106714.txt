need some help  

So ive decided imma ask my crush out but i dont know when to do it. Shes gona have me over at her house on saturday for a barbacue with her dad and some of his friends. She says she plans on invinting me over there more if things go smoothly. Should i ask her on the first time or should i wait.

Also should i ask her if she likes me and proceed from there or do i just tell her flat out
