Hi I'm an adult but I am legitimately concerned about this kid I know She's 12, just a year away from being a teenager. She joined my among us discord group from a public lobby. Really sweet girl, but her reaction to minor things not going well is pretty troubling to me. 

She responds with what are essentially suicidal jokes; wanting to cut her fingers off or be hit by a bus etc. Now if she was an older teenager or an adult I wouldn't blink an eye, these jokes are common. But when I was 12, we never made jokes like that.

My question is, are suicide and self harm jokes the norm among children and young teens these days? Or do I have cause to be concerned?
