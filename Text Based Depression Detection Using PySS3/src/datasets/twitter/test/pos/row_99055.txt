Day two of trying to do a pushup Today i was able to do 28 and 33 wall pushups but I think this was because I did them at the start of my workout instead of the end

In better news, i am now 59.4 kilos!

I have been trying to get sub 60 for months and then boom it just happens no warning 

Anyways I'm pretty happy because Im losing weight and gaining mass of muscle
