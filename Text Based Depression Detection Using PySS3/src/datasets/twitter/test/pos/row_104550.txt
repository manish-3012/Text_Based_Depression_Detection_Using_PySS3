Need help writing rap lyrics. Started with a topic I can relate to, therefore I call my rap "I am a living mistake". I started writing some of the chorus, not done yet, but I need help My parents said that I am a living mistake

Said that when I was born I put their money at stake

Dad said that he regret letting his condom break

Mom sad that the very presence of me she hates
