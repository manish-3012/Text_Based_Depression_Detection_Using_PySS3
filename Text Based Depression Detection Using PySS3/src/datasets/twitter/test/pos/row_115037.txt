mixed feelings about everything vibe So part of me is really thinking about getting a gf, but a part of me is like bros before hoes haha, But then another part of me is like fucking why should I care I'm gonna commit suicide before 20 anyways.   But then that one part that says bros before hoes suddenly realize that I don't really have any bros. Then another part says I'm not good enough for them. Yes, I know this is a lot to throw at Reddit no this is not a meme. Anyways I don't know what to think at this point.
