Help needed. Interviewees needed  (Idk what to flair, sorry!) Hello everyone! I'm getting a bit desperate so I decided to try posting on this subreddit. Basically, one of our activities in a subject in our school wanted us to interview people through chatting about "Taking care of sick people at home". Please pm me if you want to answer my questions. I shall give more context in the PM and anonymity shall also be discussed there (You can choose what you want to keep a secret at and not). Thanks in advance, everyone!
