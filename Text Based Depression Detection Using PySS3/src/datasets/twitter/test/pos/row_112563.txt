Atleast im trying. So I got a nice little agreement where I do yard work for the neighbor including pulling weeds, edging, mowing, and generally making it look nicer. I get paid 100 a month, which is a lot and that was not my offer. For all that I had first said that 50 would be very generous. I agreed on 100 reluctantly because I felt it was a little much. I had worked very hard last month and not much this month. Theres not many weeds and the only thing left to do is to periodicaly edge, mow, and sometimes pull weeds. 
Ever since I got this "job" .y parents have been very critical, and constantly threatening to "do it themselves," or to "have me return the money." When I dont go out. Its been raining everyday almost and out mower recently stopped working , so what am I supposed to do? 
EVERYTIME I do something my dad's on me about it not being good enough or that I'm not doing enough, or that I'm too slow. 
Sorry if you can't relate, thanks for reading.
