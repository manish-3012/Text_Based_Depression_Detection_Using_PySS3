Shit has been told about me I've wrote with this girl once and we maybe got a bit too funky and wrote shit that we regretted the next day. She then told her friends that i am a perverted jerk and didn't tell the whole story that she also wrote that same type of shit. and those friends of her told the story to other people and in another context so i'm an even bigger jerk and many people think of me i'm a perverted jerk even though i'm 14 tf. Is there anything to do about it?
btw i've talked to that person and i couldn't do anything and now i don't know what to do, i'll probably have problems getting girls later on.
any advice?
