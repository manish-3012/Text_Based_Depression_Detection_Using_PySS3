One time I nearly died (From bathroom shenanigans) Last year, I was in 8th grade. So I think we all know how stupid 8th graders are. Anyway, so I'm heading into the Girls Bathroom because I needed to go, I walk in, and see a stall already in use.

In a single moment I have the "greatest" idea to say:

"I'm bouta take the biggest shit in this bitch."

....out loud, to whoever was in the stall.

But I decided not too.

And then my science teacher, who was my next class, walked out. 

She's a really nice teacher. One of the greatest ones ever. But considering how small and prestigious my school was, I would have been in a lot of trouble if I went through with the joke. Ah, the joys of going to a Gifted Magnet School run by Liberal LGBTQ+ supporters.

So excited for high-school.
