What the hell is going on ..... For the past two hours everytime I think of physical empath or i put my left hand on or near the phone there's an unbearable feeling I never had before.. it's as if my scar was reaching to the phone's energy so badly. It causes an intense sensation. The type I feel in response to others pain.
