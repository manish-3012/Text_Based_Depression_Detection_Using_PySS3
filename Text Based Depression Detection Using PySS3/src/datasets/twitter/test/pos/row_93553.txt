How do I get my crush to dating other guys??? She is interested in other guys and it makes me sick in my stomach. She's not the same ratchet and slutty girl like most of her friends, so I know she won't do anything too crazy. The problem is that she's sweet and wholesome, so the no good losers she's interested in will take advantage of that. 

I looked her up on social media, but she sadly doesn't post anymore. I don't know how to track her on any other social media platforms. I easily found most of her friends because most of them are super egotistical and superficial. How do I get her to wake up?
