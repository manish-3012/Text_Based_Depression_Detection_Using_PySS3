Bro I fucking hate planning sleepovers I've been planning a sleepover with some really close friends for my birthday and they all said they can go about 3 weeks before the sleepover. Now they're all saying they cant go or they're just not responding to my texts. It's really pissing me off because they were all super excited and had a ton of stuff planned for it.

But now they're just making up excuses when they checked with their parents and checked the calendar and shit. Its pissed me off so much.

Thanks for letting me rant.
