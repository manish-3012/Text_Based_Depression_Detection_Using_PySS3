ONLINE SCHOOL Ok Iâ€™ll be honest. I enjoy online school. There I said it. For me the pressure is just mostly taken off and I can do what I want (to some extent). I have 5 lessons a day, most of them calls, however at my school you donâ€™t have to have your camera on. I do struggle to remain focused (in fact, in a way Iâ€™m procrastinating by doing this as Iâ€™m supposed to be in English).
Anyone got any advice on how to stay focused and not procrastinate the whole time?!
