i got a concussion my friends and i were goofing off at school, running into each other and whatnot- typical stupid stuff.

one of my bigger friends was aiming for another one of my friends but got knocked off course cuz weâ€™re all idiots

he came at me full force and accidentally bonked my head into the concrete gym wall, really hard

this was on tuesday and iâ€™ve been home since then, i canâ€™t think without my head pounding or getting nauseous 

atleast i got out of the pacer test Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
