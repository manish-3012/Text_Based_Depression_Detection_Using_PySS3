I can't be the only one who thinks relationships are weird but also kinda want one Ok, so I've seen posts about how they have a crush and they have a girlfriend, but like, having a girlfriend? Why? I get it, you don't want to die alone? but like?????? I never understood that, but I kinda want some sort of relationship, just without the kissing and crap, but more like the cuddles and trust, just leave all the romance, please.
