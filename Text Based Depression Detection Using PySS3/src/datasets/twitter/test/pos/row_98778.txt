Something just hit me... For around 60% of my entire life, I've been staring at a specific object with a bunch of small lights changing colors (aka a computer monitor), from when i get home from school, until I go to sleep, almost every single day.
Nothing that I'm doing on my computer is real, it's all just me controlling numbers to make it look like I'm doing something.
