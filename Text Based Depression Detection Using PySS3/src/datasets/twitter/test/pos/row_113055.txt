My cat is the bane of my online-school existence. During class today, i was talking to one of my friends on a separate phone during a google meet. Well. My cat was walking around on my desk and he stepped on my computer. I didnt notice this, so not only did i continue talking to my friend, but i was narrating what my cat was doing.

My cat sat down and i was petting him and booping his nose. I said to my friend â€œim annoying my cat.â€ And then. I literally. Meowed. In a sexy cat voice. 

â€œIm annoying my cat. mrrrr-owww. maxxyyy. im being so babb rawrrrrâ€

My friend, who finally noticed this just whispered as lowly as possible â€œyoure unmutedâ€

I just looked at the screen, resisted the urge to go die, and promptly exited the meeting. 

My friend then informed me that not only did everyone hear us talking, the meow, and me talking in my being-sweet-to-my-cat-voice, they  also just stopped the lesson and were just starting at me. They heard me talk for at least a minute. They heard me talk to my friend who was also in the class. They heard him laugh. they heard me go insane. 

I want to die.
