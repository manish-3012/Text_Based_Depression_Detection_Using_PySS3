Your boy took an L today Today, I had a math zoom lecture at my college and a fine ass lady shows up in the sidebar. Naturally, I pin her video and decide what I should do next. After contemplating for a while, I private message her asking for a snap and she gives me the snap. That's a win for your boy, right? Wrong. I snap her asking how was the recitation and she said she couldn't pay attention because she was laughing the whole time. 

You see, during the zoom meeting, my roommates were all standing within the view of my camera and doing crazy shit because I lost a bet. I saw that she was laughing so that's when I asked for the snap.

Anyways, I respond back to her saying that I couldn't focus either with some ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ emojis implying that i was distracted by her looks. She then says "lol nice".... Ok fine shes playing hard to get maybe. So I then ask her for her number. 

Two things could happen when I asked her: she says yes which means she's interested or she says no because she isn't interested. I figured that since she was willing to give me the snap, I was in. Boy was I wrong.

She responded back saying that she could give me her number but she wanted to let me know she has a boyfriend.... Then she follows it up by saying that we can still play 8 ball. Smh. I was led on this whole time only to be kicked in the balls.
