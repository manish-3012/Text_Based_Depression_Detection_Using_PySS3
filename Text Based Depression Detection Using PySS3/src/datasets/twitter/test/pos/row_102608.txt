I guess some friends would be nice. Iâ€™ve always had a hard time making friends growing up, it was mostly me harassing people to be friends with me. And when I did Manage to find a person that wanted to be friends with me they already had their own circle. Now insert a few years of bullying, and now Iâ€™m homeschooled. 

And Iâ€™ve been homeschooled for 5 years now, and I just realized at 4:40am in the morning that I just wasted 5 years of my life. I havenâ€™t really talked to anyone else but my family in 5 years. But now I watch streamers/YouTubers like QuackityHq, Tommyinnit ,dream extra . (If you donâ€™t like them please donâ€™t judge me for liking them)  

But now Iâ€™m here wishing I could have what they have, lots of friends to hang out with and do dumb shit with, tell god awful jokes, do role plays on Minecraft (not the cringe stuff.) and just have a good laugh with. Iâ€™m heading to bed now.
