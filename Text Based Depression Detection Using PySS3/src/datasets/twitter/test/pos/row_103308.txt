This is gonna sound weird but... Basically my friend has a small YouTube channel where he uploads vids of him gaming . He barely gets any views and I think it would really make his day if he logged on to see one of his videos be filled with likes and views. So please help me make my best friendâ€™s day by following the link and at least playing the video , even for a split second . You donâ€™t have to watch the whole thing . But those likes and views add up and who knows , on top of being a nice surprise it may actually boost his channel. I know it seems like Iâ€™m shamelessly plugging but he has no idea and I really want to surprise him with this. So please check out his videos and channel . Who knows , you may like what you see.
