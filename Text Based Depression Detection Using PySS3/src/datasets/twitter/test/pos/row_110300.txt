do people really like me like do people actually get crushes on me 

i donâ€™t even like myself so i canâ€™t fathom it happening even though iâ€™ve gotten a couple of confessions 

looking back iâ€™ve actually gotten asked out a decent amount of times. i can see why my friends are surprised iâ€™ve never been in a relationship now

itâ€™s not that iâ€™ve never had a crush, i just cannot see myself being in a relationship with someone as attractive as them. 

there was this one year i got asked out by 6 people and i just assumed itâ€™s because i was the new girl and an easy bullying target. 

if i wasnâ€™t so insecure i could have been dating my crushes

yes crusheS. itâ€™s happened more than once where my crush has sad they like me. 

insecure with my body and sexuality. the only things stopping me from having a normal highschool relationship 

imagine that. i literally held hands with a girl around school yet couldnâ€™t bring myself to say i liked her back so we could just do this all the time
