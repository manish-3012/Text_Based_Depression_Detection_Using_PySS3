I masturbated for the first time. It was about 4 years ago(13) when I first heard about the deed and I felt like this isn't something I wouldn't commit to. But somedays back I really had the urge to just bust a nut, hence I did it. I felt so ashamed that I did such a thing. I know a lot of people say it isn't a sin but my mom keeps telling me it is. So I feel like I'm in this battle against myself and God that I've done something wrong in his standards but in terms of us humans, it's not. I tried to tell my mom, my pastor's son, and my brother but I felt no one would listen to me and they would just disown me. If anyone has any suggestions on what I can do please tell because I feel like I don't know if anyone in my family is going to listen to my sinful act.
