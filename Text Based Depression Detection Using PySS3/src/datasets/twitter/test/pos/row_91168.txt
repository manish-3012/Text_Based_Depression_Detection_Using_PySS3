I fucking hate printers I got a printer for Christmas as a gift for college and the damn thing has only worked once. ONCE. I've been trying to print for the last 2 fucking hours. It keeps appearing offline even though the printer says it's online. Wtf. Why. Why. Why. I call HP and the only thing they fucking tell me is if it's turned on. OF COURSE IT'S TURNED ON DUMBASS. Then they say they can't help. Fuck you. Fuck these shitty printers. Never in my life have I seen an effective printer. They are always dog shit
