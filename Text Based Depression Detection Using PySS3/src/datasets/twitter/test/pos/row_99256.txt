Possum in the girlâ€™s bathroom at a Catholic high school My high school has mass, (donâ€™t ask me how often I donâ€™t pay that much attention) and ð™„ have a sense of aversion to masses and/or Christianity.            
   So, when we had mass yesterday, it is safe to say that I already wasnâ€™t having a good time. I had an even worse time when the shoddily streamed mass on the projector started singing â€œhow great is our Godâ€.   Now my dad died when I was in the sixth grade(Iâ€™m in tenth now), so I have memories of him. One of those memories was of me getting picked up from my grandfatherâ€™s house after school by my dad; we had learnt that song in music class that day and I was still pretty young, so I was singing that one verse over and over and over. I remember being so excited to go home with Dad and tell him about my day. 
       Iâ€™m standing in my homeroom class already shaking because Jesus or whatever, tearing up because again Jesus, and listening to this glitchy version of a song I sung to my late father when I was still a kid and I just canâ€™t. This is when I start really crying and my friend notices. This friend of mine tries to help and calm me down by telling me to breathe. I am very thankful for this friend but that doesnâ€™t entirely work because this isnâ€™t a panic attack, so I go to the bathroom. 
    Of course, I do that dramatic â€œwalk out of the classroom and completely break thingâ€; when I make it to the bathroom I sit down and cry in the handicapped stall. Because a) itâ€™s the biggest and b) itâ€™s the farthest from the door. Something to note is that this was the Friday before Halloween so people were allowed to get dressed up, I was one of the people that dressed up. The whole of the costume isnâ€™t important, but what is important is that my costume had a ð™«ð™šð™§ð™® good fake tail. 
   So Iâ€™m crying in the bathroom right, and I hear the door open so I go quiet. I hear shuffling and then the door closes and the person is gone. The door opens again and I hear a gasp. Door closes. Then the commotion of seniors leaving mass gets mixed with the commotion caused by the â€œfactâ€ that there is some kind of annoying the girlâ€™s bathroom. In the second to last stall people saw something furry, black, and white. Some say possum others say raccoon, and I also heard mention of a skunk. I had, at first, forgotten I was wearing the tail, and was extremely confused. Then I remembered that I was wearing the tail and came up with a plan; I would put my hand next to the tail so next time someone came in theyâ€™d see that it was just a furry. Before they came in I hear mention of calling animal control, boxes, and senior boys offering to come in and grab â€œmeâ€.  Finally, the principal(this is her first year at this school) comes in and seeâ€™s that it is just me,a human person. And the rest is history. 

This is how I became the possum in the bathroom at a catholic high school.
