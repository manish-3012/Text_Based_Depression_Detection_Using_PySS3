Why Tonpa doesnt deserve the hate he gets. Why Tonpa is good and not as evil as people think. He (Tonpa)  took the hunter exams 36 times. Tonpa is around 45-46. 45.5-36= 9.5. Tonpa does the hunter exam to "break newbies". Now we ask ourselves, did a kid about nine years old take a dangerouse exam that could kill you just to break newbies? why would a newbie break other newbies? why would a nine year old do that for 3/4 of his life? Awnser: he didn't. he either 1. started taking at seriously but ended up getting broken. 2. failed and started doing that 3. was looking for an excuse 4. was actually breaking newbies since he was 9 and a half or 5. an unexplained reason. This is why tonpa is a good charater.
