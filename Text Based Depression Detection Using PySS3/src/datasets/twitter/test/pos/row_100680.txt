What to dress up as for homecoming The theme for our last day of homecoming is Christmas for the seniors. Iâ€™m not Christian, but I want suggestions of what to dress up as. I already thought of dressing up in wrapping paper and calling myself the ghost of Christmas Present, but I want other suggestions.
