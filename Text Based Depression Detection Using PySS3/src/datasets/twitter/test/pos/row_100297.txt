I need help Ä° am a 8th grader that will have finals.Ä° study hard.80 math,science,Turkish and History everyday.And have like 1-2 mistakes from each and i study on those where i failed.But i still make like 6 mistakes from 20 questions in the trying exams.I don't copy from the answer sheet while studying also.I don't know what is the problem.Does anyone has tips? I can realise that this problem is slowly breaking the family bonds and my family is so close to grounding me to the point where I can not get any social interaction.
