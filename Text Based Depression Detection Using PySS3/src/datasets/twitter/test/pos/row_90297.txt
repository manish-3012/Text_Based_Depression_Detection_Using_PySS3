bro i just wanna be happy Iâ€™m genuinely trying but nothings working. 

like all i feel is guilt, for literally no reason. i just feel like i did something fucked up or Iâ€™m a terrible person when i cant even give myself a reason why.

my girlfriends the only thing that makes me happy but im becoming more clingy everyday n shes fine with it but im scared one day im gonna become toxic or something and sheâ€™ll leave me. 

i cant keep any hobby that i try. i just lose motivation n all i wanna do is sit on my phone which is terrible. even hanging out with friends doesnâ€™t seem fun. every time i do hang out with someone i feel even more guilty for some reason and almost cry. 

anyone have any idea on something i can do that doesnâ€™t involve going to the doctor? (i have reasons for that)
