Motivations just gonna suck for a while Over the past 2 weeks 2 really bad things have happened and I havenâ€™t been able to find the motivation yet to start back with exercise and my plans to start running again. Hopefully I can work towards that but honestly itâ€™s just not possible rn. These next few days or weeks will kinda just suck. Hopefully school doesnâ€™t fuck me over with to much homework. The stress has been getting to me recently and itâ€™s just not very great.
