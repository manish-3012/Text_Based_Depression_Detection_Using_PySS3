this is gonna sound like the dumbest thing ever but i donâ€™t wanna get in a relationship until iâ€™m hot. that just sounds embarrassing. like imagine him tryna tell his friends that i look better irl than in pictures and everyone thinking heâ€™s doing charity work. no thanks, iâ€™d rather stay single forever.
