Socializing is hard! Tomorrow there's a party at my mate's house and idk what to do. I've already accepted the invite and i don't wanna let them down. And i suck at socializing. I have almost 0 social skills. I tried everything that google said (talk with your close friends/family, etc etc...) and i don't think that will be helping me tomorrow. So now here I am asking for advice, help me!!! Idk want to be a weirdo at the party. 

Note: i only know 1 guy who will be at the party (my bff)
