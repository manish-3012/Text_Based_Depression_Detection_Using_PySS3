how do i know if im losing feelings or if the honeymoon phase is just over? ive been dating this girl for 9 months now and i feel like im starting to lose the feelings i had before. were both really comfortable with eachother now and i love her but i somehow feel like im losing feelings or im just bored? 

i dont have feelings for any other girl and i can see her in my future so its weird idk. its stressing me out a lot

not sure if this is losing feelings or just being comfortable but idk
