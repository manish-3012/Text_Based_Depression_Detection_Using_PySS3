What's the point of most of the things we learn in school? I just finished eight hours of an online exam for college level math and all of the problems are just harder recycled questions from homework and lectures, but they've never really discussed the importance or life applications of these topics, when I'd ask, they would just get mad and tell me to just shut up and do my requirements instead of complaining.

I've forgotten most of what I learned in elementary and high school and now, I have to go through four more years of subjects and topics that I'll mostly never even use after I graduate, what's the point of all this?

Of the few subjects that I do enjoy and genuinely find interesting, are the ones that teach me public speaking, how to manage my emotions when under stress, teaching me how to interact and others and even thank fucking gosh, my rights as a citizen and a human being, none of the "I only exist on paper and to solve me, you can't use a calculator since those don't exist in real life" bs.

Anw, just ranting, hope you guys had a great day, cheers!
