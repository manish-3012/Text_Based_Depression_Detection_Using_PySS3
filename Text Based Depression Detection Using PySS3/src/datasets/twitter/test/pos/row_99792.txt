How do I make things more romantic with the guy Iâ€™m dating? So recently I confessed I liked my crush and we went out on a date, then today we hung out for like 5 hours straight and just talked and played games. It was really fun and we always have a great time together but it wasnâ€™t exactly â€˜romanticâ€™

I think weâ€™re both too shy to bring up the romantic aspect of our relationship in conversation, is that something that comes with time or is there something I can do to further it?
