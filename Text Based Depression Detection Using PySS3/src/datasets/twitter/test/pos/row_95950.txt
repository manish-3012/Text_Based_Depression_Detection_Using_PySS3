So i wrote this letter to the guy i loved and id just like to post it here bc idk it took a lot out of me to write and hurt a lot to write  

Dear Alexander,

You were my everything.The reason i woke up most days,the person i talked to the most,who i wanted to text all day and call all night.Most importantly you showed me how to love and what was love.There were so many things that happened but we always came back to each other and grew stronger because of it.Ive never regretted or hated myself so much for letting someone go.Ive never stopped loving you.I miss you everyday theres not a say that goes by that i dont think of you.You were my forever and always.You still are even if we dont talk.I will never love anyone the way i loved you.What we had was so special and amazing id rather die than have never met you because you saved me and kept me alive most days.You made sure i went to bed and that i ate and that i didnt do anything that would put me at risk.You were there for so many anxiety attacks or after my mom hit me or yelled at me.No one has ever been there for me like you were.I was your burrito and you were my dumbass.I love you.I never stopped loving you.I never will stop loving you.You will always have a piece of my heart because its the piece you earned to have.I truly never knew love till i met you.All the calls that lasted for hours,lil naps id take,movie nights,softball practices,stupid pictures wed send each other,making fun of people on google maps,telling you about my day and asking about urs,just seeing you and hearing your voice and laugh.Everything.I dont regret meeting you.Without you i wouldnt be who i am right now.I got so much confidence because of you.I was you girl,baby,burrito anything else youd call me i didnt care as long as i was yours.Im no longer yours and it tears me apart on the inside that im not.Forever and always thats what we would say.Well you will be forever in my heart and always the one i loved most.There is not a word strong enough for how much i miss you.I stayed because i liked talking with you and then i fell in love with you.No one has made me feel how you made me feel.I cant ever say thank you e=nough for everything you did for me.I love you forever and always.Ill never forget every little memory we made.All the stupid inside jokes and that dumbass word niggardly you liked to say so much knowing it pissed me off.I miss joking around with you and calling you a dumbass then doing stupid shit on facetime as you called me an idiot.In those moments i was always the happiest ive ever been.You made me the happiest no one else.Now that your gone its been hard finding someone to fill that hole.I cant say its been easy.No one is as amazing or had the connection we did.I just wish i fought harder for you.I didnt and that is the biggest regret ill ever make.You were so smart and i truly believed you can do anything you want and deserve the fucking best because youve been through shit.I just hope that you can find someone who makes you half as happy as you made me.I will never forget you.I love you alexander forever and always.Im happy i met you and i hope i can find another like you.
