Should abortion really be legalized? I saw some posts about a underage girls getting pregnant,and the some comments supported the idea of abortion. Given the situation here ignoring the fact that underage sex should not happen,I was at a loss,many literally supported that the idea of abortion being legalized. Does not matter how I see this,this is literally killing kids. Even mother Teresa hated the idea of abortion! Think if you guys parents thought the same thing? "We don't want kids now" you would not be seeing this post here right now. I would like to hear you guys opinion here,for my part I really hate the idea of abortion!

P.S- sorry for the bad English,its not my first language.
