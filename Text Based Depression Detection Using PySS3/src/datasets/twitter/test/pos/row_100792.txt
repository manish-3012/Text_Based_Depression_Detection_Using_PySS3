Is This a Cause for Concern? 
I have nowhere to ask, hence why I am asking here. There are communities made for questions like these, but the people there take way to long to respond. 

I am in the market for an iPad. I have wanted one for over a year. I will use it for a variety of things, with one example being school-work. 

I am going to be purchasing one tomorrow. I was going to purchase the iPad Air IV, directly from Apple. 

This was when I found out someone is selling a sealed (on Kijiji) iPad Pro for $900.00, one-hundred dollars more than the Air IV, but $200.00 cheaper that buying it outright from Apple. 

He has proof of purchase/receipt and it comes with the warranty. 

He said I can open it/check it out before purchasing it. 

However, I am still a bit suspicious. What do you think? 

I do not want to buy the Pro directly from Apple. It is not worth the extra money. It is a difference of $300.00. However, a $100.00 difference is not that big of a deal, and is worth it in my eyes. 

What do you think? 

Do not respond telling me to save my money. I already have a savings account, with half of my wage going towards it.
