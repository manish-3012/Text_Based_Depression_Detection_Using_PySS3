Send some underrated songs from underrated artists. It can be any genre tbh, i need to add more to my playlist, and i really hope people take the time to listen to the underrated artists and comment if they like it or not their type. I honestly never thought of myself saying this on Reddit, but i have to say the word: please press the arrow going up so i dont have see the same comments, and so i can see other people can see this post. :)
