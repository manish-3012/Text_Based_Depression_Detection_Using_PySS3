So I emailed Bezgar support about the RC car I bought from them It's a chinese company that makes RC cars and honestly whenever I look stuff up about them it's like a weird mix of "we're just a small company and we're trying our best to make our customers satisfied but English just our first language" and \*super shady chinese company\*

So I guess either I'll know the thread count of their wheel lock screws, or they'll know my social security number. Probably the first one though, their website makes me doubt they have the technical know-how to set up an e-mail address, much less hack anything.
