Advice from a 23 year old When I was a teenager I was overweight and short. Than after a couple years I was fit but still short. Right now I recommend losing weight and living healthier lifestyles your body will thank you for it. As of now Iâ€™m living my last day but I hope you all had a good Christmas and some other advice going to community college first and transferring saved me a shit ton of money.
