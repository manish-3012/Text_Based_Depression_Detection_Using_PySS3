Sometimes I feel like I'm being forced to stay in Chinese class. I mean I like it and it's fun but sometimes I feel like I never even had the choice to be in it.  I also feel jealous sometimes because my little brother was taken out of it but I still understand why he was took out but still. I also don't think that either of my parents realize that I struggle with it sometimes. It's probably because I've been in it since first grade but the fact that it's hard doesn't change. It also takes up some of my credits so I can't take all the classes I want to do. But I only have a few more years then I'm hopefully done with it.
