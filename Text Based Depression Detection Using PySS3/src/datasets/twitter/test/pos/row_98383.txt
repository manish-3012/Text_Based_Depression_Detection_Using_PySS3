I'm feeling overwhelmed Hey everyone, I don't know if this fits here but I'm 16 years old so I guess it does. I am kinda overwhelmed by my feelings right now. Two days ago my parents told me that they wanted to divorce. A few days before I got my first girlfriend. I don't know what I'm expecting but I guess I just wanted to share. I hope you all have a great day ^^
