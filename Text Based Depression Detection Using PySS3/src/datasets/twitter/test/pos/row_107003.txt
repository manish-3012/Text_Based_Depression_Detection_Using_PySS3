I wrote this poem and thought some of y'all might appreciate it. TW: self-harm **Thoughts**

He follows me,

Day and night.

Hoping to see

me in a fright.

He smiles at my blood,

and bathes in my tears.

Always, hoping,

more.

&amp;#x200B;

They see me, just barely,

when I face the outside.

Always wondering

"Why not more, Why?"

Their thoughts, so cruel,

yet nothing I can do,

Why can't I just die?

&amp;#x200B;

I see my cuts,

For attention, most likely.

Deeper, I say,

as my blade holds me tightly.

It glides over my wrists,

a sea comes rushing.

"Is this enough?"

They say nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys have any feedback to share, that would be great! This was the first draft.
