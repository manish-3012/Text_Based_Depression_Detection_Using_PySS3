fish sticks a week ago i developed a random craving for fish sticks and i finally decided to try them yesterday. they werenâ€™t amazing or horrible. ok thatâ€™s a lie they were fucking delicious. maybe itâ€™s because i hadnâ€™t eaten but they were just so fucking amazing. i thought the craving would go away but no i still want some 

itâ€™s weird because iâ€™ve never had fish sticks before. and itâ€™s not like i came across a video of fish sticks and thought â€œoh i kinda want thoseâ€ no i was just watching big time rush and i wanted fish sticks then that thought did not leave my mind for a week straight

i still want fish sticks oh my fucking god they donâ€™t even taste that good but they sound so fucking good right now
