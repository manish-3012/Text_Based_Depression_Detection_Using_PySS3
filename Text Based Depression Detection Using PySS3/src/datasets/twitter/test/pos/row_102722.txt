Gonna go 1 week clean starting today Yesterday my mum was talking to me about self harm without knowing that i do it. This scared the fuck out of me because i thought she knew. Starting today i want to go one week clean of cutting. this isnt much but since i started a month a couple months ago the longest gap ive had was 3 days. I feel so pathetic of how i need to consciously tell my self not yo cur.
