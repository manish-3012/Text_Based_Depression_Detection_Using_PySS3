A writer who needs to know what the modern middle and high school cliques are. Hi, Iâ€™m a writer who is hoping to understand the variety of different (Iâ€™m 34) social heirarchy/clique groups for middle/high schoolers in the hopes of making my story more relatable to my audience. My main character is a girl who is about 10 years old, so I donâ€™t even know what they have nowadays. Iâ€™m sure it canâ€™t have changed THAT much, but just to be sure.. are there any trends these days that I just wouldnâ€™t have gotten on my own? I found I was writing in a way that was relatable to ME... and that probably isnâ€™t going to fly...

Can anyone help a clueless childrenâ€™s writer out? Any advice or direction for me to research would be amazing. Thanks everyone.
