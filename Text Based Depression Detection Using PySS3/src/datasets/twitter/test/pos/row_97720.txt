I just donâ€™t know Itâ€™s one of those nights. A yearn for music but nothing is good enough. Feeling emotional and trying to embrace it but wanting to bury emotions at the same time. Iâ€™m tired. But I donâ€™t want to sleep. I canâ€™t do anything. I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t really like living. Itâ€™s just the same cycle for everyone. Goodbye.
