I swear there is a tune going through my head the whole school day. I drum on my binder between classes. I drum on the table while waiting for the teacher. I hum whilw we are doing work. I drum on the table more before going to the next class drumming on my binder. All day. There always seems to be some song or other in my head for whatever reason.
