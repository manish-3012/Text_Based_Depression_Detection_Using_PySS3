Iâ€™m crying- Welp, after not giving fuck for months about what my dad is saying to me (he has anger issues and he ALWAYS thinks heâ€™s right. And oh heâ€™s swearing at me), he fought me cuz of some dumb shit any other normal person would understand and now Iâ€™m here crying because Iâ€™m tired of his behavior and my mom excusing it all the time. 

Can someone send memes or smth? Or maybe tell joke or funny story? I really donâ€™t want to cry or think about it more
