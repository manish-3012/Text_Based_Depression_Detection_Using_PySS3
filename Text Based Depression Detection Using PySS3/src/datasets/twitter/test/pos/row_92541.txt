im not truscum or tucute. i just believe you can identify as whatever you want as long as its not harming anyone i dont exactly understand some gender identities, especially xenogenders, like people who identify with stars and plants and shit, but imo, if it doesnt hurt anyone, you can identify as whatever tf you want

you identify as stargender? cool, idrc. you identify as spaceastralgendervoid? cool, you do you, and be proud! you identify as a nebularomantic demi-greyromantic asexual demiboy? hell yeah, thats 100% ok!

like i said, idc what you identify as, if it doesn't harm people

if you identify as transage/agefluid, pedophile/map/pedosexual, AAM, zoophile/zoosexual, necrophile/necrosexual, clovergender/kindergender, or anything similar to those philias, then that IS harming people and i will have 0 respect for you

but yeah, idc if your identity is some crazy thing. if it doesnt hurt anyone, its fine with me
