Do you like my poem I wrote at school From the outside the tent seems friendly 
But inside their scared my war
And this men made our enemy flee
But still they ask for a cigarette more 

But when you ask these men what they saw
Some would fall once 6 foot tall
They would describe what happen in â€˜04
That the enemy attack they helped to stall 

But some men to the contrary 
Would say nothing at all 
But all knew what they see
Help needed though a silent call

So Iâ€™m conclusion 
Some men say the delusion 
Of old glory 
But now they Canâ€™t tell their story
