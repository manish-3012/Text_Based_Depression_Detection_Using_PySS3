I finally confessed my love to my best friend today and we are now dating. Iâ€™ve known this girl for 6 years. Sheâ€™s my best friend. Overtime, I started to develop deep feelings for her. Once I came out as lesbian, I fell hard. Sheâ€™s a really pretty, talented, kind girl, and I canâ€™t think of anyone better. I had to move away from her a year and a half ago, and havenâ€™t seen her since. So, naturally, we started dating over a Discord call. Very romantic, I know. All day my anxiety was telling me that I was going to be rejected, and I was terrified. When the big moment came, I said it immediately. She didnâ€™t know how to respond but after a few minutes I asked her if itâ€™s a yes or no. She said yes. Iâ€™m not officially the happiest girl in the world.
