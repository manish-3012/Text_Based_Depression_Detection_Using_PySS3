Nightmare In Hood Street: Monologue/Episode 0 It was a dark night as I walked through Hood Street, searching for some good fucking food. A worn out lowrider without a left door pulled up beside me, and a black man with no teeth exited with an angry look on his face and the scent of cocaine about him. he yelled at the big brown house on the curb, then filled the walls with bullet holes. the man retreated to his car as gunfire reigned down from the surrounding streets, and crowds of people screamed "YO WACK DIS MOFO I STG NI". after that incident i left Hood street, hoping to never encounter it again.
