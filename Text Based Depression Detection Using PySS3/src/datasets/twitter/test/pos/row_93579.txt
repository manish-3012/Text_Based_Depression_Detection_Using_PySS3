So my friend wasn't awkward today at school and I'm so happppppppyyyyyyyyyyyy So on Friday my friend figured out I liked her and then there was a whole fiasco there (she wouldn't tell me what was wrong and I had to get a friend to talk to her etc, you can see my profile for the whole thing). So I was worried that it was going to be awkward at school because I share 3 classes plus lunch with her and she is like one of my only friends at the school because we're freshman and I've known her for years. So luckily it looks like our friendship is fine. I'm so happy rn it's just like feosfnu usnn.
