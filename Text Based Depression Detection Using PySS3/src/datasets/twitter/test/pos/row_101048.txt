I was having a good day I shouldnâ€™t be as mad/sad as I am rn but it meant something to me. Throughout the last few months shits been hard. So I started playing on an smp with a few fiends. They all quit for the most part but I kept playing. I had several mega bases a wither farm a guardian farm gold farm etc etc. And they reset it today. So I asked for a world download because I wanted to keep playing and they said I could have it once it reset. Well I asked and they said nope this time we arenâ€™t giving it out cause yes. It meant a lot to me and they basically did this as the biggest fuck you because theyâ€™re mad at me for smth I didnâ€™t even do or remember. And Iâ€™m just crushed. Itâ€™s been really rough for the past week or two and then shit happens. I honestly donâ€™t know anymore I wanna restart a new world. But itâ€™s just so fucking hurtful for this to happen. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore
