Flashback to the time I had a laughing tic Shit sucked. I felt like the damn joker and couldn't go anywhere because I was way too embarrassed to be out in public like that. My friends would just be talking in an xbox party with me and mid conversation I'd just start quietly chuckling to myself.



Fuck that tic. I mean fuck tics in general but fuck that tic specifically.
