My crush told me who she had a crush on someone (spoiler, it wasn't me) I met her a few times already but lockdown has made things difficult, over the last month we've been snapping almost daily, almost all day. I always thought she was giving me hints and almost agreed to go out after the lockdown, today she told me she had a crush on someone, he likes her as well and they'll meet as soon as they can. So basically all I thought was hints I just interpreted wrong, all the hopes I built up got torn down today. I really don't know what to do anymore.
