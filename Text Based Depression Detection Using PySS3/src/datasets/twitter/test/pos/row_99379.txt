Luck is just a confirmation bias... Luck is what you call when a convenient coincidence happens due to unforeseen circumstances from a personal perspective.

If I held a gun at you and could shoot u or not. If I didn't shoot you that would be luck according to you but it wouldn't be luck according to me.

If u roll a dice and you land a 6, you weren't lucky. You simply rolled it a certain way without you knowing.
