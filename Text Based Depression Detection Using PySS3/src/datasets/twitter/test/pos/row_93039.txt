I complimented every teenage guy I saw in my work today thanks to you guys. So I always browse on this sub and I noticed a lot of guys say they never get compliments. 

I compliment other girls all the time-  including strangers I see at my part- time job at the supermarket.

But apparently guys never get compliments - I didn't even realise this but when I thought about it I realised I don't compliment guys half as much as I compliment girls. 

So I decided that today I would compliment every teenage guy that I served in my part-time job. And let me tell you - that was *a lot* of guys lol. 

I complimented their outfit if they were wearing something cool, or their haircut or eyes or whatever I saw that I liked. 

It was a fun thing to do and every time I said a compliment the guy seemed sooo surprised and shocked that I complimented them but were chuffed that I did. It was very cute.

So yeah I guess thanks to this sub for bringing it to my awareness that guys never get compliments cause now a lot more guys were complimented today! 

 I'm gonna do this for now on and give the guys more love cause they need it just as much as my fellow girls! ;)
