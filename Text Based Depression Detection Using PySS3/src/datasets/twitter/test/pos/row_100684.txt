Want to get revenge on my brother is this a good plan? Don't ask why but my parents seem to insist I wear my older brother's hand me downs. Problem is the pants never fit, I even wear a belt and they keep slipping down and showing my underwear. Parents don't listen and say "your wearing a belt, it's fine, pull them up if they slip". After 7 years of this (yeah, haven't worn something without a belt for 7 years) I'm getting used used to my underwear showing all the time... except at home because when ever my brother sees me he always gives me a massive wedgie. I've come up with a plan to get revenge but wanna ask if it's a good idea or not good enough.

My brother's pants fit...but only when he wears a belt. Most of the time he just sags his pants (tbh kinda what I've started doing now) but times when he wants to look good, he wears one. His girlfriend is coming over in an hour and in 30 he'll be getting out some smarter clothes...so I'm considering stealing his belt and embarrassing him... then after she leaves, giving him a suprise wedgie and telling him I stole his belt.

Good idea?
