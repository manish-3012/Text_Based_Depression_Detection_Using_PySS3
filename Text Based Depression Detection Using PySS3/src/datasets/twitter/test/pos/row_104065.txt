People are careless I made a post a few days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/iwu7lc/i_need_the_motivation/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf 
Well, after I asked my crush out she said she liked some other guy and that we could still be friends.
Today, things changed.
She said that I asked her out because I wanted the social status of having a girlfriend and not because I have a thing for her. (I do have a thing for her btw)
Then she started insulting me and trying to humiliate me.
I donâ€™t know whether to feel sad or angry.
