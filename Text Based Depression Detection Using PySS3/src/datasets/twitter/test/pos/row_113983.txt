Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m the only one dealing with this My maternal grandparents have been living with my family for close to a year now. I liked it for a little bit until I realized that they would be staying with us for a long time (maybe even the rest of their lives). My house has 3 bedrooms. Hereâ€™s what has happened:
1. My mom and sister sleep in the master bedroom.
2. My dad sleeps in the study on an ottoman which folds out into a bed. (Normally he would also sleep in the master bedroom but heâ€™s a doctor and is worried he may end up giving COVID-19 to everyone after he comes home from work.)
3. My grandma sleeps in my room.
4. My grandpa sleeps in my sisterâ€™s room. (My sister doesnâ€™t sleep in her room, she just keeps her stuff there and sleeps in the master bedroom.)
This more or less leaves me without a room to myself. This forces me to sleep in the family room or the formal living room (the place that guests sit when they come over). This leaves me without a place to work or keep my stuff (my grandma basically took over my entire room and she uses my desk all the time). My mom and dad are also getting a new house built and itâ€™s about halfway there, but the construction is going very slow (Itâ€™s not because of the coronavirus, itâ€™s actually because the carpenter is making wooden fixtures for other houses while he is at our new houseâ€™s construction site). Each time I tell my mom that I donâ€™t have my own place to work in my current house, she tells me that I just need to wait a few more weeks. But sheâ€™s been saying this for over three months and there havenâ€™t been any significant advancements in construction at our new house (which will have enough bedrooms for me to have my own while my grandparents stay with us) since April. Iâ€™m honestly not sure what to do and itâ€™s very irritating that I canâ€™t have my own room. Does anyone know how I can deal with this situation?
