I let another girl kiss me while I loved someone else... I'm 17, this was my first ever serious relationship but it was getting toxic for both me and my girlfriend. She decided to break-up since and it made sense, if it didn't create a fuss that is. Me being the weird narcissist decided to make it all about myself and ruined everything. Later shit happened and the ex decided to say she's sorry and wants to patch things up.
Now, during the break-up period (just 2 weeks) what my girlfriend decided was to go out somewhere with some other dude, get flowers and put those flowers as her profile picture. So naturally I refused diplomatically to her suggestion to patch things up.
2 months later, it's my friend's birthday and we all decided to meet up at his place, not a lot of people just 6 out of which there was one girl who was being overly clingy with me. 
During a truth or dare session, the girl gets a dare to kiss me, now the only other girl I've ever kissed is my ex whom I still love but in the midst of all the peer pressure I give in and let it happen. I immediately regret but don't show it. When we leave, I was sad and I called my ex and apologised for all the stuff that I had done when we we're together and then I hung up the call. 
I just wanted to vent. thanks for reading
