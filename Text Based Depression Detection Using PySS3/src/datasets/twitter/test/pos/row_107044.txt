Help me make a list of unwritten menâ€™s code of conduct rules written for all men and boys to see Rule 1: First and foremost, do not use a urinal adjacent to one that is currently occupied, unless said urinals have a stall wall between them that is no lower than eye height.

Rule 2: What happens in the locker room (or bathroom) stays in the locker room (or bathroom.)

This is what Iâ€™ve gotten so far, expand this list and spread it when finished to be displayed for all to see.
