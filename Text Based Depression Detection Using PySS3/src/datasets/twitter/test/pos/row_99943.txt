ive never had this feeling, nor have i ever cared about things like that, but today just felt different im just posting this because i dont have anyone to talk about, and ive been feeling shitty lately.

so i had my birthday on 7th of march. family etc congratulated me. but the thing is, no of my friends even congratulated me. not even my 2 closest. and i dont really care about things like that, but after the teachers said raise up and sing for (another kid that had birthday on 8th of march) made me somehow sad. teachers go around telling how they care but cant even sing a birthday song for a kid that had birthday in the weekend, literally a day before the other student? i literally sat for the rest of the class being in my world. i dont know, feels like i dont even have real friends.

sorry for posting i just needed to let this out, and no im not doing it to get any wishes from ppl ive never met lol
