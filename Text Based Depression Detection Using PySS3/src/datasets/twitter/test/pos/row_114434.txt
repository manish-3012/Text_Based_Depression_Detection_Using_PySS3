Aight boys girls and others that are willing to listen, I need help So thereâ€™s a girl that Iâ€™m crushing on and I donâ€™t know how she feels or what to do. Weâ€™ve been staying up until like 2 AM talking for the past few nights and Iâ€™m realizing more and more just how amazing she is. I feel like I can talk about even the most boring topics with her and the conversations never get old. Somehow we always have something to talk about. I want to ask her out but I have no idea how to or how sheâ€™ll feel about it. What do I do?
