I don't think I'm getting a new phone anytime soon. My dad is going to buy me an iphone but today when i turned on the motor that fills up the water tank  i forgot to turn it off. 

It has stopped working and is so hot that you could fry eggs on that. I don't think I'm getting a new phone anytime soon.
