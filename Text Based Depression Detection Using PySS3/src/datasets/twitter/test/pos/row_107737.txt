GCSE's in uk So in my school someone in year 11 got covid19 and we all have to isolate for the next 14 days. Everyone is super confused what to do as we've all been studying online since may. Since September we've been attending school and have had all classes in our yeargroup bubbles. We had some mocks last week and they were conducted in 'real' exam conditions. However now that we're in isolation, we are already behind in our syllabus and we're gonna lose out on more   studies. By the look of the number of cases rising, lockdown doesn't seem far off. Apparently they are deciding on having teacher assessed grades which is really messed up and our final GCSEs may be cancelled.
