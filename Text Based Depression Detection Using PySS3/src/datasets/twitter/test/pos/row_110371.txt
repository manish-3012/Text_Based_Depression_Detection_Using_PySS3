I hate wearing a mask. I hate wearing mask, not because it offends my human rights, and not because I have asthma.....

It's simply cause it fogs up my glasses. And if I really had to go outside then I only would wear one.

So for not wearing mask I simply stay at home.

So yes Karen, whether you have human rights or your doctor prescribed it, if you don't wanna wear a mask just simply stay inside home.
