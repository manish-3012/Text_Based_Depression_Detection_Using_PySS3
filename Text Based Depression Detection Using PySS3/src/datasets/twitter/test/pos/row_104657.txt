Please help me I donâ€™t know what to do. So hypothetically I like this girl who is semi-shy, we donâ€™t really know each other too well, and sheâ€™s been hitting on me occasionally every few months since this time 2020. Last week we spent a good 30 minutes texting, then the next day she left me on read immediately after opening my last text the millisecond after I sent it. We donâ€™t really know each other too well and I donâ€™t really know how to approach this as we barely even talked when we used to go to the same school. Weâ€™re not total strangers but we also barely know each other so itâ€™s weird to approach in general. Hypothetically what should I do?
