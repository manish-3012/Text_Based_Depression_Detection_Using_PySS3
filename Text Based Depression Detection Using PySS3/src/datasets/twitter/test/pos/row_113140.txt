This sub should be proof that they need to start teaching LGBT+ history in schools. The amount of straight guys who think they know anything about being LGBT+ on this sub is very annoying. All the time i see you straights saying things that you think are right but are lowkey homophobic/transphobic/any type of phobic. 

Youâ€™s need to learn about what we go through and what our type of people used to go through before you can tell us stuff like â€œoh saying â€œstraggotâ€ is just as offensive as saying â€œf****tâ€â€.

I hope schools start teaching stuff like this soon because the straights need to be taught.

Anyways cant wait for you straightsâ€™s lovely, annoying and borderline homophobic commentsâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸
