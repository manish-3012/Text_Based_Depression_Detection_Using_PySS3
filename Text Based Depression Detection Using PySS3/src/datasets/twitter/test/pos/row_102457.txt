Any sneaking out advice lmao? My mom has always said that if I want to go out cuz Iâ€™m mad or need space then I can I just need to tell her first and she will let me go to a friends. 
And Iâ€™ve found walking has really helped clear my head of stress and basically everything recently so Iâ€™ve enjoyed going for long walks. But here is the catch:
Sometimes Iâ€™ll over think at night and need to go for a walk but I wouldnâ€™t be allowed passed a certain time...
So basically long story short any advice for sneaking out incase I (or someone else) may need it?
