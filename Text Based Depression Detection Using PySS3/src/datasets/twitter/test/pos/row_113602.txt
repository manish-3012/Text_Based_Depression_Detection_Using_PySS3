I am confused and mad So on starters I eat a lot but am not fat. So my mom tells me to do exercise and I agree and do it.so anyways we get to the push-ups and she said "ok Do 25" and I said "That's a little to much" and out of nowhere she said this " Well You eat to much" in a mean way. And then I was confused and mad.so we start getting into an argument and then she blames me for saying "That's to much" like I'm on the verge of losing my sanity.P.S this has been going on for several years and my mom is an alcoholic and a smoker. Thank you for listening.
