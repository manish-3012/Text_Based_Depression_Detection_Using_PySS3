HELP I confessed to my crush and I need help deciphering their response So I just confessed to my crush (we're both girls) like "y'know how I told you I was bi? I think I kinda have a crush on you" and they just responded with "ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚it's okay" and "well I have school tomorrow so goodnight"

So now what? I have no idea what that means- like it wasn't a rejection? But it wasn't an agreement either. I'm just so confused pls help
