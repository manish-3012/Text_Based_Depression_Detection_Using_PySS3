My Classmates and teachers are simps For some context about 2 weeks ago I came to my grandmother's house, and 5 days ago my hindi teacher, he hates me to the gut and I hate him to the gut, assigned us a project which I could not do since I did not have my books or any school supplies with me ( I am pretty sure that y'all are gonna start judging me for this and think that I am a bad student, well no I am pretty good at most subjects, Hindi is one of the subjects I am bad at ) so I messaged my class' WhatsApp group, which has teachers in it too,  that they can postpone it for some days, like till 1st September since 31st august is the day I am returning to my home, with no reply, so on the last day of submission I messaged the WhatsApp group 4 TIMES requesting the postponing of the deadline, with again no reply, so I have a female friend, who is pretty popular in the school, and I private messaged her saying "I know this is a pretty dumb idea but I wanna know if our classmates are simps, so can you message the class WhatsApp group requesting the postponing of deadline" and she replied "yeah sure, I know this is a dumb idea but I wanna see what happens lmao, and I read your texts in the group" to which I replied "thanks girl". About 5 minutes after that she texted the group requesting a postponing of deadline to which 9 guys immediately replied stuff like "yes sir, please do it, I agree with her" and shit. And then the teacher POSTPONED THE DEADLINE TO 1ST SEPTEMBER, then she private messaged me "shit dude, I didn't think this would actually work, and your hypothesis is confirmed our teacher and classmates are simps, absolutely disgusting"
