Whats the best way to let a guy know that they mean a lot to you? The guy I like has been feeling pretty insecure lately so I think I should put some more effort into our 'relationship' (we're not actually dating because tbh the idea freaks me out, especially because we haven't met in person yet :/ but he really means a lot to me).  So is there anything you think he'd appreciate?

I'm posting it here because we're both teens but still pretty darn serious
