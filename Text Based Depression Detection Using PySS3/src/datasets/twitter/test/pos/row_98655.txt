Do you know what fucking annoys me? so my girlfriend likes to talk to me a lot, and mostly about her feelings and problems, but what I don't understand is why when she tells me her problems, and I offer solutions, she gets fucking pissed girls, can you explain, I've noticed she is not the only girl ik who does this, not to generalize or anything, But why does she get mad when u offer her solutions to her problems? It is causing a strain in our relationship.
