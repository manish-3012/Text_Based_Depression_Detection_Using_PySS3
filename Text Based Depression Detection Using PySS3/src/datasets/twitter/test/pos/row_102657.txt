Story:
So, Im a girl who likes tall, clean faced, chubby guys, and had a friend like this. Heâ€™s adorable. He looks like a big olâ€™ teddy bear. I got a lot of my dark sense of humor from him and heâ€™s overall just really funny and kind to me. I am on Reddit often, so I learned a thing or two about men. I saw a post saying how men like when women make the first move, so I texted him first today. I understand most guys sense of humor; jokes about genocide, gross stuff and crusades, so I made the text in a way it looked like it was supposed to be a joke, so if he got weirded out, I had a plan B. The text went like this; (note: this was just talk. None of us actually want to do these things)

Me: Can we go on a date to Chuckâ€™eâ€™Cheese and I bite your neck with children screaming and running beneath our feet and the place smells like foot fungus â¤ï¸ that would be so romantic 

Him: you might be my soulmate (lol I knew I was headed in the right direction)

Him: and then when weâ€™re done eating our gourmet aids pizza we can drown the children in the ball pit and give them hives

This went back and forth until I sent him a pic of a ring pop in an engagement ring case and said to marry me. This was meant to be a complete joke, until we talked for a couple more minutes and we exchanged snaps. He friend requested me and I messaged him â€œhey bbâ€ and we talked for an hour and I remember us referencing videogames like Star Wars and Spider-Man, sending blursed images to each other, etc. Then I asked him how it felt to have a gothic gamer gf. (Referencing â€œbig titty goth gfâ€ meme) and that was the first time one of us brought up the girlfriend-boyfriend topic. He said it felt great. Thatâ€™s when we made it official. 

Today is a good day. And because of this day, I will pass my luck on to whoever reading. Have a good day, people of Reddit.
