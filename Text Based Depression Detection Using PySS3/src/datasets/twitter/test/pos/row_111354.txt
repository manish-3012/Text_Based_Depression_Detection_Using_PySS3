We have PE online classes For some reason they put 4 PE periods (3h 20m) in our week schedule. Like what are we meant to do? Play basketball with my PC as the hoop?. Most students don't even have a camera. They're making us wake up at 7 AM and the first 2 periods on monday and thursday like have you heard of sleep? Tiredness? It's really stupid and I hate it.
