Iâ€™m still waiting, going on a lot of hours. I have really liked this girl for a long time. I told her, a few months ago. I asked her out a few months ago, and she said that she didnâ€™t want a relationship at time. Now, Iâ€™m certain she likes me. Our mutual friend says sheâ€™s in love with me, and that Iâ€™m in love with her. She really enjoys talking to me, and I do to. She sent pictures of herself and asked what I thought of them. We FaceTime for hours everyday for months now. We havenâ€™t recently because of school. But just last night she said that we needed to FaceTime soon. So I called her today, no answer. Minutes later she called. She said â€œhiâ€ and it was so high pitched it couldâ€™ve broke glass, and itâ€™s not near that high with other people. Then he hung up right after because her mom called her. I asked if she was okay because I didnâ€™t know what happened. She told me that her mom called and that she would call me back later. Itâ€™s been nearly 6 hours and no call. I waited 18 hours just for a â€œhiâ€. Iâ€™m just going to wait for tomarrow and see what happens.
