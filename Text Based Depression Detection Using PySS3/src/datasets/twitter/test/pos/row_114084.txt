I need help figuring out the name of my childhood game So whenever I went to my daycare after school she let us play this video game that I have very faint but nostolgic memories toward. All I remember from this video game is that it was on the PS2, it was very colorful, and was a platfromer. I also remember a level that you were in a hot air balloon that that was the shape of an elephants face. This has been bugging me for the past 2 years and I can't find anything online.
