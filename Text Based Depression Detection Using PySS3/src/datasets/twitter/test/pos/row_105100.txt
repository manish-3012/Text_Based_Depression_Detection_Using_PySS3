Staying at cousin's house for a few period of days. Any ideas for what we can do together so can we actually have a good time? I'm pretty close with said cousin, and I'm going there for a few days.

I'm pretty excited, but a lot of the time when we're with each other for a while, we don't know what to do, and we end up just being bored and going on our phones for most of the time we're there.

When we were kids, (well I guess you could say we're still kids, but we're teenagers now) we used to have a blast everytime we met up, but now we're older it's not the same.

I really want to have a good time, it's been a while since I actually hung out with anyone. 

I brought a few board and card games, a few movies we can watch, and my mom gave me 25$ to spend while I'm there, but besides that I'm not really sure what fun things we could do.

Any ideas? What would you do if you're at a close relatives house for a while?
