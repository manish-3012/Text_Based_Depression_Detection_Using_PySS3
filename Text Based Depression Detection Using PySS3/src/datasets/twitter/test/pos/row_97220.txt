Learning History in Europe So I like a lot history and try to learn as much as I can, I'm particularly interested in the late Middle Ages and 19th century to the 1920s. The problem is that in Spain there are a lot of fascist (in the present) and in turns out that it seems they are the most interested in History and I have to deal with them everyday.

 Furthermore I like to express how much I am interested Prussian history (although I don't know much yet) so people think I'm a nazi, although I am interested in an earlier period and the monarchy was absolutely opposed to Hitler's ideals

 Long story short, I am afraid people might think I'm a fascist
