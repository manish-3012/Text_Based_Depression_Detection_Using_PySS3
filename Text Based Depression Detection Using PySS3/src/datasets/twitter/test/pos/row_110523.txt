Iâ€™m convinced my cat of nine years is working with foxes to get rid of our dog of just over two years. Yes, you read that title right, and no iâ€™m not crazy (i think). So every night i walk my dog along the same route, and majority of the times i see foxes, and also my cat in his usual spot on a low wall.

I was walking my usual route tonight, and i get to the spot where my cat normally is and what do i see? A fox just chilling there with him, not attacking him or anything. And then this fox spots me and my dog and bolts... I mean what the hell??? 

I canâ€™t have imagined it because my dog spotted the fox as well, and your telling me that animals canâ€™t communicate? I am now questioning if Iâ€™m overthinking this but surely you guys can agree that that is a bit odd... right? I am genuinely baffled and also slightly concerned. Does anyone have any idea what the hell could have been happening? Please tell me Iâ€™m not crazy.
