Does this happen to anyone else? I always almost cry but I never do. I donâ€™t know what it is but I suddenly get emotionally moved and i feel like Iâ€™m gonna cry but I canâ€™t. It doesnâ€™t even have to be significant pretty much anything that sparks any kind of sadness will cause it. I think itâ€™s worth noting that I have had trouble crying in the past, I was always able to cry but I did a lot less than everyone around me. I canâ€™t even remember the last time I cried and yet I almost cry around 10 times a day.
