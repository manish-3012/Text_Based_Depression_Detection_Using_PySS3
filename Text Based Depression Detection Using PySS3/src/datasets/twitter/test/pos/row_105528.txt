I somehow made a profit out of school. So last week I was on Holidays, and I was in some homework group thingy without me knowing.
 
I triggered some bad whiplash this week, so I missed like all the classes except today, where in HAAS we had to do a presentation about the thing for the homework thing we were doing. 

And so I came back today, and we had to do said presentation, and one of my friends in the group offered me 5 dollars to read it out, naturally I said I wanted 10 dollars, and we settled on 9 dollars since that is what he had.

So I earned 9 dollars to read out something on the board. I said to the teacher that they did everything, so hopefully I don't get graded for something I didn't help with.

I am just surprised as fuck that I got 9 dollars for just reading out something
