Never swim in a public pool eyes closed. In the summer holidays in December, I was at a public pool with my friends because it was a scorcher of a day. Now, I don't exactly know why I did this, but I completely forgot to bring goggles, meaning that I would keep my head above the water at most times so I wouldn't irritate my eyes with bacteria infested pee-water. After about 15 or so minutes swimming, my friends challenge me to a breath-holding competition, so we all go underwater to hold our breath. While I was underwater, my eyes were closed so I had no idea of my surroundings. After I couldn't hold my breath any longer, I kick off from the base of the pool with my mouth open and start shooting towards the surface, however, because my mouth was open and I couldn't see what was around me, I swam right up into the path of a lone band-aid and it goes into my open mouth. I fucking died of grossness.
