ok, everyone let me tell you about the first time i saw tiddies so, i was about 9 years of age, i think

i go out of my room, and there in the living room, the tv, my parents aren't really paying attention to it, they're, but i, i look at it and there is a documentary about some band, idk why i even started to watch, i was bored i guess.

and then the moment happens just some random footage of they're fans screaming and yelling, boom its hits my a girl takes off her shirt and im appalled.

wtf fuck is this, I say to myself, is that how women look? ok. its fine i guess

i did i said it
