LISTEN TO THIS DUDES *dabs unironically* Holy frick. Holy frickin frick. Aight so this morning i was jus chillin in 1st block right? Hangin and banging as the bruvs say, when my crush walks in. So obviously i say hi and be akward  and stuff, and then she pulls out some lil bb donut holes. And im lookin at them the way you look at donut holes and stuff, but then she pulls out ANOTHER ONE AND ITS FOR ME. She kinda hangs around me sometimes but i dont think much of it. But today she was extra friendly-flirty and stuff.
So im tryna find a way to ask her on a date i guess. So thats cool. Thanks for listening reddit lololol




(Btw idk what flair this is but rant kinda fits so ye)
