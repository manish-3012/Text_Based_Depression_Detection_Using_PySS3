Hello, I have an idea for a twitch stream but IDK if people will actually want to watch it. So, my idea for the stream is pretty much me scrolling through a few antiquities sites, and checking out the stuff they have (mostly coins, but a lot of other stuff). Most of the stuff on the site is ancient (mostly pre 600 AD) and I know a little about the history behind the stuff. But IDK if people would like it. Please give me your ideas!
