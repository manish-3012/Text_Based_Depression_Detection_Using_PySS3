I kinda got behind schedule with learning for next week testweek I have 8 tests

4 of them ive already studied for

2 i studied good

The other 2 minimal

The other 4 i didnt do anything yet

I still have 3 days so the only option i have is to pull 3 all nighters and dont tell my parents. If i tell them they freak out.

Its still possible for me to do it but super hard.
