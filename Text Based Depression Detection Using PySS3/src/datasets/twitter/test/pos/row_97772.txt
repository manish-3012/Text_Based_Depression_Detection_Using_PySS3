I need help and i'm lost in this situation and idk what to do. So basically i really like this boy and i have liked him for 3 years.
And I've been chatting to him alot over text and a little irl but more over text.
We've got really close recently. 
My friend asked him something which i didnt want her to ask. She asked if u were to go out with one or the other of us who would u pick. And of course he picked her.
The first person I've ever actually liked like that and I've been friend zoned :/
He said he only likes me as a close friend.
And I'm lost. I've been writing a book about this relationship and its just gone down hill so yea i need help.
Also he picked the same gcse options as me so he's in lots of my lessons.
Art, photography, and i picked business but he picked pe.
