My chemistry teacher pisses me off So this year I am taking chemistry and my teacher seems like she is fresh out of college. In class we are doing significant figures and what not. And she say COCulator instead of calculator. It pisses me off so much. I want to speak up and tell her how to pronounce it, but I donâ€™t want to come off as a dick.
