My feet hurt I've worked about 6 hours in a hot ass kitchen this week but that's ok nothing I'm not use to. But these new shoes arnt helping, after messing around with some old friends I've gotten back in touch with I've ended up walking 20km in the same shoes. In my part of the world it's summer however we don't have the 4 seasons we have wet seasone (northern Australia) so obviously it's very very wet, we got 1000mm of rain last week. Now my feet are itchy purple and it's hard to walk on, even when I was in the army cadets I never had something like this. I think I have early trench foot.
