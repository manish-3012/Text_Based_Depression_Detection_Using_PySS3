Guys I need help with my homophobic parents blocking my access to talk with friends So my parents decided to look through my phone without permission

Then they decided to go to my discord and backread

they found my messages with a non binary person

Turns out they don't support that 

They try to make sure that I understand that these people have something wrong with them mentally

next day I change my passwords so they don't go through my stuff without permission

Now they're even more mad and tell me that I'm not allowed to do that and that I'm not allowed to keep anything from them (absolutely nothing) until I'm 20 years old

They also now think that my classmates and gay people are the reason why I'm like this

Now I'm not allowed to talk with them anymore

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I should do (sorry for bad formatting but I need advice)
