Yooo got my first complement of the year yesterday. Yesterday at school we had a dress up day for halloween, and I went as Dr. Doofinschmirtz. I was the only person in the whole school to dress up, besides one of my friends who went as someone from Naruto. But when I went to school no one really cared or asked what I was, they just went "Ight, ain't the weirdest thing this month." But in my last period this one girl said, "I like your lab coat." And that is the first compliment I've gotten this year. Should keep me emotionally satisfied for the next three years, when I expect to get my next compliment.
