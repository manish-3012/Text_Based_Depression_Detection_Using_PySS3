I have a really stupid career plan Thereâ€™s a solid 90% chance it wonâ€™t work out, but I thought â€œsince I have so many passions, and Iâ€™m a loner anyways, why donâ€™t I just... do them all?â€ I want to open a plant store, become a teacher, who knows maybe I could try doing artwork commissions in 5-10 years when Iâ€™m better at it, hell even songwriting is something Iâ€™m interested in pursuing. I donâ€™t want to stay in the same career for more than 5 years, that sounds too boring. Yeah itâ€™s dumb but itâ€™s something Iâ€™d do lmao
