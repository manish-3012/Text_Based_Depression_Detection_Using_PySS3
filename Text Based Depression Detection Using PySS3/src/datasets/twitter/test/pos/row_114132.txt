Iâ€™ve been having trouble with motivation I love playing guitar, piano, and drums but I canâ€™t necessarily play any of them. Even thought I love  when I play the said instruments I canâ€™t get myself to actually do lessons, or try to self teach myself. I love messing with them but I canâ€™t stay focused and end up just messing around. Got any tips to fix this issue?
