Am I a bad person? Ok so we got our schedules today, and I wanted to make sure this girl didnâ€™t have the same classes as me. I used to be friends with her, but the entirety of last year, she was a total bitch. She would flaunt all he accomplishments in my face and brag about shit like Christmas presents. I donâ€™t know why, but she was competing with me, and only me. Anyways, I hate her, so I just wanted to make sure. And I knew her birthday and her student number, so I just logged into her account for school, got her schedule, and got out. Iâ€™ve actually done this a few times for different reasons. Am I a bad person for doing this?
