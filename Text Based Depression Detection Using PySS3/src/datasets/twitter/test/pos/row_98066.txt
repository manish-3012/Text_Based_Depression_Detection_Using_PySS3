i convinced my mom that Donald trump, North Korea and bill gates were behind coronavirus ok so basically i was shitting around and my mom brought in the story that I was making in front of my dad. and i now messed up because after I told her that everything was a lie, she thought I was covering something up and believed the lie.


help what do I do next



ps. My mom is not a Karen, she is just very gullible, and doesnâ€™t really know English that well; plus since I do everything for her she really trusts me
