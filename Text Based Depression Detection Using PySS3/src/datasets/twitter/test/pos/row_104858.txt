Am I a sjw and how do I not be one Uhh so basically Tumblr is like the only social media I can get away with having and I'm not really a fan of reddit idk why, so I've been on Tumblr for like a year and got pretty popular just posting stupid stuff, and tumblr really is a n echo chamber so I can feel it changing the way I think about a lot of things, and I wish I could go back to a more normal standpoint. Like a lot of tumblrs audience and therefore my social circle is almost always gay trans nonbinary traumatized people (I'm gay myself but it's not like, a core part of my personality). And I'm not saying there's anything wrong w those people and I respect them, I just don't like the person I've become
