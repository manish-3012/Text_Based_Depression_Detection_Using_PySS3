We're less alone than we think Age, Race, Nationality, Religion, Clothing, Income, Neighborhood - these are some of the many fake dividers we are told makes us different. Different morals, different hopes, different pain, different struggles, different hearts, different tears.

**But itâ€™s not True**.

Just like itâ€™s not True that Bjork, Biggie Smalls, Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube, The Beastie Boys, Queen, Fiona Apple, Queen Latifah, and Sting are any different.

**All of us, just like the music we listen to, have been placed into Genres**, and weâ€™ve been made to believe different genres are about different things. This is a lie and itâ€™s a lie that keeps us, all of us Brothers and Sisters, separated, angry at each other, dismissive, resentful, and WEAK. You want to know how â€œThe Manâ€ wins? By keeping us thinking we are different.

**Genres divide based on style, not substance. Genres divide based on SOUND, not on the MESSAGE.**

I play my Mom System of a Down and she cringes and makes faces at their **style**. Then I play it for her again but have the lyrics up on my computer screen and even though she isnâ€™t able to totally get over the **style** (she still cringes and makes faces), she will say over and over â€œI never would have known thatâ€™s what they were sayingâ€. She sees the lyrics and with a little help interpreting the words through the style she sees they are singing about things she feels. My Mom is 72.

Every one of the artists I mentioned above (and those are just examples, most every great artist of any Genre is on that list), sing about **waking up, being trapped in a prison, not being a sheep, Unity, Love, Brainwashing**. They sing about their weakness, their blindness, their mistakes, their heartache.

Who thinks a black manâ€™s tears and a white manâ€™s tears feel different?

Is there anyone reading this who hasnâ€™t cried? Is there anyone reading this who hasnâ€™t felt sorrow or rage or unfairness or fear? Is there anyone reading this who has never felt alone?

**No Genres**

In the last 100 years or so weâ€™ve added another Genre, and this one is a killer â€“ itâ€™s called the â€œWeâ€™ve had it Worseâ€ Genre. And anyone not in that Genre is told they have â€œprivilegeâ€, that they arenâ€™t allowed to talk about their pain, that they donâ€™t understand what itâ€™s like..  
 

Itâ€™s true some people have a triple helping of pain in their Lives and others have a single. But **pain is not a competition. Empathy doesnâ€™t go only to the most injured person**.

Who would walk by a vet in a wheelchair with no legs and a catheter bag full of urine who was asking for some change and tell them they were privileged, because two blocks away there was a vet in a wheelchair with no legs and a catheter bag full of urine and only one arm? Would this second vet come up to the first and tell them they lived a life of privilege and no one wanted to hear about their troubles. I should hope not.

**Nobody wins the â€œIâ€™ve been hurt more competitionâ€,** and what if they did? What if one genre of people were awarded â€œThe Most hurt Trophyâ€. You know what happens next? All the other people in all the other Genres turn and tell them to â€œGet over itâ€ (like they were just told they had to do). Thereâ€™s no recognition and no reward. Only enmity. Because when we compete, **the winner makes everyone else a loser**. **The winner makes everyone else the one at fault**.

Take down the divide of this Genre my Brothers and Sisters and Neithers and Boths, and every other classification of human â€“ I Love you all.

**PLEASE** **TAKE DOWN THESE DIVIDERS AND LETS LET GO OF OUR BLAME, LET GO OF THE FANTASY SOMEONE BUILT THAT TELLS US THE PEOPLE WE HATE ARENâ€™T SUFFERING TOO.**

Take down all the Genres and weâ€™ll find that thereâ€™s only 2 Genres based on substance:   The first is filled with people trying their best not to be jerks and thinking they are trying to make this a nicer and kinder world.  The second is filled with people who feel like they don't care about you or me.  They do deep inside, because everyone does deep inside I think, but they have been hurt real bad at some point and now they have so much rage, and anger, and feelings of unfairness inside them that they act mean because it gives them temporary relief.  Both Genres are made up of people from every race, creed, religion, nationality, and sex. No group has any kind of monopoly on being mean.  And most of us will go back and forth between the two genres at different times in our life.

Take note of this and see it with open and unbiased eyes.  You will see itâ€™s not the white men sub-genre who make life so hard.  You'll also see it's not the black men sub-genre.  You'll see no more greed from someone just because they are from the Jewish sub-genre, and no more judgement from someone just because they are from the Christian one.  Every one of those groups, or genres is filled mostly with people who just want to survive and not get too hurt, who are dealing with a lifetime of pain and disappointment (as most of us are), and who care.

We **ARE NOT** as alone as we are told we are. But what makes it seem like we are, is when we seek solidarity and understanding only in our Genre.  Because so long as there is an "us", then there will always be a "them".  There is no "them".  
 

Love,
