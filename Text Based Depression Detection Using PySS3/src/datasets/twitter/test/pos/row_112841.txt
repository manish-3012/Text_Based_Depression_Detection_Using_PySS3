She doesnt like me and there are more things So i asked her straight to the point why shes so distant to me the last couple days.

She said she thinks itâ€™s annoying i say shit about her friends, i mean shes not wrong but me and most of her friends cant really fit in with eachother.

Then the following:

Me: do u see me as a good friend?

She: why

Me: im just wondering if u still think im friendly

She: yeah u still are

Me: u too but sometimes im just worried u dont like me anymore because i overthink a lot

She: I understand 

I am 200% sure she doenst like me how i like her and that me and her will never get into a relationship. 

The day when she switched classes at school because of her grades really ruined everything, it split us up and she has new friends now and there are new guys around her. I feel like shes trying to push me away and have a new life.

But i want to be with her and i already know her for 4 years only everything was screwed up when she went to a different class
