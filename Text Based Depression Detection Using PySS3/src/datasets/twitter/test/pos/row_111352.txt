Bruh... Im lost So about a yearish ago i recovered from anorexia, but when quarentine started in march i started losing weight again, i was dieting and all but i wouldnt quite say i relapsed i mean, i felt in control. But i managed to lose 10kg (22lbs) and i guess that's good??? But now im looking in the mirror and for the first time im realising how skinny ive become. I can see my ribs again and all my bones. Idk dude. I dont wanna lose any more weight but im scared of gaining it all back and im still restricting even if im not trying to. Idk what to do
