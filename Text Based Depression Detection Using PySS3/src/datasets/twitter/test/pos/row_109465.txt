Advice on getting called cute by a guy? Ok so the following thing just happened to me on the bus and I'm just shocked because I never thought this would happen to me in a million years.

Guy across from me: \*hands me his phone\*

"hey i just wanted to say i think ur cute and i had to write it here because i have bad anxiety and i get really nervous talking to new people" 

me: "thank you! that's ok, i understand it can be hard to know what to say sometimes!"

him: "i just wanted to ask if i could get your number so we could talk but i know you just met me and i fully expect you to say no so it's fine if you don't want to"

me: "will you be on the bus a lot? i don't really feel comfortable giving out my number to people but we can still talk here!"

him: \*head nod\*

What do I do? I just realized I won't be on the bus Monday or Tuesday because of practice, so I'll only see him on Wednesday.

The truth is, I'm not really allowed to date because of my parents because they think dating is a distraction to studies and that I'm too young , which I get. I also am not really interested in him, but I don't want to let him down too hard, because I know how hard it can be to screw up the courage to talk to someone, especially someone you like. I feel like a pretty big asshole because I led him on, but I really don't want to hurt his feelings. I've never been called cute by a guy before, or had my number asked for, so I don't really know how to handle it. What do I do, fellow teenagers?
