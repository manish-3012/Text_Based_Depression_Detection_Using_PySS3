Hereâ€™s a story So hereâ€™s a little thing I found funny when my stepfather died my brother just texts me and I quote â€œso uh we think t is deadâ€ (t is stepfather) and then like 30 minutes later â€œif he wasnâ€™t before he is nowâ€ and I was like what and he said dude he hasnâ€™t moved in half an hour.

 I said oh. I thought you did something 

He replies nah. 

Anyway thatâ€™s my story
