Is this a good apology for your crush? Rewrite Post #3 hey, just wanted to apologize cause I feel like Ive done or have said some very stupid things latelyÂ  that may have annoyed youÂ  :/. and I'm genuinely sorry if Ive made you feel awkward. 

Bad life choices aside, Ig I just wanted to see if we could start over? I say this cause honestly, you just seem like a cool potential friend and an awesome person in general. at one point it felt like we had decent chemistryÂ  as far as snap goes.. but things  change I guess

So that's why if you say no,  i promise I'll  leave you aloneÂ , it's fine
