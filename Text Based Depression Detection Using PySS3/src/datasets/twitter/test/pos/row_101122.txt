To be happy Idk where else to go rn since im basically alone almost all day so i wanted to see if there were answers for me here. But how do i try to be happy? Im alone most of my time and im in love with this girl but not only does she seem much happier without me, but we also seem to be having a falling out where i feel like she doesnt want to love me anymore and its driving me to sadness. Idk what to do and i dont really have the types of friends where they ask me to hang out since im basically just a loner type so idk what im supposed to do to help myself feel better. I cant even talk to my family about it. Like i just want to be happy but i cant.
