my sister just said that every white person is racist. It's an interesting perspective. she is saying that she is racist because she has a slight inherent racial bias. despite the fact that she fights against various racist instagram accounts on a daily basis, she claims that she is racist because she is white. this feels like an extreme perspective, but frankly I couldn't win a debate against 3 snakes in a trenchcoat.
