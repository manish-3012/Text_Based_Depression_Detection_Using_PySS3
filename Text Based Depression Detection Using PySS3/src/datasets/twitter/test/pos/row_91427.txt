I'm bored and sad I'm just bored. Its almost midnight where I live, I'm not tired, and I have no one to talk to. All I've been doing this past hour is eating and browsing Reddit. Now I'm just sad that I'm bored, and that I have no one to talk to. My mom and sis are sleeping and I have no one to text that I haven't already. Idek why I'm posting this. Just trying to pass some time, I guess? Wanna talk about anything? Or link me to some funny vids or posts, idk.
