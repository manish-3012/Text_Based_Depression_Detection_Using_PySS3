Tommorow is my Dog, Samuel's Birthday :) Idk if y'all would care but like, Could you wish him a happy birthday in advance? He's the bestest doggo ( all dogs are bestest doggos in my book ) we cuddle everyday and he's just the cutest shiba I've ever met :D

I really want to thank my mom for getting me Samuel!  Thanks mom! &lt;3
