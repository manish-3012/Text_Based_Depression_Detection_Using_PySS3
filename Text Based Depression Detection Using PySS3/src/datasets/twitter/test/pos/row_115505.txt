Poor choice of words, I was playing DOMINATION on call of duty modern warfare with a friend. I flanked to Charlie flag, as itâ€™s the better spawn on that map. And as I was far into their spawn I exclaim to my friend, â€œIâ€™m deep inside Charlieâ€ plot twist is Iâ€™m bi, and I havenâ€™t told him yet. And the icing on the cake, I made the mistake 2 more times in the same session.
