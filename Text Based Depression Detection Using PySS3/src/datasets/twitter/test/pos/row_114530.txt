Pieces of advice to avoid procrastination. You know who you are. 1. You see, what I used to do is that i don't work in my room, and I go in a place where it's very easy for people to see what I'm doing, that way it's more risky to put on anything else than work. Then, I put on music that relaxes me, and I run through it.  
2. Put on a timer for 30 minutes, if you get distracted, the timer will eventually go and you will be reminded that you have to finish the work.
3. START. NOW. no matter what, it's best to get it done as quickly as possible, but don't rush it. If you don't remember how to do the assignment, please study a bit for it. 
4. Make sure to take breaks. That way you won't be tired and will have a fresh mind. Don't sleep till 4 AM, unless it's absolutely necessary.
5. If you purposely turned in a corrupt file, know that it will affect your grade. Don't just leave it hanging for months on end.
