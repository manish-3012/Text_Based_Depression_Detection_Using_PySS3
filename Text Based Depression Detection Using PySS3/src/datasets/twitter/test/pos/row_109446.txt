I still canâ€™t move on from my first girlfriend and itâ€™s causing my mental state to deteriorate She broke up with me over discord dms around mid July and the last time I saw her in person was in May. She meant the fucking world to me and I know it sounds like Iâ€™m just being a bitch and not moving on but this shit I donâ€™t take lightly. Iâ€™m incredibly bad at social interaction and tend to avoid people Iâ€™m not very familiar with so when I when I was with her I felt like I would never need someone else ever again. Then when COVID hit and everyone in my school was sent home for distance learning. Everything just fell apart, after my visit to her in May it felt like so me that we werenâ€™t as close to each other. Ever since she broke up with me my mental state was at an all time low. I didnâ€™t want to eat, sleep, or be around anyone. I couldnâ€™t focus in school and to this day I still canâ€™t move on from her. She meant to much to me to lose. Honestly right now Iâ€™m not sure what Iâ€™m gonna do with my life. Please donâ€™t think Iâ€™m asking for pity. I just really needed to get this out there since this is the only subreddit where people will understand where Iâ€™m coming from. Thank you for reading this.
