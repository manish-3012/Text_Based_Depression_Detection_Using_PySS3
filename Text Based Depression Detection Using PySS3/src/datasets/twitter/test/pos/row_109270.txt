Not sure if Anybody would be interested, but a comedy series that Iâ€™ve been working on since freshman year of high school is coming to an end and I want you all to see it live! So one day my freshman year of high school my friend and I were bored so he grabbed a camera and we went out in the hall to film our lunch period. We did it again the next week. Eventually we started posting these videos regularly and letâ€™s just say they got a bit...stupid. 

The first few episodes are pretty timid and awkward for me to watch and share now because of how young I was (14 but I looked 11), but I really hope I can make some people laugh. 

This series means a lot to me and the dozens of people who have cameos, co star, or have helped produce every episode. The characters are just my friends at high school and maybe you guys will have a favorite!

Anyways, the final episode premieres on Saturday 9PM EST. There is a trailer up for it now. 

A few things that actually did happen on the show: 

1. The last line in almost every episode since 2017 has been â€œJoe Biden is your presidentâ€â€”it was total satire but turns out there may have been some future seeing involved who knows

2. We have parodied several tv genres to varying degrees of success

3. We created a very VERY convoluted story full of conspiracies, battles, and maybe a small bit of dimensional hopping. 

4. My hair goes from short and spiked to shoulder length. 

5. Despacito 2 was released

If any of this has piqued your interest you can find it by searching for â€œThe Lost Files of Johnâ€ on YouTube. There are playlists for all 3 seasons complete with our season finales. Please be nice Iâ€™ve never shared this with anyone outside of my school and I really hope people like it!

TL;DR

The Lost Files of John offers a unique blend of comedy and awkwardness with enough head scratching plot twists and plot holes to leave you thinking for days. Check it out on YouTube and catch the premiere of the final episode this Saturday!
