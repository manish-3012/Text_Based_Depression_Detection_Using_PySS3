Does anyone else love the LGBTQ community but aren't part of it? Like damm I love seeing posts and stories about pepole being themselves it just warms my heart. And as a straight guy I can agree with alot of the points lesbian and bi girls make about cute girls. That's it I guess, I really hope anyone seeing this can be proud of who they are no matter what!
