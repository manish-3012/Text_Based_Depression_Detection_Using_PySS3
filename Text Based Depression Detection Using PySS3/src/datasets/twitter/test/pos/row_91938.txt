Survey on Hours spent on hobbies/personal time Vs Average semester mark. Hello!

I am currently taking a data management class. For the final assignment, I chose to collect data on the average GPA and the hours spent doing personal time and hobbies each week.

It would be great if I could get some responses; the survey is two questions and takes under a minute to complete. If people are interested in the results, I may be able to post some graphs/Insights.

Thank You :)
