So I need a little advice I found out my girlfriend is in a group chat with 3 other people where they do something similar to D&amp;D but they said Iâ€™m not allowed to join. I feel like Iâ€™m just being paranoid but I have a lot of trust issues and I really hate not knowing whatâ€™s happening in it. Does anyone have anything helpful I could do to not feel this way?
