I hate people who judge marvel and dc solely on the movies I honestly hate these people. As a lil bit of a dc lover, ive collected a few comics (not many cus i dont live near a bookshop that sells them) and ive watched most dc movies, and some episodes of the animated tv series and also talk about them with my friends. I dont hate marvel, in fact i like marvel as well. Characters like spiderman and quicksilver have always been in my top favourite heroes, and ive collected some comics of theirs as well. Seeing as i know a little bit about these two companies, i figured i should speak up about this. Dont judge something as widespread and popular as superheroes, with multiple different ways of shoeing them, solely on the movies. Sure, dc movies suck, except for a few and hopefully not the new ones, but the comics are fantastic, and have always intrigued me. Same for marvel. Just because you didnt like the captain marvel movie doesnt mean marvel is bad and dc is better. They both have comics to read, so why not read them? They have live action and animated tv shows, so why not judge the companies on them? Its just really annoying when i hear my classmates, with no knowledge about the 2 companies at all, say one is better than the other just because of a film. I may not have the best comic book knowledge, but at least ik that much

TL;DR: im annoyed that people judge marvel and dc solely on their movies and they should judge them on comics and tv shows too, for a fair comparison.
