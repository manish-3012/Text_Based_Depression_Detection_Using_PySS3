Goodbye for a while, guys. Goodbye.

&amp;#x200B;
If y'all don't recognise i'm the guy who posted the trump jojo style pic.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having to leave reddit because:

&amp;#x200B;

1-My sis is a butthole. I had to beg her to let me write this. She's fricking controlling. I'm the oldest...

&amp;#x200B;

2- My Mom says that I've fallen to the devil because i'm not religious enough (i'm a very religious guy btw, i try my best always) because i listen to 'devil music' (sabaton is the only metal i listen to. Also my mom's being like this all of a sudden.)

&amp;#x200B;


3- my dad's mad at me for the same reason as my mom. Apparently, to him, i'm useless at everything but playing videogames and Eating. 
&amp;#x200B;

All this happened coz i woke up, and sat down to watch Memenade's daily memes on YT and my dad and mom came on me with all this.
I can only either use: my pc for videogames, TV for memes, Clarinet for practice, and my sisters tablet for whatever i want.
(all for 2hrs a day. it's a combined limit so i can play for 2hrs or practice for 2hrs.)
&amp;#x200B;

I tried negotiating.. But apparently sleeping for 8hrs counts as playtime. I may sound childish but seriously... that's her words. I was told i can negotiate when i'm deemed religious enough.

&amp;#x200B;
I'm not making or posting memes here for the next 3 years. I'm not supposed to use reddit as my parents don't allow social media of any kind. I don't have a phone so i'm kinda done for. I can't sneak it on my PC because it's in a way where everyone can see what i do (my dad wanted it to be how nobody can see, but my mom doesn't believe in privacy there).
&amp;#x200B;

To my 11 followers, thanks guys. To the people who helped my memes make it to the subreddit homepage, thanks. 
&amp;#x200B;
Goodbye till i'm 17. I'm not allowed to use any device starting from next year. I'm allowed this small time for what i can do, and i'm gonna miss waking up to see memes and stuff here. All the memers here who made me chuckle, thanks.
&amp;#x200B;

If i ever get a phone, i'll probs come back but that's unlikely because i can't own a phone till i'm 18. Guess that hurts my chances with the ladies as i can't get a phone till i'm 18, and I can't date till i get a degree.

&amp;#x200B;
I'm sick of being made fun of for being weak and "useless at manly things" and told i'm not manly enough. I've took up weightlifting now.
&amp;#x200B;

So bye guys. If i ever come back, I'll Make a meme for y'all to smile and chuckle.
&amp;#x200B;

P.S,I won't delete this acct as i wan't to keep my memes alive for
you guys so y'all can look at me memes for a chuckle. It's gon be my birthday in a week and i'm screwed as my dad's not talking to me.Hopefully our relationship gets repaired by then. (my parents don't wish me anymore because i'm too old)

&amp;#x200B; 
heres a little explanation for the devil music thing: My mom grew up in the 80's... when the rock music=Devil music scare went arnd.
I'll try my best to be religious enough for them and maybe i can come back. Idk if i don't comment or post for too long maybe reddit deletes accts?? I'm risking it tho.
