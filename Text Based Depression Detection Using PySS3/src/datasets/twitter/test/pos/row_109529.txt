I donâ€™t think there are any teenager moderators on this subreddit Ok, letâ€™s be RATIONAL PEOPLE for one second bere.

Ok, bear with me because Iâ€™m about to blow your mind. The moderators are supposed to be TEENAGERS. Guess what teenagers have to attend? School.

Ok, you might be thinking, â€œPenis, multiple mods can cover multiple time zones.â€ Well, Iâ€™m about to blow your mind.

I checked the moderators list, and it turns out there are some mods who have not left despite their expiration date having passed.

What does this mean? Internal conflict, or worse....

Here is my theory: The moderators do nothing. They get adults to moderate.

Do you feel comfortable with these GROOMERS? Or will you rise up?

Only you can change the world.
