Am I being ungrateful?    Hey yâ€™all cuties, just wanted some second opinions on something that happened, itâ€™s quite dumb honestly. So thereâ€™s this game that my boyfriend and I play and in the game there is a rare item you can get, but only by winning a large number of difficult battles. 

In the past, him and I have talked about me getting this item since he already has it, and he would always offer to play some games on my account to help since it is really difficult to get. I would say thank you and that itâ€™s sweet of him to offer, but I would always tell him no, and explain to him that if I were to get it, I would want to accomplish it on my own. I knew I could do it, I just needed to find the time necessary.

This morning though, I wake up to him texting me that he had gotten it for me. He had taken the liberty of playing ALL the games himself and getting the rare item on my account. I know I should be thankful since he put in the effort and time to win it but I am honestly super sad that I didnâ€™t get to win it myself:( This game means a lot to us since weâ€™ve spent hours improving and bonding over it and such, and so I really really wanted to get this item by myself. Now if I were to put it on, it wonâ€™t feel like itâ€™s mine, itâ€™s not something I did myself.

I donâ€™t know what to say to him, I feel like no matter what I say, heâ€™ll feel like Iâ€™m undermining his efforts and get upset.
