School ans my parents gave me anxiety. Going to school and my parents always gives me anxiety.I got future anxiety because of exams and my parents.I always had the fear that if i get a bad score from a test,my parents would scream at me.When I was 5-6,going to kindergarten would always make me cry.I couldnt accept the fact that my parents would leave me in a school.It lasted until 1st grade.We learnt how to write in 1st grade as everyone did.Our Teachers gave us writing homeworks.When I came home,when I tried to do the homework,my hands would hurt a lot and my parents screamed at me like WHY ARE YOU NOT DOING YOUR HOMEWORK! DO YOUR HOMEWORK! I DONT CARE IF YOUR HAND IS HURTING! and stuff like that.Around 2nd-3rd grade,when I could not solve some of the math problems,my dad would explain it 1-2 times and scream at me for not understanding it.Then came along 4th grade.There was a math exam and i did really bad.I got like 70 points.My parents wouldnt stop  screaming at me for days.I got 65 in 5th grade,but i got off of that lightly.My parents screwed over my childhood.Thats why I overthink everything and get anxiety a lot to this day.
