I'm happy in life and it's from theism. I don't hate you if your atheist (religion's so despised I have to add that disclaimer smh) but the idea that the universe came from nothing, has no meaning, and no inherent beauty is not only depressing, but illogical. Studing the cosmos has lead me to the conclusion that something greater than reality made it. God exists, if not, then where did this intricate reality come from? Y.W.H makes the most sense, but its really down to faith. God loves me so much he bore my punishment as the Christ, he is my Jesus (Yeshua, meaning "God with us"), I must now love others because he loves me. : )
