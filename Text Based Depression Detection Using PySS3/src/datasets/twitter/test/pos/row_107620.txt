I know this sounds fake, but there is a Russian pirated site that lets you watch movies for free without ads or viruses [The address is http://megamult.net]

Megamult lets you watch movies online for free, up to 720p quality, in Russian, Ukrainian, and English. It has no click bait ads or viruses, and I have been using it to watch Anime. Itâ€™s very nice. So this is how you use it:

If you donâ€™t understand Russian, you should get the google translate extension for chrome, and it will translate the webpage. There should be a search bar on the main page, where you can search for movies and tv shows. Once you have found what you want to watch, click on the season icon and select the episode. It should play. If the playback isnâ€™t working, click on the setting icon in the video viewer, click players, select player 2. It should work if player 1 isnâ€™t working. To change the language that you want to watch it, go to the video viewer, settings, then language. Select English. I hope this has been helpful to you, and again no this is not a scam
