So I asked my crush out I asked my crush out over snap chat. She opened it and left it open for two hours before responding. I have yet to open it because I am not sure if she is declining. Do you think she is going to decline my confession because it took two hours for her to respond to a yes or no question? I probably am going to wait until morning to open it. Please tell me your thoughts.
