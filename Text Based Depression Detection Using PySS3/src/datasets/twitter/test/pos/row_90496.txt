Whoâ€™s down for a story So the other day I was minding my biz playin cyberpunk and listening to music and Mary (my girlfriend text me and Iâ€™ll kinda relay what it was for a bit 

Mary : hey uh Pete ..how much did you go to the beach  as a kid 

Me : what do ya mean kid? Like 10 thru 12 or 4 thru 9 Cuz I donâ€™t know how much of the 4 thru 9 stuff I would rember 

Mary : uhhh 7 

Me : thatâ€™s specific 

Mary: Whell I found somthing here

[if you canâ€™t read it says â€œMary made a friend named peter at the beach today with scars on his belly his mom said weâ€™re from a surgery  Mary wanted to take a picture with Peter cuz she said the scars were weird and she dint wanna forget ]

Me : WTF thatâ€™s me in the pic 

Mary : I knew it .. 

Me : so it turns out we met at the beach 10 years ago ? 

Mary : I guess so 

Me : cool when you come toningt bring that scrap book

Mary: ok petey see u at 3 luv u â¤ï¸ 



Anyway I though it was a cool thing that happened and I canâ€™t be fucked to put in effort so I just copied the texts messages witch did take effort but whatever anyway it blew my friken mind
