hello, i'm bored so here is how to take care of yourself when you have a cold or a fever 1. Drink lots of water, and eat as much as you can without feeling more sick. It's ok to not push yourself but you have to stay nourished and healthy. 
2. If you seriously cannot eat anything, or have an upset stomach, stick to the BRAT diet (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast) to ensure you still eat while giving your gut a chance to recover as well. 
3. If you can eat, try to refrain from eating spicy foods, as it can give you indigestion, and have some warm broth or chicken soup. You can also try some hot teas, honey, and other soothing foods. 
4. Get lots of rest and don't work yourself up. If you're burning hot, get a cool compress. 

Some teas to try:

* Peppermint tea helps a lot with coughs
* Chamomile helps you get lots of needed rest
* Ginger tea soothes a scratchy or dry throat
* Elderberry helps with reducing symptoms.
* Hibiscus helps up your vitamin levels
* Or just some traditional herbal tea with honey!

that's it and tbh idk why I wasted time typing this, i hope someone finds this helpful ðŸ˜Œ
