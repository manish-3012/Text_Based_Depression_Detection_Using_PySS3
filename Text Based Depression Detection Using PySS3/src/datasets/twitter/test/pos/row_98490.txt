How to I know if I'm really depressed So I've been struggling with depression for a long while now, it's gone through fazes since I was 8 years old but never seems to go away, but how do I know if I'm actually depressed, and not just sad or sulking for no reason

-I've lost interest in the things I used to love

-My sleep schedule is just fuuuucked. I feel tired everyday

-I have no motivation to get out of bed or to do anything

-I feel completely alone and have nobody that I feel safe opening up to

-I notice that lately, I've been getting irritated more easily, especially since I quit gaming.

-I often think of suicide, although my suicidal thoughts have been decreasing in the past month or 2.

-Fuck I just wanna go back to how things were pre-quarantine. I miss how things used to be and I regret every decision I've made since then

-sometimes if I'm distracted enough, I get a little enjoyment out of life but it never lasts long

Am I depressed? I want to think so but there's a voice telling me that I'm just another cringy teenager. IDK even if I was depressed it wouldn't make a difference cus I have nobody who would take me seriously
