I can feel by fucking brain throbbing Apologies for the rant, I just need to get this off my chest.



I fucking hate tourettes. I hate having to hit myself full force in the jaw repeatedly until my body decides I'm good to go for not even a minute before making me hit myself again. I'm almost certain I've given myself a concussion, this is the 3rd time this has happened because of this tic.



I want this shit to end so fucking badly. I'm not even really depressed anymore, but I'm still contemplating suicide because of these fucking tics. I'm not strong enough to live with this for the rest of a normal lifespan.
