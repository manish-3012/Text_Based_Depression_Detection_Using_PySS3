I really need help please !!! My bestfriend is in hospital because my friend is having Covid-19 and due to covid my friend is bit sad and depressed I need something to cheer up my friend and I tried many things but it seems like they are not working and I feel extremely sad and hopeless that my friend is laying in a bed and I can't do anything that can cheer my friend up. I want to gift my friend something but we both live miles apart from each other. 

All I do to cheer up my friend is I write a beautiful and cheerful message every morning unless my friend is totally healed from covid. But I guess I need some beautiful virtual gift that can really cheer my friend up. Please can you people help me what can I do to make my friend happy and please suggest some virtual gifts that I can give my friend. And please make sure that this can reach as many people as possible and maybe someone out there will have a perfect solution to my questions. Thank you everyone for reading this.
