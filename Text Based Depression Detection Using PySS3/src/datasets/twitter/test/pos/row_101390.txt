idk if someone is going read these but just typing makes me feel a lot better.  

(English is not my native language and sry for that)

so where I live schools have opened today, and you can already walk in but only if you wear a facemask.

the problem is that my mom is an anti-vaxxer plus anti-mask supporter (2 in 1 haha xD)

so today I asked 

\-"where are my stuff so I can go to school?"

and her response was

\-"you aren't going to school with a facemask"

after that sentence, I really tried to change her mind like wow 

we've got in a super-serious fight 

I've never heard such great myths about masks

she is always seeking philosophical thoughts in anything 

(let me give you some context )

I'm the type of guy who is always trying to study everything in super great and fine details

I never struggled in any subject (except history and literature (2hard 4me xD))

if I don't understand something in... hmm let's say biology, I dedicate all of my free time until I'm brain dead (like 7-5hrs)(and my parents permit me to study anything until midnight). and I can get mentally upset easily :D. the pandemic wasn't hard id say it was easy for me, nothing changed in my lifestyle, but it changed how my mom behaved... she would always make me drink some unknown substances known by chemists, and if id refuse to drink she would try to talk that all I know abt viruses and biology overall is just a BIG B.S. and I should spend my time on better things like reading old books or being social to at least someone(about being social hits always me the most)

She's a good person I'm not trying to talk bad about her but I REALLY need to vent my brain here

I can't explain what I'm going through

I might have to change school coz of '' ay they insist to wear only face shields'' "don't they know that masks block oxygen?" 

the people who I know there is everyone I know 

that's the place where I met people and became who am I now

that's the place I spent my 10 years 

if id feel bad for something my native language teacher would try to have some time with me and have a talk about myself (how am I, what am I doing in life ...etc)

we have no bullies in school, everyone always tried to help each other

it will feel like tearing a piece from who am I now

I'm trying to keep myself positive but wow this is a new level 

# I think all that I wrote is nonsense(like I can't understand what's written in here xD)
