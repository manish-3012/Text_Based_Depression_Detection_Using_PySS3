Marvel Movies are good for society, they give positive role models to young kids without fathers, religion, or philosophies. If you don't have a higher moral purpose, you're the center of reality and that leads to selfishness. Looking up Captain America, Ironman, or Black Panther is really good for children growing up without good homes.
