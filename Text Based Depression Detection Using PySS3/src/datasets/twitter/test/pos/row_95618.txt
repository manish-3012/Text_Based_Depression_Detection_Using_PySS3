can i get some advice im 15 and there's this girl who has been my best friend for quite a while now. recently, we've missed each other bc of covid and all and now apparently we're dating. its happened before twice and I know how it ends and i don't think I can commit to a relationship at this time. ive got my whole life.

i preferred when were bestfriends and just flirted all the time. she's been on my mind lately which  i don't want. i want to friendzone her but I'm scared that'll hurt her feelings because shes made it clear that she likes me I mean a lot to her. she means a lot to me but i don't want to catch feelings. 

i take her out every week and i am going tomorrow and idk what to do.

above all this, ive got a job, school, family issues, and more family issues. three of my uncles almost died last week and too much is on my mind. im just overwhelmed and i don't think i have time for a girl.

how do i go about this without hurting her? anything is appreciated, thank you.
