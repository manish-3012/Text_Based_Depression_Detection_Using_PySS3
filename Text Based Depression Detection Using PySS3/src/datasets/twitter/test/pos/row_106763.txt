â€œAnotherâ€ was great The ending was stupid though, now if you excuse me itâ€™s 00:55 and I need to get my anxiety and breathing under control and my heart rate down before I sleep, (spoilers for â€œAnother)&gt;! my breathing and heart rate sped up a bit when everyone started killing each other and me anxiety went through the roof!&lt; 10/10 would recommend, you should watch it if you like horror and donâ€™t have a heart condition
