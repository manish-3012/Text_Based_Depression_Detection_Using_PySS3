There should be a sub like r/teenagers except its for people for like 20-30 so that way when we turn 20 and have to leave this sub, we can still post relatable things for our age. I was just thinking of the goodbye r/teenagers posts ive seen and had a random thought- what if leaveing didnt nessissarily mean you had to say goodbye to all your fellow teens. I think there should be a sub for people who used to be in r/teenagers but eventually grew out of that age range.
