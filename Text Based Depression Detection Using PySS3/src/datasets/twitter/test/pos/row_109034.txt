i feel a bit lost, a bit hopeless and a bit like iâ€™m issuing something (M17) i have this yearning feeling, like a dull ache (mental not physical) like i wish i had someone, like a gf maybe , or maybe itâ€™s just lockdown getting to me - iâ€™m very social and i like meeting new people, itâ€™s like new possibilities for relationships i guess. 

problemo is, i fucking hate myself lol - and iâ€™m not saying this to sound edgy i have body dysmorphia disorder and a bunch of other stuff that weighs me down constantly

i feel ugly all the time , i feel sick and stressed walking past mirrors , i obsess and scrutinise myself all the time , sometimes i donâ€™t even know what i look like 
people tell me different but they are my friends so theyâ€™re just lying to make me feel good, which iâ€™m lucky that i have such friends but i think they forget that i can also see what i look like so i know they are lying.

itâ€™s weird, like i wouldnâ€™t consider myself ugly in a literal sense but just my features are so unattractive to me like i have a round fat face and my ears stick out , i tried not eating which just made me feel ill and now my arms are twigs lol 

itâ€™s almost like i have the capacity to be decent but thereâ€™s something holding me back. my cheeks arenâ€™t thin and it just completely ruins my face. unfortunately starving myself didnâ€™t really affect my face and was not a good idea in general, so iâ€™m gonna just have to come to terms with that iâ€™ll never look gaunt and attractive

i just donâ€™t look like other boys my age. they have defined jaws and masculine angular faces. and ya boy over here, well heâ€™s stuck with the moon on his shoulders 

but i feel self conscious to the point where itâ€™s debilitating, like not regular teenage low self esteem but a genuine deep rooted self hatred where i feel like iâ€™m worth nothing, no one will ever love me and if someone ever did theyâ€™d leave because i wouldnâ€™t be good enough

i stress when iâ€™m sat close to people, i keep my head down, back bent, cover my mouth when i laugh, literally run from A to B in a public place tk avoid being seen, i cringe internally sometimes in social situations when i remember that everyone can see me, so i feel like a constant idiot talking to these people because they all must be judging me

okay, melodrama over - sorry i just wanted to dump some thoughts here as my CAHMS therapy has ended (it was for anxiety not bdd) and apparently i have to re apply to get help for that, my parents donâ€™t believe i have such an issue so thereâ€™s no point. they say theyâ€™re here for me but they donâ€™t trust that i actually do need a bit of help, they donâ€™t understand the extent of how much i feel crushed all the time lol. itâ€™s really hard trying to get on with stuff when i just have this feeling of ugliness all the time. 

iâ€™d never talk to a girl because i would feel too stupid, no girl would want to talk to me

no girl would want me lol


this sounds very like simp-y and â€œoh girls donâ€™t like me omg my life is terribleâ€ but its just a genuine concern that i will actually be alone forever, which is not a welcome thought really :/ iâ€™m not usually like this but as i keep this account anonymous i donâ€™t really care. iâ€™m pretty good at hiding how i feel. lots of people look to me/rely on me for strength, so i wear my smile and carry on :)
