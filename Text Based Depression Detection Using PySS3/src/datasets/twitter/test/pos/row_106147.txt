Help me solve a riddle (Black Magic) My friend presented me with a problem to solve. I think of an object and tell her and then she names a bunch of random objects in the area to her mother, including my own, to which her mother will respond with a "No" if it isn't the object or a "Yes" if it is. Her mother guesses my object right 100% of the time and the only condition is that she can't guess it on the first turn. I wrote down some of the games that were played. Help me solve it.

**Game 1:**

\- Balloons

\- Crutches

\- Schweppes soda bottle

\- Flowers

\- Straws

\- Mat

\- Dog

\- Wifi password (the correct item)

**Game 2:**

\- Shoes

\- Splint

\- Her toe ring

\- Bag

\- Onesie

\- Lantern

\- Swimming pool

\- Grass

\- Friend's phone case

\- Apple watch (the correct item)

&amp;#x200B;

**Game 3:**

\- Deck

\- My burger (the correct item)

They can do it without speaking to each other so it isn't the way she says it, and they can do it on opposite ends of the house so it isn't body language. I checked with her and it is able to be figured out with just this information. Nobody has ever solved this before. I'm counting on you guys
