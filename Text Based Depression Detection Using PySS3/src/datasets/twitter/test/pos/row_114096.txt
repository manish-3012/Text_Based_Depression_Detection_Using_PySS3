Good chill or low key SoundCloud artist? The genre doesnâ€™t matter that much Iâ€™m open to most. Personally I like teenage disaster and Iâ€™ve been following him sense 200 followers but if your open to a lot of music check him out. I just am not good at expanding my music playlist so Iâ€™m sure some of you can help.
