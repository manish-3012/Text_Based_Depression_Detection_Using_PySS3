Help im socially awkward Ok so in middle school I had a classmate I sometimes talked to, and messaged with on ig. 
We havenâ€™t heard of each other since we graduated, 1,5 years ago. 
I know he smokes weed, and I want to get some, (I donâ€™t know anyone else) so I thought about dm-ing him..
The problem is our last message is him saying hello in March 2019, which I didnâ€™t notice back then so I basically left him on delivered.
Also, he unfollowed me, and basically everyone else.
So i guess the question is how awkward it is to dm my middle school classmate whom I havenâ€™t talked to in almost 3 years for weed lol
