I wanna go you with friends but my parents won't let me if I tell the truth that should I say I wanna meet some friends tomorrow but my parents are strict and will want to know where when what and who. They will not let me if I tell the truth. We meeting outside a pub not going in tho and my parents would hate that. I'm meeting friends they don't know. I am normally allowed to go down to town with my other friends but these are different ones and a different town. Please help.
