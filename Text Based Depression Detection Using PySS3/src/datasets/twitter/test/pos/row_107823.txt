Something something crush yes, now shush, it's my turn and it's going to have a couple twists. You know what feels bad? That you're thinking you may have a crush on someone but turns out it's just because they treat you like a human being (in case you're depressed or something)

Or worse is having a crush on someone and then you get hit with the "yeah I'm actually homosexual"

Like you're happy for them but damn now I'm alone
