yo I'm creating a manga and I'm wondering if anyone would be interested in reading it once I finish it So I'm making a manga and I know that there are a lot of people who like anime here so I just thought I would see how many people would be interested.

Plot of the manga

So it's about a person named Arthur who was locked up in a cube like prison in medieval times so in this cube like prison were he had to give wishes to people like a genie so one day a girl named lily ask him to get rid of the aliens attacking her village so he wipe's out the entire alien race she ask's him to get rid of the curse but he can't because the people who put him in the prison so then she has one last wish which is to know who she is he say's that she is just a human but it turns out she is his daughter so since he messed up a wish he has to help her so she goes on to release the curse on her so then they go picking up people until they reach 8 people in their group and that's all that I'm giving.
