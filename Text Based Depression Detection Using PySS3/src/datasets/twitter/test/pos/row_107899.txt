How Do I, A Female, Take Initiative Dudes? Seeing my fellow high schoolers suck face in the depressing hallways made me realize how lonely I am.

So thereâ€™s this dude I see staring at me but he wonâ€™t approach. 
Iâ€™m guessing shy or not interested but why not try.

Can you guys tell me how to take initiative into sliding into your dmâ€™s?
Do guys like having girls asking out or starting the talking stage or is it to forward or weird?

Iâ€™m trying to not stutter or make a fool of myself.
