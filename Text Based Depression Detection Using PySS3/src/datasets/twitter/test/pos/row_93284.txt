Am I the only reason people are talking about superstraight on this sub? I posted a bunch of superstraight posts after everyone gave me shit for being exited that r/superstraight was back up again, but now I regret it cus I think I might have started to make superstraight seep into this sub. Please tell me I'm not the only reason and that it's just people unrelated to before just asking.
