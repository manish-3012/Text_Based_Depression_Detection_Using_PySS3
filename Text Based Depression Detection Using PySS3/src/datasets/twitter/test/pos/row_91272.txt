I feel like I'm kinda losing my best friend So my best friend and I attend different colleges. They're only about 15 minutes away but due to civil we haven't been seeing each other. We still speak on the phone at least twice a month. But his program has all his classes in person so he's always with someone else partying and such. While I'm stuck in my student apartment with no one to talk to. I know it's irrational. He's told me he can't wait to see me and I know he means it. But I just can't stop feeling like he's just moving way faster than me in life and leaving me in the dust. I guess asking teens for advice isn't the best idea but this is more of a rant. So, any help is welcome
