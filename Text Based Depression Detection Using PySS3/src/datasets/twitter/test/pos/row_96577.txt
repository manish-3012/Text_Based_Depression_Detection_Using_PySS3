Parents are the most hypocritical people you'll meet Parents are the worst and if you've been in this sub for more than a day then you know the stories.
Parents will demand respect but then belittle you while doing it acting like your existence is a gift.
Parents will yell at you for a trivial lie when they do it to you for years
You say or like something they don't they'll take your stuff cause you're "not listening"
They'll compare you to other kids and expect you to take it in stride bit turn the tables and they will explode
They'll punish you over grade when school is really just a waste of Time and they know it
If they're religious then they'll take you're stuff because you're being "tempted by sin"
Keep it going
