I donâ€™t know what to do (TW!!!!)


So Iâ€™m 17 and Iâ€™ve been abused by multiple men sexually and emotionally. Well someone found out and contacted cps (child protective services). My most recent ex was 18 making him an adult but he never abused me but we did sleep together. We had a huge falling out after the breakup and he no longer wants to be in contact with me which I agreed to, this was before the case was a thing. So a week goes by and cps is interviewing me and basically they know he had sex with me even though Iâ€™m a minor keep in mind he is 18 so heâ€™s not a pedo. So there is a possibility that he could be taken to court although itâ€™s very highly unlikely. My parents told me not to tell him because he will panic and if he finds out and gets more involved with me it could get him in trouble. My mother also told me not to tell him because he would get scared and block me every where and that would hurt me and she doesnâ€™t want me to get hurt because heâ€™s scared. Although the case isnâ€™t about him a talk about these boys abusing me in general (which he didnâ€™t do) and my parents not knowing about it, I feel like I should warn him even though it could cause complete panic and chaos. So should I tell him and break no contact and cause panic which would destroy me and what little respect we still have for each other and ruin the acquaintanceship we still have, or should I say nothing unless I know for sure he could get in trouble because itâ€™s still very high unlikely that he will get in trouble. Also this may be confusing but basically me and him arenâ€™t talking right now but thatâ€™s just for now itâ€™s not a permanent thing so weâ€™re still acquaintances like he doesnâ€™t completely hate me but this would make him hate me.
