r/Fiftyfifty is unsafe So letâ€™s go back a few years when I was 12,I had reddit and I looked at the subreddit r/fiftyfifty,I skipped past most of the gory stuff but there were some things I looked at.For anyone under the age of 14/15 I recommend not to use this sub as I had serious night terrors ,night terrors are when u wake up sweating but shivering so ur body is so freaked out at night that it canâ€™t decide wether you are hot or cold,you usually talk or scream whilst asleep and never remember any of it.my advice is to stay away from this sub until u are at an age were u feel as tho u can handle this kinda stuff otherwise you may end up like me 

This is just advise and not hate against the sub,it is a good sub but unsafe for young people.
