You know what's crazy? I have spent half of my middle school years online.

My school went on break in about April, and online class started a month later.

That was right before the 3rd quarter started in 7th grade, which means that the difference between my time spent in school vs virtual is only about 2 and a half months. That's really weird to think about, it doesn't feel like it has been that long since Covid started being reported on. But it has.

I was 12 when Covid first started, and I am turning 15 next year, and starting highschool this year. That's insane!


Edit: some people get confused about the age thing, so I figured I would clarify.

I was 12 when Covid first started being reported on.

I turned 13 last year.

I turn 14 in a few days 

I turn 15 next year.
