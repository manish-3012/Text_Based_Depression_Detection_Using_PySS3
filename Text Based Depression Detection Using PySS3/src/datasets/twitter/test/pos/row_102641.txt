If you guys could have 3 wishes what would they be? Rules: 

no loopholes like infinite wishes or more wishes 

You can only wish for things to happen to you, i.e. you can't wish for everyone to he happy or to solve world hunger.

You can't wish for something broad like "I wish I was smarter" it has to be more specific like "I wish I was world class at maths". 

You have to explain why you chose these as your wishes
