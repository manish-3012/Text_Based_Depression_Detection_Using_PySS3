I've just watched a video 40 times in a row The fact that I've just watched the "You're my little pogchamp" youtube clip makes me realise that I'm lonely af and any piece of love or attention I get will fill my heart for the rest of the day. Maybe call me a simp, I don't care at all. I like how I feel after watching it, and I'm keep on doing it everytime I feel sad.
