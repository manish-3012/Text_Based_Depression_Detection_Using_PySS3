Does anyone else only live with one parent? Before I get into this, I wanna make it clear how much I love my mom. She has cared for me and went above and beyond since I can remember, and is the best parent I could wish for. My dad is a very different story. I donâ€™t live with my dad, and havenâ€™t since I was 6. He smoked all the time, didnâ€™t have a job, didnâ€™t pick me up from school until 8:00 at night several times, and would shout and spank me without warning if I did something he didnâ€™t like, even with me being just 3 or 4 years old. He wasnâ€™t close with my mom, But I stayed at one of their places for a few days at a time. He eventually tried to do something bad enough to my mom he went to jail for several years, and my mother and I have restraining orders against him. It makes me really sad when I see people having fun with their dads, whether itâ€™s a small child or someone my age hanging out with their father. It makes me feel like Iâ€™m incomplete. It makes me sad to not know what itâ€™s like to have a good father, it makes me angry that my dad was cruel enough to try and harm my mother, and it just scares me to think about him. Ive so emotionally confused for years, hating him for what he has taken from me, depressed realizing that Iâ€™ll never have a good father, Iâ€™m scared if I ever have children one day that I wonâ€™t be a good enough father because I donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to have one myself. Sometimes I wake up at night and just sit in bed, fantasizing about stalking him down and murdering him, only to feel guilty about feeling that way later. If any of yâ€™all have actually taken the time to read my probably incoherent rambling, thank you. To anyone who has a father who isnâ€™t a piece of shit, hug them or do whatever it is to show you care about them every day. I went through the trouble of recounting my experience as a child without a father to see if I could find comfort with anyone who has dealt with a similar issue.
