My sister made my lip bleed and got off scot free. I was making fun of a show she was watching, and so she decided that a good response was to kick at me. 

This made my phone fly into my face, and my lip met my tooth. It bled, and I grabbed her and said that if she did it again, that I would hurt her back. We go talk to my parents and she makes it sound like I was super aggressive. 

I wasn't and I made my case. And to be fair, I mouthed off a tad bit. But other than that, my mom said that I'm not a kid anymore (keep in mind I'm 15) I say that my sister isn't either and my mom says that she's 13. Thir-fucking-teen. It says it in the word. Teen. I point this out and my parents considered it backtalk. My dad even said he would punch me in the mouth if I "mouthed off" again. 


I fucking hate my sister. She makes my life a slog to go through and I've honestly considered killing myself. I won't, don't worry about that. I've got people that need me, so I have to live for them. But my sister is so awful, she made me forget that. 
Thanks for letting me rant. Have a good one.
