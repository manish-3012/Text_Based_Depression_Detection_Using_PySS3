Hi there. Rly wanna talk to people and not be a social loner like I've always been. Also, just don't read the first 3 lines for f**k's sake and read a bit in life. I have stuff to say.  

Hi there. Let me give a rundown of things I do/like

Also, I don't rly wanna show my face until I can trust the other person completely (I've had.....issues regarding that, so pls understand, I'm no creep. Stalk my profile all you want, and you might see that I'm a genuine human being on the planet (though was maybe not treated as one all my life))

Also, get the f\*\*k out of here if you're only gonna have 1 convo. I wanna have a good friendship/relationship/whatever the f\*\*k we might be.

* I love gaming (not able to do it due to classes, but would love it)
* Love trash-talking movies (though I've never seen many)
* I absolutely hate rock/jazz/rap/any other form of music other than EDM or Dance-pop.
* I have pretty dark opinions and I've scared quite a few people with a weak mind and soul with them, so proceed with caution
* I am an introvert, but give me the illusion of trust (pls don't do that. Give actual trust), and I'm willing to open up my entire life story.
* I hate anime. Period. You are not convincing me otherwise
* Kinda suicidal and depressed, but never willing to kill myself (too much work), so I just educate people about killing the ego and living life like never before with no ego (turns out it's great for me).
* I curse a lot. A lot a lot.
* I respect my sleep a lot, so I really cannot talk at night
* Have a ton of hobbies which I've left now, but willing to talk about them.
* I love Cinemasins, Game Theorists and kinda hate the modern Pewds
* A complete academic nerd
* I also have a penchant for weird analogies and weird visual imagery
* Can speak rly good English even though it ain't the only one I speak. Apparently, I impress people with that (that's what the last person said)
* I've never really been able to speak with women physically (I physically start to slur and do weird stuff), but I do hold up great text convos with anyone (even women).
* If you've read till the end, A. You're insane, just like me. B. You still have a lot more to learn about me (I'm serious). Pls, do comment and hope we can bond over our complete agreement on stuff or being complete opposites (I do like people who are the exact opposite of me).

Now idk why I'm posting this here too, but hey, a person who might like me is prolly far and few, so gotta get the word out more.
