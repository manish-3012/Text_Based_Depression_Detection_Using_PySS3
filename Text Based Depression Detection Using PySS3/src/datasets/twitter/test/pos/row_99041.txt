Friends can be selfish Fucking hell!! I don't wanna drive for 1 hours if it's fucking snowing and at roads are super slick! We live in Utah for fucks sake! That only adds to the danger cause of the dumbasses on the roads! 

Making me decide a day in advance when we don't know what the weather is like. 

I get it, being prepared is nice and all but so it being safe! And driving in a blizzard is not safe!
