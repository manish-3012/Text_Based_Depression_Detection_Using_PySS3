Assert dominance by Expressing yourself how you wanna express yourself

Oh and to all the racists/sexists/lgbt phobes: assert dominance by minding your own fucking business and letting people express themselves how they want and letting them live their lives in peace. Them being different from you is neither any of your business nor does it affect you and you should stop pretending it does. Please let me be gay as fuck in peace thank you very much.

Anyways have a nice day :)
