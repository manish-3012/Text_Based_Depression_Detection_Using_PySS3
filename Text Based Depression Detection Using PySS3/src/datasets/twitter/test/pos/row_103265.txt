so we lost our minecraft server because of one fatal spelling error. So me and my friends were playing minecraft together and we like to use the tp command because it just makes things easier and normally i dont but my other friends used it all the time cuz they didnt really mind.

Today one of my friends was at our xp farm grinding levels and enchanting our gear for us because we were doing villager shenanigans. he wanted to tp us to him with a simple /tp @ a @ s

Hooo boy did that go terribly.

He spelled it wrong and wrote /tp @ e instead of @ a and teleported all entities to him. aka hundreds of creepers, zombies, golems endermen etc exploding everything and killing everything.

We had basically lost all the farms we worked towards that had entities in them and our vilagers which we spent hours setting up. At this point we were devastated and had lost all motivation and just decided to delete the world that we had been playing on constantly for a week.

My friend is now terrified to use any sort of command when he plays minecraft.
