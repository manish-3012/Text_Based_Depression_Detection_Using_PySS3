Do y'all have any tips for Stardew valley? I'm barely starting out. I'm in Pelican town, and I'm struggling with gold. 

Right now it's the first day of summer, and all my plants died out. They were beets.

Also, how do I give the right gifts to the right people? Like how do I figure out what they like and such?
