I wrote this today. Let me kno if ypu liked it :) Alone stood the mighty tree



Lacking sorrow and utterly free





















A misty gale the wind brought through



The stormy winds he fought grew


































Alone he stood big and tall



Zeus gasping at his gall



































Wrath of gods he seemed to incur




And everything passed by in a blur






























Woken by the sun he was




Showing the carnage he had fought































Tattered branches lay around



But the stump was strong and sound

































"Ask any wish you may ask O tree", said the sky.




" For such bravery never has fallen on my eyes"



































" Wish I wasn't none my leige, just a partner of this lonely tree"





" Children I have many here a companion is what I need"


















































" Consider it granted", cried the sky



A sudden bolt of lightning struck near by










































From the ashes a tree sprung




The wrath of Zeus hath joy brung



































Happily the tree lived the tree forever



Say what thou may but say not there will be joy never
