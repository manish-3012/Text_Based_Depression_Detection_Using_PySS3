I feel so worthless right now I have this terrible dread for seemingly no reason, I havent been able to do anything I enjoy to take my mind of it for the past 5 days because I'm staying at my grandparents, and I have 5 more days to go. I just hope when I finally go home and start doing everything normally this goes away.
