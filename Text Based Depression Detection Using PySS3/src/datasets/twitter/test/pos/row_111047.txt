I wanna ask out this girl... So basically I have interests in this girl, we take the same bus to go home and we usually talk while on the bus, we get along pretty well, but ya know I'm pretty awkward irl and I wanna ask her out... 
Im trying to chat with her like every 2 to 3 days. She usually replies to hiiii pretty quick with a heyyy but then she goes away for like one or two hours ;(
I'm writing this while I'm waiting for her reply and I sti have no idea how I wanna ask her out... Pickup line or a not too long honest text. I asked some other girls, they said they would prefer getting an honest text so I'll probably go with that but yeaa that's it...
I really don't want to mess this up I have never had a gf and she is litteraly prefect
