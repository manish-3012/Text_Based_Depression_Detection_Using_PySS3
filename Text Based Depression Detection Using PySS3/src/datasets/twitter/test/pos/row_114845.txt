I think I had too much caffeine I downed a Monster Java (200 mgs of caffeine) earlier today and I realized that I had to do laundry, so Iâ€™m just sitting here with a ton of energy quite literally shaking and Iâ€™m just browsing Reddit waiting for my clothes to dry. This is not the move. 5/10 would not recommend if you need to do something sedentary. Be careful with caffeine kids.
