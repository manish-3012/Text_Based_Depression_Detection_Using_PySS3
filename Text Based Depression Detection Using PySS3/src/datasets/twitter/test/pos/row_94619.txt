Wtf is wrong with adults and there â€œhelpâ€ So iâ€™m doing my year at school over cause i didnâ€™t like what i had to study (human Sciences)  and i got a 49% for my french so i wanted something with less french. So i found a school with something with a lot of science (biotechnology) and i like it there itâ€™s much easier to understand and just more fun so i get a lot more good grades and still now i almost got my exams every adult is extremely annoying, i get that they are trying to help but they all do it wrong. My father mostly goes like that iâ€™ll have to work in a factory if i mess this year up. My mom said that i need to go study in a metal/ wood class and all the rest keeps asking what i want to do but i still donâ€™t have a clue of what i wanna be later. Like if one of them would just say that iâ€™m working hard and that i need to keep going i would be happy. Last year when i god my bad grades at the end of the year i said that i did my best and my father yelled that my best is not good enough so wtf am i supposed to do if i alk for their help they will keep saying that i canâ€™t do anything without help or by myself but if i donâ€™t i will try to study my way and get yelled at for not doing my best.

And then they are surprised that i like to sit in my room during family meetings
