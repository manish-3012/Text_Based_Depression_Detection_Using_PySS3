Yâ€™all so anti religions you go after idioms that weâ€™re made 100â€™s of years ago I saw a dude downvoted on this site for saying prayers about a dude in the hospital, everyone saying like â€œitâ€™s the doctors that save lifeâ€™s, not you!â€ 

Something tells me that you guys donâ€™t know that when a religious person says this, we are just wishing them well and telling them to be calm. People have been using this saying forever and just now we have a problem.
