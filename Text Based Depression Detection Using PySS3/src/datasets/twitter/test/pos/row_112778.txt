I'VE HIT 20. My birthday was December 3rd, so this is a little late. I wasn't very active on here but I wanted to say bye to everyone. I automatically know how to file taxes, drive a car and buy a house now. I will also be getting married very, very soon. Might even do an AMA on adulthood. Watch this space.
