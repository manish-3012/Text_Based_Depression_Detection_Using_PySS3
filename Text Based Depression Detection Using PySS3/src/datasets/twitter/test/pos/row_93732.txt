I need advice fellas So there's this girl I like and I want to ask her out but it's complicated.

I know she likes me back, I mean she basically told me, so I'm not afraid of getting rejected. What I am afraid of though is the fact that we go to the same school, are in 2 of the same classes and if we were to get together and break up it would be very awkward. Also I'm worried that we'll go out but she'll find it boring or I won't be entertaining and will screw it all up.

Too many problems and I'm getting confused. Please help
