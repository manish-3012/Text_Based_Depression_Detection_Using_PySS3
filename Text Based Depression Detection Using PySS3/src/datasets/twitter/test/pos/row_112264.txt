I (15F) have been single for more than 10 months and Im having trouble reminding myself that its okay to be single I think i just feel so pressured to be in a relationship and feel like that is the only way that I will be truly happy. A lot of it is also probably quarantine too because Iâ€™ve only hugged one of my friends this whole time and i realllyyy need another hug. I havent hugged a friend since august. Like Iâ€™m craving physical affection sooo bad that i think its making me desperate to get a boyfriend or girlfriend. And itâ€™s not healthy. And i keep forgetting how not all relationships are puppies and butterflies. But it feels like it because i mean two of my closest friends have been in a relationship for about 10 months and seem to be pretty happy. I havenâ€™t ever really had a healthy relationship or almost relationship before. All of them have been toxic in some way. On my end, their end, or both ends. I just feel like Iâ€™ve been putting a mask on and acting happy when i feel like im falling apart. And I think ive tried to make myself believe that im happy because i want to be. Idk i just dont know what to do. I feel like i cant get out of this cave in my life.
