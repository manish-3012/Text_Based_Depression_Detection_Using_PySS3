the pet store near my neighborhood is really cheap Is it normal for parakeets to be sold for only five dollars? I mean thatâ€™s a whole bird. I feel lucky that they have so many animals. Maybe Iâ€™ll be able to adopt one of my own when I get older. They have ferrets, guniea pigs, hamsters, dogs, cats, fish, all sorts of birds, and some other things,
