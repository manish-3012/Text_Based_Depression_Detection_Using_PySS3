Got sexually assaulted by my cousin.... (For context Iâ€™m a dude)


I forgot about this but this was 3 years ago, I was chilling watching some Thursday night football, my cousin is right next to me and sheâ€™s touching my hand and giggling then she hops on top of me and is attempting to give me a lap dance, now At this time I had no muscles and I was skinny and short, she was fit because she ran and played basketball. Then she starts pulling my shorts down, and Iâ€™m trying to stop her but she wonâ€™t  then finally I kick her chest and run. I never told my parents or hers. But she was the really popular girl at school and I was considering telling everyone and tarnishing her reputation, but I would feel bad.
