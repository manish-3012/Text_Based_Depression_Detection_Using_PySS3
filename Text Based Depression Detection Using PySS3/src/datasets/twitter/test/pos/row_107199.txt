I saw a dude's post about how he got a girlfriend and Imma share mine it's pretty much the same I was in a instagram group chat we did all weird funny things like shipping people with each other having marriages with people I used to have a crush for the sake of the story B on a girl only my best friend (from real life but was also in the chat) knew that he messaged someone who did all the shipping people for the sake of the story her name is M with each other he didn't tell her that I liked B she then did the whole thing in which she shipped me with B and all I was to be honest excited because hey I get to flirt with my crush without her feeling weird now turns out B also had a crush on me which still blows my mind like who would like me it's crazy for someone to like me so B texted me with another account which u didn't know was hers but I had a gut feeling it was her so I was like hey even if it's her I'll shoot my shot and say that I like B Amd even if I get rejected it's ok because I've been rejected for all my life B then messages me with her main saying that she likes me she's now my girlfriend
