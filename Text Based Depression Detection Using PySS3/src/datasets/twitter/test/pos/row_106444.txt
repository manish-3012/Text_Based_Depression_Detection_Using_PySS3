You know that meme about phone causing all the pain/problems you have Well I'm in the hospital because of brain tumour and it causes a lot of headache.

A nurse just said to me well put the phone of that can cause the pain to be worse.

Wow. Yes. All the problems solved. Especially when I'm alone in hospital and my parents or anyone else isn't allowed to meet me and I'm literally chatting with my friends. I would probably feel much better if I just suffered without my phone.
