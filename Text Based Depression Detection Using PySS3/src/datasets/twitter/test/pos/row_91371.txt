Quick opinion folks. IMPORTANT too! I had this kind of argument with a Dutch friend who is a female.

Apparently, she thinks that a boy can wear bras and panties and do all sort of stuff that is feminine but can still be interpreted as a boy by the social world. 

She thinks it is normal for people to do all sort of stuff the other gender does and still identify as the same gender.

I think that doesn't make sense, such a person is not a *boy* anymore from brain, he changes into non-binary/trans/anything else?

Is it normal for people to do all sort of stuff the other gender does and still identify as the same gender? Need your opinion folks.
