so I tried to kill myself note: I AM NOT USING MY PERSONAL PROBLEMS FOR INTERNET POINTS

my parents sometimes make me feel like they prefer my older sister over me (because she's more talented, smarter, older, knows french, plays music, played volleyball, is neurotypical). but one time I called my dad because my sister was playing her music too loud, but because I was mad, my dad took my phone away, of course I was fucking miserable, so I took some clorox wipes and tried to eat them, unfortunately I've yet to die or even get sick, fortunately I got my phone back, I'm recovering as we speak, I'll be watching The Lego Movie 2 on my dvd player in my room, I will update if anything happens
