DAE use Reddit or social media in general to distract yourself from reality and then drown in an enormous amount of guilt afterwards? I feel like social media helps to reduce stress to a certain extent by distracting you from whats going on and it helps you zone out but, as soon as you leave it you are overcome by this insane amount of guilt because at the end of the day it's a distraction..
