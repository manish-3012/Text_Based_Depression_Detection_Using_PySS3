Trying to quit 7-11 and get a job at a post office 7-11 is full of shit.  They let anyone come in with our without a mask.  Even if theyâ€™re sick and coughing on everything.  Half the employees donâ€™t even wear masks.  They just have this thin plastic sheet in between the employee and customer.  Whatâ€™s worse is when the people go to grab a donut they just let them shove their filthy hands in their and touch all the donuts.  And they honestly could not give a fraction of a fuck about their food.  The pizza tastes like actual fucking horse shit.  The boneless chicken is like eating rubber.  The only good thing thatâ€™s cheap and edible are the cups of noodles (1 dollar per cup).  

Iâ€™m trying to quit and get a job at a post office.  15+ dollars an hour plus full benefits and paid leave.  Thatâ€™s a straight up no brainer.  But in order to apply I have to study the fuck out of their applicants manual and score a 100 on their application exam.  My mom suggested I talk to the post master and tell him to look out for my name among the applicants.  He looked me dead in the eyes and said, â€œYour name doesnâ€™t mean anything.  What matters is that you score the highest and you can follow the instructions word for word.â€  

I didnâ€™t even say anything I just left.  

So in summary

Fuck 7-11 theyâ€™re full of shit.

And its study like fucking hell time.
