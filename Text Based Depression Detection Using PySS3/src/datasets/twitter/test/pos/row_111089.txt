I love everything It's great being up way too late wondering why tf you exist and why suicide isn't socially acceptable. Why people try to prevent someone they've never met, whose life story they don't know, from making the call to end their life. Why the fuck am I like this. My life is in shambles and I can't even be bothered to fucking off myself because I'm such a pathetic piece of shit. Not even my dog likes me. Ah well, off to fucking yell at a wall it is i guess
