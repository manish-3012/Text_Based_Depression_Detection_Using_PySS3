Ever just hurt your own feelings? Some time ago I was talking to this dude late at night and we were talking like insecurities with bodies and he was like saying Virgin gang and shit and I was like but it's kinda nice having someone and he's like yeah why, and I say that you can like hold hands and cuddle and he really answered with "Bruh ik what you're really thinking about".

And like no you absolute idiot, fucking is the last (third) thing on my mind. All I want is a boyfriend who loves me for who I am and holds my hand and we can cuddle and be like best friends but like that extra step. But this isn't going to happen because of how much I hate myself and my body because I'm fat and fucking ugly and no one would ever like me. 

I'm just so god damn lonely that even the thoughts of holding hands makes me cry and I think people actually like me just because they talk with me and then have to talk myself down so I don't get my hopes up but anything I do I still hurt my own feelings somehow. I hate that seeing any even slighty attractive guy makes my brain go blank and then having to fight a crush by telling myself they'd never like me. 
I just dont what to exist anymore, this is so fucking painful.
