i asked my dad when my new screen protector arrives he said "i got one but it was the wrong size" then walked off like that answered my question 

what tf is wrong with people oh my god 

just another little dad moment today, id just got home from school and was wearing a towel and he asked if im going in the shower... no im wearing a towel for fucking fashion aren't i :/ 

ALSO at school a big group of us were stood outside the changing room cos it was locked, this kid then comes to the front and pulls the door handle... obviously it didn't open and im just thinking oh cheers for your fucking contribution i wish we'd thought to try that
