Work update #7 I GOT A FRIGGIN $5 AN HOUR RAISE!!!

For you guys that dont work, that's a helluva raise. I'm making prolly $17-19 an hour now which is damn fine.

I'm also getting popular and I've been invited to many coworkers houses. Keep declining because the offers normally consist of drugs and alchohol ðŸ˜¬
