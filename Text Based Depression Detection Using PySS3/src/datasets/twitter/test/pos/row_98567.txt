I put a Hamilton reference in my homework So in English class, we're in the middle of reading *And Then There Were None*, and I just finished the reading guide my teacher made the class for chapter 6. One of the questions was "Why is Mr. Rogers suspected with killing his wife?", and this is how I answered:   
" \*inhale\* ðŸŽµ NO ONE ELSE WAS IN THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENED, THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENED, THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENED!!! ðŸŽµ "
