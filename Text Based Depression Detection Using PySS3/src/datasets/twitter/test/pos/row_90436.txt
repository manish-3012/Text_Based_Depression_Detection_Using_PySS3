My best friend is friends with my crush And normally I wouldn't be that mad about it, but they seem really close. He hasn't even done anything to help get me become friends with her, even though he knows I like her. I've tried asking him if there was anything between the two of them and he denied it, but it's hard to believe him when literally everyone thinks they're dating.

Sorry for the generic post, I just need to vent.
