I won't tell anyone irl, so ig ill tell you these things. So yeah. I have like 2 things that I haven't really told anyone irl about, though they are kinda big.

â€¢ Religion
Yeah... so I kinda recently joined a religion, and nobody knows irl. It's just kinda, uh, ig controversial. I mean, I was raised by an atheist father and a Christian mother. My mom isn't really religious at all though, and wanted me to find my own one, not being forced into one religion. I did that, I just haven't told her, or anyone else. &gt;!The religion is The Satanic  Temple (TST). I'm not in it to be edgy, or even for the style. I just like their ideals, and the way they think.!&lt;

â€¢ Relationship
This one is kinda different because my sister knows about it. I told her she can't tell anyone, and I'm pretty confident she'll stay true to me. Anyways, I got my first girlfriend not too long ago. This one is kinda tricky to tell anyone irl about because it's long distance. I already debated before I asked her out whether or not I should do it because of the distance, and decided to do it. For a little context, she gained a crush on me, and decided to talk with me. After talking for a while, she started liking me even more. She confessed she liked me, and I started liking her. It took me a day (it happened really fast ik) for me to "ask her out". We've been dating for a week now. My sister only found out because she started using discord, where she joined a server with us two, and we decided not to hide it. They got along, which is good.

Anyways, yeah. I have been just hiding these things from my family and irl friends just because it would be uncomfortable to tell anyone.
