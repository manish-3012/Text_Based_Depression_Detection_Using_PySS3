How would the average TV watcher of suburban America react to seeing sci fi for the first time? I live in this middle class suburb and most people who watch TV there are obsessed with these so called "reality shows" or football.

I don't know why but I would love to see the reaction these people would have toward a show like The Expanse

or even a realistic astronaut show!

How would they react? Would their jaws hit the floor?
