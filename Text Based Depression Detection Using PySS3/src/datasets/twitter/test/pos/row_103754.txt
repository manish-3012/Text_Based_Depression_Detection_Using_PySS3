Iâ€™m asking her out. But I need help. 

So thereâ€™s this girl in literally all of my classes (unfortunately, theyâ€™re Zoom classes, but whatever) that is really pretty and smart. Iâ€™ve decided that Iâ€™m going to ask her out this Thursday (Dec 10). I have one problem, though. I donâ€™t know what to do as a date due to the virus. Iâ€™m thinking about a movie across Zoom, but Iâ€™d be very open to any suggestions you have all got. I think that overall, this subreddit has really made me more confident in myself and given me a better perspective on teenagerism. Any questions or suggestions are more than welcome in my DMs or comments.
