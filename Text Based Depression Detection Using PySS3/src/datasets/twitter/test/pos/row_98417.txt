I donâ€™t belong here I got added to a discord group by a friend from last school year that Iâ€™ve talked to every once in a while.

The group plays Minecraft and stuff together. They seem to all know each other.

I donâ€™t belong there. I donâ€™t anyone but the friend, so I never really get to talk. I try to occasionally but I get the sense the donâ€™t like me.

And another part of it is just I donâ€™t want them to leave me. Itâ€™s been the only contact Iâ€™ve had on the past month or two. But if I leave the group first then it wonâ€™t hurt as much. Itâ€™ll have been up to me and my responsibility.

So yeah. I donâ€™t belong there. I feel like I should just leave
