To all my 2003 born homies... Bruh, our life technically is around a virus only.  


Like our parents fucked in 2002, when there was SARS

and now our last year, i.e HS Senior (For most of you, I believe) is fucked up, cause a virus came. Like this is the pivotal point in our life...

But, to make it a little wholesome, cause I guess we all need it right now, the virus happened in 2002 and *we* came in 2003, as a gift and happiness to our parents ~~mostly...~~ So, on that note, I guess the next year ought to be better for us... I mean, things will change for the good, let's hope...  


Stay safe, all my homies, and ladies and all... hope for the best and it will happen, for sure :)  


Take care!
