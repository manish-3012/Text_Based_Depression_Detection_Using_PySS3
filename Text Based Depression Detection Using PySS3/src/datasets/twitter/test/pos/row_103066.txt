OK I literally just read an article that said when they stormed the capital with that crazy riot a few days ago there were people talking about hanging the vice president and some crazy dude erected a makeshift gallows in front of the Capitol building? Just... what the fuck!...  In all seriousness I've only found one article that said this does anyone know if there's a secondary sourced either verify or dispute this claim because this is a really fucked up and I know there was some guy that got arrested because he had Molotov cocktails and like restraint cuffs that cops use with them when they stormed into the Capitol building.
