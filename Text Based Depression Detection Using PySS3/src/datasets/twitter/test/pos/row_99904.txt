I messed around and made a music video in my backyard. I'd love to hear what y'all think about it Yeah, so one of my hobbies is making beats and writing raps and I made a song so good that I thought I'd shoot a video for it. I can't go much places due to Covid so that's why I shot it in my backyard lol
