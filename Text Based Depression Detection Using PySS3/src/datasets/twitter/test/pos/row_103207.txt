Please just stay safe and wear a mask FML

Iâ€™m in year 11 right now, and my mocks are in three weeks time. Iâ€™ve just been sent home because of a case of covid, meaning that Iâ€™m stuck at home for the next two weeks. I had an English Language paper two, and a Maths non-calculator on the thirtieth of November (in ten days time). My mum is a key worker at a school, I have three siblings in three other different year groups, my best friend has insane parents and half the kids in my year are at high risk due to asthma or diabetes or something. Being a small yeargroup, Iâ€™m close with pretty much everyone. If this spreads, anyone could be in danger. I already missed six months of school, and now Iâ€™ll miss even more. Iâ€™m behind in maths and I needed this extra time to catch up. My family has been trying to move house since August, and we technically sold it on my birthday, but we canâ€™t get a mortgage because of the terrible economy. Christmas is coming up, and itâ€™s already a sad for my family without this. Iâ€™ve developed a tick thing from stress, where Iâ€™ll shake my head to either side. 


Please. Just wear a mask and social distance. Stay safe.
