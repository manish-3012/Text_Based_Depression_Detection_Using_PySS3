To everyone who found my previous post of me wearing the Biden merchandise offensive or controversial... I apologize if my post made you feel that way and I would like to clarify some things!

1. I didnâ€™t JUST do this to make people mad, i did it for a variety of reasons. I did it to express myself, to have fun, and to help other Liberals and Biden supporters come out and express their beliefs as well.

2. I never intended for this to be controversial, I thought it was funny and would make a few people laugh here on Reddit.

3. I donâ€™t need any hate, I donâ€™t have time for that. So any personal jab at me isnâ€™t gonna get to me. donâ€™t waste your time.

Thank you for reading this! :)
