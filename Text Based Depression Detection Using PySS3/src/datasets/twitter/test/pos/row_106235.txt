My APUSH teacher last year was the only teacher to blatantly say â€œslavery was bad.â€ Iâ€™m just curious if people had the same sort of school experience. I mean my school system had talked about slavery and we watched videos of people saying it was bad, but none of my teacher except my APUSH teacher said that slavery was a fucked up thing to do.

Little history on my history teacher (haha god Iâ€™m so depressed) he has a wall with presidents faces on there who were idiots and he calls it â€œthe wall of stupidityâ€ so he was a bit eccentric but also my favorite teacher.
