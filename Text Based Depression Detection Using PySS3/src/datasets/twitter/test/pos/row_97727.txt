Am I being sensitive for staying home from school beacuse of anxiety? Recently I have been having some severe anxiety at school out of the blue pretty much to the point where I almost feel like I'm gonna pass out.

So for context, I have been staying home from school for about two weeks because I have been symptoms of Covid.

I returned back home after having an anxiety attack on the way there and I'm currently scrambling for solutions on what to do.

\-I'm currently 14 by the way.

The teachers have always mentioned that   
"If something is bothering you then you can always talk to us about it"  


So that's what I did, but assuming because I have been staying home for a while they played it off as nothing to worry about "and everyone gets that sometimes".  Even after explaining that I almost passed out and was not feeling well. I suggested that I should go home but they just got pissed at me. 

They portray themselves as helpful individuals but yet they made no efforts to get me any help.

Am I just being sensitive and dumb for not trying to handle this myself, what should I do?
