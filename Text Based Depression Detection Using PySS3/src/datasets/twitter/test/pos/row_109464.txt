This information is all from googling and fact checking TikToks. Get radicalized or get out. I am the real patriot, I am fighting for what is Just and Right even if it is the unpopular opinion, this is what a patriot dose, not brandish a gun and fight for racism in the US, so if you need any more reason to support BLM, your stupid, I've given you reason enough already. I've given you the reasons and the prompts for your letter now all you have to do is email the UN at https://www.un.org/en/contact-us/ and write about any and all; the only other thing I ask of you is that you fill in the character limit. Thank you for your time remember, BLM ACAB I wonâ€™t delete this post, if it gets deleted I did not do it.
