New environments... Iâ€™m a student studying in Singapore and Iâ€™m currently going into my first year of Junior College. Last Friday was my first proper day in the school and we went through orientation programmes. I canâ€™t help but feel very scared and vulnerable about whats in store in the future.

I think my biggest worry is that I might not have friends to help me through these two years. I would say that my secondary school days were one of my happiest days and maybe leaving that and all my friends and the people who made those 4 years of my life really enjoyable might have caused this reaction; i feel constantly anxious and close to tears when i think about it. Its really affecting my mood and im having a harder time eating meals too. 

I know change is a normality and some say change is the only constant, but I really donâ€™t know how to cope with this. On top of being in a new school, knowing almost no one prior to that first day, the subjects sound really scary to me and I guess its freaking me out too.

I dont know how to cope with this, even though Iâ€™ve told my friends and Iâ€™ve heard advice from them, i still feel this anxiety in me and its really affecting everything in life right now. If anyone has had similar feelings, how did you cope with it and overcome this anxiety. I really hate how I feel right now. It doesnâ€™t feel good.
