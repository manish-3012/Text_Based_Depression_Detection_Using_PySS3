4 things to attract the most girls u possibly can in high school. SELF IMPROVE
Itâ€™s self explanatory to look ur best. Clean skin, white teeth, get in the gym (u donâ€™t even have to eat like a body builder, u can be healthy and look good on a regular diet) Keep a haircut and wear nice clothes with a good scent

STATUS
This is the same thing as clout. Wether itâ€™s insta snap chat or YouTube or TikTok or anything if u have a lot of followers it is social proof. Most women are in love with fame or clout. Make a regular IG page with posts and get your followers up. Add ppl and interact on Snapchat and shit. Just grow your accounts as much as u can.

MONEY
Yessir. This one above all. And you shouldnâ€™t be doing this for women but for yourself. Get the bag bro. Wether it be video game tournaments, streaming, making content or gettin a part time job, go get some income.

RESPECT/REPUTATION
Nobody is gonna fuck wit someone who has a very bad reputation. Wish someone taught me the importance of Rep when I was younger. This means to always be on. Never get caught lackin. If someone wants to fight you fight back, if someone talks shit talk back. Stand up for yourself. This also has to do with women. Girls like guys who get girls which is why they get them. Women love competition. And if they see girls want you the. Theyâ€™ll want you

Now not every woman will like u. Oh well go cry about it nigga you arenâ€™t Jesus, you not perfect. This is how u attract them. They like stuff like this. But u still need to talk to them yo self big guy
