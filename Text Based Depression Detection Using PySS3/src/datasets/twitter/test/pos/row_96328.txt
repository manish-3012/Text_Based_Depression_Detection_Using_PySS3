Small engine repair I just turned 15 a week ago and I want to get into small engine repair (lawnmowers, atvs, dirtbikes, snowblowers etc) but I donâ€™t have a garage or shed or anything I can work in and I donâ€™t have much money. It also gets really cold and snows in my area. Does anyone have any ideas on what I could do?
