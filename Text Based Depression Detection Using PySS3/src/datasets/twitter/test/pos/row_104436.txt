How tf do I get a job? My younger sister has had a job for two weeks and has earned $300. My mother had told her to come into my room and brag about it, and in her own words, "Maybe that'll convince him to get a job." Now the reason my younger sister got a job before me is a mixture of Covid, luck, and the biggest of all, me not wanting to deal with the interview.  


So, for those who have a job, how do I get one, because having disposable money before the requirements of living on my own would be nice. Thanks in advance.
