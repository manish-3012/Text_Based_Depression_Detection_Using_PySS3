I decided to prank my teacher today So I do school online, and my teacher couldn't hear us when we were talking. So i decided to pull a prank on her by telling her to try pressing alt+f4, and you know what? SHE ACTUALLY FELL FOR IT!! I think she was kind of ticked off that I did that to her, but it was worth it.
