I crashed my car 2 days ago. Now I'm depressed So I just got my license Mid-August. Sucks that I couldn't go without crashing my car for two months. Anyways; I was at a stop sign in my neighborhood. I turned right. I was looking behind at my mirror. It was dark outside so I couldn't see much. I reached for the dome light (I think it's called that but don't quote me on it) and next thing I knew I heard a loud noise and airbags deployed. Subaru service was automatically getting called. I was shell-shocked. I had no idea how it happened that fast. I got out to see the mailbox (made out of rock) completely leveled. The bottom of the front of my car was broken too. Few minutes later the dude who's mailbox I broke came out of his garage driving his car. He immediately stopped once he saw the mailbox and got out of his car. I explained to him what happened then called my parents (I have ADHD so I tend to panic more often). They came instantly since my house was literally one block down and I explained to them what happened. The police came as well since Subaru service alerted them I guess. The officer asked for the obvious which I showed him. He then asked the guy if he wanted to put a ticket on my license. He said no. The man was going to pick up his pizza from Domino's so my mom did that for him while my dad helped him shovel the remains of the mailbox (he wasn't able to leave because it completely blocked the driveway). He told my family the name of a towing service then left when my mom came back with the pizza. We called the towing company and they told us to wait for 45 minutes. My mom left while me and my dad waited. They came and towed it to Subaru. 

So now I'm left with no car in rural Illinois (the University is like 18 miles away tho). My small village of 8,400 only has a DQ, McDonald's, Subway, JJ and Arby's. I don't know what to do. My parents don't like leaving the house much so I will be stranded at home. I'm also a picky eater so I don't know what I can do if my family brings food I don't like. I was also supposed to be a poll worker but I can't do that without a car. 

TL;DR An Illinois teen crashes his car into a mailbox and now can't drive for the next month in a rural area.

PS: I was fine. Airbag gave me a bad scratch on the back of my left hand but other than that I'm good (physically, mentally is a whole nother story).
