I rickrolled my science class. Okay, so today we were supposed to give a presentation on mitigating the affects of using wind for energy. (The effect was the turbines killing birds, and my idea was to hollow the tips to be like whistles, to scare away the birds.) And at the end of it, I had the link to 'Never Gonna Give You Up'. And my science teacher clicked on it. There was then a cacophony of yelling and laughing at the sound of 35 people being rickrolled.
