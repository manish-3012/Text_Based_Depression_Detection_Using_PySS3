A call with my crush Today I had a two and a half hour call with my crush in which we: talked about motivation, looked at maid outfits for both of us to wear, the licensed internet funny man Alpharad, because 'Spongebob with a Gun', and a hentai, to which I sent her the link, which I've been watching because it just feels like a regular anime + some sexy time.

Pretty normal for our conversations
