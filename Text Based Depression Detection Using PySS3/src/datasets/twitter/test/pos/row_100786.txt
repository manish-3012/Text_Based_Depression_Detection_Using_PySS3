Life update: I just traveled 4 hours to sit on a bench That's it. There are several benches where I'm staying, but no, I decided to spend 4 hours getting to Stockholm to sit on a specific bench. It's not even a comfortable one. If that's not an indicator for how my life is going right now, I don't know what is.
