This is troubling me, I need help So my friend Sarah is 14, and she has an online friend who is 19. The 19 year old is named Dustin and he is about to turn 20. He has been saying some questionable things to her on discord, and fishy stuff has been going on. 11 days after she broke up with her ex, she revealed that her and Dustin were dating. Dustin kept saying â€œlove is loveâ€ and that they were a furry couple. No, this is bullshit Iâ€™m breaking you two up. So thatâ€™s what I did. I broke them up. They still act like they are together though, Iâ€™m worried he will do something to Sarah. Sarah recently said she is â€œgroundedâ€ when really I have seen her online with Dustin in roblox and steam and stuff. Dustin did something to make her get over her ex in just a week, and made her want him more than all her other friends. At first I blamed this on jealousy â€œmaybe Iâ€™m just jealousâ€. But no, something weird is going on. Idk whether itâ€™s right to call him a pedo yet or not though. Sarah also got mad at me when I mentioned her and Dustinâ€™s relationship and she said I â€œtook that away from herâ€. Dustin also blocked me on every website or platform we know eachother on. Me and my friend Morris seem to be the only ones thinking something weird is going on, everyone else we know on discord said they were completely fine with when they were dating, and fine with all the questionable things Dustin said. I feel as if he is aware that he is (what I think) a pedophile. I called him one before, and he got pissed at me and said â€œdonâ€™t call me thatâ€ and that he has history with that word. That obviously means something. Idk, Iâ€™m just worried about her and all. I might just be getting corrupted by jealousy. Iâ€™m just confused and thought this subreddit was a good place to vent.
