Story time: the most frightening moment of my life Ok this is going to sound ridiculous but this came from a farm goat. We were visiting my dadâ€™s farm and when we were getting back in the car to go home my dad said that we were bringing a goat along and that it had to sit NEXT TO ME. Next thing you know I was sitting next to the goat in the back seat of my parents car and it was TERRIBLE. The goat was screaming and kicking around and I was scared for my life. My dad kept insisting that I was safe but I certainly didnâ€™t feel safe at all. I was at the point where I was crying like crazy and screaming to be let in the front seat.

Eventually my mom convinced my dad to let me go away from the goat but it was still traumatizing. We are off to slaughter the goat now. BRB to write another post about me being traumatized, but this time about the slaughter.
