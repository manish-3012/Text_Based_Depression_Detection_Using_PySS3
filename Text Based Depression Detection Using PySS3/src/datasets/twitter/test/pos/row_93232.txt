What browser do you use? I'm looking for an alternative. I've been using Firefox for ages, but since their recent post I don't believe they are the same company what they used to be. and that they fight for free internet and free speech.

I'm thinking about Vivaldi, water fox, pale moon or gnu ice cat..

Any advice or experience with privacy focused browsers?
