a favor Hi. my name is Tess and im schizophrenic. my whole life i have wanted to raise awareness and educate people on mental health struggles. i believe that mental health is looked down upon and that it needs more attention brought to it. 

i made a Facebook page in attempt to get my organization started. the page is called 'Discover Mentally' and i would love if you checked it out. there isnt much yet, but with some support and motivation, this could become something great. 

I'm not asking you to donate or anything. maybe just check it out and leave a like on the page. 

thank you tons.
