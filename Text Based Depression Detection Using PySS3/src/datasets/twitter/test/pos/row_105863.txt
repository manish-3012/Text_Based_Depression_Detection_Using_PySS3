I just saved a man from suicide! Yeah this isn't as long as the others because I don't want to make it long but before I start, please excuse my very very cursed username. Like I'm talking about not filling up the comment section with "r/rimjobsteve" or stuff related. 
Now anyway while on discord I encountered this guy making a lot and I mean a LOT of suicide jokes on discord, I tried to ask him what's goin on in the PM's and turns out he was in a very bad position in life, he felt as if he didn't have a purpose but as I used to be in that position before I already knew what had to be said, anyway I told him about how it's an amazing thing to be alive and told him about what it means to make the most of it. It's a lot and again I don't want this to be 16 paragraphs long but anyway this guy seems to be much more upbeat in the VC chats and barely makes suicide jokes at all. I actually play Minecraft with him often just to make sure the vibe check is successful, anyway if I'm not enough I'll recommend him some therapy but other than that he seems to be much better. 



If you made it this far thank you, I just wanted to share this not for karma but to show you guys to look out for others :)
