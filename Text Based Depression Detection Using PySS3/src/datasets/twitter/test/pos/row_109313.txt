Sick of my parents calling my hobby an addiction. Hi, I'm 16, I play a guitar, I go to the gym twice a week, I'm doing good in school, yet I play on my computer for more than 30 minutes and my parents start calling me an addict, tell me to take a break and do other in my life than just playing video games.

I'm just sick of it, just because I'm not as social as you and spend more time playing video games it doesn't mean that I'm an addict.
