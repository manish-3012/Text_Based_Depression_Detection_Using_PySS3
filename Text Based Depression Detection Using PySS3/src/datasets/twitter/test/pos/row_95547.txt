When will it get better? So ever since I was formally diagnosed with depression about 6.5 years ago I've always been told by almost everyone and every source trying to support those like myself with depression that "it will get better" or "this feeling is only temporary" or that kind of thing. but what i want to know is \*when will it end\* people say it will and it's all temporary but if that's true then \*when will it end\*.  This isn't just because of covid either, where I am we aren't wearing asks and there's only 2 covid cases so me and everyone around me isn't worrying about it directly. This is just about how I feel lied to for years and I don't feel there really is any end to my mental suffering. So when will it end? 

And when will anyone care either? I talk to no one and the only time people actually talk to me is if I go into my uber depressive states and start threatening to kill myself which I shouldn't have to do to get people to talk to me. I try to message people and talk but they leave me on read or give dead answers and don't engage in conversation at all making it clear they don't want to talk to me.
