Get helped before you try to help During the biggest low point in my life I tried to find meaning in trying to help others. I joined a chat room where suicidal people come to ask for help.

I used to be there for hours every day just trying to talk people out of suicide. Some of the stories they told were very sad. I still think about some of the people. I really wish they are still alive. 

It was very draining to be there for them. It made my situation much worse.

So get help yourself before going out of your way to help others. It will not fix your problems.
