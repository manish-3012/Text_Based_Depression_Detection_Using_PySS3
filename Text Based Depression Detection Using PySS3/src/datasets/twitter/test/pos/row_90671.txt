Weight loss day 11 Iâ€™ve been doing good avoiding carbs and sugar as of late. Smaller meals are really helping me with portion control- because i am used to smaller portions i CANNOT binge eat even if i wanted to. My max capacity on food is down a whole third. (Used to be able to eat three plates, now only 1.5/2) Feeling good about it
