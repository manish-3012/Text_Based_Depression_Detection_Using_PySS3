Im just gonna rant a little, it wont make much sense Im will never have an enjoyable summer break for at least years to come

I will have a super difficult time getting a stable socialcircle 

Shits far from perfect to the point where im scared to eat an apple if i want to or go to bed when im tired

Pretending too much around a lot of things

I get paid for highschool and people think it makes me really happy while i dont care about the money at all because i want other things to become stable

Shit is getting worse in odd ways

Im unsure about my hope for different things

Wanna fix but its difficult and does it even matter?





This rant was for myself so it probable wont make any sense and that sort of the point with a lot of it
