WHAT PRIDE MONTH REALLY IS. We aint celebrating sexuality we are taking pride in being ourselves since society has taught us to hate  us for being who we are. If not for pride month i would not have stopped hating myself for being bi...a lot of people have been taught to hate themselves and consider themselves a sin and i don't think one month for celebration is too much. Since people still despise gay people in the current world.
