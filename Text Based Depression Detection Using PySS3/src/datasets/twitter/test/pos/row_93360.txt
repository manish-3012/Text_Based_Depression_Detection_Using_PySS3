do people actually like posts with girls in them? Ok, let me elaborate. I see these comparison posts of someone posting a really nice art or something without anyone in it, then with a boy it gets some awards and upv\*tes, and then when a girl uploads it it gets all the awards and so many upv\*tes. 

Does this really happen because I never saw myself, or are those comparisons just fake?
