Hey do you wanna compliment someone without sounding like a simp or a creep? Well dont you worry my friend, i got you. Dont compliment sexual parts of their body, like "oh nice tits" or "hey nice boner" thats fucking weird. Instead say things like. "hey you have a cute smile" or "hey your hair looks good today". Instead of saying, "damn you look hot" say "BRO UR LOOKING FIRE TODAY, WHAT?? YOU GO HOMIE THATS WHAT I LIKE TO SEE!! LETSS GOOO" hype them up. to not sound like a simp, simply just throw in "bro" and "homie" alot. Your trying to be friendly, not flirt. But yeah thats pretty much it, Oh and be confident. if your being awkward and stuff and u compliment them, it can be weird. Be confident, instead of saying "h-hi yeahh uhhh so like uhhh so uhhh yeahhh u look uhh kinda cute and stuff yeahhh uhhh anywaysssss" grow some balls and just spit it out! but yeah thats it.
