Itâ€™s sad hours. Or months :( My crush blocked me on everything. We were amazing friends and we had dated before. He knew I liked him but he never let it ruin the friendship, then boom, no warning, no goodbye, no nothing. He means so much to me and it really hurts. This happened about two weeks ago but I needed to tell someone. Have a nice day yâ€™all
