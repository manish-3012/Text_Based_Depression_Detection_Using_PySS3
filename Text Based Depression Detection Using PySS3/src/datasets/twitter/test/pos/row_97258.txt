Just out of interest. Am i the onlyone who hates valentins day? I hate that there so mutch of a fuss around it. So you are saying i got to do smth atleast smth little with a person i like? Isnt that forced love? YES IT IS!

And idk why but in my area i am seriousely the only one who hates this day. I would rather be showimg my love spontainiousely and supprise my partner. But for that more often!

If you hate it as well comment. And if you think im weird, try to change my mind
