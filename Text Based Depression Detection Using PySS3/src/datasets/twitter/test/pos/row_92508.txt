To all the boys out there... I know this is a little weird of me to ask, but Iâ€™m just curious. What do guys look for in girls that makes them think â€œI want her to be my girlfriendâ€?

Like, not just â€œoh sheâ€™s hotâ€ or crushing on her, but like actual love. What traits make guys feel that way about girls?
