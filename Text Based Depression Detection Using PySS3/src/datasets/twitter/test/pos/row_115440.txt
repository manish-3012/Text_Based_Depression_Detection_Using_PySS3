My grandpa passed when I was going to visit him. I haven't seen my grandpa in around 5 or 6 years because he lived 9 hours away from me. He had cancer, and was put in the hospital last month. Doctors decided to put him in hospice care 2 days ago. My aunt, sister, my mom, and I were going to drive that 9 hours to go see him. He passed away at around 11 AM, an hour into the drive. I'll never forget my moms voice when she told my sister and I what happened. Despite him living 9 hours away from me, and despite me not even being related to him by blood, he still cared for me. I still have the birthday card he sent last year, and I still have the laptop he got me 3 years ago. I'd trade all that away if I got to see him one last time. I don't know when, but I'm going to make that drive some day. You never know when you're going to lose someone, hold on to those around you while you still can. I'm going to live with the regret of not getting to see him again for the rest of my life. He was a good guy, and I'm going to miss him.
