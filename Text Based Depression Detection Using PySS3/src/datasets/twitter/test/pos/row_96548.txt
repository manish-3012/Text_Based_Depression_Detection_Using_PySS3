Day 2 of posting a random thought (sorry for being so late, my ISP is fricking up) Can cum be used as a glue alternative? I mean it isn't  *extremely* sticky but we can add additives and so on to increase stickiness. And if it's possible, would it be a renewable resource? Actually does cum even have an alternative use to impregnation?
