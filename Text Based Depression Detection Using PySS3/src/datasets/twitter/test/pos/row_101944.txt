Rest in piece to my cat. This is the first pet death Iâ€™ve experienced in my life, he was around since I was just a toddler. He had to be put down since he was in lot of pain, Itâ€™s just his sister left, Iâ€™ll miss him. 

I donâ€™t know what to truly feel, itâ€™s weird I wanted to replace him right away since It feels kinda dull when there isnâ€™t another animal that brings such a big personality in the family.

Iâ€™ll look back at this post in the future and think about the fun times.
