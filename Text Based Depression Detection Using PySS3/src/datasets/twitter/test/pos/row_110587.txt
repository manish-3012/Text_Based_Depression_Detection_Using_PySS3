ok I might just fucked up with my crush without her knowing ok a long time ago a very good friend of mine I met on the internet told me that he got a girlfriend now, so because I was jealous I told him that I have a gf as well. By accident, I mentioned the name of my crush someday so he thinks I'm together with her.  I didn't want to look like an idiot after he told me that he broke up with his gf so I never told him that the girl I pretended to be my gf never was. We didn't speak much about that topic but yesterday he discovered her Instagram and started following her. As I mentioned above I didn't want to look like an idiot so I didn't say anything.   


I have a very strong relationship with her, we are best friends and sometimes I think that I just have to tell her that I love her and we're gonna be a couple. So today she asked me who he is because he followed her on Instagram and also told me that she asked him as well. So, it possibly could happen any second that he writes to her that I'm his boyfriend, or at least pretend to be. I neither want to tell him that I lied to him, nor I want to tell her that I pretend to be her boyfriend by accident. And well my relationship with her that grew about 3 years may be ruined with a few text messages. fuck.
