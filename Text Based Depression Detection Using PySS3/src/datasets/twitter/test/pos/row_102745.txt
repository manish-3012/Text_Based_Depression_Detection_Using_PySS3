I believe that English is a very subjective subject What might be considered an A+ to one teacher might be a D at best to another, even if they are both teaching the same kind of English class.

I feel like we as students literally have to alter our writing styles year after year just to cater to what different English teachers deem as "good."

And it's so stupid.

Especially when you have to write essays based on the "main idea" or "theme" that an author was trying to "convey" in a text.

I might write one thing, but the teacher would say another thing, and therefore my claim would automatically be wrong. I'm sorry that we are two entirely different people who can interpret the same text in completely different ways. Teachers ought to respect our points of view too. There is no write or wrong way to do English, specifically writing essays. It's not like math where there are a million different methods to get one outcome. English is more like there are a million different methods to get a million different outcomes.

So how can you say that my essay is not up to par just because it doesn't fit your own personal, biased criteria? I'm sorry that I do not share your mind.
