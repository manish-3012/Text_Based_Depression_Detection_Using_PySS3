How to approach my parents about cutting my hair Hi there, I don't know if this applies here, but as teens you'd probably understand this. I am female and have always been a tomboy. I want to cut my hair short and donate it. I have a haircut picked out and everything. I don't know how my parents would feel about it. Do any of you have any experiences or advice that could help me with this?
