I was never as pissed as I was today So some background. I'm gonna graduate this year in my high school but I wasn't in school for almost half year. (third year last half+last year first half until now) and basically I don't have normal lessons or they are very bad quality because of the system. And I'm frustrated because of that. Also I failed my highway code exam again (this was my second time) I hate my body, I have a lot of things to do, I have to think about universities, and also I'm gay and my parent can't accept it so I have to hide my "relationship" (the " is because Im talk g with a guy but we can't meet because of the pandemic.)and this is the last thing about the bacround. The fucking pandemic. I'm close inside my house where I have toxic parents and a spoiled sister.

What happened today: so the first catalyst was the highway code exam where I failed. Then I was in online school until 4:15pm but I had to ditch some tome from one of my lesson because I had to go for my sister who said she is sick but the only thing was with her is that she had a headache... (second catalyst) So when I came back I got in the class where my teacher was not too happy for the late. The my mom came home and I thought "oh I can rest now" but no because her leg was in pain so I can't rest because I had to cook a dinner for the family, and clean the house. (third catalyst) After that I knew I can rest (but I was very pissed at this point)

The explosion: my mom sent my sister in my room while I was playing to help her in his homework. She had to learn a song in German (I'm Hungarian) and her "biology" (she is in 3rd grade and she is nine) is in German too. She said there is not too much because she knows almost everything. That was at 7pm. I studied with her until 10 fucking pm... In this point I was so frustrated, pissed of, and angry I almost threw her book out but I didn't because I don't want to scare her like this. And then... After that 3 hour studies session. Where I could literally cry because my sister cant remember for a word I told her 100 times, and also she told me back but she was keep forgetting it because she doesn't cared about this so for her that 100 times was one and "she cant learn a word I told her 1 time". So after this my mom came in. I told her what's going on. And she said okay. The she won't go in school tomorrow because if she do she will get a bad grade. I literally stood up from my chair. Walked down in our garden and smoked 3 cigarettes in a row ( I usually don't smoke unless I'm drunk), I cried out loudly about my whole fucking life, also cried from anger too and I came back, got in my room, closed the door, and now I'm sitting and writing this to calm myself down.

Thank you if you read this.
