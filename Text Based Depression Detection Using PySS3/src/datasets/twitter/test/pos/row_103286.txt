Would anyone like to hold a social experiment with some other redditors and I? Iâ€™d like to get around 20 people together and create a government of sorts I want to see how teenagers think about cause and effect and problem solving. There will be a few rules but really nothing affecting what you can and canâ€™t do in the â€œgovernmentâ€.
