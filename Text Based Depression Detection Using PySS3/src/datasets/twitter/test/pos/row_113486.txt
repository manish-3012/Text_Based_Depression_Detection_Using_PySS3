I finally found a place in the internet that people just have fun and don't discuss viruses and politics (mostly) It's called CnCnet. Specifically the Yuri's Revenge servers, which are the most popular ones. Think Among Us but for older people. It's a great service to play a great game with people online, I advise you to check it out.
