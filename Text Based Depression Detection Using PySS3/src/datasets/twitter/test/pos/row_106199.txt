Any teenagers out there wanna help my equation? So someone said to be an equation, A=(ab+c)/d, and they asked me, what would be the equation if we were to be finding c.

This gonna be good for you too, since I know some teenagers here gonna hate math, but you're gonna love it.

Tried c=(A/d)-ab, but they said it was wrong. So... any ideas?
