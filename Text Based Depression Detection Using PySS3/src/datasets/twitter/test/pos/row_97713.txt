What kind of dreams do you have? Iâ€™m asking because I donâ€™t think mine of late are normal. The past few nights Iâ€™ve died gruesomely, feeling rapid hot / cold sensations as I die. For example, in one of them I was slowly sawing my own head off as a form of torture inflicted upon me by some sort of officials. I felt coldness in the exposed meat of my neck, and a split second after my head chopped off I woke up. Fun times. How about you?
