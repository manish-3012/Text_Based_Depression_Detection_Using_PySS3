How to pass out - step by step guide Idk why I'm writing this but I'll do it anyway cuz I'm bored

DISCLAIMER - don't do it if you have some kind of breathing illness or something like that. Make sure that someone is around you so he/she can wake you up if you didn't do that yourself. Never do this alone. If you are too scared to do this, don't force yourself!!!!!
When you pass out you will probably shake or do weird thing's with you body but don't worry, I tried it myself and I'm completely fine
DON'T DO THIS MULTIPLE TIMES IN A ROW!!! IT'S SAFE TO DO IT ONCE BUT DON'T DO IT MULTIPLE TIMES AT THE SAME DAY!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!
I tried it and I'm fine but you are doing this at your own risk!!!



Was you ever curious how passing out feels like? Wish no more, there is step by step guide how to do this. Just fallow the steps.


1) Sit at the edge of you bed (there is a chance that you will fall forward and not backwards so make sure that floor next to you is covered in pillows or something like that so you won't brake your face)

2) Open stopwatch on your phone

3) Start breathing fast and deep with your mouth for around 1 - 1.30 minute (you need to find the perfect amount of time for you - it can take a couple attempts)

4) When you're done with breathing, stand up quickly, grab your nose and block it and at the same time, start exhaling air thru your blocked nose

You will probably fall back and pass out and you will wake up shortly after. When you wake up, you won't remember what happened and you will feel weird but in a couple of minutes you will get back to normal.

I think that's all and I think I explained it correctly and understandably. Remember, you are doing it at your own risk but I'm pretty sure it's safe cuz me and all of my friends did this and they are fine.
