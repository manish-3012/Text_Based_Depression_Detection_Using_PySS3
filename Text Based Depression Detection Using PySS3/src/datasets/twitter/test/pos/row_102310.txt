Yes, we are gamers too! Iâ€™ve seen posts and comments saying that Nintendo gamers or people who donâ€™t play as many hours arenâ€™t considered as gamers. Like, are you stupid?

Nintendo is a gaming company too, that makes their own consoles, that makes their own games, and is Nintendo gamers arenâ€™t actually gamers?

If you were to define what a gamer is, it would be a person who plays video games, so whatâ€™s wrong with Nintendo? Theyâ€™re a gaming company too!

All my life, I only owned Nintendo consoles, and I definitely consider myself a gamer. Iâ€™ve played hundreds of hours playing these lovely games, and theyâ€™ve changed my life.

But apparently Nintendo gamers arenâ€™t actually gamers because their games donâ€™t have enough action, or they donâ€™t have the best graphics. For fucks sake, just admit our games are different and move on.

If you like horror games, youâ€™re a gamer. If you like action games, youâ€™re a gamer. If you like open-world games, youâ€™re a gamer. But if you like peaceful and family games, youâ€™re not.

If you criticise someone for using a Nintendo console, Satan is a big fan of you, because you canâ€™t accept that people like things that youâ€™re not interested in. 

So sit down, shut up, and play some Animal Crossing, because that will calm you down.
