i hate life as we know it Who says I canâ€™t just go into the middle of the forest and start my own small civilization, forage for food, build my own shelter, hunt, the works.


why do I have to conform to societies standards? why do I have to have a job? why do I have to buy a house?  like fuck off with that bullshit


why am I owned by a government? Why do I have a Social Security number? Why am I a number? Why am I allowed to be locked up in prison?


The only reason we have law and government is because we all agree that it should exist, imagine if we all just started to rebel.


I hate that the government controls our lives.


like I could literally be taken and locked up in a prison at any moment for any reason, and we all just agree that itâ€™s OK and Iâ€™m not saying that life will be better without these rules but Iâ€™m just saying itâ€™s kind of weird that its is possible.


I probably sound like my brain is not OK right now but this is just something I think about often
