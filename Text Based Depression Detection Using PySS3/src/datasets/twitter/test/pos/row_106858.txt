I need to get over a stupid crush I never should have had in the first place [serious]  

I wanted to post this on a throwaway but I needed karma so uhhh I'll just hope no one irl finds this post.

A few months ago, a friend introduced me (17M) to one of her friends (17M). Usually when people introduce me to their friends I don't really do much more than say hi and make light conversation, and then we never talk again. This time was different though, and he and I immediately exchanged instagrams and started talking. We talk all day and we've hung out a lot, and I knew pretty quickly that I had a crush on him. I immediately told myself I would never tell him, and I knew I wasn't his type and I have a lot of issues that just would not make me a good person to date. I also never have told my crushes that I like them, I've always just tried to ignore my feelings and waited until I could move on, even if it took years. He talked a lot about wishing he had a boyfriend and posted a lot of those like 'mlm positivity posts' and other things where he fantasizes about having a boyfriend, and every time I saw those I wish I could have responded because I wanted to be that for him. He'd also talk to me about wishing he was dating someone, but he would always talk about other people that he liked. This pretty much just cemented that he wasn't interested in me at all. I knew I should have just gotten out then and there, but no matter what I tried I couldn't stop liking him. One day I did one of those little story games where you answer questions and I put 'iykyk' as the response to if I had a crush, and he asked me about it but I lied and said I didn't actually have a crush on anyone, I just put it to sound mysterious. I feel terrible about it, especially because I told him I'd never lie to him, and then I did.

I was scared to ever tell him that I liked him mostly because I didn't want to ruin our friendship. I'm worried he'll be disgusted by me if I tell him the truth and even worse I'm worried he'll think I did nice things for him just because I wanted to date him, when I really did them because I care about him and no matter what I just want to be his friend. In all the scenarios I played out in my head, I didn't care if he rejected me just as long as he wanted to stay friends and it didn't make things awkward between us.

Today he told me that he asked out someone he liked and they said yes. I'm trying to be happy for him, but I just can't. I know it's my fault I'm upset because I should have made myself get over him months ago or I should have just told him how I felt. I wish I'd said something because I at least even just needed to be rejected so I could get over him. Now it's too late and I feel like I'm a horrible person. I should be genuinely happy for him and I'm supposed to support him but instead I've been just pretending to be happy and instead I'm upset and I've been crying all night, and I have no right to do that. I wish I could just get over him.

It's stupid and really really horrible but part of me hopes things don't work out between him and this person. Part of me hopes this will turn out like a romance novel where in the end he realizes we're meant for each other and everyone ends up happy, but I know real life isn't like that and that doesn't happen to real people. I also know I'm probably too young to be this upset over a relationship I'm not even in and that either way we'll both be moving away for college next year and it's really likely that we'll stop being friends at all and just drift apart. I kind of think I need to stop talking to him now before he finds out that I've had feelings for him and just ends up disgusted with me. I just need advice I guess, I have no idea what to do and I just feel really horrible and like I'm not a good person at all for this. I want the bad feelings to all go away.
