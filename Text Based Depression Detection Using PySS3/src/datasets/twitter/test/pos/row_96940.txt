Why did I react this way? I thought I was over her While I was working yesterday, my former crush came in with her boyfriend to order a drink. She seemed really excited to see me and it was almost like she forgot her boyfriend was there for a second. She was saying how it was so nice to see me and itâ€™s been a while since she last saw me. When I saw her and she started talking to me for some reason, I felt my face starting to become hot and almost red. I tried my best to control it, because her boyfriend was right there. My muscles started to tighten up and I had butterflies in my stomach too, it was just like old times. I donâ€™t understand why I started to feel this way again though. I thought I was over her, I honestly did. After she left, I went into the back and kind of freaked out and I kept repeating to myself, â€œWhy do I still like her?â€ â€œWhy do I feel this way? I thought I was over her.â€
