This one girl So i got a gf (almost 11 months)

But this one girl, I swear the moment I saw her shheesshh i fell in love.
But I knew i couldn't get her.
That was before i entered a relationship with my gf.


Once I messed up by insulting the other girl. I really wanna have her as a friend, cuz she is 1. Damn cute 2.looks really nice

A friend says i should.just chat with her and try to make contact again.

I really want to but idk she is so damn cute

I would cheat on my gf but like i really wanna have her as a friend
