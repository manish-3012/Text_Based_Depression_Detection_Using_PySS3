Some girl called me nice! It was our first day of school, and I go around looking for lonely people. I always do this because I want to make the first day of school just a little bit better for them, give them someone to talk to, y'know? I found her sitting alone, picking grass. She looks up and I see the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen. I sit with her and start talking.

We talk and we develop a pretty good friendship. One day we are talking about an essay for a group project, when she blurts out,

"Sorry for being out of the blue, but I think you're really nice"

My brain just stopped working. I hadn't gotten a compliment in so long, I'd forgotten what to say. 

Now I'm just gushing over the fact that someone called me nice. :)
