Talking to my mom about my potential depression Recently i have been super sad. Im not sure if its depression or just the sadness Iâ€™ve bottles up for so long coming out. I want to tell my mom how im feeling and whats wrong but i dont want her to worry about me or think shes a bad parent. What can i do? And how can i know if this is depression?
