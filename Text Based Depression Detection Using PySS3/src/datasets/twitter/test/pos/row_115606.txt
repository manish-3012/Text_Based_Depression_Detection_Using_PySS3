How do you deal with someone who constantly brings up negative things about themselves every time we have a conversation I know they have a really low self-esteem but it has come to a point where whenever they do that, it kinda gives me a headache a little bit?

I've been saying reassuring and positive things to them but they will always go back to their self-deprecating self. It's tiring me out tbh.
