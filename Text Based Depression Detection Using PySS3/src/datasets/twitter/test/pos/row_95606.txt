Man you know, I love space and earth for 2 reasons. 1. Both are just so majestic and beautiful. For Space, it's the stars and Nebulas and Galaxy's and all that. So fucking cool. For earth it's volcanoes and mountains and weather and everything.

2 But they are also so destructive. Supernovas, Kilonovas, Black holes. And Volcano eruptions, hurricanes, tornadoes, and many other things.

So majestic, yet so dangerous. I fucking love it
