I'm thinking about killing myself but I kinda don't want to do it It would be easier than to face my problems. But I also want to have a good life. I want to spend time with my friends, finish trade school and get a job, get a partner etc. I also have dreams I want to do.

But as I'm under 18 and live at home, my parents would need to know if I went to a therapist as I don't have money to pay for it or a way of transportation. My parents also can't afford therapy right now so I'm not gonna tell them about my problems as that would just make them stress more.
