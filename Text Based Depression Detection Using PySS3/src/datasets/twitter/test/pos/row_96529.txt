I had a weird dream Last night I dreamt that my uncle turned into a rat. This was apparently normal, so in the dream I didnâ€™t worry too much about it. I was busy watching a movie with some girls(yes, it was a dream) when I decided to go and check on him. When I went to the room where Iâ€™d last seen him, I saw my dog chewing something in the floor and looked to see what it was. All that was left was a tail
Thatâ€™s when I woke up.
I know that some dreams are supposed to be caused by something, but dude, wtf?
So anyway, thanks for coming to my TED talk
Now get off your phone and back to work
