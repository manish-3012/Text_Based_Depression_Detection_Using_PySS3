I've been worried about my older brother So he's 21, i'm 16, we've never had any jobs at all. he hasn't ate in 4 weeks and he has written nonsense and weird drawings around the house. We're both giants but i'm weaker than he is. He's 6'4 and i'm 6'2. I'm beginning to wonder if HE could be schizophrenic. I'm scared to talk to him now.
