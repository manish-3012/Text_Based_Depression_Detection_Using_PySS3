It turns out my best friend had a crush on me at the same time as I had one on her. So me and this girl have been friends for four years now and obviously, me being a teenage boy, I start to develop feeling for her and apparently she did to, but by the time I build up the courage to ask her out she started liking a different guy. This was a year ago and Iâ€™m still upset.
