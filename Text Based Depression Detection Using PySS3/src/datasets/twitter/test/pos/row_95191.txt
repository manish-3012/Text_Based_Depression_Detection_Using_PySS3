I am so fucking tired of the US school system I need student unions to be a thing. You know, like a workerâ€™s union, but for students, and one that actually can make changes happen - specifically making accommodations more available.

Iâ€™ve never been to a psychiatrist or therapist. I suspect I have ADHD. My mom will never take me. We live in pretty much the country now. My dad lives too far away (2+ hr drive) and I only see him for 1 week a month. My stepdad is away or busy most of the time because he runs his own business. So Iâ€™m stuck without a diagnosis.

Getting back on track. All I want is a simple accommodation. To be able to step outside for a few minutes during timed exams. Just to breathe some fresh air, pace around a bit and then go back inside. If I canâ€™t do that, Iâ€™m unable to perform as well as I could. Essentially, I have a panic attack.

Around February last year I talked to every staff member I could trust and/or knew could help. I got a â€œyouâ€™ll have to talk to (x)â€ every time, so I went to that person, and I kept on getting shuffled up and up until I finally got a response to my question. 

The answer? â€œSorry, but allowing you that would give you *an unfair advantage* compared to other students.â€

An unfair advantage. An unfair advantage?? Iâ€™m already at a severe disadvantage. If anything, Iâ€™d still be below par. So I asked about changes that could be made to my idea and reiterated the boundaries. I wasnâ€™t asking to extend my time for the exam for every break. I could have them take my backpack, phone etc during the break. An aide could supervise me the entire time. Hell Iâ€™d even be okay with getting a TSA style pat down as long as I can trust the person doing it to not violate me. But no, â€œeven then it could encourage other students to ask for the same and we canâ€™t have everyone doing that can we?â€ 

So I went home angry and looked at my options. There is a way to achieve it, but Iâ€™d need a diagnosis and a note from a psychiatrist and my mom and I would have to fill out a bunch of paperwork and go to a bunch of meetings, or my mom and I would have to fill out a lot more paperwork and go to a lot more meetings. She doesnâ€™t want to do that. Itâ€™s not worth the effort, I donâ€™t think so either. 

Itâ€™s *ridiculous* how difficult it can be to receive accommodations like that. So simple and yet so much effort, makes you think. Theyâ€™ll claim they just want to avoid the system being exploited.. I see where youâ€™re coming from but amending other areas of the school system (e.g. eliminating assessments that are based on rote memorization) could avoid that. No way to cheat if you need to be original, thinking critically, and everything is run through a plagiarism checker.

Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve got to say for now.

TL;DR: No, go read the entire post, Iâ€™m not summarizing my rant for you.
