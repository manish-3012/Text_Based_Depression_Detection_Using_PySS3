Opening up to people is really a scam. I regret opening up to all people. Not only that they canâ€™t help me with my problem, but they also judge me for it. They say mental health is not my fault, but later they say like somehow it is my fault, but they just donâ€™t say it out loud, they say it indirectly. I know itâ€™s my fault that I have no control over it and Iâ€™m sorry. I promise I wonâ€™t open up to anyone ever again because every time I do, I regret it.
