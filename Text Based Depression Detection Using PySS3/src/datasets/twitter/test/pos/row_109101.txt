I donâ€™t know what I am. Recently I havenâ€™t been feeling comfortable in my body as a female. But I donâ€™t feel like I am always male either. Is it possible that I could be gender fluid? Because some days I feel like a girl and some days I donâ€™t. I donâ€™t know if this is the right subreddit to talk about these kinds of things so if it isnâ€™t, please tell me where I should go and Iâ€™ll gladly delete this. Iâ€™m just so confused.
