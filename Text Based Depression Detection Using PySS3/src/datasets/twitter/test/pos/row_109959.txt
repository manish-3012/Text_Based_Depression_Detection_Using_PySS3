The horrors of the climbing unit in Gym class Ask anyone who knows me irl, I fucking love gym class. Itâ€™s where I thrive, not to brag but in middle school your popularity was based on your performance in gym class and in turn I made a lot friends. But once I got to high school they introduced the climbing unit. We had a forest right outside our school where they set up zip lines and rock climbing and balancing on a pole suspended 30 feet in the air. And I know you might be thinking that the scary part was the climbing and suspended high above the air, no, that wasnâ€™t scary at all. The worst part was those mother fucking *harnesses*. Girls? They had it easy, no problem at all they could strap on their harness and be completely fine. But when I say that you could teach an entire anatomy class with just a picture of a boy wearing one of those harnesses, I mean it. That shit was right and showed EVERYTHING. And the girls in my school just loved to stare and laugh. And that was just when you put it on. Once your hanging from a rope with actually pressure or tension? Forget about it. It was insane. Everybody could see everything. Wearing jeans or khakis would help, but not much. Plus it was gym class so you couldnâ€™t wear them anyways. Those polyester gym shorts everyone wore became our worst enemy as it made gym class suddenly not appropriate for anyone under the age of 12. Anyway thank you for coming to my Ted talk
