When the day just sucks. I know many probably have this aswell when a day kind of just sucks already. Every little inconvienience just feels like a blow against your day and everything demoralizes you. 

Today I have one of these days, today I had those just enraging stuff happening and I am laying in bed, thankfully having my cat on my lap and trying to just take a breather. 

Why do I always have to think things through every single time but the entire family disregards it when someone else doesn't when it comes to me? 

Why do I have to care for my siblings feelings if they dont for me? 

These are my thoughts right now and I dont know they answer yet. Do some of you?
