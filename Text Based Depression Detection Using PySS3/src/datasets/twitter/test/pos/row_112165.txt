Anybody else get like random depression on sundays? As a kid Sundayâ€™s were always so freaking depressing like id wake up on Sunday be fine and then like around sunset. Iâ€™d just get smack by the biggest depression wave ever, and it always happened. Every Sunday. The depression felt so lonely. 

It eventually stopped and didnâ€™t come back until today. Right at sunset, it was the same feeling I got every Sunday all those years ago. I immediately recognized it, but why did it just come back all of a sudden?

Anyone else experience this or is there something wrong with me?
