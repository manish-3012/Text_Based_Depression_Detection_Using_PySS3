Last Nights sleeping. Idk what else to do. I have sleeping problems, so normally I can't fall asleep for hours until my body says screw it and shuts down. Well last night I was up late trying to get some sleep, then when I was finally falling asleep my brain decides it wants to stay up for another 2 hours and decides to think bout some shower though I saw months ago"yo, isn't it weird we gotta pretend like were sleeping to fall asleep". I was up until 2 AM!
