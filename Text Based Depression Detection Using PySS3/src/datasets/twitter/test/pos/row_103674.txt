my whole system and cycle of life is kinda messed up nks before my brother came to visit from NYC down to Florida, life was pretty good ngl, I was finishing assignments, I was biking and running, and walking daily, eating healthy, everything was good but then my brother came and everything feel off, it's not his fault at all either, it's completely my fault but it's so hard to stay on track when all I wanna do is spend time with my brother especially now that hes calm and is better with his anger bc his joy friend came with him and he has therapy but like honestly I can't wait till he goes back so I can go back to my grind on getting on my shit, I love my brother but with the combination of ADHD and him being home is hard and difficult
