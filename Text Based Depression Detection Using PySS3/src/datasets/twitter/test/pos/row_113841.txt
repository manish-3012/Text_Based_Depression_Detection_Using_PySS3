The previous post got removed I just had the best idea of my life, here's my idea :


I made a collaborative playlist on Spotify and I want ALL of you to add ONE song, it can be anything if it's on Spotify, here's some rules :


1- please do not add more than 1 song

2- you can't put a song who's already on the playlist

3- if your favorite song isn't on Spotify but you still want to share it you can link it in the comment part
