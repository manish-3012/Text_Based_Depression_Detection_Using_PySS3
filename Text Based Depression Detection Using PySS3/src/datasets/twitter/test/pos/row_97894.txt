My Sister ladies and gentlemen... My sister texted me that we needed to talk(we live in different countries). I told her of course. So she adds me to a group with a friend of hers and my sister tells me that she was dating someone. A girl and it started over text. Immediately I put two and two together and figured out that it was her friend in the group.

Once I got confirmation I told my sister how proud I was of her and how I was happy for her. Her friend told me she wouldn't hurt my sister and i jokingly replied "You best not because I can't beat up a girl." 

After all that I got to thinking. My sister got a girl before I did. And then I got sad because of my sad life
