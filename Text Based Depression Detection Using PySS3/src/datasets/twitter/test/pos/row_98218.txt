My dad hates when I season food while cooking? He hates garlic, onion, creole, old bay, and pretty much seasoning you can think about. Ive been cooking for a while now and it pains me to not season food.. like I get just salt and pepper are enough for some things, but come on now. I fried some chicken the other day and seasoned the flour with a bunch of different things. He got upset that I seasoned the flour.. asshole ended up really liking the chicken. What are yâ€™allâ€™s favorite seasonings and things to cook/eat? I want to get my dad to try new foods to maybe open up and start liking some new things.
