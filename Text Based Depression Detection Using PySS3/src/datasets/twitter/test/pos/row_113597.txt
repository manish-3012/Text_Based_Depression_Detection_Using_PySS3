I kinda want to start streaming on twitch but scared to talk pretty much the title. I've been kind of dreaming about playing games to an audience but I have literally no idea what to say. Also my mom sleeps in the room next to mine and don't really want to bother her about it :l

Just getting that off my chest for some reason
