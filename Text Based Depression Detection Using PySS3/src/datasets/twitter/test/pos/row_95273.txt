TIFU by hitting the gas pedal. Iâ€™m learning to drive right now. Two days ago, my dad took me to a church parking lot to practice. I was doing fairly well; his main complaint was that I stopped too suddenly. Then it was time to go home. The road was too busy for me to drive on it, so we had to park and switch places. I decided to park in one of the parking spaces. And thatâ€™s where I messed up. 

First, I decided that too late and was having some difficulty maneuvering into the parking space. Then I figured I was close enough and hit the brake. Only it wasnâ€™t the brake; it was the gas pedal. The car immediately sped over the low curb in front of me and I heard something metal scrape the pavement behind me. My dad and I both panicked. I somehow managed to park in a different spot. I started laughing. My dad told me to take it seriously. I said I was taking it seriously. 

We got out to check the car. Thankfully, no obvious damage was done to the back and nobody was hit because nobody was in the parking lot. My dad drove us home. Now I know why he didnâ€™t like the idea of me driving. 

TL;DR Driving practice with Dad. While trying to park, I hit the gas and ran over a curb. Nobody was hurt.
