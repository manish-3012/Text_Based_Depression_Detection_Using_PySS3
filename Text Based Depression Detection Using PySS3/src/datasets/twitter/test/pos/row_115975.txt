I had a strange dream yesterday... So basically I was standing in a dark room and suddenly Dwayne Johnson appeared and I accidentally stabbed him with a lightsaber I didnâ€™t even know i had in my hand. Then suddenly everything was back to normal and I woke up. What did this mean exactly am I force sensitive?
