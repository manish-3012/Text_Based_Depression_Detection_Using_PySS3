I am on a trip rn and I am kinda scared I am on a mini vacation and I am kinda scared I will get the virus here. My family isnâ€™t really worried. I am the only one. The place I am rn has less cases than were I live but I am still really scared and I feel like I ainâ€™t enjoying the vacations. What should I do?
