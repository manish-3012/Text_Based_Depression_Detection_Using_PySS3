My dad is brain dead So I was watching spongebob in his room. He comes in and says â€œwhat the hell is this?â€ Cause apparently he doesnâ€™t know what a bowl of cereal is. He tells me to go watch this is my room. I CANT. I tell him this everytime, yet he still tells me to watch it in my room. When we moved in, they gave my younger sister a smart tv, and they didnâ€™t even give me a tv until a year after we moved in. When the did, IT WAS A FUCKING CRT AGAIN! I had a crt at the old house! So until he learns what I can and canâ€™t do on a tv thatâ€™s 20 years ago, Iâ€™m gonna watch spongebob in his room.
