Body image Iâ€™ve been having trouble lately with my body image. Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m not that fat sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m the fattest person in the world. And I feel like people see and treat me different because of my body. I hate seeing pictures of myself and Iâ€™ve tried loosing weight but I donâ€™t have the motivation to. On top of that Iâ€™ve always had a bad relationship with food, itâ€™s a big comfort for me but I feel so guilty after I eat anything remotely unhealthy. I just wish I could wake up skinny.
