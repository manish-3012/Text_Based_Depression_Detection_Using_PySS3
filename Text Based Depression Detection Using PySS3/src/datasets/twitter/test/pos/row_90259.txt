Can I get advice on a girl? So yeah, this girl and I are loose friends. Like hungout a few times, are friendly, have good inside jokes. But sheâ€™s not a close friend yet.

We got no classes/clubs together so I literally gotta ask to hangout pretty much every time to see her. Feels awkward asking repeatedly, u know? Sheâ€™s always grateful that I asked her, but still

Iâ€™m not afraid to make a move. Iâ€™ve done it before on a girl, worked wonders, though we didnâ€™t date. Iâ€™d love to make a move on this new girl, late night hang, put my arm around her, maybe go for the kiss. I have problem with courage 

I just donâ€™t know when to do it. The semesterâ€™s ending in a month (early). Doesnâ€™t have to be that soon. Iâ€™d like the relationship to start naturally. I just donâ€™t want her to get a boyfriend in the interim

Advice, and maybe what point u guys were at with ur gfs b4 u made a move?
