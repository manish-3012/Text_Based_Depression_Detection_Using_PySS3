THE MODS HERE SUCK I tried to host an "ask me anything on cyber security and ethical hacking" to get more teens started with ethical hacking and clearing some of the basic doubts on how to get started. Obviously it got removed by the mods and they asked me to mail them a formal request which I did then I was asked to wait for 14 days
It's been more than 20 days no reply from them
