Lads, I could've nearly died in the past hour So, I'm an Auzzie, and as you know, everything wants to kill you down here. I was sleeping, peacefully, nearly asleep when I felt a small pitter-patter on my back. I damn near slapped my ass trying to get it off. I get up, shit my pants a bit more and look for the suspect. The only thing I find is a small black, glossy leg. I look it up and a fucking AUSTRALIAN FUNNEL-WEB *FUCKING* SPIDER IS THE FIRST RESULT. I could well have died if it decided human would be a good lunch.
