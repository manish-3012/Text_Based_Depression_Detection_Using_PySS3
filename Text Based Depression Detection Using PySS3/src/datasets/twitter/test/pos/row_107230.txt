Do I need help? I constantly make jokes about my failure and think about all the ways I could kill myself. I constantly mark myself as a failure during conversations and tend to try and stay happy even if Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m starting to give up hope that this is normal and starting to think about suicide more often than usual. I just came here to ask. Do I need help? My friends keep saying I need therapy or that I might have depression but I donâ€™t believe them. So what do you guys think?
