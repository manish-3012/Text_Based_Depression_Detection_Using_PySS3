To everyone looking at this Hi there, recognise my name? Want to get to know me better? Well that seems unlikely since I'm unable to make friends, yes even online on Reddit I can't make friends.

No I'm not an interesting person, so you probably don't want to be friends with me. This is advice for you, I want friends but don't want to make you feel shit so please don't choose to like me. You'll start hating me and I honestly don't want to deal with losing friends again.

Just a quick warning for you please don't like me, because you'll end up hating me and then I'll feel shit over you hating me
