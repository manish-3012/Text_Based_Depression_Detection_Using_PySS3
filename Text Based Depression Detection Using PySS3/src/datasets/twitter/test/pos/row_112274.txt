What I have discovered may change the course of all of human knowledge. Every meat has a corresponding cheese to go with it.

Beef-cheddar

Chicken-parmesan

Ham- swiss

Just think of the endless possibilities with different meats and cheeses. With this knowledge, we can rebuild sandwiches to be stronger, faster, smarter. Our sandwiches will be superior and lead a golden age into a new era of prosperity.
