Whatâ€™s the most illegal/immoral thing yâ€™all have done? Mine is I was at this arcade with some friends and we each blew like $30 on the coin pusher and were 1 card away from getting an insane amount of pints from the arcade store. We ran out of money and decided to try trading some cards we had extras of to try and get that other one. We found a group of people who was cashing theirs in and they had the one we wanted. 3 seconds to late and the card was sucked up by the machine. So we did the only logical thing. Me and one of the guys went up to the ticket counter and bullshitted the guy with this story that the machine sucked up one of our cards and didnâ€™t count it. He fucking bought it and we took that card. We then cashed in our cards and with the points we each were able to get a nerd gun, and funky pop (I got a Bob Ross one) and some other random shot like a Bluetooth speaker.
