Just found out i got allergic to my favorite snac. 2021 is going great ðŸ˜ So a few months ago we got sunflower seeds and so i ate some and 30 mins later my chest got HEAVY and i could barely breath. I thought that was just a weird thing that happened so the next time that we got sunflower seeds i literally only ate 10 and my chest felt WORSE and i even almost cried cuz i couldnt breath
