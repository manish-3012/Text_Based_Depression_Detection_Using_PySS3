DOES ANYONE LIKE ALGEBRA? So I'm in 9th grade this year, most of my classes are advanced because for some reason I'm into that. Anyways, I'm currently in advanced algebra 2 but to be honest I'm not sure why I wanted to be in this class, I never actually did algebra 1 so I have low key basic knowledge of how theses things go down. I need help, a lot... but for some reason I don't have that desire to grind and learn how this crop works. If ANYONE has advice for me please let me know.
