I am not sure whether a guy is using me or not. help? Not sure whether this is the right place to turn to but I've been having problems with this one guy. I have met him only two times. The first time i met him was at a local skate park, he was teaching me a few things nothing special but i asked for his social media. Shortly afterwards we started texting and it was really fun. We would call eachother and talk endlessly. After a week or so we decided to meet up. The meet up didn't go all that well. I was kind of awkward because i could barely hear him (my ears were plugged with water) and I was with a broken foot. After the meet up he just texted me "well this was interesting". He kind of stopped texting me and so did I. Am not sure how but we once again started talking pretty lots and it was nice until he started leaving me on read and only texting me at night time when he was horny or needed attention. I didn't really please his hornyness but I would definitely text him back. recently though i sent a pic of myself in the mirror (nothing sexy or anything I was just smiling with a text saying "how you doing?:))" ) the picture wasn't ment for him but he immediately texted me saying "u hot" and asking if i was in a fucking bra (once again horny as shit) which i was wearing a simple black dress and I can maybe see how he could've confused it because it was v shaped. And he's all like oOh send me of how u look in that sexy dress. I sent him beetlejuice pointing at him because I could understand that the dudes intentions were most probably different than to just compliment my dress. 

anyway I guess the problem here is he is very fun and attractive and i like that a lot but he is most probably keeping me around for different reasons or am I being fucking crazy?
