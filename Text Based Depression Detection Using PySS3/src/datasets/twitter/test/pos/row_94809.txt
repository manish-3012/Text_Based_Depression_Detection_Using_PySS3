My great grandpa died. He was a good man, he had a lot of surgery and things wrong. But what pissed me off was that he was obliviously not going to make it my whole family was talking about him In the hospital then getting better then going back to normal life but if you pulled at him he looked like he didnâ€™t have time i am the only one who said well what does he want I was the only one to see that he needed to go back to the farm get comfortable and die with family at the place he had built but instead he died in a hospital by himself and the three daughters of his are always at each otherâ€™s Throats one of them asked what their inheritance was and completely disregarding that my great grandma is still alive with signs of dementia. He was a war veteran, father, grandfather, and a great grandfather.
I am in this young marines program and I think he didnâ€™t know how old I was or anything because in the hospital my last interaction with him was he told the nurse I was a marine then we saluted each other. There are a lot more details but thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m going to say.    Sorry for bad grammar/punctuation.
