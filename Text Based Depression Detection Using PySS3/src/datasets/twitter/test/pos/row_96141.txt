Guessing if my teachers who have Reddit or not My orchestra teacher- slightly odd but nice middle aged lady- most likely not

My Japanese teacher-nice but naggy older ish lady- no definitely not

My English teacher-middle aged lady, but boring and pretty nice-no definitely not

My biology teacher-im almost sure he does, he's a middle aged guy who's super into stocks (he mentioned Reddit at one point)

My math teacher-never in a million years- a older but super nice lady


My engineering teacher- he's nice but old , may have it bc he's into technology like 3d printers n stuff


My ceramics teacher- nice middleish aged guy but I doubt he has Reddit tho
