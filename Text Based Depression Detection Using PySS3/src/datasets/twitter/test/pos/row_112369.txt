I feel like Rocket League will be the next big game to sweep the internet Once Among Us dies out, not saying that it will happen anytime soon, people will look to play another game with their friends. And since Rocket League is a multiplayer game that now is free I think it will blow up. 

Not really looking for anyone's opinion but go ahead and go off in the comments.
