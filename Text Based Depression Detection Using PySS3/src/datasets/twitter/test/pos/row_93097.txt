im fucked I've already fucked up everything at 13, my grades are shit, my parents hate me, I have no friends and I'm on the verge of losing the only thing that is keeping me sane, drawing. I feel like a shitty person I've done shitty ass things and i cant find a reason to do anything productive anymore. I so lazy I cant do anything and I'm always just so tired and sad.  


so yeah, how was your week?
