YouTubers I have lost respect for in order. 1. ELECTRICDRAGON505. Now Matt Burnett goes by animat. but I'm not going to call him that idiotic name cuz I lost a lot of respect for him back in November now this does not involve politics. But back in November when Joe Biden won the presidential election he compared Donald Trump becoming president to the terrorist attack 9/11 I am not kidding he compared an idiotic president to an event that killed hundreds of thousands of people in New York City I take September 11th very seriously I'm the type of person to make jokes everyday but whatever September 11th the rolls around I don't make Jokes I stay serious because it's a sad day because. Of the deaths and the loss of two towers. Another reason why I lost respect for anime is because of his massive hate boner for Sony pictures animation open season and it's mini sequels caught with a Chance of meatballs 1 and 2 hotel Transylvania 1 2 and 3 of trust me he hates them all but it's funny cuz he didn't hate Spider-Man into the spider-verse and I know why it's not just because it's a great film it's because if he says he hates it he'll get a lot of backlash. 

2. Cosmodor. Now cosmodor is a German YouTuber that's part of the cartoon community well was part of the cartoon community. The reason why I said was is because he's a child groomer and frankly I don't like watching pedophiles on YouTube so cosmodor if you're seeing this on Reddit don't come back. 

These are the two YouTubers I have lost respect. I will edit this if I find where YouTubers or if I remember any.
