I don't like Mario 64 It isn't a great game. Why do people think it's such a fantastic game? It is the first one, so it's natural for it to have flaws, but if I say that I dislike Mario 64, I practically get decapitated by the mob of nostalgic idiots. In fact, many retro games are bad. Modern games improve on everything the older games have made. If you are telling me why I'm wrong for disliking Mario 64, &gt;!fuck you!&lt;.
