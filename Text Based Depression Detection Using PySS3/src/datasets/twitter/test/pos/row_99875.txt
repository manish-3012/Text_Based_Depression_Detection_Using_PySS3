I have high functioning autism. Am I allowed to hate myself for it? Or am I too 'gifted'? It doesn't effect my ability to function in society, I just can't accept the fact that I'm fundamentally different from most of humanity. I'll always have this weighing over my head. I'll never get to be a person, just an autistic person. When I do show symptoms (like listening to the same dozen songs on repeat) I feel this twinge of intense shame. I'm fully aware that I can fixate on certain kinds of information, and no - I'm not gonna use my 'special interests' to motivate me. I won't be treated like a fucking dolphin, letting myself watch one jojo episode for being a good boy.

I have to prove I can take agency over my life. Whenever I bring up anything to do with current events, my mum asks me if it's upsetting me.

Sure, most of you know that people like me can live productive lives, but you don't understand that. When you read that I have ASD, you made some assumption of what kind of person I am. I want to be angry at you for it.

I can't cope with being so different. I'm a coward. Letting tropes created by 'the general public' rule over me.

So, general public; am I allowed to be a person yet?
