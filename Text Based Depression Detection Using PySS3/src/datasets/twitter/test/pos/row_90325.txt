Why BLM never made any extravagant clothing or clothing line for the movement. I honestly support this but hereâ€™s why, and yeah there are clothing lines that make blm merch, but hereâ€™s why theyâ€™re shitty. BLM shouldnâ€™t be marketed. If you have a shirt with BLM on it, all it should do is represent your support, not your style, thatâ€™s why they look bland. No one wants an â€œinfluencerâ€ wearing a louis vuitton BLM shirt and the posing in front of the protests to take pictures then just leaving. Iâ€™m glad they never made much clothing because people like that suck, and it reminds you that itâ€™s not about you.
