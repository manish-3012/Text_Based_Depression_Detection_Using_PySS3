How to cope with being lonely and having little chance to change it anytime soon? Ok so i have no friends (other then online) and no girlfriend obviously. Most people irl dislike me and i suck at all things social so usually fuck up. I have zero chance of making friends in my school, too small of a school where i already have a bad reputation. I'm 17, third grade of high school. Corona has literally changed nothing in my social life since i never even had it before it. I feel like i have no chance of making friends in the foreseeable future and that's making me even sadder. Also, i can't get a girlfriend (i am undesirable but also a bit too picky aka i am only interested in rare women who are similar to me in some way, i just don't have any interest in most girls i have met in my life. Tbh its same for friends, i just have no interest in most people but still even people i have an interest for becoming friends reject me)

So anyway i am also an introvert and have social anxiety and i guess depression as well. I feel sad that other people in my situation at least have friends to hang out with, i have one cousin who i am not very close to and rarely see and i have a few online friends but its not enough for me. I desire to have friends irl like the ones i have online, but 90% of people i have met irl i just dont click with. 

And meeting a girl i like and her becoming my girlfriend seems impossible in the foreseeable future. Like sure ii can't see how ill be like in 5 years but rn i see no exit. And it hurts to be alone like this ffs. Why would any girl even fucking like me back, never happened before and probably won't in a long time (can't pretend like this worthlessness will last forever. Eventually like most people ill find someone, but you know i don't like the idea of waiting until 30 to feel loved.) 

Anyway i can't have any clubs or anything like that in my school since they don't exist. I don't want to volunteer for anything since i have no interest or willpower to and i can't see myself becoming super social and stuff. I just don't find shit like parties even remotely appealing.  

So i guess with all this i realised i can't have either friends or a girlfriend for a long time. Winds of winter will be released before i get laid ffs. So um, any advice on how to just accept it and live with it? Of i can't change something then i have to just accept it. I am alone and feel unloved (ofc not just in one way. You know, i feel unloved in a lot of ways) and i feel like its clear i won't be getting either friends or a girlfriend for a long long time. And since i suck and am very undesirable as a potential friend or lover but also very picky myself i know i have pretty low chances. I know i can't do the hard things, i can't just start being ongoing or just try to pursue a relationship with a random girl i feel no interest in or random people i feel no interest in friendship with. 

So, how do i cope with this? I in no way blame anyone for not liking me, i understand why lol, not everyone is compatible especially not with fuck ups like me. But still i feel lonely and would like some advice on how not to feel this way anymore. 

Also i feel like most of you are doing a lot better ffs. Most people seem to be doing a lot better then me. I feel like im the only one, i know im not obviously but it feels like it. Like half the posts here are "wow my crush said yes" or some shit like that, look im happy for ypu but you also make me want to cry with your fucking luck mate. 

Also its not ugliness that's the problem with me. Its my lack of social skills, my shyness and my pickyness and my shitty personality and lack of skills in life that maje me an undesirable shit. I go to the gym and ik that in like a year ill actually look better but it won't solve the problem. Its charisma that attracts people the most, not just appearance. You can be the ugliest man alive and still find love, but if you are anything like me then you will need a lot of luck.  


So yeah this fucking rant is over now. Comment if you want, doesn't fucking matter.
