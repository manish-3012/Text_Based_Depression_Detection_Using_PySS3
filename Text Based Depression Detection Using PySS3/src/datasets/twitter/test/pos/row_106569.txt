Well it's progress... There's a girl I've been interested in for a very long time and we've been talking almost every night lately. There was a few days where I didn't talk to her cause of drama I won't get into but that's over with now. I've chilled out a lot after that, I'm not really worrying too much what she thinks of me. 

Well, we've been "snapping" on well, Snapchat. Anyway, usually she only sends one pic as a response to what I say, then I send a pic back. Tonight though, she was sending two pics, which is basically like double texting. It doesn't mean she's interested, but it's progress at the very least.
