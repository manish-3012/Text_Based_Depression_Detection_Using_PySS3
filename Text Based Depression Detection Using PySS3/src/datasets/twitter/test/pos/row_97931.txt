Anxiety about school I have always hated school. Ever since I was in pre-k I got anxious and extremely shy around everyone. I never had friends until like 5th grade and then I moved. I do have friends, but they're more like school friends. I have like 2 friends i talk to once every month, other than that i literally have no one that i can talk about my personal problems. I've heard multiple times that we may be going back to school in a few months. I am extremely scared to go back to school, sit alone, stay quiet all day, talk to my friends for 30 mins (if i have lunch with them) and just feel miserable and ugly. To be honest i have thrived during quarantine ( even though i realize its an awful thing), i love being alone. Is anyone else feeling like this?
