Any advices for online school? So next week our school is going online because of all the covid cases. I had online school before but it wasnt on zoom, the teachers just left assignments and we finished them and send them back (except one class that was on zoom a few times) This time its going to be mostly on zoom. Do you my fellow redditors with more experience have any advices for me? It would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
