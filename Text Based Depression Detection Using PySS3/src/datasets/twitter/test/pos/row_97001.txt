Day 3 of Vibing with r/teenagers I once again have nothing planned for today, so if you have an idea for something i could do, let me know in the comments. I would also like to thank anyone who responded on the last one i did. I was surprised to find so many people were paying attention to this subreddit, and it filled me with joy reading all of the comments. Thanks for being cool people :)
