Update on my last post. My last post was me asking for advice on my friend getting married. Turns out her parents ARE the people who she is marrying. She is engaged to her adoptive father and has cut all ties with us. She threatened to kill herself if we contacted her again. I haven't really talked to her for 2 years so I wasn't too upset but my best friend/crush was ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED. I have been trying to calm her down since the whole thing happened.
