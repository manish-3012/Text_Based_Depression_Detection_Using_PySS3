A calm explanation of why i was so angry in my last post So if you didnâ€™t see my last post, go look at it to understand this one.

So basically, it really annoyed me when he got offended because for hundreds of years, LGBTQIA+ have been told that they have a mental disorder just because of who they like. So when this straight male gets offended because someone jokingly said that heterosexuality is a mental disorder i got pissed off because people like him have told us for hundreds of years that weâ€™re a mental disorder and it wasnâ€™t a joke.

And if you say â€œoh, well, not all straight men are homophobicâ€, then yes, that is correct, but still. If you truly support the LGBTQIA+ community then you shouldnâ€™t be offended by a joke about your sexuality because your people have been insulting our sexuality for hundreds of years.

But a lot of you guys probably wont understand since a big portion of you are straight and wouldnâ€™t understand how stuff like this could affect LGBT+ people.
