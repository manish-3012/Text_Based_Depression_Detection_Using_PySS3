it's my birthday!! &lt;3 Hi guys!!!! It's my birthday and I turned sixteen!! One of my friends gave me candy and an aloe plant. Another gave me a monster (pacific punch obviously). Another gave me an Ikea cookie (10/10 recommend). When I got home my mom ordered pizza and we ate cake. I got $10 from my grandma and grandpa out of state and $50 from a family friend. After dinner, my parents gave me AirPods (up until then I was the only child without them lol). Anyway, I think I had a good day. I'm ready to talk to my boyfriend for the rest of the night and ignore all of my homework.
