I just broke up and a dude wont shit up I broke up a couple days ago, because of personal stuff and both me and my ex are ok and chill. But there is one dude that likes her and is clearly pissed at me because I got her. It has been 3 days since he has been saying I am a terirble person because my ex is now sad and all that stuff.

Dont be him, try to understand both sides pls.

And sorry english is not my 1st language
