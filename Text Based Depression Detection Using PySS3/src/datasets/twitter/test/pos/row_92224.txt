I am trying to have my state governor if not shut down schools again at least have stricter measures to prevent the spread of covid-19. Ok so hear me out as a Floridian being in school right now I am worried for my teachers who are old and many of the students at schools in my state so if you could sign and try and get this petition big enough I would greatly appreciate it [( Petition )](http://chng.it/JP8F4DgzLD)
