Feeling guilt over someone who was suicidal on Omegle I canâ€™t shake this feeling of fear and guilt if this person is ok or not 

So last night I went on Omegle because I was bored and just wanted to talk to people for fun and I thought Iâ€™d maybe help people who werenâ€™t feeling good cuz and just listen to them and try to be there for them I knew a lot of sad people went on Omegle to vent and I was talking to this one girl and she was suicidal because she had gone 3 months without cutting herself and she relapsed and I was just there just telling her how far she had come and just being someone for her to vent to but nothing I said was getting through to her and she kept saying she didnâ€™t deserve a happy life and all this and I told her how God healed me from so much emotional pain but eventually she left the chat. And I feel so bad because I donâ€™t know if she is okay or not  and I also feel guilt like it was my fault I couldnâ€™t make her feel better. I know I brought this on Myself for trying to like fix people or whatever but I promise my intentions were good I just wanted to make people who were lonely feel a bit better or just have someone to vent to. Idk I prayed for her last night and today that god gives her peace and she comes to him but I guess itâ€™s the unknowing thatâ€™s frustrating me and also feeling bad for not being able to help. Is this something I just need to let go and leave it in Gods hands because I donâ€™t even know whoâ€™s she is so thereâ€™s no way Iâ€™d be able to know what happened to her and if sheâ€™s okay. I just feel guilt about it

(Btw I didnâ€™t like just force beliefs down her throat or anything she said she believed in God, wasnâ€™t exactly a Christian, but believe in like God. So I just told her how God helped me in dark times.). 

I just feel this guilt About it because I couldnâ€™t help her idk why I feel like this I didnâ€™t mean any harm I was just chatting with ppl on Omegle but I still feel guilt
