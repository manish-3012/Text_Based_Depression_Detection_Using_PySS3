Netflix movie recommendations for date night? Gf and I always take hours to decide what new movie we wanna see. We arent exactly teenagers anymore but its very close lmao and you guys are usually the most active so I figured I'd get a lot of good movies here.

We love mystery movies and thrillers. Maybe a good drama or comedy. Thanks in advance everyone.
