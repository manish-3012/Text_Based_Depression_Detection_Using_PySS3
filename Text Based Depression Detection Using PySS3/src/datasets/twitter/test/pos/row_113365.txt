Making people uncomfortable as a joke, isnâ€™t funny TLDR: if u you act like a shit, be prepared to be hit

I went to the mall today with my family and while I was alone getting lunch, a group of 5 15-16 year old boys walked past me. The one in front said â€œI see youâ€™re in the food court, because youâ€™re looking like a whole snack.â€ And while it was a complete joke, and it was kinda funny, it did not seem the same for my 16yr old sister. Not being weirdly incest, but she does not look bad at all has been to prom about 5 times. She was alone ordering food when each one of them walked up to her and asked for her Snapchat. She nicely rejected the first one, but became more annoyed after each one of them would follow after one got turned down. They then followed us after we caught up with the rest of our family and waved to me and her different times. My parents didnâ€™t notice and we both agreed to not tell them either. Basically donâ€™t be a dipshit and make people uncomfortable in public because it is â€œfunnyâ€.
