Got a Complement ðŸ˜ Background: I've been growing my hair out since quarintine. People at school have told me that they didnt reconigize me the first time they saw me. So my hair is parted in the middle going down to the sides and flows down. 

The girl that sits infront of me complemented my hair today. And that made me happy :)
