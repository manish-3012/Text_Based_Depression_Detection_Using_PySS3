Iâ€™m tired of being walked all over. No this isnâ€™t a suicide note or death wish or anything like that, I just need to vent. 

Aight. Ever since I was like 7, I was picked on. For whatever reason, being fat, tall, ugly etc. I really didnâ€™t care much, but itâ€™s worn on me over time. I guess the best way to describe me is a book. When  I was brand new, I had a good cover. But over time after being in situations like backpacks, bathrooms, and stuff like that, my cover is torn, broken, and fading. 

Iâ€™ve always been a really good student and someone that is easy to get along with, but people take advantage of that. This summer I joined a new baseball team after my old one broke up. Iâ€™ve always disagreed with them, but they took me in. I didnâ€™t play much because of me being new, but I didnâ€™t really mind. That is until they started an Instagram page with stuff about me being shit at everything. I found the page (because they put it on public like the idiots that they are and my crush found it) and promptly reported the page. It got banned and they started picking on me for being a bitch. 

The shit theyâ€™ve done to me is getting ridiculous. Theyâ€™ve ambushed me after class, challenged me to fights, and wonâ€™t shut up about the season. I donâ€™t think they know how fucked up the shit that theyâ€™re doing is, but if they do, theyâ€™re fucked up in the head. Iâ€™m worried now because they know where I live, and Iâ€™ve gotten many death threats from them and other people. Iâ€™m about to start carrying a pocket knife on me just in case. 

But hereâ€™s the thing. School isnâ€™t the only place. Home is supposed to be a place of peace, but itâ€™s definitely not at my place. My brother gets away with everything, and I canâ€™t lay a finger on him or say a single bad thing about him without me either getting yelled at or grounded. The amount of mental trauma that happens to me at my house is ludicrous. My parents think Iâ€™m useless and even though I get straight Aâ€™s, if I get one B Iâ€™m grounded for a week. My brother is over there getting fucking Câ€™a and Dâ€™s, and youâ€™re praising him for being a lazy ass piece of shit. Theyâ€™ve forgot that I have feelings too. God how much Iâ€™d pay to move in with my best friend or sister. Oh and they donâ€™t even recognize that I need help. They say they â€˜canâ€™t afford for therapyâ€™ but they would GLADLY go out and buy my brother a new golf club. 

Iâ€™ve attempted suicide 3 times, and though Iâ€™m not actively suicidal right now, Iâ€™m still thinking if Iâ€™d be better off dead. Itâ€™s so bullshit how hard I have to work to not kill myself or have someone else kill me. I have a small group of friends who I love a lot, but theyâ€™re pretty much all I have. My crush is super supportive and caring, and I wouldnâ€™t be alive without her. My best friend is always there for me, and heâ€™s brought me out of suicide multiple times, and again, I wouldnâ€™t be alive if it werenâ€™t for him. 


TL;DR: Universe is bullshit to me, looking for someone to adopt me. 

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. 
(Also if you read this whole thing, thank you so much for caring because I really need the support)
