How does duolingo not have Armenian, or Hmong yet Those would be very useful where I live, 8% of the people where I live speak Armenian, and around 5% speak hmong. Not that I would learn either of them, I just want it to be an option, I would learn Spanish and German way before I would learn one of those but I just want to know itâ€™s there

I know a lot of people probably actually want to learn Armenian and Hmong, idk, Armenian Americans at least in Fresno very much want to preserve their language and culture, so you would think this would already be a thing
