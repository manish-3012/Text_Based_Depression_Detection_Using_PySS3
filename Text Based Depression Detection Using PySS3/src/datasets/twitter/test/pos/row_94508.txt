Addressing pedophilia and breaking it down Source: https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/mental-health-disorders/sexuality-and-sexual-disorders/pedophilia
Definition (from the source): Pedophilic disorder is characterized by recurring, intense sexually arousing fantasies, urges, or behavior involving children (usually 13 years old or younger).                                     
Some of the points made in the article: Doctors diagnose pedophilia when people feel greatly distressed or become less able to function well because of their attraction to children or when they have acted on their urges.

Treatment involves long-term psychotherapy and drugs that alter the sex drive and reduceÂ testosteroneÂ levels.                                                  

What we can understand from here is basically your hormones get over the normal amount which creates an uncontrollable sex drive to have intimacy with children, a really uncontrollable sex drive that pedophiles become "less able to function well" because of it. And from the second point here, reducing testosterone levels ( definition: Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and anabolic steroid. In male humans, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as testes and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair.) And testosterone is found in men with way bigger amounts than in women which explains why there are more male pedophiles. Neo to help you understand it more, let's talk about paedophilia's sister, gerontophilia. Definition: GerontophiliaÂ is an â€œerotic age orientationâ€ in which one is most strongly aroused by the elderly, and so it is at the opposite end of the spectrum from pedophilia. Basically younger people, commonly women, being attracted to elders, commonly men. And by elders I dont mean people in their 50s, I mean people in their late 70s. As we can see they're both complete opposites: one is more common in men, the other is more common in women, one is an attraction to young people, the other is an attraction to old people . And they're both disorders caused by hormone imbalance and in some occasions traumatic life events. If you stuck until the end thank you and have a nice day
