This one goes out to the fellas So I have severe body dysmorphia and when I was 15 I was about 226lbs at 5â€™10 and I went full anorexic and began not eating for days at a time and working out up to 3 times a day. After 4 months I was 167 at 6â€™1. You would think I would be overjoyed with my insane progress plus growing 3 inches in 4 months while eating almost nothing makes no sense. Instead I hated everything. I had some extra skin and I would cut it with a razor blade and say it was a carving accident. I was ingesting triple the testosterone booster they give to transgender men. I was just in constant mental and physical pain. 

For the last year Iâ€™ve just been taking testosterone booster and doing home workouts because of COVID. The isolation didnâ€™t help the problem. My entire mindset was â€œby the time I go back to in person school Iâ€™ll be a Greek godâ€. 

2 days ago I realized Iâ€™m not a Greek god, and I almost logged out for good. Iâ€™m really glad I didnâ€™t. 

Guys just try and live healthy. Diet and exercise, donâ€™t starve yourself and workout until you collapse. 

Donâ€™t think no one will accept you or love just because you are on either side of the spectrum. 

Also, if youâ€™re worried you canâ€™t get bitches just because of your weight, nah man unfortunately in my experience itâ€™s all about height. So itâ€™s literally RNG.
