Japan is a USA owned country that serves American interests Hear me out first before you call me crazy. Japanâ€™s constitution was written by USA. USA has a military base in Japan. The CIA worked with Johnny kitagawa (a sellout) to feminize the male population and keep them under control. Seriously, look up Johnny kitagawa and see how influential he was in promoting boy bands, etc.
