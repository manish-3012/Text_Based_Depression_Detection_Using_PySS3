any of you have advice for moving on from a relationship? she was perfect, and nobody could ever replace her. Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that I donâ€™t deserve her and that sheâ€™ll find someone who actually deserves her. 

Itâ€™s really fucking depressing considering she was literally my best friend and the one person willing to hold a conversation with me 24/7. now I have no friends and nobody to talk to but myself but yeah. 

I need to move on
