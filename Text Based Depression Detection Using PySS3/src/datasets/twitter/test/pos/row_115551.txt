Couldn't get an erection with my girlfriend. Me [16M] and her [F16] agreed to have sex with a condom, I bought ones and I was ready. When she came over, we did the usual stuff and then we got turned on.

The thing is, even if I was really turned on, I couldn't get an erection.

I am so fucking sad, and pissed at myself. I am not sad because I couldn't have sex with her, I'm mostly sad because she was in the mood and very turned on as well, but I couldn't get a boner to satisfy her.

I am 100% straight, we have an absolutely great relationship, and I have perfect health.

I don't know what to do, I don't know why didn't I get one, and I am so depressed about it.
