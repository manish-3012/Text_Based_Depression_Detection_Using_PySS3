Looked at my dads phone, very big mistake I was trying to study for a school assignment, and the doorbell went off. My dad went to answer and it was our neighbour who loves to chat about everything under the sun. His phone started to ring and he has it set so it never goes to voicemail, so it just kept ringing  and ringing. I decided to go shut it off because it was fucking annoying after like 3 minutes. It ended up being a bot call from some telemarketing company so I shut it off. It went back to the lock screen and it showed he was watching a video called Baby sitter caught on camera playing with... Now i would like to say that I walked away and never thought about it again, but I was intrigued as my dad is not the sort of person you would think would do that kind of thing. I opens the phone and not only was there a porn video, but there was like 20 tabs in incognito mode of this random sketchy looking porn site. Apparently my dad doesnâ€™t know that you have to manually clear incognito tabs, they donâ€™t just go away when you shut safari. I am now horrified, and I canâ€™t get the image of my dad watching porn out of my head. Please help me
