Fly ritual So Iâ€™m here in online class and I see a swarm of flies surrounding a dead fly and going in a circle around that dead fly. I realized that they were eating it, yes eating the dead fly. I soon broke it up cause it was distracting me. After I broke it up they swarmed around my head just like what they were doing to the dead fly and I soon realized that the flies that were swarming me because I broke up their â€œsacrificial ritualâ€ and that they were going to use me as a substitute. So I used a fly swatter to kill them and went back to my classes.
