If you havenâ€™t sat in a car for 12 hours ur not an American me and my dad have Drivin to Portland and back on multiple occasions, thatâ€™s an 11 and a half hour drive, we drove back on a different day, we didnâ€™t drive for 23 hours in one day, we go to Sacramento 2-3 times per thatâ€™s a 3.5 hour drive year when there isnâ€™t a pandemic, we drove to Anaheim to see the we are two different people tour that was about a 4-5 hour drive, we regularly drive 45 minutes to go shopping in a different town 

If your an American this probably sounds normal but apparently in Europe they donâ€™t think they can drive for 2 hours or something, like London to Manchester is a bit over 4 hours and apparently no one does, 4 hours is nothing, in the us driving from LA to Seattle a 17 hour drive or even probably LA to Vancouver a nearly 19 hour drive is relatively normal, some people drive from cost to cost although at that point ur doing it because you want to cuz itâ€™s going to cost significantly more than just flying
