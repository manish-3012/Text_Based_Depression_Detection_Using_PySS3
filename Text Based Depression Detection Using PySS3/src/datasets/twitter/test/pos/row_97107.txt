Got teargased yesterday. LGBTQI rights are a thing. We were doing a peaceful protest against a catholic extremist group. Some of us were teargased, some were hurt with batons, and I almost got shot by a rubber ball. The french riot police protected the homophobic rally. This should not have happened. The street belong to us. Love is Love.
