Iâ€™ve had a pretty interesting week On Saturday I thought I poisoned myself (if you want the long story, comment), I have a cousin on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and if you havenâ€™t heard, they won the Super Bowl, and earlier today at school, I tripped and fell down a flight of stairs. Really hoping I heal from the fall before vacation really starts.
