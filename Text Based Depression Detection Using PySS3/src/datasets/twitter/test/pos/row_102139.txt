Don't rush into a relationship. Last year after about 4 months of texting I asked out this girl in my school we dated for 9 amazing months amd then she dumped me. One month after we got talking and she said she missed me so we started taking is slow texting, hugging and the occasional kiss. I caught feelings for her again. Now she has told me that she is not interested in a relationship. This girl has broke my danm heart twice win a month. This shit sucks.
