hOw NOt tO bE a pUSh OVeR iN a rELaTiOnSHip My brother (18m) was told by a girl that he has a thing with that he shouldn't be a pushover. However, all the situations she gave where he was a "pushover" were just him being courteous. He likes this girl and needs advice on how to not be a pushover while also showing her respect and kindness.
