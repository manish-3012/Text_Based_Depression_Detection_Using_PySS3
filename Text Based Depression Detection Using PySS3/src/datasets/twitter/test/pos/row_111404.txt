this needs to stop I just played a few rounds of among us and I got imposter some of the time and when I kill someone, someone finds the body and instantly say its me. HOW YOU ASK THEY KNKW THIS, well because the person I killed told him, HE SAID IT HIMSELF, "I know it's you because you killed my IRL friend and ge told me" LIKE WHAT THE HELL THE POINT OF THE GAME IS TO KEEP THE MURDER A SECRET NOT TWLL PEOPLE WHEN YOU DIE
