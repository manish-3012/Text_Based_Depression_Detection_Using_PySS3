If you love someone romantically and they spend time with you that they could be spending elsewhere, whatâ€™s stopping you from asking them out?! Seriously people always talk about how they are in love with someone but theyâ€™re too scared of rejection- I say this from experience, if you wait too long the only thing thatâ€™ll come from it is pain. Iâ€™m painfully aware of all of the people that say things like: â€œI donâ€™t have the confidenceâ€ or, â€œI donâ€™t want to lose her as a friend.â€ The truth is that if you ever want to gain confidence, you must push past your limits and go further. 
     
Also, ask yourself this: will you be happy being just friends with someone you are madly in love with? If so, move on, if no, tell her!

Thatâ€™s most of what I wanted to say but if anyone wants to talk about this privately shoot me a DM, or whatever you feel like doing.

Edit: Iâ€™m only saying this because I feel like this is a common problem I have overcome and hope I can help many others overcome, as well as the fact that Iâ€™m going to move on this step fairly soon with a girl I'm into, wish me luck and good luck to you all!
