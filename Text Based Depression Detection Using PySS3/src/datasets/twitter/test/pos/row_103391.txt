Let's fucken goo So I had been having my hair grow for the past 6 months, and I didnt want to cut it cause when it started growing it started becoming wavy and like curly, and I really liked that. So I got a hair cut finally after I felt like it was too long, and I was sad cause i thought it was gonna go back to it's old straight hair, but nah, it's still curly and its awesome. Not gonna let grow anymore now, it was down to my chin before I cut it, but now its l just goes to my eyes and I can keep the same fade I always had
