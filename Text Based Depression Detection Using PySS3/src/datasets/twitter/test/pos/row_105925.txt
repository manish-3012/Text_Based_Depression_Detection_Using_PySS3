I need some (female if possible but doesn't really matter) advice So i am in a ldr with this girl for about 10 or 11 days now, we don't really talk much during the day and sometimes not even during the night but the times we do talk to each other i really enjoy the time. I want to tell her that i think i love her. I plan on telling her on call, do you think it's too early for that? Should i wait until we meet in person? Should i wait for some more weeks and tell her on call then? Could it destroy the relationship if i said it so early already? I know that she likes me but i don't know if she loves me. If you were in her position would you apprechiate it or would it scare you off to hear that i think i'm in love?
