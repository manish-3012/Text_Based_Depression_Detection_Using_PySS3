OH MY GOD IN ABOUT TO DIE JESUS CHRIST AT THE END OF THE DAY GOING DOWN WHAT MY SCHOOL CALLS THE â€˜Main Streetâ€™ MY CRUSH AND HER FRIENDS WALKED PAST ME AND MY BEST FRIEND, THEN HER FRIENDS STARTED SAYING â€˜OOOOOHHHH (her name)â€™ AND SHE SAID â€˜If you donâ€™t shut up Iâ€™ll punch youâ€™. THEN SHE WALKED PAST AS FAST AS SHE COULD PAST ME AND MY BEST FRIEND. I AM SERIOUSLY FREAKING OUT RN.

On the side note my best friend also fancies her, so itâ€™s hard to figure who it was, but I have a trick up my sleeve
