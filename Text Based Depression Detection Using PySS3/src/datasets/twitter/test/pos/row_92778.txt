I love my dad I really love my dad. He's the best. I couldn't live without him. But sometimes I'm really rude to him, and I always regret it afterwards. I play guitar with him, go to long walks everyday, fix his car, play pc games together and many more. Some people might say that I am too clingy on my dad, but I try to live these years to the fullest, and try to spend as much time as I can with him. I love you so much dad.
