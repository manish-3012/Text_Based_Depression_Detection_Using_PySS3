Love letter. :) I have experienced a lot of abuse in the past. It's hard for me to feel safe around men. I met you 2 years ago and I took a long time to trust you. I was scared because I felt vulnerable. I tried to make you believe that I was going to come out on my own, but you never believed my lies.


You calmed me down during my anxiety attacks, you gently healed the mental scars that others left me, I was intimate with you without wanting to cry, I started to share my personal thoughts without wanting to run away. You're a lovely and charming boy. You're very funny, kind and arguably the smartest person I have ever known.
Â 

When this world is no more, the moon is all we'll see, you make me feel fireworks in my belly and supernova in my heart. Until the stars all fall down, they will fall on us, but I don't mind, if you're with me then everything's alright...


If one day you see this post I just want to tell you :


I love you beyond all rationality.

You can reassure yourself by saying that I am writing to you at 3 am, and drunk. But even in the vapors of alcohol it's your face that takes shape, this face so perfect, and which is however the only one that matters to me.

Everything I have and everything I am, is yours...
