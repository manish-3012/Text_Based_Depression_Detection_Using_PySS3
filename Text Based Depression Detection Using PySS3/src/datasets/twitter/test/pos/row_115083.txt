If the girl I like has a boyfriend can I still send her gifts? Should I tell her first before I send anything? My relationship with this person was very complex. We got into a lot of arguments in the past and for 5 years I never really spoke much to her. 

Recently I caught up with her once more and we talk a lot on a casual basis and I wanted to send her a gift (flowers or a fruit basket) as part of an apology. Sheâ€™s also going through a lot at the moment so I figured Iâ€™d brighten her day. 

Can I still send gifts or is that a big NO. Considering she has someone already.
