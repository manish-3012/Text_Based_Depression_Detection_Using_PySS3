I know this is a long shot... But Jade if you read this... 

Sorry I was so weird talking with you in the airport. You see, the thing is, I really think youâ€™re cute and bright and intelligent. I was really really nervous and I said some stupid shit. Believe me Iâ€™m normally not that awkward. Okay that was a lie, I am that awkward. But Iâ€™m actually a pretty chill guy. I would like to get to know you more because I really think we would work. If you see this and youâ€™re interested in me... hmu :)
