How do I fix the occasional buzzing sound on my Headphones (onikuma k19) Everynow and then whether I'm attending my online class, gaming, listening to music or watching anime there will be an annoying buzzing sound that occurs randomly. I always thought that it might be just the show or the meeting that I am attending but when I just plugin my headphones and do nothing the same buzzing sound occurs. help pls :(((
