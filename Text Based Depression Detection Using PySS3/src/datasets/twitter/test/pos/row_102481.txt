Grandma passed away Ive had a lot of family pass away this year and one of them included the woman who basically raised me who was my mimi. It was around 5 months ago It left me deeply saddened and I would try my hardest to keep it together and not cry as she was passing as I knew if my family saw me cry theyd break down as well. Because of this I only cried a few times and right when she passed even though I was devastated. Since then 3 more close family members have passed including my other grandma earlier today and I have not cried once over any of their passing even though I was upset. Is this normal, or is there something wrong with me?
