Okay so I need some advice like RIGHT NOW Iâ€™ve been talking to this girl since June(I technically met her in June of last year through a gc that she left instantly but we only had small conversation until this June when we started getting to know each other) she messaged me saying she had a dream about me. and the weird thing was I had the same dream about her (it was literary just like the dream she explained so thereâ€™s no way she faked it) so I told her I had the same dream and thatâ€™s how we started talking. We talked maybe a few days a week but talked to each other more and more each day to the point where there wasnâ€™t a day we didnâ€™t talk to each other. So to this present point we both have said we really like each other (we havenâ€™t gotten further then saying we both have a crush On each other) and send those wholesome relationship memes to each other and we say good morning and good night every day. But I want to make the move and ask her if sheâ€™d wanna be my girlfriend but Iâ€™m just to scared to. Sheâ€™s the only girl Iâ€™ve talkin to and she would be my first girlfriend (Iâ€™m 15 sheâ€™s 14, she turns 15 mid next month) so I have no idea how to talk to girls and any help would be helpful
