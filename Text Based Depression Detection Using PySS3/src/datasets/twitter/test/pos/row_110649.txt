Recent Updates on how im holding out... The past two months I've been going to the gym for calming myself down. I've learned the more I lift, thr more I become Suttle and humble. Recently, I've broke a personal record for a max bench... I can now do over 300 Lbs in a bench press. I've also gotten a girlfriend, and I have known her since 6th grade. Kailey and I have been very close to one another, even before one of my first Ex's decided to date me.

This is our 2nd week together, and I am not going to lose her due to this virus, stay safe out there you guys... this world will change, give it the time and resources, and it will.
