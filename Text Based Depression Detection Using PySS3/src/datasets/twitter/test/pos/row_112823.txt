I accidentally flipped off my mom I was riding my bike in my neighborhood yesterday and I was almost home. So as Iâ€™m turning a corner near my apartment, this car behind me honks at me. A lot of people in my area canâ€™t drive for shit, and more than a few people honk at me aggressively(SHARE THE ROAD ASSHOLES) and have tried to hit me with their cars in the bike lane. Anyways I glanced behind me and just thought the driver was just another one of those freaks. I held up my hand and kept pedaling. The car followed me into the alley that leads to my apt. Then the driver honked a bunch of times. I got pretty mad so I turned my head and put up my middle finger at them. Then the car sped up and passed me. They rolled down the window and...surprise surprise! It was my momðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³
