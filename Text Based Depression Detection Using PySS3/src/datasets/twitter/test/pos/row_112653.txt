yeah, sex and all is cool, but 
have you ever just put on some headphones, put some music on,  iâ€™m talking like the clash, van halen, danny brown, iron maiden; or something softer like apollo brown, gorillaz, 
glass animals or colter wall, and just laid some on your bed, listened to the music and cleared your mind. just let it consume you until you have nothing to worry about.

one of the best things you can do to calm down if your angry, stressed or anxious.
