Guys, I need some advice. To the people who are about to go to Uni, or have already finished their applications, or are already in Uni, I need some advice. 

I'm a grade 9 student in Canada, and I want to go to America for Uni. I aim for good schools, and I set myself a high standard, but I don't really know if I can make it. It's really scary for me right now, because some people tell me that if I don't do well in grade 9, I've pretty much fucked my chances because Unis look at your marks in grade 9. Furthermore, I don't really know what else I can do to boost my chances, and I'm scared that I'll be disappointed in Grade 12 when I get my acceptance letters because I didn't get into the school that I wanted to get into. If you guys could give me some advice as to what to do, and how to act, it would be greatly appreciated.
