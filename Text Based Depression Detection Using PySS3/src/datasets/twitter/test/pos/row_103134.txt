Unpopular Opinion: We Should Boycott YouTube (There's a TL:DR at the bottom by the way...)

YouTube is a trash site. Not only are there way too many ads, the YouTube algorithm is so incredibly screwed up. YouTube demonetizes content creators that have done nothing wrong, but let creators who do bad things off the hook! There were so many videos showing people abusing animals and such and YouTube didn't take them down until there was moral outrage among the community. Next, YouTube doesn't care. Everyone who makes content or watches content on YouTube always wants to see changes, but it's like YouTube can't hear any of it. Gus Johnson made a funny skit about that, in which everyone's telling YouTube to not go forward with a bad idea, but they do so anyways. YouTube not caring also ties in with how they demonetize creators who've done nothing bad. Also, a huge problem that my friends and I talk about is that there is now a YouTube Kids app. Now the actual app is actually an amazing thing, as it ensures the safety of kids when they watch videos. The problem arises when YouTube STILL demonetizes anyone who swears. They made the YouTube Kids app for a reason; it's designed to give kids all of the content they watch. There is no reason why content creators on regular YouTube should still be demonetized for swearing when there are no kids to watch it. Now, of course, anything you put online is bound to be seen by anyone; people of all ages. But it's still insane how YouTube takes those measures. If a content creator's video is demonetized, that can mean some serious hardships coming for them, since if they don't make money off of their videos, which is their number 1 source of income, that could be pretty detrimental. The algorithm completely screws all smaller content creators over as well. It doesn't recommend their videos to anyone, which means no one watches them, etc.

That's why I'm thinking that we should all boycott YouTube for a few days. I'm not really sure how though. Maybe all of the viewers would stop watching videos and content creators would stop making content for those few days? Or if this doesn't happen, maybe just spread the word around about the problems of YouTube and hope that there comes a serious change sometime?

TL:DR

YouTube is a trash site. The algorithm screws people over, it seems like YouTube simply doesn't care about anyone who uses the website, and people get demonetized far too often for stupid reasons. We should boycott and/or spread the word about the problems of YouTube.
