just feeling upset ok so im just gonna like rant here cause im pretty sure no one will see this and i wanna let everything out.
so there were these posts is hot over her that were like advice about boys and they just reminded me about how close i was w my ex-bff.

i found myself just scrolling through old messages when he would really make it seem like he truly cared.

what happened was he got two girlfriends back to back (they both were best friends as well) and just started ignoring me. i told him that this upset me and he snapped at me saying that i always try to control him, i honestly dont think ive ever done anything controlling.

so because he snapped at me and was also always unwilling to listen to me i just stopped texting first and stuff. soon we just stopped talking.

apparently he misses me? according to my best friend who messaged him about me. but to be exact he said he lost "many girl best friends and actually liked some of them". i don't think he ever really counted me as a friend tho, i feel like he felt pressured to listen to me.

i know that i shouldn't miss him because hes lead me on countless of times but i cant help it, it felt nice.
i miss having someone listen to me
this is just a pattern in my life now, i dont know what im doing but everytime i start enjoying someones company they leave me.

i dont think i can blame them tho, its their choice who they surround themselves with or not.
