my doggo story ok so the 19 of December was my birthday and my parents got me a dog as a gift, they told me.he had been in the adoption center for a week and was pretty afraid of everyone so I shouldn't touch him or get too close to him yet. so we did that same night he slept with me in my bed lol. the next day and incident happened tho, he peed in my parents bed so my mom tried to apprehend him (no hitting or anything just showing him what he did and telling him not to do it again in a very serious voice or sum like that) and then he started barking at her very fucking loudly and we live in a small apartment so with the echo it was like a stun granade for me lol cause i just woke up when that happened. later that same day he got super angry and started barking at my mom for no apparent reason and trying to bite her, we were in my room i was sitting in my chair and my mom in my bed. so he started barking at her and looking like he was about to bite her, so she jumped on top of one of the tables and he bit her in the right leg b4 she was able to escape. while that happens she screamed at me to go into the bathroom of her room and close the door, after some more embarking he started crying. we really didn't get what was wrong since we have him as much space as possible and only pet him a few times when we noticed he was willing to. that night we had to take him back to the shelter since it was too much for us and my.mom was already scared of him, it was kinda sad cause I've been wanting a dog for a long time but I know it was for the best.
