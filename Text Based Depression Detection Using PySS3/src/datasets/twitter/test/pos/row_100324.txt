Wtf am i doing. Right now im in a 3 year water sanitation technique and im halfway done. The jobs after that are mostly working in a water treatment plant technician. Itâ€™s pretty easy to find a job and it has a good pay. Although i am not really motivated to continue and im starting to fail my classes. Ivâ€™e never really have any passions or project that drived me and im very lazy but i like a lot of things moderatly : sports, science, philosophy, photography, video games. I donâ€™t really know if i should continue or risk changing for something that may interest me more.
