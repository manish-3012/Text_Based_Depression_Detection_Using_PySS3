Got rejected just gotta vent or something I'm cool with it I respect it but if be lying if I said I wasn't at least a little bummed. I thought I had a good chance but at least I tried. At least things aren't awkward and nothing's changed, were still good friends. But I can't help but hold onto false hope which i know I shouldn't do. Idk honestly probably the best case scenario besides her saying yes, she was respectful about it. Cool beans got it off my chest
