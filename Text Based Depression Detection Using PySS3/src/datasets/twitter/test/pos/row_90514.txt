School tine Okay so I did some math and this is like the bare bones so its not exact 
Students in my school spend
40 hrs on home work a month
7 whole days a month doing school work and being in school.
3 weeks of free time not counting for extra work. Bug assignments or events days off
This is crazy to me an exact week 24 hrs a day in this week btw of school.
