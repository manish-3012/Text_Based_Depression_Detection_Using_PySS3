Should I get vaccinated for COVID? My uni is providing it for free. So in short, I study at a medical university at Poland and theyâ€™ve recently announced that theyâ€™re providing free vaccination for the students of the university. Iâ€™m not sure if I should go signup for vaccination or not. Most of my classmates are telling me theyâ€™re not getting vaccinated at Poland. 

This is something I really need outside opinion on. Should I get vaccinated for COVID? 

(Btw Thereâ€™s also a possibility where Iâ€™m allergic to penicillin since my mother is also allergic to it, but it has never been tested for.)

(Btw Iâ€™m not polish, Iâ€™m Taiwanese. So Iâ€™m not exactly fond of the idea getting vaccinated here. But weâ€™re also resuming onsite classes right at the start of January. So getting vaccinated might be a good idea.)
