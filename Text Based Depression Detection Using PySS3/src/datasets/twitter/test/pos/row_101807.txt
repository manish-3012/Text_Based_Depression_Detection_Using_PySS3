my classmates really do care so i was doing PE and we were doing a complex circuit exercise, i did all of it and when i was about to finish i suddenly felt pulling, i looked down and saw my shoe laces untied, i immediately hit the ground and i also hit my right knee which i fractured years ago and if it gets hit it will still hurt, when i fell i was so tired, i stood up and ran and it my brain started to hurt along with my eyes(probably because i wasnâ€™t breathing a lot), i reached the finish line and this guy from my class started making fun of me, i didnâ€™t care as i was so out of breath and exhausted, i told the teacher and she said to put some ice on it, i was at the nurse and she just gave me ice which didnâ€™t help at all, i went to the train station with my friend and i could barely see because of my eyes were hurting with the bright sun light, i arrived at the station and went home, on the train i applied some medicine i had and just sat down, i remembered how that kid was such a dick head to me and how he hated me for no reason, i told my teachers about it after months and felt much better, i arrived home and sat down to rest and some time later this girl(which i kinda knew but we never became friends) asked if i was okay and how she was sorry for what happened and wanted to help, she knew that there were certain people who hated me and wanted to help, we talked to each other and she was really supportive, i felt soo good talking to someone about my problems, i have a lot of problems and she was trying her best to help me, we ended up becoming friends and she decided to go out in the weekend with her bf(which is a great friend of mine) to talk about all the problems i have. i feel so much better knowing someone is on my side and someone actually cares about me, i couldnâ€™t thank her more for helping me when i needed her, now going to school is much more fun when you know that there are people who actually care about you.
