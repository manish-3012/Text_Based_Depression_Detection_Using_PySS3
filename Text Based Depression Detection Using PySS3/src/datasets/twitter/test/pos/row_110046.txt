do you like it when musicians reference their own work? I like this one band that refers to their last songs sometimes but in a more subtle way?

like "I think you saved my life" to "I saved my own life"

and they have a song named Stupid For You so there's one that's like "I was stupid for you, stupid me"

sometimes it is lazy af songwriting tho
