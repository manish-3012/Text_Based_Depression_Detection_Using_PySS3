heres an interesting idea :) we should stop cringe culture !! its toxic and makes people feel yucky for what they enjoy doing/being.

soo heres a list of what to stop calling cRiNge :]

-being a furry !
â€¢you're a furry ? cool ! not my thing but if it makes you happy you do you :))

-drawing furry art !!
â€¢thats your art style ?? its cute and you have amazing art skills, people are just jealous they dont have ur skills :)

-liking any game (even if its fortnite) 
â€¢heard u play fortnite ! its not my favorite but im not gonna hate on u for playing it !!

-music taste !! i see it more in kpop and country
â€¢its really cool you like kpop, a lot of kpop is really cute and cool ! or u like country?? thats ur music taste and im not gonna judge u off of that (unless u listen to 6ix9ine:D)

-using xD or o_o, any of those really 
â€¢if u use those ur honestly really cute, emojis are overrated anyway ðŸ‘ï¸ðŸ‘„ðŸ‘ï¸ and for a lot of people who play minecraft and use them in the in game chat i love u :D

-specifically for reddit is emoji use
â€¢emojis are cute &gt;:))

thats all i can really think of rn but â¤ï¸
