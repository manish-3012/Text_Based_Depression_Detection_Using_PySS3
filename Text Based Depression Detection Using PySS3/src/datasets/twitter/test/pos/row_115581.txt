Being tall does not mean: (I'm a tall person so I know this from personal experience)

1. That you play basketball (I hate sports...)

2. that you are not afraid of heights (I am 1.90 meters and I am afraid of heights)

3. That you can reach everthing what another person can't reach. (Most of the time I CAN reach it, but... it's annoying that people always ask ME for that kinda sh*t.)

And if you see someone tall, don't ask things like: "wHy ArE yOu So TaLL?" -that's just f*cking annoying.

Thank you for reading.
