Okay, so one gal sent me a pic of her BooBIes...  

Okay, now that I have your attention, kudos to everyone who are battling with themselves every day but still manage to get up in the morning. I too have been wanting to die for so long, but I saw a post on reddit today saying something along the lines "If you've got up after having a bad day today, or any day, then I'm proud of you" and hence wanted to tell every brother/sister going through the same thing that it's not easy to be in a condition like you and still manage to live!

Have a great day, stay hydrated, and know that you're strong! I'm here if someone needs to vent out :D
