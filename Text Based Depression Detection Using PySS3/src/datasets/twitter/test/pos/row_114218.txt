Sex addiction and why itâ€™s horrible Iâ€™m a sex addict, this seems like a lot of peopleâ€™s dream positions being a teen but it isnâ€™t. Like any other mental illness there is a cause, mine was a girl. I was with her for 3 years, treated her better than anything, spoiled her and loved her. Then came the point I realised I was being abused because, itâ€™s hard to realise when itâ€™s happening to you sometimes. Physical and mental abuse all the time. Then she threatened me when I tried to leave. I was relationships before her but this broke something in me. Since then my trust issues developed a sex addiction, I want to be close to someone and feel affection but the closest I get is fucking a girl because I donâ€™t want to get closer. So, out of quarantine I go girl to girl, get more friends with benefits but I feel so empty. Sex became a coping mechanism like a drug and I canâ€™t get enough. Yeah, sex is cool. But being loved is better.
