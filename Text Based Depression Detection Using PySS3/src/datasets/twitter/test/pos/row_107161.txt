My Friends trying to Flirt is the funniest shit ever my friends are really funny because whenever they try to flirt with girl they go and insult them in front of the whole class and either tell me : "ya see that? she's gonna be over me later" or come to me for advice on why that didn't work. I told them that like you they are also humans and deserve respect, so respect them and be actually nice. Its tomorrow and they pull the same shit again and go : "wHy dOeSn'T sHe LiKe mE?" and that makes me laugh every fucking time.
