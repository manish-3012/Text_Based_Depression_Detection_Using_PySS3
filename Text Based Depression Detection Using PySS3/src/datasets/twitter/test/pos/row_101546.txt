For the first time in years, I stopped watching youtube for an entire month straight. Now this might sound weird, but when I was about 10-11 years old I made a youtube account. And since then I sit down and spend about 6-10 hours daily watching countless videos, channels, streams, etc. Fast forward a couple of years, and I made myself a twitch account. So now I basically have over 180 youtube channels that I'm subscribed to, and over 50  twitch channels that I follow. And of course I didn't know any better but to watch all of them day and night, I just wanted to keep up with everyone.

My mindset was, that if I wasn't constantly catching up to every teeny tiny detail of what whoever I'm following is doing, what they playing, what updates they have for a long time I wouldn't get anything of what are they doing and what are they playing when I finally start watching them again, and that might make me feel alone and left out.

But a bit over a month ago I met a couple friends through reddit and added them on discord. We started hanging out almost all day everyday, playing games, reading books, listening to each other's music and tons more fun stuff. But I didn't realize untill recently that I stopped watching my favourite youtubers, and started missing out on a lot of twitch streams. Which for a moment got me pretty upset, but now that I think about it, it's just great. I never felt as free and not attached to anythins as now since I stopped really caring about catching up to the literal hundreds of people that I follow.

Now I have no idea what you gained from reading this, it's not the "I stopped self harming for a month/ I haven't been depressed for over a month" type of story, but hey, thanks for hanging out I guess.
