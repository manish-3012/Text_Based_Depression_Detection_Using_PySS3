My dad is a smug smartass Okay so when I was about six I was struggling with math. Particularly subtration. 

After dinner almost every day he would pull out a pack of smarties and lay them out on the table. He would then ask me:

"How many smarties are there?"

I would then count them, and tell him how many there were. Then my dad has preceded to take a few smarties out of the big pile and EAT THEM.

"Now how many are there?"


Thanks dad. You realy helped me out there.
