I think my friends don't like me anymore So, I have been part of a large friend group at my high school for the better part of 4 years, and only recently it has become apparent to me that I have been very slowly dropped from the inner circle and I'm on my way out of the group in general. Now, of course, mentioning this to any of the people in the group ends with the same result, a half-assed response which is a blatant lie to try and keep my feelings from being hurt.

Very recently, I feel as if nobody actually wants me in the group, from a massive lack of acknowledgement during conversations, constant jokes directed to me which at times just feel like plain bullying, a pure lack of trust in anything I say (Despite the fact I have made an effort to speak as honestly as possible), leaving to go elsewhere when I approach the group, to straight-up eye-rolls directed at me in very rare cases.

I might sound like an anxious, attention-seeking loser who overthinks everything I do, but I genuinely think that they all don't like me anymore. Being left out of things isn't the worst part of what they do, but being directly lied to, knowing that it's a blatant lie, with evidence to prove that it's a lie, hurts the most. 

Does anyone have any advice or personal experience on this subject?
