So yesterday my mom met some friends she told them a story about me from when I was like five or something She said something about how I used say â€œgay girls are the luckiest because they get to kiss girls *and* be girlsâ€ and my closeted transbian ass is just sitting there on my phone internally screaming

How the fuck did I think I was cishet for as long as I did?
