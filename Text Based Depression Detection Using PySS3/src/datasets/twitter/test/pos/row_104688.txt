I feel like I'm loosing my best friend It's like Ill ask him to hang out and hell say no because he doesn't want to deal with the heat bc it's tx or he's busy or sum like that but he's always out with other people. Idk bro. Maybe I'm just loosing my shit or sum. But on the other hand it seems like he genuinely is starting to hate me or something. Idk. But then also I feel like I deserve it too. I'm not necessarily a good person.
