It's my birthday! So far this has been the best birthday. My mom bought me lots of makeup and took me to hot topic (which was an _experience_ for her) and I played video games with my dad. I've also gotten several birthday wishes which is great bc normally ppl forget my birthday.

So yes, it's been a good day. Going to update my age right after I post this.
