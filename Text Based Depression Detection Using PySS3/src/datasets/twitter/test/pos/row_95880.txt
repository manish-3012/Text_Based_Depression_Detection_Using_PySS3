Thinking a guy is gay because most of his friends are girls needs to fucking stop As a straight guy who has mostly friends that are girls, I want to say this is complete bullshit. The amount of times someone says I should hang out with more guys to seem less gay is annoying. Iâ€™m hanging out with them because they are cool and genuinely care about me and I have plenty of friends who are guys but since I hang out with girls more often, all of a sudden Iâ€™m gay.
