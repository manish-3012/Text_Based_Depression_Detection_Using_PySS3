Anyone who created a discord server and it didnâ€™t work out, youâ€™re most welcome to join us and be a part of the family :3 I honestly know what it feels like to have no one join you, I was at that stage at some point. Even though right now my server is booming and active, it was a dead graveyard at the beginning. So youâ€™re most welcome to join us, I know it probably wonâ€™t be the same as having all the controls over everyone but  youâ€™re most welcome to treat it just like youâ€™d treat your own. Iâ€™m saying this in the nicest way possible, donâ€™t mean to sound arrogant in any manner.
