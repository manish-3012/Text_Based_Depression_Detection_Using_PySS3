I ask for help and recommendations 

I donâ€™t want to come off as selfish or greedy but my clothes are becoming to expensive.

Me being a tall and big teenager has its pros and cons. One of its cons is the rate at which I grow through clothing and the cost of clothing. The cost of clothing for someone my size is around $50 dollars for a pair of jeans and I usually need five pairs of khakis and jeans which will cost my family around $300 dollars just for pants if we are shopping in clearance and we usually need to go clothes shopping twice a year for clothes for me. But during quarantine my family has been facing financial issues and this has caused me to not get enough clothes to the point to which I have to wear some twice in a row and wear my clothes that donâ€™t fit(currently itâ€™s just the pants but now my shirts and underwear are now becoming too tight). The problem with this is I go back to school tomorrow in person and I only have one pair of pants that fit and my schedule is wack so I go to the school up to four times a week when Iâ€™m only suppose to being twice a week.
So Iâ€™ve been faced with the issue of what to do, my family has put it two ways for me. I ether wear clothes that donâ€™t fit multiple times a weeks or I must be put on a strict diet to make me lose weight to the point which clothes are big on me. 

I ask all of you for recommendations of what to do and if you know, what are some cheap clothing clothing stores for big people.
