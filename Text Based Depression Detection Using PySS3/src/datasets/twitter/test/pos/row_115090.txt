Corona has made my goal of getting a Girlfriend harder I am starting sophomore year tomorrow august 25th 2020. We go back in person 5 days a week like normal. My school is making us wear face masks social distance and has the desks 3 feet apart. I am not good at talking to girls because I was really awkward around them and no girls talked to me because I wasnâ€™t in the best shape. However over quarantine I went from being 200 pounds and 5â€™9 to being 145 pounds and 5â€™10 and look much better. Which is why I decided that this year was the year I was going to try to get a girlfriend. As I want to step out of my comfort zone and experience high school as best I can. Since I wasnt talking to any girls before its gonna be a lot harder to try and get to know someone with all these strict rules. In a normal school year this wouldâ€™ve been really hard but corona ups the difficulty to insanity.
