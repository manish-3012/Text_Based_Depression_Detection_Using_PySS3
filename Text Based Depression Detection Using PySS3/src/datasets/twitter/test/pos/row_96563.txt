What is the best way to answer â€ži love youâ€œ So Iâ€™ve known this girl for more than a year and weâ€™ve had crushes on each other but never really got into a relationship. We later on decided that we are just really good friends. Today is the first time ive looked at the screen since i had an eye surgery 24 hours ago. I have told her before that i was getting an eye surgery. So i open my wifi and then see â€žI hope the surgery goes well and i love you ðŸ˜˜â€œ in my notifications. How do i reply so i donâ€™t disappoint her? Please help.


PS: i do love her back, its just that im hiding it from her since yknow she already said that were only friends.
