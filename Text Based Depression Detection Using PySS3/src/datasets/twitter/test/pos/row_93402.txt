Damn bro so my genetics pretty much make me the whitest of white that ever whites the white So i have grey eyes, which I just found out, with a bit of blue. My ethnic background is from Norway, and I have blonde hair to top it off. My doctor told me pretty much that I could probably never get a solid tan. I have so little melanin that my skin turns a near dark red when I get cold.
