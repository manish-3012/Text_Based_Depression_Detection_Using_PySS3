I f*cked up and I donâ€™t know what to do Last night I was on call with two of my friends, we were joking around, I brought up how I wanted to drink and smoke weed and other things when Iâ€™m an adult (I made sure to emphasize that) but one of them started lecturing me on it and I said some things I shouldnâ€™t have, long story short I admitted that psychedelics were just a crutch to keep me going in the future and I canâ€™t see my self living past 25.
I made it so awkward.
I donâ€™t why I said that stuff.
I fuck everything up.
I canâ€™t bring myself to speak to either of them anymore.
