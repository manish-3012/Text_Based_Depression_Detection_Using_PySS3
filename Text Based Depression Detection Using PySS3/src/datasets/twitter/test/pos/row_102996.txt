how do some of y'all get addicted to smoking that shit sucks So today my parents were away and i had the whole day and house to myself. Around noon i had the thought "you know what, since my dad smokes 3 packs a day, lets try to light a cig and see what all the fuss is about." My dad only had these thin cigars, but i dont think they were the real deal, just cigars in the shape of cigarettes. I light one up, put it in my mouth and inhale. It felt pretty good the first 20 seconds, not gonna lie. Like roasted pop-corn in my mouth. But after that my mouth started burning. Like not spicy-burning, heat burning. I let it cool but the results were the same. I dont know why people genuinely like this, or did i do something wrong ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸
