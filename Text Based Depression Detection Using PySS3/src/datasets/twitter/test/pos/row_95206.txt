Everyone at my school thinks I'm gay, but I'm straight as a pencil, what should I do? Hey! Before I start I want to make it clear I have NOTHING against non-straight people. I know its kind of obligatory at this point but I just wanted to make that clear. To start I also want to make clear I am 100% without a shadow of a doubt straight. Not bi, not gay, but straight. Never have been, never will be.

Now onto the main topic. As stated above, the people at my school think im gay. I've concocted a few reasons why they think so, which I will list and explain below:

- I dress nicely (?)
Apparently giving a shit about how you look is now considered a gay thing. I know one of the stereotypes for gay people is that they dress nicely all the time, and I don't see it. I don't even think I dress particularly nicely, I typically just go Jeans and a sweatshirt in winter, and kackies and a polo in the summer. Apparently the "style" is looking like you just got out of bed, at least at my school. But if it works it works ig. You do you.

- A homosexual at my school has liked me before.
Kind of self explanatory really. In turn, this caused people to think I too was gay.  don't like him back in that way, if it wasn't obvious enough, but you get the point. 

- I'm friends with girls (Also ?)
Again, not sure how exactly this makes people think I'm gay, but this is what people have told me so here goes. Also yet again, self explanatory. I'm friendly with lots of girls at my school. Mainly because I've either liked them, or have liked them in the past. 

I don't think I have any other particularly "gay" tendencies. Everyone knows the girl I like, I can't keep a secret for shit. Maybe its because I don't play sports? If you look at my profile I'm i guess you'd call a "self proclaimed game dev"
I'm not sure. I think that might be my main reason. I'm not exactly what you'd call a masculine person. Never had a liking to playing sports. I can watch them for sure, just was never a die-hard fan. I play a lot of video games, quite honestly more than I should, so at school I'm known as the "probably gay kid with no mom that codes and plays video games all day" (thats all true minus the gay part obviously. My mom has passed away but that's not related.) I'm not depressed or anything like that. I like to think I'm a rather cheerful person. My typical quote is "if it made someone laugh, no matter what I said or did, it was worth it." And I think that says another about myself.


The real kicker to all this is that the girl I like, no shit, thinks I'm gay, *and she knows I like her*. Like wtf? I swear people think I "like" her as a cover up. I don't know what to do. I don't get particularly made fun of for it, but it seems to come up in conversation alot and I'm not okay with it in the slightest. Again, if you yourself are gay, power to you. But its the same situation as you being called straight when you're gay, just kinda, flipped. What should I do? Because Apparently the House Party Magic 8 ball thinks im gay too, so I'm out of options here yall ðŸ¤£
