i just don't have any motivation :/ this bitch about to go fail her midterms bc she couldn't study bc all her motivation is goneeeeeee.

fuck you quarantine :)

and can someone irl just become the bff i read abt in stories \`(\*&gt;ï¹&lt;\*)â€²

i just want someone to listen to me :(  
someone who i can trust, and talk too :((  
i want someone to fangirl with me, talk to me and have fun with me :(

but again thats never happening bc everyone else already has their happy ending. welp  
moving on

anyways talking to my parents isnt ideal neither is talking to my 5 yr old brother. 

im literally failing school, bc the teachers can at most send me a message online. and theirs no reason for me to be "excited" for school n e more. no friends = no fun.

ty for listening to my tedtalk
