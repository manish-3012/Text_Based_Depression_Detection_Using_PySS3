I hate this subreddit itâ€™s all the same shit; virginity jokes, crush doing x posts, depression/anxiety wahhh feel bad for me posts, obvious karma whoring, and completely god awful memes. thatâ€™s all this sub is, thereâ€™s little to no actual discussion regarding being a normal teenager cause everyone here is socially inept.
