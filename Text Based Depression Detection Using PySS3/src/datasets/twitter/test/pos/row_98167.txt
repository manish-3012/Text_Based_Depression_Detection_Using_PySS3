A cheesy movie line that I really needed Ok so I got around to watching "Fantastic Beasts amd Where to Find Them" yesterday. I used to be a Potterhead but I didn't want to watch this because I thought the book(which was just the script) was boring. It was a lot better than I expected, actually. This week was rough for me mentally and this had been the nice point of it.

Anyways one line stuck with me: "My philosophy is that worrying means you suffer twice." As someone who worries a heck ton, I've heard the likes of this maybe a hundred times. I have no idea why but this time it just hit different.  God, it's so cheesy but I really needed that. Thanks, JK Rowling.
