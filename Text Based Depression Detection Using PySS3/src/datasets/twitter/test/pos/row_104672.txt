Anyone listen to Txt or Stray Kids Bro, the amount of good songs these guys have is crazy, they have songs in each different genre which blows my mind. godâ€™s menu and shampoo fairy are probably my favorite songs by them as of right now. Iâ€™ve been avoiding this music for a while but itâ€™s actually good lol
