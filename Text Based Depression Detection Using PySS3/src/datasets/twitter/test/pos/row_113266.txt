Iâ€™m all for calling bad people out for doing bad things But Jesus the amount of people that get butthurt over something that wasnâ€™t even referring to them is very high. The bad thing about that is that they call out the wrong people just for saying something while there are actually people out there that will do worse and get away with it 

Youâ€™re not helping anyone for calling pity things.
