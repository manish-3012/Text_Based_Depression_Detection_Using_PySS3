this world honestly disgusts me, iâ€™m actually feeling sick thereâ€™s this guy on tiktok who posted a graphic video of a dog MURDERING a cat. it picked it up and shook it so hard. the cat was dying slowly at the end and the person didnâ€™t help it.

and the people in the comments where all just saying how funny it was.

on top of that the video got over 200k likes, and the person who posted it has over 2 million followers. 

i looked through his account and he also has tons of videos of animal cruelty, people being hurt, dogs penises, sexual assault, ect, and people just think itâ€™s funny 


i reported it but i doubt anything will happen since the guy is verified by tiktok and everything ðŸ˜”
