Been a minute since I've used reddit Been pretty damn lonely lately not gonna lie. Dosen't help that all my friends are in relationships. Honestly suprised it took me this long to really start feeling. Well I was into this one girl for a while and she sorta started dating someone bleh. Had to fight the inner incel in me when that happened. Don't feel like talking to any of my friends rn so i came to where all the other social rejects go to. So hi random person reading this, I'm lonely and sad about it :)
