I enjoy the fact that I can lose and get feelings so quickly All of the people Iâ€™ve crushed on usually didnâ€™t take to long for me to be into them, and when they stopped showing interest I lost feelings for them so fast. 

Takes me about a week to a month to catch feelings and they then are gone in a day or 2.
