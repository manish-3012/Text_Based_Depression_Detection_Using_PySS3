Fridays are supposed to be good so why do mine always suck My job is just so trash it makes my entire weekend shit I hate it but I think any other job I get will be just as shit. And talking to my ex would always make me feel better on Fridays when I have to work but heâ€™s not around anymore bc other than that talking to him just stresses me out. Iâ€™m sad this week is probably gonna be the worst week of my life just so much stressful shit going on and no one to talk to and Iâ€™m so busy I canâ€™t get a break until after Christmas ugh
