How do you figure out who you are as a person? How do you figure out your likes and dislikes? I don't really understand who I am, I grew up poor so I didn't really have a lot of time to read or listen to music. As an adult I find myself istening to a lot of music on a daily basis and yet I still have no favorite artists, I try to read when I can but I get bored by it/not motivated to progress reading, so its hard to find interests.

Could just be depression talking, but I dunno. I just wanna try to figure out who I am as a person. I don't know what kind of sports im into, I know I enjoy watching baseball. But I find it extremely boring when talking about it so im not sure.
