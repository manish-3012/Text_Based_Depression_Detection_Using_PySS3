Passing on my wisdom (AKA life hacks I made) I am a wise one. Here is my wisdom for you

1. In one of those refrigerator water dispensers, go ice cubes first, not water. Not only will it not splash on your hands no matter what, but the ice cubes pop and crack, and cracked ice cubes melt faster

2. Having a big jar of sugar on your kitchen Isle is a good idea. Not only is it good for a tea or coffee addiction, but one grain is just a easy way to wake yourself up a tiny bit more

3. Keep your dog treats in a container that makes a weird noise that only it makes. Mine makes a loud click. Your dog associates it with treats and will come running to you whenever he hears that noise.

4. If you're like me and collect old electronics, you want to display everything you have in your collection, but cant. However, of you store them in a LEGO box (mainly LEGO Mario starter), its a awesome second collection.
