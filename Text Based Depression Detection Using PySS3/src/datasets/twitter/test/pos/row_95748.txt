Fucking hell liking someone sucks sometimes Welp, my best friend is dating someone who I hold very dear to me. I like that girl so much. I used to date her too. But I fucked up, and ruined it. And it still weighs on me like a cross shaped rock (kudos to whoever gets that reference). They hid it from me for two months. I was just told about it by my best friend. I had to tell him it was fine, and that I wasnâ€™t mad. But Iâ€™m fucking livid. I know this is pretty much my fault in a way. But I really wanna crawl into a hole and listen to Dio right now.
