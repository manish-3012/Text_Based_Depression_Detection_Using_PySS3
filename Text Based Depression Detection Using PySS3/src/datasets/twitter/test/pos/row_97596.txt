cant believe i need to say this but its not inherently transphobic to not want to date trans people.  its okay to have a preference for cis people.  some straight guys or lesbians might not want to date a trans woman who hasnt had surgery, some gay guys or straight women might not want to date a trans guy who hasnt had surgery.  for a lot of people sex is an important part in a relationship and theyre not comfortable or attracted to certain parts.  so long as youre calling them by their names and their pronouns youre not being disrespectful or transphobic.  as a trans guy im really sick of people saying that if youre not dating someone who is trans, youre being transphobic.  theres a difference between not dating or sleeping with someone and not treating them like a person.  treat trans people with respect, but nobody should feel forced to date someone if theyre not attracted to them.  yall are just making actual transphobia look like a joke.
