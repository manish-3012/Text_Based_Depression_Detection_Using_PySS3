I subconsciously predicted the future. Last night I had a dream where my 6th grade homeroom teacher (Iâ€™m in 11th grade now) gave us all these marijuana tablets.

I popped one in my mouth and immediately my brain began to feel as through it was expanding and pressing into my skull. I felt like I could hear the white lights and touch the ringing sound. 

Looking back itâ€™s amazing how I didnâ€™t wake up. I legit felt like my head was going to explode.

Then I wake up and find out that Gov Cuomo signed the bill to legalize recreational marijuana!

Coincidence?
