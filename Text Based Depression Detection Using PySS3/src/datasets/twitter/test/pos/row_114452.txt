Idk why I'm crying i should be so happy I'm in a relationship with the most amazing guy I've met (I'm talking breakfast in bed, constant cuddles and adorable nicknames as well as being as weird as me and his family say I'm part of family). 

My ex and me are still good friends and call when we can. 

But with my mental health I just break down and cry constantly. Watching YouTube, cry, watching f1, cry, walking, cry. Idek why anymore. 

I was going to end this all, on the 31st this month. But I can't now. And idk what to do.

I've done counseling, I've tried medication, I've tried exercise and sunlight.
