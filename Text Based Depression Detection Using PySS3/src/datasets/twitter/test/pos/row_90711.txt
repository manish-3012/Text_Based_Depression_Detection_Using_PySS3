I have to be homeschooled instead of going back to my actual school now :/ My dad is a pilot, the best in the country or even the world. He recently had heart surgery so he got his flying license revoked which caused him to take a massive hit in salary. He's also taken another hit in salary due to the fucking virus so we have to change schools. But where I live there aren't any other good schools which I can attend which are in our budget so I have to learn online.

It sucks because I've always wanted to go to prom (yeah yeah it's unmanly so sue me), I've wanted to get a girlfriend and I genuinely like socialising at school. It sucks I may never see some of those people again and it sucks I won't get a prom and it sucks I won't get a girlfriend so I'm super bummed about all that

But realistically these things dont affect my life and I'm still getting a good education which is a lot more than others can say, so I'm thankful for that. 

Im just scared of being aloneeeee during school daysss
