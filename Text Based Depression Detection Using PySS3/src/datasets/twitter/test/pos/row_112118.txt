I just found out that my "friend group" thinks the biggest jerk in the gc is better than me So yeah, title sums it all up. It hurts even more cuz the people who prefer the jerk were my lifelong friends, and I don't think they're joking. I don't even know why they don't like me, I'm not annoying, i'm not a jerk. I just repeat the same joke like once or twice every day. is that why they don't like me? I don't know, the only thing I have to say is, this hurts, and its better if I just move on ig. Maybe i'll look for a new friend group with similar interests or something, idk
