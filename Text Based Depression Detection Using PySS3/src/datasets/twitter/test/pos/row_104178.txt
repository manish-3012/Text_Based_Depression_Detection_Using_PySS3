I was offered a job yesterday I was renting skis yesterday, and the guy who was helping me out told me that he can tell that Iâ€™m very experienced with skis and straight up offered a summer job on the spot. He said Iâ€™d have to wait until Iâ€™m 15, but then he bumped it up to 17 when I couldnâ€™t remember what size my skis were last year. But Iâ€™m pretty sure he was joking about the last part
