My school can now see and control what we're doing on our laptops Like they can monitor our laptops through there computer. They can move your mouse and pull up text boxes to communicate to who ever is on it. I think turning off the wifi stops it because when I did the little monitoring bar when the teachers looking at your screen just disappeared after I did it. Still creepy though.
