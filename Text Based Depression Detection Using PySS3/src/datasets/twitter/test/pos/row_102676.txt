Who else thinks this? Dont you think that, in school, teachers are completely sexist? Like me, my friends and some other girls got into trouble last year and the teachers only punished the fucking boys. And it's not just the teachers, the girls would go punch you and say "you can't hit a girl". So annoying




One time I slapped a girl in the face once she hit me and said you cant hit a girl
