Funny school story -Salsa Yeah its in the title.  Anyway so in 7th grade my father had brought home like 12 gallons of salsa from work.  Well it was getting to the point where we couldn't use it all in time so as the ingenious solution my mind came up with was bring it to school.

  For about 6 gallons out of eight (We used 2 and we gave 2 to our neighbors) it went smoothly.  Except one day I ever the risktaker brought 2 gallons with me.  The first deal went off without a hitch.  But the last deal when I gave it to my friend the principal saw them with the gallon.

  For some unknown reason the principal took the gallon who knows why only they do.  The principal asked who gave this to you but apparently I chose the right person to give it to because he said I brought it from home like the good person he is.  They took it to the principals office.

 Yet afterwards when I went to retrieve the salsa they said that If no one came to claim it they were gonna eat it with some chips.  The.  Audacity.  I kinda cared but then I thought "Hmm thats talking to authority and I'm liable to be angry and then get in trouble.".  So like the saint I am I said okay thanks through a bleeding tongue from biting it so hard.

  Finally with the happy ending to this I gave my friend the salsa after school and it all ended happily ever after.  (Sorry for possible bad grammar English is even my first language I'm just dumb).
