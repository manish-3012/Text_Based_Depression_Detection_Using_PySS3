Drugs aren't bad, they aren't good, they just... are Drug abuse is bad. Drug addiction is bad. But drugs save my life every day. Drugs, to me, are good. If it werenâ€™t for the pill I take every morning, I would be dead. Fuck anyone who says overgeneralizing shit like â€˜drugs are badâ€™. SSRIs kept me from killing myself. Mood stabilizers kept me from having panic attacks. LSD showed me truths about myself I couldnâ€™t imagine. Prescribed Xanax helped me sleep when nothing could.

Taking LSD every week is bad. Taking Xanax presses unprescribed is bad. Drug abuse is bad. Drugs are not. Addiction is bad. Occasional useâ€”with a purpose, reagent testing, and suitable dosingâ€”is not always bad. It might be, but that's on you and **your** decisions, not the substance. Thatâ€™s right, drugs are sometimes good. Suck it up. Just because you donâ€™t take something doesnâ€™t give you the right to shit on everyone who does. I know people whose lives were saved by illicit substances like DMT and shrooms. I know people whose lives were ruined by prescription drugs. 

Take responsibility for your actions, especially with drugs. If you don't like drugs or disagree with using them, that's your opinion. This is mine. Respect mine, and I'll respect yours! 

Watch the first episode of The Midnight Gospel if you donâ€™t believe me.

Donâ€™t underestimate the power of drugs. Yes, they can be bad, but they can also be beautiful. Don't be brainwashed, make your own decisions. 

By the way, I see people countering my point by making statements like "cocaine was made specifically for the high". No it wasn't, google it. 95% of synthetic drugs you know came around due to a pharmaceutical experiment. Cocaine and LSD, most notably. Non-synthetic drugs have been used for decades: weed, ayahuasca (DMT), cubensis (shrooms). 

tldr; drugs aren't good or bad, your decisions are good or bad.
