For people with depression I was depressed when I was 11, I felt suicidal every day and just felt like I wanted to end it, but I didnâ€™t, and I am very thankful for that. The truth is, it was hard, I hated myself, I hated everyone else and I hated the world, I was tired and sleepy all the time, I wasnâ€™t able to concentrate on anything. But I made it through it and Iâ€™m talking to you right now! So cheer up and just know within yourself that you can do it, that you can make it through this, I believe in you
