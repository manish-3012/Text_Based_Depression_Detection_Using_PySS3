[Teacher calling for aid!] I am running quiz games for my middle school, and I need your help pranking the faculty. Millennial teacher reaching out to the Zoomers here:

I've been running live quiz games on Fridays that all students and faculty participate in. They've been "get to know us" games where I get "fun facts" about teachers and everyone tries to guess which teacher goes with each statement.

The problem I'm having is that the faculty are *dominating* these games, because we all know each other better than the students know us. Shocking.

I want the students to whoop the faculty tomorrow, so I'm hoping to add a bunch of questions that *every* middle school student will know, but relatively few of the faculty.

Here are some examples:

* What is the name of Spongebob's pet snail?

* Which of the following was *not* a real Disney channel show?

* Which of these is *not* one of the basic Minecraft enemies?

* "Ninja" is a famous social media personality. On which platform are they famous?

Remember that middle schoolers are 11-14, so maybe a little younger than the standard r/teenagers crowd.

It would be suuper helpful if you could post questions AND multiple-choice answers, because I am getting old and out-of touch.

Thank you! Age slowly! Being in your 20's is really hard but being in your 30's appears to be better!
