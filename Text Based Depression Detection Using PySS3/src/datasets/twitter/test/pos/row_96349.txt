Made out for the first time recently and it was magical bruh As a dude, Iâ€™m not exactly use to getting a whole lot of attention or affection, so finally truly experiencing it just feels so nice. My emotions were overloaded.

Been dating someone whoâ€™s bound to be my gf, and after a bit on our date we ended up just making out in her car and my heartt aaaagh. It didnâ€™t even make me that horny, it just felt niceâœ¨

that first big breathe you both take after you kinda initialize the makeout, once I felt that I was like, oh shit this is it. Iâ€™m kidding a girl outta my league hella and she is equally into it. Maybe she was into it more cause she kept blushing a lot especially when I slightly choked her lmao

Emotional connections with someone youâ€™re interested in feel great wow. AND HUGS AA

Please donâ€™t ask me for dating advice, this is the second person Iâ€™ve ever dated, and how I met her is quite literally the luckiest and dumbest thing ever
