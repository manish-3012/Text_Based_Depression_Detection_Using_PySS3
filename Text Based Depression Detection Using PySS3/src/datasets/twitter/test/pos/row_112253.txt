Should I tell her how I feel? Hello there.

So Iâ€™ve been thinking about this for quite some time now and Iâ€™ve come to Reddit for help. Iâ€™m in love with a friend for a rather long time now, and I guess Iâ€™ve been just hiding my feelings since then. But I think she feels the same way that I do, but then again Iâ€™m really not sure. We do boxing together and we always have something to talk about, even in DMâ€™s, which is pretty much every day. But I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the insecurity boiling inside me or if Iâ€™m just an idiot, but I seriously think that love is more than that. Itâ€™s not just texting everyday and smiles at boxing, no, itâ€™s more of a feeling. What I mean is, the feeling that you know that sheâ€™s in love with you. All the little details coming into one giant truth: sheâ€™s in love with me. My boxing coach says I should go for it, my colleagues said I should go for it, but I just canâ€™t keep myself from thinking: *does this feeling go both ways?*

Reddit, give me a hand here.
