Nobody can actually pinpoint why the hell Teens are depressed... It always shifts from one thing to another, social media, politics, and shit that makes no sense. 

But tbh I don't think we will ever pinpoint it! 


With all the horrid problems circulating around the world. With these problems, new problems pop up. Either bullshit or serious. 

These problems send the mentality of teens down the drain, to the point of it being very critical. 

I'm no doctor, but this is just what I think...
