Bought a new thing Ok back to talk about my dad. So my dad bought a tv awhile ago ( I posted about that too ) and now he bought a router to go with the latter half of the house. So the â€œ Internet â€œ router comes in and he bought a router that you had to plug in the tv but the tv and the place the router goes is very far away. This is fine I think a simple mistake we can return it and get a internet router but now that it isnâ€™t working he gets mad and unplugged the internet router we already had and put it in the room with the tv so he unplugged the other router and plugs the internet router into the Ethernet cable and this isnâ€™t gonna work and I tell him that and he doesnâ€™t believe me and now he thinks both routers arenâ€™t working and we have to get two new routers.
