I am so sick of being female! I know you see a lot of this on this subreddit, but I just had to say something.

Today me and my best friend were at the mall, I don't usually show any skin but this time I was wearing a crop top and so was my friend. 

So we walk down some stairs and on our way two security guards pass by. I wasn't paying any attention to them, but my friend was.

She then turned to me and said,

"those security guards were looking at our stomachs (the only place where we were showing a little bit of skin) In a really creepy way"

It might not seem like much but through out the day we would get weird stares from older men, and I just feel so disgusted.

I would also like to mention that I use He/Him or They/Them pronouns and am waiting for the binder that I finally ordered.

I hope I won't get weird stares anymore then, but I know that from now on I will fully cover myself when in public.

I would do anything to not be a "girl" 

(I apologize for any spelling errors, English is not my first language)
