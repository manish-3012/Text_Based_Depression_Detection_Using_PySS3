wish i was black i know that it sounds kinda weird but i seriously wish i was born as a black man. I am white but i feels like i was supposed to be black. im really good at basketball, i have a bunch of black friends and i talk like a black guy.

is there like transgender but for race? because thats what i think i am. this started about 1 year ago. i dont know why but i just suddebly got the feeling that it would be cool to be black. then that feeling started to become stronger and now its just all i think about.
