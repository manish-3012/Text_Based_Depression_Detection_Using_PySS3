Funny incident from school This is a true story; I have seen it happen with my own eyes and heard the exchange with my own ears.

**Background**

About a year and 4 months ago (before Covid), we were still having in-person school. So it was during math class (Honors Algebra 2), period 6. The teacher finished teaching about 20 minutes early, and so we had time to work on our homework. But of course nobody was working on homework, we were all talking to each other (no phones out though, that was teacher policy). And there was a quiet kid (Male, 15), he's not the "potentially school shooter" kind, just the extremely introverted kind. He's pretty smart, but he got no girlfriends or crushes (as far as we know). So basically a girl (also 15) who is very popular among the sophomores went over to him and started flirting with him (many other people, including I, were nearby, we were just talking about stuff, but we stopped talking and watched the exchange). 

**The incident**

The girl just tapped him on the shoulders (he was probably the only person in the class who is actually working on homework), and he looked up at her (I believe he is a bit annoyed, but he didn't show it). She said "I love you" to him (seriously?), and he, almost immediately, responded "Thank you!" 

**The aftermath**

Everyone else started laughing so hard the teacher had to intervene for everyone to calm down.
