How do I explain to my parents that I don't want a haircut from them? My dad keeps calling me gorilla just cause my hair has gotten a bit long. I know it's long but my hair it's not unreasonably long like if I had to pull it towards my eye it would barely reach it. Last time I got a haircut from them, people I'm my school called my haircut clapped so I don't want it to happen again. I can get away with insulting me but it's still annoying to hear skmeone say that.
