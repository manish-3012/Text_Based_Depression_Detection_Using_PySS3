Can you report accounts? As title says. I have seen few pics with ad at bottom to some type of stream recording service. The accounts that have posted those type of pics are bots. You can see it from name. So is there way to report profile as a bot? Is it agaist some rules that ad should be marked as ads? That is subliminal advertising because it doesn't say its ad. Am I wrong? I can very well be wrong. I don't know.
