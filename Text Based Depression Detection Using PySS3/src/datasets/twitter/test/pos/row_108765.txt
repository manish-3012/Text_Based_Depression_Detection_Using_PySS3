Is posting a photo of me edited into an old photo with my dad karma whoring? I want to know if I should delete it. Recently posted a photo of my dad and a younger me in which I edited myself into it to have an updated photo because I can take one with him anymore. I simply posted it because it made me happy, but I want to know if thatâ€™s karma whoring because I know people have posted before purely just to get karma and awards which is horrible. Just want to get an idea if I should delete the post or not because I donâ€™t want to be a karma whore.
