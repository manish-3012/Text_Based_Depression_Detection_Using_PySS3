My sister shaved off 80% of her eyebrows off They're almost gone now. She's been doing this over the last 3 days. She looks really weird to me. I'm not gonna tell you what you can and can't do to your body but this looks really bad. I've seen some people do it but she did it way too short and now she just wants to shave it all off because me and my mom commented on it. She also called me ugly. My mom can't really stop her because she does it in the middle of the night.
