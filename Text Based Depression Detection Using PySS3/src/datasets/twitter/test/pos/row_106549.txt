Fellow horny teens, please ffs, do not see porn as a good sex Ed or as real life So Iâ€™ve been thinking for a while about all the stories where abusive partners forces others to do painful or damaging things like anal or rape play. I have come to the conclusion that the porn industry plays a huge part into this. If you donâ€™t know, sites such as PH are playing a role into sex trafficking, rape of actresses and even CP. It also isnâ€™t normal than 13 yo are into hard kink such as rapeplay or bdsm. Things such as anal are considered easy and always pleasurable, when in reality, it is difficult to do so. Violence against women is always there and they are objectify. Donâ€™t worry, I am not trying to shame you for watching since it is normal at that age, but Iâ€™m trying to make you understand how it can be bad


Now here is my message: Fellow horny boys and girls, porn isnâ€™t real life. Not much girl will want to try anal or be choked hard. So please, when asking your gf or bf about sex activities, Do not repeatedly ask the same thing if they say no. Respect their boundaries and love them. 



Have a nice day yâ€™all
