Does drawing give anyone else Anxiety? I was bored in math today so I started drawing on my paper. Not only did it stress me out, but I just kinda freaked out and dropped my pen.

I find that this happens a lot when I draw. Iâ€™m not talented but Iâ€™m a perfectionist. 

Does anyone else have this problem?
