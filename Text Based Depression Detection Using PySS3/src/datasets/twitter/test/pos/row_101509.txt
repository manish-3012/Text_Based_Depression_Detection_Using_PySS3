I donâ€™t really feel happy, ever Iâ€™m 16 I have a good life, Iâ€™ve got decent parents, Iâ€™m super active, Iâ€™ve got an astrophysics career planned out and Iâ€™ve been reading at a college level for about a year now. But I donâ€™t ever feel happy. Iâ€™ve resorted to calling the moments I do feel happy â€œhappiness dosesâ€ I only feel them about once or twice a day and they last for a minute or two. Iâ€™ve noticed they mainly happen when I piece together something difficult that I didnâ€™t understand previously.

I get great grades in school, Iâ€™ve got two fantastic friends. Iâ€™m not being bullied and my teachers are all pretty good. I have no idea why Iâ€™m feeling this way. Itâ€™s not bothering me or effecting my day to day life. Iâ€™m just confused.
