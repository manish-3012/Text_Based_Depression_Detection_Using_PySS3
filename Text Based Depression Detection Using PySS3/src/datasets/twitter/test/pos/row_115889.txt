Staying up and watching youtube videos helped me save a kid. Well this is a story iâ€™ve wanted to tell but never had time but today I released theres nothing to do so yeah, iâ€™ll post this story to reddit.


Now, this was a year ago, I was staying up on a Sunday as there was no school the next day. I was up at 11:00 AM watching videos on how to stay aware in situations after seeing recent events about shootings and terrorism. Now I went to sleep after a few videos or so and I woke up at 10:00 AM sharp next day.



The next day, we had to go to get groceries. We decided to go to a well known Indian store for groceries as we were going to have a big party next day. As we enter the shop, it was very crowded full of people we usually didnâ€™t see if we were to go there another day. Now it was just my dad and me as my sister and mom were staying home. As we enter I hear 4 guys saying,â€œno not that guy,(referring to my dad) the other kid(referring to a little kid).â€ Now I notice as in the video It gave tips such as use your surroundings and avoid eye contact. Now how I used these was that went behind a few aisles where I could hear them but they could not see me. Then I saw  the cashierâ€™s monitor with certain cameras. I had full vision of them and I could hear them very easily. My dad was with me and I told him about the situation. We decided to leave and tell the cashier about how sketchy they were. At this point the 4 guys decided to act as they released they had no time. I noticed them getting closer to a kid and I used another tip from the video. Use unexpected things to your advantage. Now really there was a lot of things I could have threw such as chip bags all the way to pans and pots. I was near the entrance and found the only thing I could use that could cause damage was rocks outside as the pans and pots were on the other farther aisles and chip bags and naan rooti wouldnâ€™t do anything. So I went to get a rock when suddenly I realized the door made noise when opened or closed at a distance. Iâ€™ve went here for like 5 years so I knew when It would make a noise when I opened the door. I was able to grab a few rocks (no small ones, a few big ones and 1 HUGE rock) and as soon as they were about to grab the small kid and I hit all 4 of them with a lot of rocks HARD. Iâ€™m talking almost causing coma hard. I think its because my adrenaline kicked in at the right time so after some hard hitting throws we called police and they searched them and their van(it was white and windows were tinted) and they found pistols and knives in their pockets(very small I couldnâ€™t notice them) and the car had even more weird shit but I didnâ€™t see what they had but hey, I saved a kid.


The kidâ€™s mom was deaf and the kidâ€™s dad had to go use the restroom so he was very vulnerable but now they realize that threats can happen and are more careful
now. 

Also, for me my dad actually thanked me a lot  for noticing and said he was really proud so yeah the compliment made my day!

The kid didnâ€™t know what happened and he thanked me after he realized they were gonna take him and he wanted me to have his toy as a gift as it was the least he could offer so thatâ€™s that. 


The 4 guys, idk what happened for them as they were arrested.(Iâ€™ll update on that later) Also, they were really gonna do messed up shit with the kid but we didnâ€™t the kid since like cmon now heâ€™s a kid.


The crowd wasnâ€™t sketchy or anything. just new people.


So yeah I can answer questions 30 minutes after but then ima go to sleep so bye!
