Today I explained physics question to the smart kid. I am average in every subject (except math and chemistry, I am very bad in them). Today I sat together with a girl who is known as the smart one. So, she was solving physics while I was revising history. Then she said to someone I can't do this question. I glanced at the question but didn't had the  courage to do it because when she can't do that how can I? But I decided to give it a try. I opened my book and that question was circled ( I circle the questions I can't solve). Now I was certain I can't do it. But I got it right in the first time even she was amazed about how I did that. That moment made my day.
