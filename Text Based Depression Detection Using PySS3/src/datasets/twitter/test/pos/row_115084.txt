Mental disorders aren't "cute". I'm tired of people self-diagnosing themselves and then going around and almost bragging about it.

Being a perfectionist doesn't mean you have OCD.

Being sad or does not mean you're depressed.

Being "edgy" does not mean you are bipolar.

And it's not cute either. Stop saying that having a disorder is fun and enjoyable, it's not. I'm tired of hearing,

"Oh my god, I'm soooo OCD!"

"OMG, me too! My room *has* to be clean at all times!"

Stop. It's not quirky, it's not cute, just stop.
