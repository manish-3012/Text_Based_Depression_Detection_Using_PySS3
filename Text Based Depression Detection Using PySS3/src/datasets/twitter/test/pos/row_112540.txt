Alright i have a horrible idea. What if we connected a cvt to a superchargers input shaft ?

so with engine speed the amount of boost would get higher and higher till the boost pipes or the engine blows up ? (or if its an engine with high quality forged parts being able to use that boost)

or maybe have another engine run the supercharger connected to a cvt so the main engine power doesnt decrease to make the boost ?
