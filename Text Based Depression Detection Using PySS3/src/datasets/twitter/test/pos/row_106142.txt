So my mom basically called me a f*ggot I shaved my armpits the other day (because who likes armpit hair? Like, for real?) Primarily because aesthetics, but also because it's cleaner.

My mom hadn't noticed, but when she did she went on a REALLY FUCKING LONG lecture/rant as to why me, a male, shouldn't shave my pits and said something along the lines of: "only girls and f*ggots shave their armpits".

Smh. I just wanted to be cleaner and got a lecture instead.
