How do I tell my parents I don't want to go to my current school anymore? (This is my first time posting here) I got into an advanced public school, and the government gives an allowance every other semester. The thing is, I can't really handle it anymore. I've been studying there since last year, so the excuse that I'm still adjusting is out of the question.

All the lessons feel drab, like I don't find a usefulness in them, but my parents convince me that I have to finish my highschool there for the free college. But, I just can't. I never knew I'd experience a mental breakdown in my whole life, but here I am, crying while writing a reddit post.

I've been thinking dark thoughts lately too, like a scenario of me stabbing myself while my mom goes to school to get my card, which I have told my friends (They discouraged me on doing that), but not my parents.

This feels like a weird place to end off, but thank you for taking your time to read this, hope you have a nice day!
