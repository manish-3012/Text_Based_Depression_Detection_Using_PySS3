Not me regretting my decision to not try out for soccer I should have just done it. I just congratulated one of my friends for making Varsity and she said she wished I would have come out and played. I'm not that great of a player but I shouldn't have let my insecurity about being left out of a senior season get in the way.


I've had the gut wrenching feeling of regret all evening because of my decision and that was just the cherry on top  :/
