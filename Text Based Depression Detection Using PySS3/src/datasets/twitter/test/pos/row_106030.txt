This is gonna sound a bit cringe lads, but I hate that I look intimidating Before you read, this is gonna sound like something an edgy 14 year old would post 


To start off, I don't think I look intimidating, I don't think I act intimidating either 


But man

For example, when I'm just walking, people just walk around me (before covid 19) like, it could be a wide ass street and they'd still go to the opposite side. 

My friends say it too, "you look like you're gonna kill someone" 

No joke, someone called the police on me, literally, walking to a mates house, and the police drove up, they were nice so it's fine, but I had to explain where I was going, where I was etc... They caught wind of who I was so they only asked if I was carrying weapons (only knives this is AUS) but they didn't frisk me 

I don't like this, sure, it might seem cool to some, but I'm a nice person when you meet me
