Should I kill him? So today I was sitting and rewatching Naruto cause I was bored, there was a fight scene and they were breathing out fire and doing other jutsus...my little cousin saw that and came to me and sat next to me and said â€œThey are making fire out of their mouths like a dragonâ€ I was like â€œyeahâ€ then they started Naruto running, my cousin saw that and said â€œHey! I know thatâ€ and he stood up and started running like that. I said â€œcool where did u see it? In any animation or anime?â€
He said â€œNo I saw it on tiktokâ€
Iâ€™m soo triggered right now...
