Just bought a refurbished laptop but it has someones account/info on it. Just saved up a shit load of money and i just received it today, when i loaded it up, it had a account name ITUS and a video file that 3 gigs. I know that this might not be the right subreddit but should I return it and wait another 3 weeks or should i factory reset it?
