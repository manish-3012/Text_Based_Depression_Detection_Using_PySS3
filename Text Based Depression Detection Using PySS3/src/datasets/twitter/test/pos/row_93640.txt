Just a rant or something idek Yâ€™all is it bad that when I go on twitter I get jealous of non-binary or trans people (Iâ€™m a cis male btw) who are so confident with themselves and are so accepted by their friends? Iâ€™m not sure if what Iâ€™m saying right now is transphobic or anything like that but Iâ€™m almost jealous of non cis people because their friends accept them even though they are different? Am I wrong for thinking this? Is this transphobic? Can someone answer these?
