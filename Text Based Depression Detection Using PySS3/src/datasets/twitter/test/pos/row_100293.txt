They're gonna bur- So i just woke up and had the weirdest dream.
It all start with some dude making a gasoline puddle and slowly but surely going to a house while dropping gasoline. I'm seeing through his eyes in that moment. Then he surrounds the house while making sure it gets on the wall and everything. Then i come back into my own body and i start running to this house because it is a friend's house  (It was a dream friend. I've never met them in real life. It was someone i met in this sub tho. Like, i met someone here and we met each other in real life.) And i see it in the distance and i start sprinting. Cut to where I'm there and i start screaming "JASON, JASOOOON" (Sorry if that's your name) "JAAAAASSOOOOON". So then, he was in his bed and didn't know about the guy. So because we're friends, he throws like a little plushie that looks like him and has like a little thing in his back like Woody. I pull it and it says "Talk dirty to me". And me, not knowing how to talk dirty, just tried to say "THEY'RE GONNA BURN YOUR DIRTY-ASS HOUSE DOWN" but as soon i got to "BURN" everything just flashed white like if an animation had a white frame between all of it's dark frames. And then the next "frame" was his house burning up. The next "frame" i woke up.
