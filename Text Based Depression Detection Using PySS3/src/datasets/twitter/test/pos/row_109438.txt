I helped my friend talk to his crush ðŸ¥³ My friend is very shy and awkward when it comes to being around her.

He never talks to her and just stalks her all the time which is kinda weird in a way,so i decided to go talk to her myself about his feelings for her and i know that's not good idea a very stupid one indeed but I was annoyed that he always drags me into this and talks about her all the time,also stalks her with me and never alone for some reason,so I was finally done and went talked to her, it turns out she's very kind and humble and decided to talk to him,they talked in private but oh boy after that he was very happy for some reason i don't know why he keeps this in mystery, the guys kinda a weirdo but is a very good friend , I think he got accepted I hope so.
