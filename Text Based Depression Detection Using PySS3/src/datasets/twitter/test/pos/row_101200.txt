Iâ€™m fucking tired of not being on E. I already know how much of a long and drawn out process beginning hormone therapy can be and I havenâ€™t even been lined up with a gender therapist yet...

I hate that every month I spend not on estrogen is another month that my body is progressing through male puberty.

Turns out researching all forms of feminizing hormone therapy doesnâ€™t help relieve dysphoria either, it just makes me hate the fact that my body is going the complete opposite direction that I want it to. Fml.

Thank you for listening to my ted talk.
