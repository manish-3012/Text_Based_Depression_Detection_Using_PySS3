I'm about to commit an act of terrorism Android users: go into your settings then go to Google settings.

IPhone users: go to settings then privacy then health.

You'll find a covid-19 tracker, do not enable it, they will be able to track where you go, who your with, when your there, when you leave, etc... This is a massive invasion of privacy, they have been doing this type of shit for years now.
