I've ruined a friendship don't know what to do. Ok so what happened was that a childhood friend of mine proposed to me, I said that we could talk and she got super happy. We talked for two months and she always sent me love quotes and stuff which made it so hard to tell her that even though she's amazing I don't like her that way. But one day I decided to tell her once and for all cause I felt as if I was wasting her time. When I told her she just stopped talking to me. She was a very close friend and I'm sad that such a long friendship is ending cause of this. Any advice on this would be appreciated.
