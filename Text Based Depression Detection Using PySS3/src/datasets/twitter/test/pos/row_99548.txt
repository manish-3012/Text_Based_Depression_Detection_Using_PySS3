We should make a logographic writing system with emojis It would have no spoken or signed equivalent, and it would be universal, basically to maximize what we can say in the least amount of characters and have a written language we can all understand 

Each emoji couldnâ€™t represent a phonetic sound cuz there would be no spoken equivalent but combinations of different emojis could mean different things so ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ would just mean Canada but something like idk ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½â¬…ï¸ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ could mean North America or something, and ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦âž¡ï¸ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ from Canada to Mexico, like â¬…ï¸ could mean thing 1 through thing 2 like thing 2â¬…ï¸thing 1 and âž¡ï¸ could mean thing 1 to thing 2 like thing 1âž¡ï¸thing 2

idk, Iâ€™m putting this idea into the world so someone else will do it, I wouldnâ€™t know where to start
