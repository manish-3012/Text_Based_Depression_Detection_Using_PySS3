I just uploaded my second video for my channel! From the previous video, I had some key takeaways. I used them and made a slightly better video. I hope somebody takes a look at it and gives me some constructive feedback. For example, using skeletons to make the figure better!

Me and my channel are beginners btw. aimed at beginner artists. Tnx for watching!
