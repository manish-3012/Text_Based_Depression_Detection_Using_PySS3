Looks like Iâ€™m going to the military This school semester has been terribly depressing and boring for me. I lack any motivation to do anything and my parents have decided that because I am failing my classes, as of right now, I have to go to military school. I have three days to do all the work from this semester and I might have a chance to get out of it. Iâ€™m scared, help.
