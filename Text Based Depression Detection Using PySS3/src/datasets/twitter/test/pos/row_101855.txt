Ahaha got me a date with a femboy tomorrow Man im excited, hopefully i dont fuck it up:)

but im pretty damn swag, in fact im the MOST swag person in this sub. Im just bored yo, i got nothing to do. As days go by, yhe more i feel as though life is meaning less. The things i used to enjoy, COD, minecraft, GTA, they all boring to me. I started looking forward to human interaction more than anything and conversing with people so im not lonely has become my top priority. Ive come to realize, that I may never find someone as good as my ex, she was the perfect person and ive come to start doing the one thing i swore to never do.  But I would never get back with her because i hate on and off shit and 2 because she moved on so quick. So now i just have her there just so i can get my revenge when i turn hot af. And i hold grudges for WAYYY too long so shit is fucked yk what i mean? 

But thats okay cuz femboys can fix any problem.
