Glasses are nice So I donâ€™t usually wear glasses very much, but my vision has just been getting worse and worse throughout the years, so we found some old glasses and put them on me and itâ€™s like seeing the world in an entire new light, itâ€™s crazy how everything seems. Like, the trees seem taller and the leaves more colorful, the houses look beautiful, itâ€™s really nice.

Edit: Just got to school and had to put a mask on. I donâ€™t like glasses anymore.
