Yesterday I was going to kill myself Today is the first time Iâ€™ve felt genuine joy in a while. If your feeling suicidal, please donâ€™t take your life. Thereâ€™s so many people who love you and want you in this world. I cant guarantee I wonâ€™t end up doing anything in the future, but ily all. Please get help. Because no matter how corny it sounds, you are beautiful. The universe gave you shoes that fit you. So wear those shoes and be proud of them. Trust me ik itâ€™s hard.
