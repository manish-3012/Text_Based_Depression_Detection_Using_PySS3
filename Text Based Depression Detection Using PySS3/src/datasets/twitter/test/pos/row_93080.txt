I've been scaring myself to the point where I can't leave my bed So recently I've gotten into watching scary movies, scary Reddit videos, and all that jazz. I watch them constantly and I find it enjoyable. My parents have even started recommending scary movies to me. But recently my imagination has started to run amuck. The stories they tell in movies have stuck inside my head, I was once watching a video about murderers hiding in closets and under beds. So some nights  I'll hear a noise and I'll start freaking out into thinking it's a murderer coming into my house trying to kill everyone in my home. It has gotten to the point where I can't turn a corner without fearing for my life. I live in a safe community, the worst thing that's ever happened near here has just been a couple of fires. But I can't go to the bathroom without looking everywhere and even worrying that someone may be in my vents. My ADHD has been acting up even more than usual, my parents tell me to just relax and that freaking myself out (which is true) how do I help myself stop freaking out about literally everything.
