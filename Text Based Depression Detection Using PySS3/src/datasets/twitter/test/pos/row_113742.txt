Anyone else really like old British rail era diesel trains? Or trains in general? I love trains, I know facts about these trains, but I only know 1 other person who likes trains (my dad) by old diesels, I mean class 08/09/31/40/43/47/50 if youâ€™re not sure look them up. I also go Trainspotting to a nearby station, anyone else here do this? I get itâ€™s more of an adults hobby, but I live near rails, so itâ€™s good for me
