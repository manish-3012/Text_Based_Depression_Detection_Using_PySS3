One of my friends tried to sext with me. I didn't really know what was going on at first. But when it clicked I didn't know how to react. I told him to stop, he did. I don't know if he will try something like this again, or if he was just tired and horny.

He wasn't being pushy and I really appreciated that.  But I still feel really bad about everything. Maybe I led him on, I don't know, I thought we were just messing around at first. 

I don't know how I'll feel about this later, but right now I feel really sad. I feel stupid.
