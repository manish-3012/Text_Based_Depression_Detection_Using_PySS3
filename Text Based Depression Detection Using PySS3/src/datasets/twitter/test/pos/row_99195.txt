Itâ€™s 4am and I have a meeting in 10:30 I have to wake up at 9:30 and Iâ€™m used to sleeping 10 hours. 

itâ€™s an important meeting that will determine if Iâ€™m able to join the military (since itâ€™s mandatory in my country [×œ×ž×™ ×©×ž×¡×ª×›×œ ×¢×œ ×–×” ×•×ª×•×”×” ×× ×× ×™ ×ž×§×•×¨×™××” ××• ×ž×©×”×•, ×œ×â¤ï¸]). I have it cuz Iâ€™m seeing a therapist for more than a year and a half. I really hope Iâ€™ll get a psychiatrist through this meeting because I wanna see one but my dad thinks itâ€™s all just a conspiracy to sell us more pills and stuff. he got pretty mad last time I tried to bring it up. The â€œgive up, itâ€™s not gonna happen.â€ Type of mad.
