My 3am thoughts Here are some things I literally woke up and wrote at 3am the other night. I was just sleeping then woke up was thinking about some things and tried to write them down, then went back to sleep.

What is happiness? Is it a feeling of contentment in the moment? Being in a long state of joy? Or is it simply not real?

Why oh why does it seem as everything is perfect but so bad? How can life be simultaneously incredible but melancholic?

How is it possible that ideas form in the mind only to be swirled around in the head, and when spoken or written down they fall out like too many objects packed into a closet that has just been opened - creating an impossible mess?

When will my thoughts actually become something other than the bland and pitiful grey, pale soup it is now? Or will it stay that way forever? Are the colours grey and white so bland after all? They world is so intricate and special with interesting things being found in the most 'boring' or 'bland' places, even these colours could have more meaning than what meets the eye.

It is only me. I am the problem. While the world is filled with so much, the only thing not wonderful - empty - is me. And I don't think there is anything that can fix that.
