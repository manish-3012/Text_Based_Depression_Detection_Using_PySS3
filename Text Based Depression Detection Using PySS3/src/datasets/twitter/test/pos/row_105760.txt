Does anybody know an image editing app that allows for multiple people? I want to play a game known as sprouts using a 4096x2160 image  using an image editor (with me and 2 of my friends one on Android and one on IPhone but we don't want to go back and forth sending images in our group chat. Does anybody know an app that allows this? It just needs to have "text" and "brush" tools but preferably also a tool that allows images to be added from you gallery like pocket paint's "import image" tool.
