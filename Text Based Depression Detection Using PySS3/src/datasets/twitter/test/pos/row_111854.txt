I am so pissed off right now So, my parents are planning to put me in a cabin in our backyard next to my brother. THE REASON I WANT TO HAVE A ROOM OF MY OWN IS TO GET AWAY FROM THAT BITCH. He is always obnoxious and abusive, and now I am just worried that I am gonna have to live in the backyard with him. My parents are refusing to put my sister out in a cabin because she is the youngest (11 years old) and she is a whiny bitch who cries and complains until she gets her own way.
