That clichÃ© of finding out the person you love is leaving so you go to the airport to stop them is weird Idk, but if that happened to me I could probably do that by walking, itâ€™s only 4.2 miles, I could run that if I was determined enough, itâ€™s less than a 10 minute drive, although most people in Fresno just drive the 3.5 hours to lax cuz itâ€™s like half the price unless youâ€™re going to Mexico, and I think I might have just given away my location, shit 

Itâ€™s not very realistic, not cuz thatâ€™s weird to do that but cuz who the fuck wouldnâ€™t tell there best friend/ significant other that there leaving well in advance
