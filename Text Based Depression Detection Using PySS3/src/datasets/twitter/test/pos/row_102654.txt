I HATE MY CLASSMATES Ok, hereâ€™s some context: Down here in Texas, we have a program called the Early College High school program (ECHS for short) which enrolls the kids in a college class along with Highschool classes. Iâ€™m enrolled in this.

Now hereâ€™s the thing. In the middle of the semester, we have a Mid-Term Essay. This Essay is 30% of our grade. This is a very important essay, is to be written in APA format, and we weâ€™re given 3 days to complete it, which is more than enough time. The subject is very easy and all the info we need is in our textbooks. Our Essay was due today, and I had mine completed. I turned it in and thought nothing of it, I knew my essay was good. 3 hours after class, I get a email. The email wasnâ€™t congratulating us on our excellent essays, but to tell us something different. The Email was about how our Essays weâ€™re so bad and completely ignored the simple instructions and that weâ€™re lucky sheâ€™s voiding the grade.

I know my essay followed everything and was well written. So that means my classmates ARE SOO FUCKING DENSE THAT THEY CANT EVEN WRITE A SIMPLE FUCKING ESSAY.

Excuse me while I go commit toaster bath because I wasted my time due to my classmatesâ€™ incompetence.
