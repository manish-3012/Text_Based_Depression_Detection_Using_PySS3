My mom is coming home in a few hours and I donâ€™t want to see her To make a long story short she got into some trouble with the law, got bailed out and is coming home, and now I have to talk to her. I honestly donâ€™t want to, I just want to know what she did and when her court day is, after that I want to be on my own. Is that bad? I still love her obviously, but Iâ€™m so pissed at what she put us through and WILL be putting us through because Iâ€™m 90% sure sheâ€™ll get a jail sentence. And I donâ€™t want to just pretend everythingâ€™s fine and normal until she has her court date. help?
