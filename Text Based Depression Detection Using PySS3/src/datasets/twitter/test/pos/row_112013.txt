the end is in sight, letâ€™s finish strong everyone will be vaccinated in a few months, and life will probably be back to normal by the end of the year (probably way before then, like june-october or something) 

itâ€™s weird to watch my country go from worst covid response in the world, to best in 50 days cuz we got a new president. my state had a good response, but the states that didnâ€™t, and the fact we canâ€™t just close the borders (i donâ€™t see why not) means that we just got it from other states

fuck Ron DeSantis, Asa Hutchinso, Pete Ricketts, Kim Reynolds, Tate Reeves, Doug Burgum, Kristi Noem, and any other governor that waited too long to lockdown their state

and a special fuck you to Greg Abbott, Asa Hutchinson, and any other governor who has removed all restrictions
