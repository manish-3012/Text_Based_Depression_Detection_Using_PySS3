my experience here after one year to the few people who sort by new who are here, i want you to here this.
i want to say thank you to this amazing subreddit ive been a part of, and to the many teenagers (and maybe not teenagers anymore) who are on this subreddit, making it such a wonderful place to be. this past year has been rough for me, with family issues, friend issues, and just issues with life in general. but through it all, ive always had your welcoming, often sarcastic personalities to come to, a place where i can forget about stuff for a while. i want to thank all of the people on here, and on the r/teenagers discord, for being willing to talk whenever, for Willing to send memes whenever, for willing to be here with me. i wish i could give you all hugs (except the discord mods, screw off). another year has gone by in such a flash, another year gone, but im glad i got to spend it with you guys. i have never once learned any of your names, but im glad weve been through it together.

p.s
discord mods, really you guys suck
