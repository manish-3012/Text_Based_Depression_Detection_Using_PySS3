I just feel like shit I had a surgery about 3 days ago. It was an infected cyst and it was much more extensive then my doctor thought it was going to be. He took out a pretty large chunk where the cyst was and said he had to be very aggressive. He said after the surgery it was one of the worst cases of it he had ever seen. I'm on painkillers right now but i feel like shit. I'm tired all the time, the painkillers aren't that effective and I'm afraid that if I get a higher dose I'm going to get addicted to opioids and then that becomes a different problem. I'm getting stressed about school and what I'm going to do. I cant sit and work at a computer so its going to be hard to work on anything. I'm not able to go into school and I have a huge pile of work right now. It just sucks and I feel so fucking weak and I cant excersise. I wont be healed till around Christmas so I wont be able to do my sport this year. I just had no one to vent to because I dont want my friends/family to worry so i came here.
