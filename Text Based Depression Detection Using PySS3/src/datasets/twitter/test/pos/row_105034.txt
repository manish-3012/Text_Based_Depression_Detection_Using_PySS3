I had to stop talking to my friend beacause of assholes that were going to my school. Backstory: At this period (in 7th grade) I used to have  long hair as a male so I really stood out of the group of other guys in my class. 

The story: in 7th grade I changed schools beacouse of our family moving out. I didnt know anyone in new school, so i felt kinda lonely. On day after school I was walking to the bus station when I met a gril from my class. We talked a bit and realised that we like r the same band and play the same games. So we became friends. Now I have to tell u something. Guys from my school didnylt see a diffrence between being a friend to someone and dating them. So they began to make fun of me. They used follow us on the way to the bus ad laugh. I officially was known as a simp in new school. But I kinda resisted their behaviour, beacouse in my first school the things were really bad. The victim were my friend. She had a big group of friends which started to bully her for ,,dating with a TRANS guy"(im not).
They started to slowly reject her out of the group to the point where they didnt want to invite her anywhere. The things got a lot worse when she broke her leg. She was going to school but couldnt carry her backpack. So as a friend lcarried it for her, whenever she was going to the other class, or to the bus stop. After this The assholes started to make memes about us. On the walls of batthrooms were writtenour names in a heart. Her friends started to make fun of her beacouse of me even more. 

After year of this circuss, we decided to kinda domt talk to eachother in school and dont give the kids a reason to make fun of us. Our contact today is very weak and I dont even remember when was our last time we talked. They ruined our relationship.

I wrote it to kinda get it off me.To fell better. Now I go to the 2nd class in middle school but still remember her and miss the days that we talked. It was nice to have a girl-friend
