Fuck, guess i am shorter than i thought. So my moter decided to make me do a BMI test because she thought i was underweight or something. Only like 3 kg under ideal, but thats not what maters.

What maters is that i had to measure my height, and apparently i am 169 cm (5'4 feet). I knew it was over under 6' when i thought i was 5'7, but this is way fucking worse.

I am still processing this, i still feel like a few years before when i was fifth tallest in my class (Argie, so class sizes are big asf) i thought it meant nothing, but now i fall onto short world i understand how much it meant all this time.

I feel like measuring it again, as i still am in absolute shock, but i dont remember where i left that tape thingy so i cant. Jfl, its worse than i thought.
