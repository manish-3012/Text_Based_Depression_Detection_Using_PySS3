Is thinking about suicide a normal thing to do? I've been constantly thinking about these thoughts and I am wondering if everyone does it or it's just me. I don't share my feelings with anyone, is that a bad thing to do? I tried telling my family but they just think I am lying about my feelings. Is it normal for them to believe that I am lying or I just have a really fucked up relationship with my family. I currently keep most of my feelings to myself and I feel uncomfortable talking about these subjects.
