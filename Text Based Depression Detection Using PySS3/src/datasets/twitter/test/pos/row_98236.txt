Just had a panic attack over among us For the last couple of games white has been following me around, protecting me and my kid as my name is â€˜*proud dad*â€™ I really appreciated him and saw him as my guardian angel. A few games after he started protecting me I got **Imposter**, now I bet you can see where this is going.

I spent the first half of the game trying to ditch him to do some killing as I really didnâ€™t want to kill him and was hoping my teammate would, unfortunately my teammate was caught and I had to start playing teammate and getting other people voted off which worked long enough to get it down to two other people, I sabotaged reactor and killed the last other guy in front of white and successfully won the game without killing my guardian angel

Unfortunately for me the match was so stressful I had a panic attack for 5 minutes
