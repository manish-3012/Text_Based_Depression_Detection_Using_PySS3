Ok.. sorry for so many vents and questions about mental health today. Itâ€™s not been a good day for me. Itâ€™s like a fight going on in my head. Iâ€™m just not able to stop thinking about everything. Overthinking, really.
But anyways, this is what I wanted to say. Donâ€™t know why I came to teenagers for answers, but hey.. I guess I wanna know if anyone can relate to me and you guys are my best bet

I live my life constantly in other peoples shoes. Like, Iâ€™ll talk like other people, act like other people, just overall pretend Iâ€™m them. And specifically, these â€˜peopleâ€™ are fictional characters. My *own* fictional characters. Or at least a character Iâ€™m obsessed with. But.. itâ€™s like, if I make a joke, itâ€™ll be relating to them.. if I talk, itâ€™d be something theyâ€™d say. I *feel* like that character. But also like myself? I donâ€™t know how to put it into words.. and if Iâ€™m not pretending to be them, Iâ€™m really thinking about them. You could even say obsessing. Everything I think involves them 

Sometimes I have these long full conversations with myself.. as like, up to 6 different characters. I know talking to yourself is very normal, but it feels like Iâ€™m talking to multiple different people when I do. Please just.. does anybody else feel like this? Or does anybody know what it could be?? 

Once again sorry for constantly asking here and venting. I just havenâ€™t been having a good day at all. Dog had an emergency, I had a rough day at school, Iâ€™m not able to focus.. itâ€™s just very stressful today

AND NO- I wonâ€™t diagnose myself! Iâ€™m just Looking to see if I should get this checked out.
