I've really lost motivation for anything in life No, I'm not completely depressed or suicidal, it's just that I've literally lost motivation to do anything. I really don't feel like reading or playing, or even sleeping at this point, almost feel like I want to go into a time stasis and just do nothing. 

I've had school here since April, and I did have motivation until recently, now I just do not have any motivation or interest to study. I've not lost grades (dropped to about 80-90%), but I still feel I could do better, just that I do not feel like doing anything. 

Any help with not procrastinating or getting hopes back up to do stuff like talking to people, or study, or even do anything in life?
