â€œHave you been washing your face recently?â€ Is what my parents always ask me whenever I have bad acne on that day. Yes, Karen, I didnâ€™t just randomly decide fo stop doing skincare. 

And my mom always makes me try these dumbass overpriced spa products for my face that never work. I donâ€™t think sheâ€™ll ever understand that I have acne prone skin, and these face products from the spa are not made for people like me. In fact, the most recent product she made me try caused me to have painful cystic acne breakouts... and my dermatologist canâ€™t get me in until OCTOBER 23RD. I actually hate living. Iâ€™ve had bad acne for 3 years and I donâ€™t know when it ends.
