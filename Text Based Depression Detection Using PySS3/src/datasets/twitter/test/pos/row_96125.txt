17 y/o Aus seeking help in that awkward transitional phase. please! Hello there! 

Currently I am 17 and I will be 18 in March. I live in a really toxic and abusive environment so I am keen to move out and slowly start recovering from years of trauma. I don't have a job yet however I have an interview soon and if that fails I have another almost guarenteed job lined up.

Now for the typical 'school never taught me this moment' What do should I expect moving out? Despite coming from an abusive home, we are quite well off and I feel as if my concept of money isn't reasonable. I just want some help so please don't go at me.  

What costs and legal fees should I be aware of? I know theres my rental bond and insurances. I don't plan to be in a shared home due to my medical issues. Here is a short list of questions:

\- What hidden rental experiences/costs that you are'nt immedietly aware of?

\- What government support can I get, if any (I think my parents earn too much for me to be able to apply for youth allowence)

\- Will I be able to stay under my dad's private health plan? What happens with the medicare family card?

\- I have a car, I don't know much about paying for it's bills.... does it just get plopped off in my mailbox?

\- How much should I am to have saved up before I move out? I really hope to get out of here in under a year because I cannot take this environment anymore

I would really apppreciate the help. I really don't know how to take care of anything. I've had such a conflicting childhood and I would have loved to stay with my parents to build up a heafty savings account but I am starting to lose my mind. They cut off my therapy because they don't like me 'spreading rumours' about them. I'm at a loss. 17, inexperienced, unaware, no family support (first gen immigrants). Any help would be appreciated.

P.S. I have had many people deny any claims to abuse on me since my parents income is high and 'how can you consider this abuse? you get free stuff all the time?' to that I would like to just gently remind you that abuse happens in many ways and the 'free stuff' is, accordint to my therapist, emotional manipulation.
