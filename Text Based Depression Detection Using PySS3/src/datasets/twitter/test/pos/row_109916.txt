My anxious brain is at it again : ) I was with this guy I've been talking to for a while. We watched a little anime and then I had to go home cuz I had to take the bus and it was getting late. He gave me a hug so I seized the opportunity and gave him a kiss on the cheek. Mind you I'm very shy so this was big girl moment for me. In any case he let out a weird/embarrassed/happy 'aaaa' and smiled and stuff um but my brain is saying I made a huge mistake and I shouldn't have done that and that I've ruined everything because he hasn't messaged me yet haha yay
