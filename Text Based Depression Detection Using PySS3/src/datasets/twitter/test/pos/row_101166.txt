My Sister is one of the best things to ever happen to me I had some really bad home life issues and what came out of that was my Sister. She was born 2 years ago and she will be 2 this year. I honestly have no idea where I would be without her. Whenever I am around her she always puts a smile on my face. I love her so much. She also just randomly screams and thatâ€™s hilarious. I think she couldâ€™ve saved me from further mental damage done to me with her unknowingly trying to make me happy. I canâ€™t wait to show her Star Wars.
