Itâ€™s really sad how many teenagers are depressed. Depression for anyone is terrible of course. But why is it so common in teenagers? Itâ€™s sad how the older generations are not only ruining the world for us but damaging the mental health of many of us/ not giving the help that many of us need too. What do you guys think?
