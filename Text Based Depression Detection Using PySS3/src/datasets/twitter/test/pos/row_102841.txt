My mom just told me to die So I just started going to therapy for my anxiety and also because my grandpa died recently. My mom keeps on asking if its working and I always say yes but I guess she expects a fast change and not for me to get better over time. Today i posted a meme on my story. It was in Spanish but Ill try to translate it. It was along the lines of:

Therapist: the only person who can bring you peace in these hard times....

Me: (please dont say me)

Therapist: is you

Then theres a picture of a sad chihuahua or whatever. Anyways this seemed to really upset my mom, even though my aunt sent that exact same meme to the family group chat and thats why I posted it; i found it relatable. 

So she proceeded to guilt trip me saying that if my therapy isnt working (which I never implied, I guess she thought the meme implied that but I never meant to imply it) then Im wasting my aunt's money (my other aunt is paying for the therapy) And that I never take anything seriously. Then she tells me to die. Like literally this was on the instagram dms and she replied to my story saying 'entonces muere' which literally directly translates to 'so die' in english, and included 'todos queremos morir despues de la muerte de mi padre' which means 'we all want to die after my fathers death' because my grandpa recently passed away and we are all still grieving. Im really not sure what was going on in her head when she said this and im sure she didnt mean it but for a solid 2 minutes I was convinced I was actually gonna attempt today and started to think of ways I could do it. But I realized theres no easy way, and I also dm'd my friends on instagram through my laptop (i forgot to mention my mom also took my phone away after telling me to die) about this and they were also convincing me not to do it and distracting me. Anyways I know she didnt mean it but c'mon it still hit hard and I honestly dont know what to do she also threatened to cancel my therapy because she thought it wasnt working. All because of one meme. I cant post anything on my social media without getting criticized by her. Oh and she also told me to 'text your lesbian friends that you wont be able talk to them for a while' when she took my phone away. She keeps calling me a lesbian as an insult (as my user suggests, im bi and actually dating a guy right now, but every time I act weird or something she calls me a lesbian) and she always refers to my friends as the 'lesbian friends' just because they like girls too and it honestly makes me angry because I know she means it in a derogatory way and is making fun of them. I dont know what to do anymore because she can obviously be nice and rly helpful and just a rly good mom but sometimes she takes it too far. I cant even text my therapist since I dont have my phone so I have to wait a whole week until Friday when our next meeting is scheduled to tell her about this.
