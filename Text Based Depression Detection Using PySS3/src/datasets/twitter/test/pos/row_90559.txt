A friend had his 2nd injection of the vaccine at the vaccination center and began to have blurred vision the whole way home.
When he got home, he called the vaccination center for advice and to ask if he should go see a doctor, or be hospitalized.

*He was told to come back to the vaccination center as a matter of urgency to take back his forgotten glasses*
