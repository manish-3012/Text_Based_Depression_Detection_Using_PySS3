just saying.... but watching peoples being burned alive scares me the most, more than anything. not because someone gonna burn me alive or smth but just there could be a Hellfire in afterlife. i mean my religion say that the hellfire is like 70 times hotter than the hottest fire on the Earth, only the fire without mentioning the other beyond horrible punishments....
and whats scares me also is that peoples there stay for millions of years untill , now thats scary just to imagine yourself there.
