Why would girls wear skirts/dresses above the knee? So I was at the mall shopping with one of my best friends the other day. And we got in the skirts/dresses section. And I kept noticing she kept picking up all the short ones, that'd end up several inches above her knees...mid-thigh precisely.

When she was ready to try them on, I was like, "Wow Maddie, you basically picked out all of the short ones, lol."

And she was like, "Well of course! I shave my legs and they're really fit and toned, why wouldn't I wanna show them off? Plus, short ones are so fucking cute! I refuse to wear a skirt or dress that's not at least a hand or two above my knees!"

Her logic...kind of escaped me though...in a skirt or dress above the knee, I feel really vulnerable. Like my underwear could show at any minute, and like I gotta keep my legs together at all times. I think below the knee is much better.

I brought this up to her, she said, "Haha. I used to be like that too. But I stopped giving a shit. Sitting properly isn't hard to do, and comes naturally to me. And even in the slight chance someone did see my underwear...why the fuck should I care? I wear bikini bottoms in public all the time anyway."

And just wow...I'm surprised how carefree she is. I still can't help but wonder though.
