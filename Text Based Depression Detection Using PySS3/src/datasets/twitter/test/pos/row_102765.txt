Ok i got a big brain thought experiment Forgive any typos am on mobile


So, you know how a shit load of cells make up your brain what if we had the same amount of humans as there are cells in de brain and we assigned each of em a cell, what will it create cuz at the cellular level each cell is an individual and its doing what it evolved to do but us or any creature is an individual because they have a consciousness and are aware that they exists so what will happen if humans became those cells, will we give consciousness to a completely new being that sees the universe on a completely different scale.

You know what, scratch that, what if we had same no. of humans as there are cells in a human body at any given time and assign them a cell, will it create a creature that has consciousness and can see, touch, smell, taste and hear, will we create life, now that's a big brain idea, i think...idk.. shut up im big brain
