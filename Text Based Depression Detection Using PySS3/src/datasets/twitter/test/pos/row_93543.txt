Iâ€™m kinda sad right now So my cousins dog died tonight and Iâ€™m really sad and crying, he wasnâ€™t my dog and I didnâ€™t see him often but I fucking loved him. He died from being really old, I think they got him when I was 1 or something so he was almost blind, and was in pain constantly, they needed to give him injections everyday for the year I believe. Obviously I couldnâ€™t see them very much this year because of corona and my parents got into a big argument with them so we didnâ€™t really talk to them much either which my mom thinks is making it even harder for me, plus it got me thinking about my past 2 dogs, one who fell down the stairs trying to protect me from falling down them and one who jumped out the back of our truck on a freeway which then made me think about what if my current dog died which made me cry harder. I canâ€™t look at pictures of him without balling my eyes out. Iâ€™m trying to look at memes to overpower the sadness in my eyes but if you guys have better ideas they would be most appreciated
