I turn 16 in 12 days Idk why Iâ€™m posting this itâ€™s kinda an r/nobodyasked post but Iâ€™m just pretty happy. I will finally get a driver license and car. I will also be able to work which is one of the best gifts because I will have a source of income. I think it is completely fucking dumb that I get my paycheck taxed when I am under 18 but oh well thatâ€™s the bureaucracy for ya.
