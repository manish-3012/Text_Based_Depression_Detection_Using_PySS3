Classic movie 2 girl dilemma need advice So I broke up with my girlfriend after she lied and manipulated me for. Popularity I won't go into. Details but it was bad she told me my friends bullied her and I trusted her and she began ignoring me and began bitching about me. She then blamed me that I was insecure and her mail best friend was an issue and when I was right that he had feelings for her she blamed it on me and we broke up soon after that

I left her in late April but I still have feelings for her and I realised this yesterday I have been in another relationship for 3.weeks now and I am still in love with my older gf what should I do I don't speak very often to my current gf and. Don't want to hurt her please help me out.    




If any details are needed I'll add them
