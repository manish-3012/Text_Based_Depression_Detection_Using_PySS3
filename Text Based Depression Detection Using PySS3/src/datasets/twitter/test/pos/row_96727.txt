Can yâ€™all please stop upvoting these â€œI slept over at my crushâ€™s houseâ€ â€œMy crush said yesâ€ posts Please stop upvoting this shit it can only be one of 2 things

1 - theyâ€™re hopping on the bandwagon and itâ€™s obviously just karma whoring

2 - even if what the day is true, weâ€™re in the middle of a FUCKING PANDEMIC why are you sleeping over at someoneâ€™s house, this is why people are dying

Anyway thatâ€™s my rant please stop this shit
