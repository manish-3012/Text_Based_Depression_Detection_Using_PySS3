There is a high chance I could be Autistic. I really hope I am. Autism is something I've always had a vague understanding of, I didn't get the full picture until I met an autistic adult. She's like me, we share similar experiences and we understand eachother on a level no one else in my home could understand.
 
At first, I thought it was because of my ADD/ADHD, as both tend to have overlapping symptoms. It wasn't until yesterday I though about it. It started at school, I was thinking about my parents, their friends, and the way they talk to eachother. I recall the way I mimic them. And the confusion I always feel when they get after me for "having an attitude" when I just want to fit in.

Then at the store with my mom I started reflecting on my relationships. I have one irl friend I hang out and talk to regularly, the only other person I would consider a friend would be my teacher. I felt so pitiful, I used to have so many friends in middle school, people I could talk and laugh with. Then I started thinking more. None of thoes people were True friends. They were not people I would hang out with outside of school, all of us were friends because of circumstances. 

Now, I find it incredibly hard to find friends that will stay. I'm diffrent from other kids my age. I feel isolated. They're nice. But not my friends. We don't share any common interests, making it 10x harder to socialize.

That's when I started going more in depth into Autism. Specifically signs in teens. The more I read the more I realized. I checked out nearly every box. 

Narrow range of interestÂ or obsessions with certain topics
(For me this is Star Wars, TMNT, my oc's, and Norse Mythology)

Engage inÂ repetitive behavior
(I play with my hands and fingers when I'm not using them, pinky nail on bottom lip, "bring it around town")

Not making eye contact
(I make little eye contact, I look elsewhere when talking with someone.)

HaveÂ  difficulty with social interaction
(Stated above)

Does not understand emotion Â in others or themselves
(I have a hard time identifying how I feel)

Prefer to beÂ on their own

Avoid physical contact

Have unusual sleeping patterns 
(My sleep is very choppy, I wake up at least once in the middle of the night for no reason)

Use formal language rather than the slang of their peers
(The most slang I use is Y'all, other than that I tend to use more academic words when I speak)

Place great importance on routines and rules
(I will cry if something doesn't go on schedule)

Develop strong preferencesÂ for certain foods, clothes or objects
(I have every single stuffed animal I've ever had still, I have a yellow amd grey jacket I refuse to trash even though it's barely a jacket anymore)

Â·Gender dysphoria
(I am trans FTM)

Of course I'm going to get tested by a professional. I had a tearful conversation in the car on the way back home from the store with my mom about how lonely I felt and how I feel so diffrent. I genuinely think I am Autistic. I want to have the label so I can finally have a full understanding of myself. I just want to know that I'm not some socially inept fuck up.
