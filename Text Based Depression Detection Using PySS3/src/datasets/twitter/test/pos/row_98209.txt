How can I try and soundproof my room? I like to face time my friends or vc but Iâ€™ve got ridiculously thin walls meaning I canâ€™t say anything without being overheard by my religious nut case parents and siblings. 

Itâ€™s at the point where if I talk to a girl Iâ€™m giving in to the devil and if I talk about anything not suitable for 6 year olds im rude and out of line.

How can I make it so Iâ€™m not so easily overheard or am I just a lost cause?
