I'm looking for information about an old imported cashmere coat.  It's an old hand sown 100% cashmere coat with a label saying "Royal Rajah 100% Imported Cashmere Maurice L Rothschild &amp; co"

The label also has red stone on it and the coat looks beige but it's in great condition and has a silk looking inside of the same color. It seems similar to the kinds of coats my grandma used to inspect when she worked in a coat factory in her youth.

I've been trying to look for information about it but I can't find anything about it. if you can find anything about it please let me know.
