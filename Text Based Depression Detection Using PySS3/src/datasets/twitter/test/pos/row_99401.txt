Ugh I just need to rant a bit First of all, I donâ€™t like going on vacation, idk why, but it just makes me uncomfortable. I canâ€™t explain it. Iâ€™ve tried to be happy when weâ€™re on vacation for my familiesâ€™ sake, but itâ€™s hard.

Now, today, my mom was talking about going to north texas for my little sisterâ€™s cheer competition, and I asked, â€œdo I have to go, or can I just stay home?â€ And my mom said that there will be other stuff to do there, and I said that I just didnâ€™t want to go. Then my dad asked why I donâ€™t want to go. I said I donâ€™t like going on vacations, and he said well, why not? I said that I couldnâ€™t explain it and they start getting angry and saying stuff like, â€œwe save up all this money for you to go on vacation and now youâ€™re telling me you donâ€™t want to go on vacationâ€, which I understand the saving up part, but for the first time Iâ€™m expressing my opinion and youâ€™re yelling at me, whenever they ask me my opinion I usually just say â€œI donâ€™t knowâ€, and move on. So then my dad unexpectedly starts yelling at me, â€œYOU BETTER GET A BETTER ATTITUDE OR IM THROWING THAT VIDEOGAME SHIT AWAY!â€ So first of all, my parents are Christian and rarely ever swear, and if they do, then that means theyâ€™re really pissed. Second of all, Iâ€™m never playing video games for more than 3 hours because they donâ€™t let me, and then they blamed my moodiness on â€œcomputer screensâ€, well maybe my moodiness comes from yâ€™all being shitty and overprotective parents! Honestly Iâ€™m just so fucking pissed right now.
