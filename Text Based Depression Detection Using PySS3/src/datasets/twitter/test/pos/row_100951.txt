I HATE The 2020 &amp; 2021 Bad Memes EDIT: This was originally meant to be posted on r/unpopularopinion however they said my post was too similar to others so I decided to post my grievances here, sorry for the essay lol but hey if you're here, it's obviously to hear what I have to say so let's get into it.

\- 

To quote Roger Ebert (kind of) " I hated this meme, hated, hated, hated, hated this meme, HATED IT, hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it. ".

To explain what I mean by "2020 &amp; 2021 bad" I refer to all the memes out about how 2020 and 2021 were bad years and that's pretty much all the meme/joke is about. It's like "oh this bad thing happened" and that's funny somehow.

I guess it was funny a little at first like haha 2020 is the worst year ever but at this point it is quite possibly the most annoying thing on the planet to me &amp; I cannot be alone here.

Just to point out "hey this year hasn't been great so far and the year before it was bad and here's a bad thing that happened that makes this year bad" and think that's funny. Again maybe at first but that's all almost any meme or joke is now, it's all anyone talks about, I feel like AVGN in the sports games review "2020, 2020, 2020, 2020", it's all I hear.

And it's not only that, it's that these memes are probably not good for people mentally, I feel they probably create some anxiety, just to focus on the negative side of everything in the form of a joke still has to not be good for you right?

In any case these memes are so very annoying and have gone on for far, far too long, they aren't funny anymore, they're repetitive, annoying, have overstayed their welcome and should go die.

Also here's that fun clip of Roger Ebert I was quoting from: [Enjoy](https://youtu.be/982R2eAhL54?t=76)
