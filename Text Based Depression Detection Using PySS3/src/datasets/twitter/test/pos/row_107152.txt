Life is depressing sometimes Hello fellow redditors, im a long time lurker firsttime poster and i apologies ahead for any spelling mistakes.

Tonight was the most saddest moment in my entire life. cuurently 16 (male) and my life was going great, i started in a new school, made new friends and things were going great untill this day when my parents decided to get a divorce.  It hit my younger sister hard but me not so much becouse i kinda already new it would happen some day becouse they were not very close anymore. i could hold back my tears for so long so i went in my room and just cried my eyes out. I just dont know anything at the moment so ive decided to come here for any kind of advice or something like that becouse im absolutely lost atm.

I thank you for taking your time to read my little story and i hope that atleast your having a great day.

with much respect,

J
