I'm sorry, but how is this even legal!? A girl at my lunch table got the coronavirus but her grandmother, her legal guardian, decided that education was more important than her health and the health of others and is now forcing her to go back to school after only one week of quarantine AND THE SCHOOL IS LETTING HER COME BACK TO SCHOOL. MY SCHOOL SYSTEM MADE A KID QUARANTINE FOR TWO WEEKS AFTER HE GOT A TUMMY ACHE FROM NOT EATING BREAKFAST EVEN THOUGH THEY KNEW IT WASNT THE VIRUS, BUT A KID WITH THE VIRUS CAN GO BACK TO SCHOOL EVEN THOUGH SHE STILL HAS IT! WTF IS MY SCHOOL ON?
