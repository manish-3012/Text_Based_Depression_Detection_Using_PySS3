I need help pls. Iâ€™m seriously shit at crafting texts/ phrasing stuff so I need your help pls. My therapist said I should reach out to a friend in which the friendship ended abruptly for reasons unknown. He said I should reach out for closure first, and reconciliation second. The only issue is that Iâ€™m dog shit at doing stuff like that, and I wonâ€™t see my therapist to help me with this for a few weeks, and the timing is right rn. Help pls
