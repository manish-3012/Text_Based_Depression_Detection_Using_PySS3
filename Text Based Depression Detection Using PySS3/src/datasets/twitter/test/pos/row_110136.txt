Did comic book movies and TV make society more childish? I was not interested in anything set in space until I played "Mass Effect" after a friend bugged me to play it back in 2014. Before I knew it I devoured "BSG", "Babylon 5", "Firefly", and "Farscape" as well as The Expanse novels and Culture novels by Iain M. Banks. I wondered why the TV show producers stopped making shows like that. Why did we lose our sense of wonder for space?

When Syfy announced it was turning The Expanse novels into a series I was reserved but when the first episode dropped in November 2015 I was pleasantly surprised. This was the type of sci fi I remembered. I thought since it was so long TV watchers would be itching for a new space adventure and I thought it would have gotten at least 8 million viewers when in reality it got a little over 1 million during it's premiere episode on Syfy in December 2015.

Meanwhile shows like "Agents of Shield" can easily get at least 3 million viewers.
