Am I psychotic? I donâ€™t know what is wrong with my mind, earlier today I got exam results and was over the moon! I was so happy! My day was amazing.

Now itâ€™s like my brain has flipped a switch and gone back to being sad and crying again.

How does my mood change THAT quickly? I donâ€™t understand myself, anyone else feel similar?
