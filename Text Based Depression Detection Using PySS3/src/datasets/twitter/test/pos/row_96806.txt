I rickrolled my teacher I was bored and joined the Google meeting about 5 minutes early. About 25 students were already there. I sent the link for the YouTube video and could hear the song playing from the teacher's microphone.

After a couple of seconds he realized what had happened and chuckled saying "whoa I did fall for it".
