The perfect edu system Here's my idea what should the education system should be like:
You're going to primary school first 7 grades and there are only 2 grades: Good and bad. The subjects are: English, Math, Second language, ICT(without programming), PE, music, art and new subject named Our Environment(we will learn about ecology). Then in high school, there should be more schools and every is for something else(like ICT, English, History, Physics) when you'll be ready to go to college. In the first 2 years of high school you'll have subjects like: Geography, history, science, math, but not about cells and that bullshits, it will be about the basic things

What do you think?
