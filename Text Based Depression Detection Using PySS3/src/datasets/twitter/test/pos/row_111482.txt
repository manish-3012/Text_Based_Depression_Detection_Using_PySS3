Fuck this day already I had an outfit planned for today, but my parents kept yelling at me because it's not suitable for a rainy day, and they bugged me about it so much, I didn't change it because it was cute but after a while I gave up. Also today I have school from 8 a.m to 5p.m and only 1 hour of rest the whole day, so 8 hours of fucking school, and my body still hurts from the 2 hours of P.E 2 days ago. It's only 7:35 a.m and my day is already ruined
