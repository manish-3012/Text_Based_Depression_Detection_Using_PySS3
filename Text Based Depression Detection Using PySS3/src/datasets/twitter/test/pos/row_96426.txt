Having a rough time with my sleep schedule, anybody else been through something similar and has advice? This is my last week of Winter Holliday. Before that my sleep schedule was fine, when it started i would sleep at 2AM and wake up at 2pm. It then got worse i would sleep at 6am and wake up at 5pm etc.
This screwed my productivity, returned a lot of stress and caused extra unnecessary stress. Also i usually go out a lot every Holliday, this one i went out of the house three times which is completely abnormal for me.
I never worried about sleep as well before this if i got minimum sleep i would brush it off then easily fix my schedule later.
Also when i put alarms i always go into 5 more minutes mode then wake up a few hours later than iâ€™m supposed to.
