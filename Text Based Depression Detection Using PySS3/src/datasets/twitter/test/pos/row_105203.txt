Made a post asking if people could talk because Iâ€™m bored and got a dm from a guy asking if I could watch hentai with him on discord... This girls is why you never mention that you are a girl on r/teenagers.

Guys, if you want a girlâ€™s attention, donâ€™t be creepy and weird. Actually talk to us and be kind. 

If you excuse me, Iâ€™m gonna go check if the dude was over 18 and if so Iâ€™m reporting him.
