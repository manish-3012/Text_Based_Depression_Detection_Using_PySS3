My parents hate what I like Hi there guys just wondering if any of you have experienced this, my parents hate what I like (playing music and video games) My dad likes music but my stepmom hates it and they both hate video games because of quarantine its been hard to keep any friends since we moved and I have no way to keep in touch. Just wondering if any of you have experienced something similar?
