How CD Projekt ruined Cyberpunk without it even being released. Duke Nukem Forever. Sonic 06. Dreams. These are all examples of games that went through something called Development Hell. Duke Nukem Forever was announced in 1996 and was released in 2011. Sonic 06 got Sonic Team, the people working on it, divided and conflicting. Dreams, well I needed another example. Why do I mention these? Well, CD Projekt announced Cyberpunk 2077 7 years ago. During this time, the developers slacked and procrastinated. During this last year with the delays, they were rushing to finish the game. This is a similar thing to what happened with Sonic 06. Likely speaking, Cyberpunk will be a glitchy mess. Then there's overhyping. Waterworld and Halo 4 are some examples. There's been merch, the Keanu Reeves thing, the and the many hideous gaming chairs and energy drinks. People have been hyping up for 7 years for this. It will never live up to the hype because people have been waiting for it and getting excited for it for 7 years now. In conclusion, Cyberpunk won't be the game you expect, and I can say it even without playing it.
