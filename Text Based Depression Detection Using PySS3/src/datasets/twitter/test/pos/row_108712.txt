So last night I had this weird dream I was in my living room playing my DS and I just took a bite out of it I thought that it tasted good so I kept eating it and I was telling people that I had ate one before so it was fine eventually I ate the entire top screen and thats when I realized that I had just ate my only DS, and I started to cry because I grew up with that DS. And now that I'm awake I kind of wonder what my DS would taste like.
