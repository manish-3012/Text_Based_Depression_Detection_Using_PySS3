Should've run for the hills then honestly. A few days ago a now ex friend of mine told me that she was drunk at our graduation ceremony. That's pretty damn fucked ngl. If anyone else had said that I'd have turned heel and ran the fuck away lol. I was obsessed with her until just yesterday and last night though, so I didn't. I should've ran then.
