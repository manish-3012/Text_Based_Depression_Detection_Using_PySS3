Iâ€™d rather date crush A but Iâ€™d rather have sex with Crush B. Who should I flirt with? I (F) am friends with with a girl (Crush A) at my school and I really like her. Iâ€™ve been flirting with her for a while and I think weâ€™re hitting it off. (donâ€™t worry I havenâ€™t fallen for a straight girl, sheâ€™s also bisexual).

Last night tho, I was messaging a friend and he was being kinda flirty and I flirted back, and I finally realized I want to f*ck him (hence, he is Crush B). But I donâ€™t really want a relationship with him, and I definitely would want a relationship with Crush A.

Should I keep flirting with both at the same time? I *was* planning on asking Crush A out as soon as I saw her again at school, but now Iâ€™m honestly not sure.
