Yâ€™all Iâ€™m feeling really down right now Thereâ€™s a girl. Iâ€™ve loved her since I was in 6th grade (Iâ€™m a freshman). I thought I had gotten over her in the past year or so but once school started back up I fell in love again. Iâ€™m just an old fool layin in bed, listenin to sad country songs, and I just wanna get wasted and forget it all. I just donâ€™t want to feel anymore, and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m gonna sleep tonight. 

So Sophia, if youâ€™re seeing this, I love you and, as Midland so beautifully put it, Lonely For You Only.
