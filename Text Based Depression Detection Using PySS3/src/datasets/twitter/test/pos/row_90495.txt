The best metaphor for my love life is me in my 7th grade school play It was the play into the woods jr. 

Specifically the part where the song "It takes two" Was being sung. 

It's a love song with the Baker (protagonist) and his wife 

I was the cow. Standing there during the song holding a cow head prop
