My mother thinks shooting games make you a violent person "Are those the games you want to play? Is that who you really wanna be? Would you like to tell your grandparents and the pastor at church that you play games that encourage violence? This game make you want to kill people, and this doesn't bother you?"

Edit: I was playing bullet force. thats like the lowest of violent shooting games AAAAHHHH
