[serious] Depression is making my school work nearly impossible I feel so lazy and useless, but I genuinely am just finding myself wanting to give up on my assignments. I have a history essay due in like 3 days, and I have pretty much not even started researching. I'm so behind, and honestly I don't care I just don't want to do it at all. Genuinely, the thought of starting it makes me feel sick and I just can't even bring myself to do it. Not to mention I have other assignments also due soon. If I don't do the assignments I'm gonna get in trouble, but I feel like trying to do them will just make me feel even worse.

I've seen a school counsellor, I've talked to my parents, I've seen a psychologist. All of them have talked to me and given me advice on how to handle stuff, but I just don't even act on any of it. It doesn't matter what they tell me because I just don't end up doing it. What the fuck do i even do
