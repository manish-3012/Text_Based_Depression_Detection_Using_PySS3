You ever just feel so god damn bored with people you talk to Like I talk to my family and the same 3 people on an Xbox party every single day and it gets so fucking boring. Iâ€™m not depressed, I never am, but it just feels lonely, ya know? Honestly I canâ€™t wait for in person school and to be able to go outside and talk to people without having health risks everywhere you look. Just wish I had more people to talk to
