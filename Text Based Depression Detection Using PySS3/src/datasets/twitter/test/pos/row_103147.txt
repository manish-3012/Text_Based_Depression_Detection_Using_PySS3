I need someone to talk. So recently i feel like even tho 2020 was a bad year the end/begging of 2021 got worse. So i really don't get bothered mostly by what other people say about me but i have 1 huge insecurity. I always have that feeling that my friends don't like me or they only hang out with me to be nice.
No mather what i can't shake this feeling off and what recently happened really did mess me up.
So i started going to a new school and i felt like i got along pretty well. Things were going well and i started feeling like i had good friends who cared about me so 1 day i messaged them if they wanted to hang out. The message was seen and nobody responded (i live pretty far away from them so i rarely get the chance to hang out with them) later that day i get (i think accidentally) a photo of them hanging out. How did your year start tho?
