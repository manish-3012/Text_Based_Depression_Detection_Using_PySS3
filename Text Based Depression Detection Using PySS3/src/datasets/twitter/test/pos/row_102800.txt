i think my abusive ex yelled something at me while he was driving off from when we took the SAT but i dont know what he said and now im freaking out he and his brother are absolute douchebags so i wouldnt be surprised if it was them. they yelled something out the window and iâ€™m thinking it was directed at me because the fuckers mad that i asked for closure a lot and got upset when being ghosted. dude gaslighted me constantly and the car didnt look that familiar though and i didnt rly recognize the voice but who knows. the dudes always trying to get to me and i just hate it. 

dont know what to do because i dont like it when people talk shit about me but i also dont wanna give him satisfaction and attention. but its gonna eat away at me if i dont do something. hate it here. ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
