Could I have some words of encouragement? Right now I'm going through a tough patch in my life and I'm glad I have my girlfriend to help me out but now we aren't even allowed to date cus her parents are blaming stuff they did on me, we're still together but we have to talk in secret, which really sucks, I was wondering if I could have some words of encouragement
