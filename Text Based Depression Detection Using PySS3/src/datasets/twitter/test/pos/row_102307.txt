Reddit, please stop. I keep getting adds for dating websites when 
1. Iâ€™m not even 18 yet, so Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m not allowed on most of those anyway, and
2. I already have a girlfriend!
My only hope is to post this and maybe Redditâ€™s even the slightest bit like Facebook so the robots or spies will see this and stop giving me those adds! Theyâ€™re getting on my nerves!
Thank you all for your time.
