Crush on the lonely weird quiet boy Ok I'm 15F and at school you mostly do everything with your class (we're with like 10). There's no group projects, extracurriculars and also he is only at school like two days a week. People before me have tried to have him come sit with us and literally everyone is nice here so everybody talks to everybody if they want to. Forgot to say people here are extremely introverted though. Most are opening up now but he isn't in the slightest and I just want to move on with my life. Never talked to him, probably never will, no idea what his personality is like and all that, we all want to be friends with him very badly cos he has great vibes but he just keeps to himself all the time and if anyone asks him something he'll just shake his head or something. He's most definitely on reddit though no way he isn't lmao

what do I do help me
