So theres this annoying kid at school Hes talked shit to me for about 3 years but is too scared to fight me every time I've went to his house hes made an excuse. A couple weeks ago I started to catch feeling for a girl (also my best friend) for the second time and that's his best friend. I asked her out and she said no I didnt take it the wrong way I get it

Fast forward a couple days and apparently he asked her out while I was outta state. I was pissed and expressed that to him and thought that I would care in any way if he "leaked" my conversation with her or him I'm not really sure. 

So I came back to school and I'm still a little mad and its whatever but then he starts his shit and we start going back and forth. He ends up flexing that he pulled the girl. This week she tells me they broke up I didnt care at the time then I thought about it and he was trying to flex a WEEK with her. She broke up with him 

He uses reddit and if u see this FUCK YOU
