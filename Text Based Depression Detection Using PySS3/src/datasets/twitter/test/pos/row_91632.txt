Do any other girls feel like they fit in better with boy friend groups? Iâ€™m a tomboy I guess. I swim competitive, and I do lots of stem projects. Most girls really arenâ€™t like this and despite flipping between a couple friend groups, I donâ€™t really fit in. I donâ€™t really have a lot of friends, because I was new to the dictrict this year and no one was really welcoming. Iâ€™m lonely, and need friends. But I donâ€™t have any. I just sit in my room listing to DCFC crying about my mental disorder and how shitty my life is. But when we do group projects and things like that or free play activities in stem class, Iâ€™m usually doing it with boys and itâ€™s so much more fun. I can be myself, and they donâ€™t judge me or care that Iâ€™m severely overweight. But with girls I feel the need to hide my disorder and I feel out of place.
