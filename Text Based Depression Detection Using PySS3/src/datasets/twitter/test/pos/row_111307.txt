I feel bad now I feel bad because I broke up with my girlfriend a couple days ago, but I said that I just wanted to be friends, and that I didn't want to stop hanging out with her. I just didn't feel like me and her didnt have enough in common, and she kept saying that she wouldn't feel bad if I wanted to just be friends. But she didn't keep that promise and ended getting upset over a relationship that lasted for a little less then a week. Idk I guess I just feel bad about doing it around valentines day, and I just thought we would be better off being friends.
