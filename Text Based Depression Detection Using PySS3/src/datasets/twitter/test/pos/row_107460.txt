Apparently nobody relates to me I wish I never came out, stupid *redacted name* why did I do that. Iâ€™m so impulsive, I could have stayed in there happy with my secret. Now they know everything about me.

Apparently people donâ€™t think itâ€™s valid to complain but thatâ€™s the lgbtq community for you. They say theyâ€™re inclusive but they arenâ€™t. Full of communist idiots, bi girls hating men, canâ€™t be even slightly right leaning. 

Some of them make us look like idiots. Iâ€™m not a snowflake, I donâ€™t care if youâ€™re homophobic, just keep it to yourself and donâ€™t stop me from having rights. I literally donâ€™t care if you disagree with gay marriage, maybe if youâ€™re my parents or something idk. The lgbtq community made me think I have to be offended by everything when I donâ€™t. Thereâ€™s a genocide going on, thereâ€™s gay people getting killed in Muslim countries, why should I care if a celebrity doesnâ€™t like gays. I know most of the lgbtq community is fine but sometimes the idiots get on my nerves. Maybe I am privileged for coming out doesnâ€™t mean I canâ€™t be upset that I came out.
