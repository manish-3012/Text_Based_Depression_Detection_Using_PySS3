Guys is covid-19 as serious as people say it is? Like I'm still not going to attend parties or not wear a mask but most of this covid shit is propaganda right? I mean 3,000 people die from car accidents every day and nobody is talking about them.. 2 friends caught covid and they just had a fever for a few days and went back to normal.  


From how I see it if you have an autoimmune disease, are unhealthy, fat, smoke, or are old then you should be careful but if you're younger than 20 and healthy I think your body will just fight it off like any other virus right? Or am I wrong?
