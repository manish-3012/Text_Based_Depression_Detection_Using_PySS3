but with this acceptance, I've also been cursed with fear, fear that I might hurt them despite the fact they arent even real, yet this fear seems to torment me, what should I do?

A: denounce my bisexuality and be straight again

B: suffer in fear forever

or C: abandon ship (abandon ship = life end)
