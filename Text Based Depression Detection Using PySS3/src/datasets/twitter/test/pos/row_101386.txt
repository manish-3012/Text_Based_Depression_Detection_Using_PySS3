Why are my parents so fucking unreasonable?? Sorry for shit formatting im on mobile

Basically my home is a super horrible place to study in and I also have a super garbage attention span, coupled with the fact I have a super important exam this year (basically decides my life) and its a train wreck. I usually need a quiet conducive enviroment (I used to study at my tuition center but COVID meant that I can't go there). I want to go to library to study for long extended  period of time (like 6 hours at a time) doing tests but for some really stupid reason my parents decide to be like "oh you shouldnt go to library just study at home" like ffs I LITERALLY CANT. I've tried to explain it to her many many times but it always ends with "i am your mother listen to me"

Like ??? it doesn't matter that you're my mother I HAVE TO STUDY and home isnt a condusive enviroment for me so OF COURSE I HAVE TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE. Is that illogical??
Of course it isn't. This exam is super important to me and I want to do well but obviously I can't do my best because "hurr durr study in a place where the TV is constantly blasting and I can't concentrate."

Its really fucking infuriating especially since even when I can she wants me to only study for like 2 hours (literally not enough) and come home early because I have school the next day (mind you if I go home at 9pm I can easily sleep at 10 because I wouldve had a productive 6-7 hours to do my work and study) but when I don't go to the library I end up sleeping at 1-2am because I can't focus

Its really stupid especially since I've tried explaining it to my mom many times but she won't listen 

Ok thanks for coming to my ted talk lol
