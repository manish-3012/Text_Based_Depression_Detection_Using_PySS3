Tell Me We'll Be Okay (Tell Me Your Okay) The nostalgia hits me the most at night. When the darkness of my room is the only witness to my thoughts and music makes emotions a bit easier. 

I miss them. Or perhaps I miss past me.

I miss our tight-knit group that was just misfit kids with nerdy interests. I miss the way I never needed to fill the silence or how there was no judgment when sharing something. 

I miss a shy smile and black locks. 

I miss a pair of big eyes and brow curls. 

But I know I'm longing for past selves who don't exist anymore. Simple memories that always make want to build a time machine. 

We grew apart--it was bound to happen, right? 

~~Or... at least that's what I keep telling myself.~~ 

It is with all my heart that I hope you guys are good. That life hasn't been too harsh on you. Perhaps you may think of me as cold, I wouldn't blame you, but please know that I still do care about the both of you. 

~~Please.~~ 

â˜ï¸ 

I'm sorry for being such a fucking coward and never telling you guys this. Or even giving you both a proper goodbye. 

Forgive my strange ways and me. Life is cruel... I'm cruel. And for both of those things I am sorry. Perhaps my words always felt empty, but I hope that my actions were never that. 

â˜ï¸ 

These tears leave the taste of the ocean on my lips, and my vision blurs. 

I hear your voices when I feel too old. 

~~I shouldn't feel so old and weary of life when my body is still so young.~~ 

It's pathetic how the memories we made make me tear up. I'm so used to feeling so empty nowadays. 

~~Do you guys feel it too? I hope you don't. You both don't deserve that.~~ 

I'm not one to pray to God, but fucking shit do I do pray for you both. A silent request (demand) to that ever absent being to make your lives a bit less bleak. 

â˜ï¸ 

Thank you both, all the same, for giving me bittersweet memories I can store away. 

Thank you both for laughter and friendship. 

Thank you for a little piece of heaven on hell. Even if it was bound to be temporary. 

Most importantly, thank you for tears that remind me I'm still here. That I'm still--somehow--human.
