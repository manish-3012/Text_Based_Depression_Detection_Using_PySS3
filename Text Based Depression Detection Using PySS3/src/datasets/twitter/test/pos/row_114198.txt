So I recently became Vegan... I hate it. Dear Reddit,

Recently, ~~I~~

~~my parents~~

My mom basically became a vegan. God damn its already happening. For reasons I cannot mentally disclose, she just started watching crack heads explain health benefits of crack. Now, I donâ€™t have a problem really with vegans. You do your lifestyle and I'll do mine. I can't love what you love and you donâ€™t love what I love. Just do you, but donâ€™t do it around me. Ok yada yada. I donâ€™t like eating what vegans eat. I think eating chlorophyll for the last week is driving me crazy. Like bitch I'm not a tree.

Anyway Iâ€™m 16, so I can't leave out on my own yet. So, I plan on killing my mom and eating her flesh. I am writing this so when you see me on Twisted Minds, First 48, and Fox News so you can have some back story. Now Iâ€™m not sure the method killing Iâ€™ll use but there is a 90% chance we were home alone I just chopped her. Now wait, she made you eat broccoli and u want to eat her flesh, isn't that a bit far? Now let me ask you this? Imagine eating actually food for like the first 16 years of your life and then you have to eat the bush summoned from the deepest part of the amazon rain forest where the plants themselves do not even use the same air as animals. You wouldnâ€™t be the happiest person would you. â€œI get that but, your killing ur mom over kidney beans...â€. Actually, I think I got the irrational thinking from her. Picture this, you came from the store, 200 dollars' worth of groceries. 5 mins later you recommended a video by the cringiest youtuber for the FIRST time then you fucking yeet everything that was within 6 feet of anything that ever fucking blinked in the fucking trash can. My dad is simp. He is/was a pescatarian, and he fucking assisted her in her fucking madness. He only ate fish, now he is eating fucking leaves. If thatâ€™s not a simp I donâ€™t know what is. This type of shit happens to a kid named toby who lives in Wisconsin.

It's partly my fault though. She started cooking some vegan food and she was like the best cook apart from me, but I donâ€™t like to make a whole meal, excuse me, an entre for like entire the village of people who occupy my house. She was like here is tofu. I should have picked that shit up right there. Name two people you know who eats fucking tofu. She was like how does it taste. It's my mom, I love, used to love my mom. It doesnâ€™t have a fucking flavor. I forgot I fucking ate it. To this day Iâ€™m waiting for the fucking chlorophyll to interact with my taste buds. That was the hardest I have ever lied my life.Â 

Morale of the story, if you like something, that doesnâ€™t mean you have to force it on people who you know without consent. Thatâ€™s taste rape. Just wait, you could have waited like 2 years, patience is key. Iâ€™ll remember that when Iâ€™m in the mental institute for the next 64 years.

At least theyâ€™ll have a variety of foods.

On a side note: How the to cook human flesh, like do I just season it or like, you know never mind Iâ€™ll just find out,

Tl;dr My parents have spasmodically quit regular food and went for an extreme vegan diet, which I am  heavily opposed to, but they say "I learn to like it" so I plan on doing a Jeffery Dahmer.
