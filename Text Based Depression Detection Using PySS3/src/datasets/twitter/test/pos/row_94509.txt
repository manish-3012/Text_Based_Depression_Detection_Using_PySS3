We had a substitute teacher once making us read aloud and one kid got picked and pretended he didn't know how to read. "T t t the fr French wa war wo woo woould"

Everyone would laugh at him but the teacher kept scolding us saying he had students who were dyslexic and should be better mannered that we are making him read.

Props to the reader too cause he managed to keep a straight face still reading all wierd while we giggled nonstopped and the sub kept stone facing us
