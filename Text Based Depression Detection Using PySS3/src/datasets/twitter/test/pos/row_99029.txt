How to apply for university I graduated last year September and have no idea how to apply to universities. I was never thought on how to check for universities rather my school focused in the gifted students. I have no idea how to go about it.
I am currently taking a level courses. Planning on doing AS alone. I would like to study abroad but dont have much funds so would need some form of financial assistance. I live in west Africa and we have WASSC Exams and I did pretty alright. 
I was thinking of going for a Biomedical Engineering course but I just feel so lost and dont know what to do.
Any advice or responses I'll be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.
