Help, a random thot on the internet sent me nudes! I just....
I donâ€™t get it...
Recently I received a invite to a chat on Reddit. She added one more person but he bailed before I even noticed the notification. I see why now. She literally sent a link to a video on tumblr of her naked and was trying to be Seductive. 
Iâ€™ve never shared any personal information on the internet so naturally I was VERY concerned  about how she thought that was okay. 

I am a 15 y/o female (A FUCKING MINOR) and this lady who is AT LEAST in her late twenties sent me nudes. Iâ€™m incredibly uncomfortable and weirded out. I donâ€™t know what to do.
