How to make friends at a new school where everyone already knows each other I am so close to dropping out, no one talks to me at the new school and i hate going here. I guess itâ€™s also my fault for not trying to make friends but its so extremely difficult, my teachers havenâ€™t even introduced me or given me a desk so i just awkwardly stand there until everyone is seated looking for an empty desk. I always just sit alone
