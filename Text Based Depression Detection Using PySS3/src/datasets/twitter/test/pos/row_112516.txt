Explaining my meme So I new this kid who was starting to do music. At the time I had just put out a song after about 2 years give or take. anyway, I do 4 songs with the kid for his album. He promised to pay me back in August. Then August came around. He said October. At this point Iâ€™m pissed because I was supposed to be paid by now, a bunch of his friends mention that he did this with another guy. I call him up and he says I donâ€™t deserve the money after trying to get paid for the services I did..

Months go by he sends me a voice message on Instagram (Iâ€™m boxing his friend) saying that if I beat his friend then heâ€™s coming for me

*end of anime so far*

Iâ€™m gonna put the audio in here too
