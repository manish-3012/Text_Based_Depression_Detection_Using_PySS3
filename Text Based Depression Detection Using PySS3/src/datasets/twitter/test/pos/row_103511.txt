Okay- letâ€™s say that cuties is a film against the sexualization of young girls I see this argument brought up a lot, but Iâ€™ll just say this: they were still sexualized in the making of the film. If you want to make a movie with murder in it- no one is actually murdered. But when you make a film about this- the sexualization remains (even if that was not the original intention) 


Iâ€™m just sick of people defending this shit tbh
