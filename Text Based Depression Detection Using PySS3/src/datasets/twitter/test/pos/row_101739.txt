well it was bound to happen at some point due to Americas inability to handle this pandemic right my school is going back to online learning. Going to school physically was huge for me especially since this school was one of the biggest I had ever been to since this one wasn't for mentally challenged kids (no joke I was born with aspergers and adhd and had to go to schools for autistic kids). In three days I will be back to online learning but at least they are saying school will return physically in January. During my time there I didn't really make any friends I just kept to myself and sat alone at lunch but now I must make these 3 days count because I only got 3 days for most men no time at all I am not most men I am an aspie I have the resources the will to make these hours count. I will sit with some cute girls I will make new friends I don't care if they think I'm weird or try to be my fake friends out of pity or if I get awkward I will make these final three days count! Wish me luck ladies and gentlemen

also now will be one of my final chances to wear my ahegao hoodie to school. Planning to do it on the final day lol
