** my parents donâ€™t let me play fortnite cause *its too violent*. I think thatâ€™s rediculous cause they let me play other games. But just letting ya know thatâ€™s off the table. Also I donâ€™t have Minecraft but *might be getting it if my parents let me. Send a request on discord if your interested. If youâ€™re quick we can play some tonight but I get off in 47 minutes.
