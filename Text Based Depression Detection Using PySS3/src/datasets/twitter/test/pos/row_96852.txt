New Day, New Start, Same Focus (62) Today is a New Day. Happy Sunday. Wishing you all a Sunday filled with Growth, Happiness, Peace, Health and Safety, during these times. It can be very tough at moments but as well filled with joy through those hardships. Everyday is unique, everyday is different; but we all hold onto baggage from yesterday, last week, last month, last year; we must let go.

  
We are stopping ourselves from progressing, from growth, from happiness and peace. It isn't anyone else's responsibility, it is solely our own. 2020 has been filled with everything, as well as the unexpected. It has been filled with happiness, growth, sadness, pain, hardships, weaknesses, insecurities, breaking barriers/comfort zones, facing fears, acknowledging self, accepting self, embracing self, sharing, care, support, self love, divine connection and releasing the need for expectations from others. We are still learning. We are Always Learning. I read this quote sometime ago and it said "they who know everything, know nothing at all", here, I am, I know really nothing and I am so ready to learn more.

  
I learned this year that its ok to be vulnerable, to share vulnerabilities, because realistically we **ALL** have something, that we are dealing with. We **ALL** have things that make us panic, feel anxious and sometimes even ashamed, but, **THIS** is who we are and we can learn to change with whatever it may be we currently don't like, by accepting, embracing and **MAKING it OURS**, then the healing and growth will come. I believe that we CAN achieve ourselves, together, separately. It takes time. It all comes through day to day practice that allows us to be present, to pause from life, to give time for ourselves, love for ourselves and take a second back and say "**WOW, I REALLY DID THAT**" and then move forward. With the year on the rise of wrapping up, don't wait until the switch of the calendar to **START** your next thing, **NO, START NOW, Right Now.** Take one step today, another tomorrow, another the day after that and so on. I believe in you. I believe in Us.

  
I love you.
