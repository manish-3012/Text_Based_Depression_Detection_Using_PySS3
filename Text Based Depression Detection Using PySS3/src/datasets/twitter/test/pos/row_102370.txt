I Never Get to say Goodbye I really don't know how to start this post.

Two people very close to me just died I have so many regrets, and if I knew when it would have happened I only would have changed one thing, saying goodbye.

My cousin died in a car crash when he was only ten he had his whole life ahead of him, my dad didn't even attend the funeral, but even my old teachers came (we went to the same school) but thats a different chapter in my life.

My grandma passed at only 60, she was the most wholesome person I knew and she constantly tried to make people happy. Due to the quarantine i couldn't see her in the hospital.

I miss them, but due to recent events I have taken a bit of a different outake on life; I am less sad that they died, and more happy that they lived and died good people.

I know they knew I wanted to see them again, but I can't help but feel a little guilty.

Thank you for reading this, I feel like I have matured a bit.
