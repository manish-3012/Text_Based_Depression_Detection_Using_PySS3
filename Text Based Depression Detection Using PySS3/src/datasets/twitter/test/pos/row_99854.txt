I fucking have to wear the mask at school while seated My classmates and I are all distant to eachother and making us put masks on makes no fucking sense. I have to wear it for 6 hours straight and I'm suffocating in it!

And guess what my school is the only one doing it in all the country because I have an idiot principal. And the principal couldn't decide this by law as well.

I'm starting a fucking protest
