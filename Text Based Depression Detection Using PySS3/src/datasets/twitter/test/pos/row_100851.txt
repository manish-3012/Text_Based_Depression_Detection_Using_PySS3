Online classes are so weary 
so tired of everything

online classes are so depressing 

not being able to go out like we used to is so depressing 

putting a hold on my hobbies/stress relievers bc of this pandemic is depressing 

being with my family (+ their problems) is the most depressing 

I understand I shouldnâ€™t be complaining bc we have no choice but to adjust. 

Iâ€™ve done pretty much everything, got new hobbies, got into working out, cooking but is it possible to be tired of all that too? I thought I was doing okay until recently. Not really looking for advice, just wanting to share experiences.
