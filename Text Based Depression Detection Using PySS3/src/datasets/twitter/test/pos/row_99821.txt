This might not make sense but I needed to rant, sorry Iâ€™m freaking the fuck out rn. Everythingâ€™s a fucking mess. Iâ€™m so fucking messed up, I need help. But Iâ€™m too scared to get actual help. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I canâ€™t take it. I canâ€™t take the fucking fear and sadness. All the time. Thatâ€™s all I ever fucking feel. I hate bothering my friends but irdk what to do. Iâ€™m thinking about doing it, but im too scared so I probably wonâ€™t but I really really wish I could do it. I donâ€™t know what I did to deserve this. Lifeâ€™s too fucking hard to deal with. Iâ€™ve gone through enough. Nothing even that bad. Iâ€™m just a baby. Everyone i know irl is happy. Why canâ€™t I fucking be? 

I hope to god nobody I know (not irl) sees this.

Also ps Iâ€™m not going to actually do it. And if you donâ€™t know what â€œitâ€ is, thatâ€™s not my problem.
