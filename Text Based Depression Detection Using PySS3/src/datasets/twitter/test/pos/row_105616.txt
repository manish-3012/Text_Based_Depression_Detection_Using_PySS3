I didn't realize how stupid people can be on the road are until I started driving I got my liscense last week and today I had an incident where I WAS IN THE RIGHT BUT ALMOST GOT HIT. First of all, fun fact if your in a turn lane and on one side of double yellow lines, you cannot merge back into traffic. BUT SOME BITCH IN AN SUV REALLY TRIED IT TODAY AND DIDN'T EVEN USE A BLINKER, SHE JUST STARTED COMING OVER INTO MY LANE!!!


I just wanted to be nice and get my family ice cream and then I almost get into an accident smfh.
