Weird thing happens to me today Ok so I was playing counter-strike:global offensive and after the match someone adds me on steam and then starts a voice chat w/ me he then calls me a gamer and a trooper for playing the game with such low specs. I guess he looked at my profile bio which has my specs. Idk kinda weird I mean my specs arenâ€™t that bad right? My pc is only 4 years old. It runs cs:go at a crisp 720p at a buttery smooth 12-22 FPS with minor drop offs whenever people shoot me
