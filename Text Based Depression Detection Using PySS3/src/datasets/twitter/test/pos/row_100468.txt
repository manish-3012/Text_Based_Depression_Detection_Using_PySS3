I missed my first class So I go to a boarding school and the campus is really fucking big so the classes are spread out really far, anyway I thought it was Tuesday when it was in fact Wednesday and I went to the wrong class, it was a PE class so I had exercise clothes on, anyway 15 minute into the class I realize Iâ€™m in the wrong place, but my boarding house is a 5 minute walk away, and I donâ€™t even know the location of my actual class, so by the time I get back to my room, change into my regular uniform, and find out where the class is, the class is fucking over
