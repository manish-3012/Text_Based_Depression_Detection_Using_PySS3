Before the memes start rolling around, let's just give the people who lost their lives during 9/11 a moment of silence. Although it has been 19 years since the aftermath of 9/11, casualties aren't funny. Families may have visited their graves of what was left of them. Many aren't able to do that, there are still approximately 9 thousand missing people since their DNA might have burnt off in the fire. Or there aren't enough pieces for a proper burial.

No one in my immediate family was lost during 9/11, I just like to give my condolences.
