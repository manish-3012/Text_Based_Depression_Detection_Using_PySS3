Do you think this is a reaction on my part I talk to my friends and heâ€™s saying like hey come over to my house with a couple others.

I sort of have changed quite a bit (clique) since high school and maybe that has changed the way I react.

Anyways I jokingly said why didnâ€™t you invite â€˜xâ€™ you know how much I would have liked to have seen him. Note I hate â€˜xâ€™

He said to me the way youâ€™re going youâ€™re not gonna get food 

I said this:

Why is my reaction always confrontational to begin with. You know I donâ€™t have to go right lol? If youâ€™re gonna be a dick I wonâ€™t go



Partly cuz if Iâ€™m honest Iâ€™d probably rather not go so Iâ€™m fine if he says donâ€™t
