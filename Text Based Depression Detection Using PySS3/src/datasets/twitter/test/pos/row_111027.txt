people on reddit love making up gay people to be mad at remember when that "gay people i respect/dont respect" meme was like makin its rounds again

and how people r like "it's ok if people are gay. just as long as they dont shove it in my face â¤ï¸" aka "go back in the closet". coz even tho the vast majority of people cant go a day without seeing multiple expressions of heterosexuality on here, in public, in other forms of media etc. and their lives are constantly affected by heteronormativity theyre just making being gay their only personality trait if they talk about it sometimes. yeah

anyway im goin to the store what yall want
