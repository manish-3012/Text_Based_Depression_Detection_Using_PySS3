Telling jokes until corona is gone day 224 I was walking through a quarryâ€¦I said to the foreman, "That sure is a big rock!"
"Boulder," he corrected me. So I stuck out my chest and shouted, **"THAT SURE IS A BIG ROCK!!"**


Edit: Thanks for making this my top post of all time. And for the ppl who donâ€™t understand, the dude thinks the foreman said â€œbolderâ€ and he shouted.


Edit 2: Made it bold.
