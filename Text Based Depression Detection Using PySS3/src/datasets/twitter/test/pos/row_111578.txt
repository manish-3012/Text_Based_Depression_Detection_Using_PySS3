My dog died tonight This is an update to the previous post

She was getting spayed and there were complications. I guess she went into shock and her blood wouldnâ€™t clot. Nothing would work. The only way to help her wouldâ€™ve been to Ok pay 10+ thousand dollars for her to go through months of pain and not even guarantee that sheâ€™d live. We had to put her down.

I donâ€™t understand. She was only a year old. The vet told us they did tons of these simple procedures every day and that she would be fine. She was only a year old
