Bruh how tf do I stop rambling Every time someone asks me something or initiates a convo I either can't talk or ramble excessively for 5 minutes. And then I ramble about how I have a problem with rambling

I literally can't end things in 1 or 2 sentences. This is affecting my social life greatly, and it even happens on reddit. I somehow end up with a wall of text that no one bothers reading it. I want to know how to control this shit
