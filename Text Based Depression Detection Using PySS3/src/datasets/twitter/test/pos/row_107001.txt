Advice on Getting Rid of and Internet Pedo Iâ€™m currently on a platform called Quora.  This older dude keeps messaging me.  It used to be kinda harmless, just him asking how I was, if Iâ€™d eaten, but recently itâ€™s gotten super creepy.  Iâ€™m a trans dude, I was born female, realized who I was only after Iâ€™d made a Reddit account, and I only recently changed my name and details on quora.  Iâ€™m trying to think of a clever way to scare off this creep, instead of just blocking him.  Any advice?
