Developing a relationship with the process.  All change starts in infancy 

If I wanted to learn how to grind on a rail with a skateboard ðŸ›¹ 

I canâ€™t expect myself to do that if I have never stepped on a skateboard before. 

But that does not mean I am bad at skateboarding it just means I have not put in the time to understand the process of skateboarding ðŸ›¹ ALL CHANGE STARTS IN INFANCY. 

If I put the time in to learn how to get on a board and become comfortable moving on flat ground then I can build up the confidence to Ollie 

Once I have familiarized myself with the process of an Ollie and movement I can approach the rail with more confidence 

Over time of me showing up to the plate and trying to familiarize myself with the process of movement and properly Ollie to getting the skateboard on the rail 

I will learn to grind on a rail with my skateboard ðŸ›¹ 


Be patient, count your mini victories, showing up to the plate and trying to act on skatbeboarding is a win:) all change starts in infancy and everything we learn we learn by developing a relationship with the process over linear time:) 

Donâ€™t be hard on yourself. 

Base your success showing up to the plate and trying. 

KEEP TRYING!!!!!
