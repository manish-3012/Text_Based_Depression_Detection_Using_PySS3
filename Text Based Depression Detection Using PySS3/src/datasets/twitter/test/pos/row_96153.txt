Iâ€™m finally telling my parents about my mental state The things is that Iâ€™ve been feeling depressed 
(I just want to clarify that I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m suffering from depression or something else I have just talked about this with a friend but he isnt a professional who can tell me what Iâ€™m suffering) anyways Iâ€™ve feel depressed since 2018 but in 2019 things got worse because I started having suicidal thoughts that year I even pointed a gun to my head trying to do something that I didnâ€™t had the balls to do. Then in March of this year I tried killing my self by drinking a bunch of pills but the thing is that I only felt dizzy had I big headache and I was very hungry, after that I kept having those thoughts and I stopped feeling sad I just felt numb without emotions, without energy. But yesterday I talked to my friend about how I felt and he convinced me to talk it with my parents, He is actually going to help me to talking to them because I donâ€™t know if can do it by myself.
Iâ€™m planning to tell them this weekend I really hope they donâ€™t get mad at me 

By the way sorry if I have some grammatical errors English is not my first language
