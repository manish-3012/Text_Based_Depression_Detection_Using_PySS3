guess iâ€™m gonna get my first missing assignment :c god iâ€™m so overwhelmed with this one assignment for music class. itâ€™s this rhythm thing and I just canâ€™t do it for some reason. iâ€™ve been working on recording myself from 4:05 to 6:06 and kept messing up. i just finally had a kinda good recording JUST TO HAVE IT DELETED NOW I HAVE TO REDO EVERYTHING AND JUST UGGGHHH i had to cry at that moment because i donâ€™t have any more time to work on this assignment and that means iâ€™m gonna have to do it all over again tomorrow but it due tonight. so now iâ€™m gonna get my first missing assignment. i seriously donâ€™t like that class. i was planning on quitting the violin and was going to tell my parents during summer break one weekend but then then they held a surprise party for me. i was ok iâ€™ll tell them after we are done. but one of their friends gifted me a new violin. i didnâ€™t know how tell tell my parents at that moment that i didnâ€™t want to play the violin anymore and that i would cancel my music class and do photography but i knew my dad would get extremely mad at me and something else. now iâ€™m stuck with music for this year. now i really just want to punch something or someone and scream from anger and sadness. sorry for this rant and for any grammatical errors :] have a good day or night
