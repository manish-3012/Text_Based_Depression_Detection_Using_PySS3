My mom is applying my younger brother for the same job I have right now. So I work at a retirement home in what Iâ€™d say is a medium sized town.  I have worked there for two years in my high school experience so far.  My brother is 2 years younger than I am so itâ€™s nice to get a break away from him at work.  Now my mom has been trying to find a job for him which there are plenty of opportunities, all which he rejects. He says, â€œThereâ€™s too many weirdos there,â€ or the simple â€œI donâ€™t want to work there!â€ Now I donâ€™t want to really work at a retirement home either but itâ€™s a good little job for the meantime.  Am I in the wrong for being mad at my parents or is it reasonable to make him work somewhere else? Thanks guys
