Need help persuading my parents of my wish to becoming a digital artist/pursuing a visual designing career. So my parents are the kind of people who believe that "If you're not a doctor or an Engineer. You're not going to be successful or get a stable income"

Which I call supreme bs on but I get where they're coming from. Since I live in Egypt which has probably the worse economic state but I'm just not interested in those careers.

How do I convince them of it? Like it's not like their choices prevent me from choosing what I want to do with my life but I hate seeing them upset and I want to at least make them satisfied.

I googled around a bit but I want more confirmations. Does digital art/visual designing have job opportunities? Can it provide consistent financial income? Does it earn respect? ...etc

Thanks for the help. Hope this doesn't get drowned in new...
