I want to just end it already I'm sitting on my ass on this stupid ass zoom classes from 8am to 5pm with barely any breaks. Then I have hours of homework. Only a month has passed, and another 2 are to come. I want to just die. I want to just end it already. I'm deprived of my friends and overworked, I just can't anymore. Why do even have to do this? It's useless shit that ain't gonna help me anyway. I want things to go back to normal. But that's not possible. 

I just want everything to end already.
