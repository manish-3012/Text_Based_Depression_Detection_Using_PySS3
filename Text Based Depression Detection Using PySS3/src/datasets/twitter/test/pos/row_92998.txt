My end is probably near I got a feeling that I'm not gonna be here for the next year. I'm 16 and literally cannot stand living with my parents anymore. It's been awful, yesterday my mom called my grandma and my cousins to the bedroom I was sleeping in (We only have 1 bedroom) and let everyone stay at my bed, making me wake up and completely fuck my sleeping schedule up. When my grandma realized she had waken me up she apologized, but my mom said: "Waking him up is great, because otherwise he'd be awake all night long." Guess what bitch, I stayed the night awake cuz you woke me up. Absolutely awful.ðŸ˜•
