Gamer Tags Hey Gamers. Iâ€™m an artist, trying to practice and gain experience. For this Iâ€™m offering/hoping to draw your gamer tags; (or literally any other drawing suggestion) for you. If itâ€™s a tag, no more than 10 Characters, &amp; no more than 2 numbers; if any. You can choose colors/color schemes you want with/for it. I just want to practice. I know people usually commission for this type of thing, but itâ€™s reddit lmao. Iâ€™m not that good, &amp; itâ€™s not going to be a fast process since Iâ€™m only planning on working when Iâ€™m on calls for school. Please donâ€™t have high expectations, &amp; I appreciate youâ€™re help. Some of my art is on my profile if you wish to take a look.
