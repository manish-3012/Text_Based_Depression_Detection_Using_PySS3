My first time getting drunk This happened at a friends house last week. We were playing xbox and i was thirsty. So i went downstairs for a Gatorade or something. (This was at his house) so i open the fridge and there are 2 packs of Budweiser in there. Yea there were other things but this stood out. So without thinking i grabbed 2 cans and chugged them in the bathroom. I don't think i was drunk, i just got a small headache
