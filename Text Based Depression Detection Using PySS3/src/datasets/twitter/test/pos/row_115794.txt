The internet makes me feel like shit. I don't know what this post is, I just need to write something somewhere. 

My country still has a pretty strict lockdown, schools have not yet opened and I have winter vacations right now anyway. Obviously in a situation like this I turned to the internet to help with boredom. 

I don't know, I just wanted to make something and let other people see what i have made. I started learning blender and posting final renders on an Instagram account I created. At one point i was uploading almost everyday and yet barley anyone seemed to notice. It sounds selfish and self centered when I put it like that and I'm still on the fence about posting this at all. 

Anyways, a year back I was uploading on my YouTube channel pretty regularly too and that got me nowhere. It just feels like everyone is doing something or another and then when I start making things I want to make then no one is there to say anything back. 

I started streaming on twitch a few days ago and it just feels weird sitting there, seeing the zero views counter and talking to myself while playing any game. Maybe I'm just not putting enough effort in but it is really saddening. 

I realize how this rant can sound like some pity-based  self promotion, that's why I'm not gonna include any links to any of these accounts. I'm just here to express my feeling of shouting out into an abyss desperately waiting for someone to reply back. 

I was about to stream today but couldn't get myself to do it, just thinking about the fact that how many hours I have probably already wasted for no return. 

Am I doing something wrong? Am I supposed to have no regards for the impact my content makes?  Is my content bad? Do I not understand the internet? Have I not made enough content? Should I just stop making anything? Is this even the right subreddit? Will this post get removed? Will anyone read this? Am I sounding like someone who's just looking for pity points? 

I'm done with the internet.
