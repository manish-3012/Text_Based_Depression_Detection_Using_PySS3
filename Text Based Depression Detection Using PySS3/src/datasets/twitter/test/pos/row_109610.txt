I just rewatched all 3 new star wars movies and now I'm sad All of those movies have a very depressing first 30 or last 30 minutes, like Kylo Ren killings his own DAD (Han Solo) in which that scene made my dad get teary (he grew up watching star wars) and then Luke's death in The Last Jedi made me feel sad as well. But the one that made me feel the saddest was Lea's death. Han's death was shocking and unexpected, Luke's death was peaceful and quiet, Lea's death was heartbreaking and sad, and the Emperors (second) death was very enjoyable to watch.
