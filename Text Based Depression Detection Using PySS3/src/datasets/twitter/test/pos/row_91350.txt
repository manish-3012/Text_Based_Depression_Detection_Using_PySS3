I did something shitty and I feel really bad Ok so some context, whenever my gf makes a joke she always says sorry even tho it was a joke, bruh I donâ€™t care itâ€™s just a joke

So anyways she made a joke about Americans and fat and said sorry about it. So dumbass me said â€œIf it makes you feel any better I looked up the obesity rate in [her country] because I donâ€™t like fat girls and I feel really shitty about thatâ€. I also explained how I did it a few days after we got into a relationship. She only responded with â€œouchâ€. I feel extremely bad rn why did I say that? Why did I even look that up?
