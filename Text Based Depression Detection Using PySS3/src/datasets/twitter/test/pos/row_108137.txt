Hi. I have a question for the other guys on this sub. Ok guys. So is it normal to have one testiculator that is bigger than the other one? If so, how much bigger can the other testiculator be compared to the small one without it being weird? 

I have one that is about the size of a ping pong ball and the other is about the size of a mallteaser (I couldnâ€™t think of any better way to describe the size)

So, do any of you have one that is bigger than the other?
