Self-post weekend is active - Introduce yourself and make friends! **Welcome to** [r/teenagers](https://new.reddit.com/r/teenagers/)**'s self-post weekend. Self-post weekend is when we, the moderating team, disable link posts for the period of the weekend to encourage more discussion and less memes during our higher traffic period of the week.** 

In this thread we also encourage you, the community, to introduce yourselves. Post a parent comment reply, and let us know who you are, what your hobbies are like or maybe a weird quirky fact that could work as an icebreaker. In addition, we'd like to remind users not to include any [personally identifying information.](https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/wiki/rules#wiki_3._no_personal_information.2C_of_yourself_or_others.)

Get to know one another more and *Remember the Human* behind that username! We encourage all users to comment and reply to each other's parent comment replies to meet the interesting members that comprises this community.

Looking for even more specific places to meet new friends and a sense of community? [Visit our Discord server, where you can talk to each other in real time with a variety of topics that occur! Our Discord server is one of the top active servers you can join to participate, so never feel as if it's empty to join and discuss!](https://discord.gg/teenagers)
