I'm 13 and in a long-distance relationship with a 15-year-old girl, will it work out? Im from New York, she's from Switzerland. Just started dating her a week ago, and she's really nice, pretty, and is very similar to me. My best friend says that I shouldn't fall too deep in love because we both might meet someone else. I try to convince him it will work out, and he keeps me up at night because I think about her and her finding someone else. I really love her and I don't want it to end, so can someone please answer this question?
