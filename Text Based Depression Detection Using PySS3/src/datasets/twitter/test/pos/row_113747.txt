I need to stop attaching self worth to my birthday Today is my birthday, and every year I do this incredibly toxic thing where the only thing I ever expect is for people to remember and wish me. I know itâ€™s toxic but when people donâ€™t in my head im like â€œwas I not a good enough person this year?â€ Because I associate being wished with how much impact I had on their life.

It especially stings that my best friend since second grade, 10 years of friendship, didnâ€™t wish me until reminded. I didnâ€™t wanna call attention to myself, but it kinda sucks when other people with my birthday post pictures of their friends wishes and get gifts and whatever.

Anyway, this year sucks. This sucks. Turning 18 like this sucks. But itâ€™s life. I hope all of you are safe, happy and getting healthier.
