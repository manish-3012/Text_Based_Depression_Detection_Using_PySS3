Blank Snapchat picture? So Iâ€™m sitting in bed at like 12:30-1 AM and I get a Snapchat from this girl that is completely blank. It is black and no words. I havenâ€™t talked to her in forever and we arenâ€™t close at all, just acquaintances. I know that it isnâ€™t an accident (unless she sent it to everyone, but why?) because I rarely use snap and I havenâ€™t talked to her using it. So... does this mean anything? because like I said, I donâ€™t use snap much and I donâ€™t know the culture well. Maybe Iâ€™m just thinking too far into it idk.
