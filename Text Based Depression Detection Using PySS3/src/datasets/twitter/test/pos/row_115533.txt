semi mad rant so ive been seeing a girl the last week or 2 and its going great and all, weâ€˜ve met up once and agreed that we would meet again today, a week later. I asked her when she wanted me to come over and if it was okay if i stayed the night, which we had planned to do the first time but turns out she didnt ask her parents beforehand and her dad wasnt a fan. I asked her like 4 days ago and she tells me that sheâ€˜s gonna let me know the day before, which is fine. now its the day we wanted to meet and she only told me that â€œi can cone over in the eveningâ€ and she â€œthinks its ok if i stay the nightâ€. Like, can you be a little less vague?? And wdym you think?? 
All week she kept telling me how much she misses me and now she hasnt responded in 2 hours, like how serious is it for you i dont get it
