I finally reign supreme over my family Thats right, ladies and gentlemen. After 16 and a half long years, it's finally happened. I have achieved what both my father and brother's feeble bodies could not. I have passed the six foot mark, clocking it at a glorious 6'1, and possibly still rising. My brother may still have the bulk to yeet me across the room with ease, but at a mere 5'11 he's nothing but a joke to me at this point. Now that I have achieved this level of dominance, what should be next goal?
