I miss lockdown Like straight up.

- It was the only time I truly felt safe. Now this pandemic is as bad as when it began and nobody wants to do anything

- Online school was less stressful than being face to face and having exams

- I can no longer live by my own sleep schedule

- I miss being able to binge shows without having to worry about waking up in the morning, or being able to play games until 2am

- I used to be able to choose who I stayed in contact with, without having to see people I dislike everyday.

- It gave me free time to practise my hobbies that i never had the opportunity to explore

I get there was disadvantages to lockdown, and some people struggled more than others, but for me it was my sweet spot. Sure I may have been getting physically unfit at times but I think I value the good it did for my mental health over that.
