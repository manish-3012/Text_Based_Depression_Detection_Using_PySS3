Fellow teens, I have apparently discovered the secret to weight loss At the start of quarantine, I was 115lbs (52 kilos), 5'9"/175cm

Now I'm 100lbs/45.3kg. The secret? Apparently, all you have to do is wake up at noon, eat nothing and do zero exercise during the day, then get stoned at midnight before eating 800 cals worth of junk food.


God I'm so fucking weak
