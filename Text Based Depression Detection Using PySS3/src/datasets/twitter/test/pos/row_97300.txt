My dumbass cant sleep Currently 2 45 am, i have an online class in 5 hours, cant sleep because i took a 5 hour nap at like 4 pm. And now im seriously debating if i should just take the day off and try to recuperate from my broken and very unhealthy sleep schedule. This always happens when i have to do something important and i hate it. 

Also ive been trying to sleep for 3 and half hours so you cant say then get off reddit. Im gonna go wash the dishes or do something productive now.
