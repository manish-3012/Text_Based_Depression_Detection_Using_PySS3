I realized recently that Iâ€™m not as alone as I thought I was When I was 10 I was diagnosed for ADHD, which explained why I had trouble focusing on things. But I hadnâ€™t realized until recently that it had also caused a few other problems. When I was diagnosed my parents didnâ€™t treat it seriously and had barely done anything to help, which had also made me think that it wasnâ€™t really an issue. Throughout middle school my grades were straight Dâ€™s and Câ€™s, and my parents werenâ€™t helping me in anyway and instead lectured me everyday on how I was being Irresponsible (which was mostly true) which had caused me to be very stressed already. My social life wasnâ€™t much better either, I constantly felt like I was talking too much and felt like people didnâ€™t like talking to me, eventually I grew a habit of saying sorry after every time I was talking to someone and felt like I annoyed them, which I ended up doing a lot. I had also had trouble with mood swings which would commonly make people look at me as if I was an immature child and had made me feel extremely excluded. This continued for 4 years and before I was diagnosed. 

A week ago I was browsing youtube and saw a video of tiktoks talking about ADHD. I click on it and start watching it, I watch and see people talking about their troubles with ADHD. I had felt a strong relief and before I knew It I was crying. For so long I had thought that a lot of the things that I had been having trouble with was my own personality. I thought that there had been something wrong with me the entire time and when I saw these people having the same problem as me, it made me realize Iâ€™m not alone.

I know a lot of you donâ€™t care, but please treat ADHD as a real mental illness, not as something that can make you â€œquirkyâ€ or have â€œcrack head energyâ€ It is a real issue and should be treated as one.

TL;DR I had ADHD it caused problems for me that I thought was personal but found out it was part of ADHD, And take ADHD serious.
