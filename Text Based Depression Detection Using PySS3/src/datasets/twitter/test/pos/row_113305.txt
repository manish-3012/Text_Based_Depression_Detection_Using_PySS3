you ever realize how pretty the moon is? like idk why, but whenever I see the moon im always impressed, like its so massive and bright, so far away, yet so close compared to everything else in the universe.

like it has craters and mares that span across the tidally locked landscape.

you know the earth has the largest known moon relative to the size of the host planet.

and like... holy shit, people have been there, people have walked there
