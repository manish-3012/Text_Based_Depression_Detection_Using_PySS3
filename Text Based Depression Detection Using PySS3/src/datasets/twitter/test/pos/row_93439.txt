I get mad way to often This year I decided to write a tally mark on a piece of paper for every time I yell or snap at somebody and just this year I'm at 350, almost twice a day it happens. I need to control my anger, but people need to stop intentionally making me angry, I am honestly about to explode, and when I do it won't be pretty.

I'm probably gonna lose my crap in the next few days.
