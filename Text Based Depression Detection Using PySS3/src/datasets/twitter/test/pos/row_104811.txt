Ranting about â€œsuper straightâ€ and lgbtq again Iâ€™m so stressed about something stupid

I made a rant about how itâ€™s stupid to call someone who doesnâ€™t want to date a transgender person transphobic but how itâ€™s also stupid to make a whole sexuality based on how you wonâ€™t date someone. But goddamn do I hate seeing people running around on the internet throwing around the word transphobic. I have a few friends who are â€œsuper straightâ€ and it just stresses me out. Im just really overwhelmed by everything. Lgbtq pride used to be about celebrating who you are and not letting idoits overcome you just because you like someone of the same sex, not bashing straight people or making sexualities that are just plain disrespectful to others.
