My dad is freaking out over me having high B average in school. Most of you probably wonâ€™t care, but I needed a place to vent and this seemed like the best place. Anyway, my dad came into my room today and started yelling at me over my grades. I said to him that I only have As and Bs, and Bs are good grades, but he kept telling me how he expects for me to always have straight As. Of course, I would obviously prefer to have straight As, but the way he was yelling at me made it seem like he thought I was going to fail school and end up homeless because of my 87 in English. Thatâ€™s basically it. I just really wanted to express my frustration somewhere.
