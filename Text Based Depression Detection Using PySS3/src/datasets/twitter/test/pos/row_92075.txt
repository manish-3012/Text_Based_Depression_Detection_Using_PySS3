The idea of tiktok is good but the people that use it ruin it Idk how many people think this but tiktok is unique and if it was more focused on comedy and not shitty dancing, than I would totally download it. The humor thatâ€™s on there is pretty bad and cringy 90% of the time, but there are some funny people on there. It actually took me until April 2020 to delete it because it was being overtaken by white girls dancing and political shit. But yeah it may have been the thing to replace vine.

Oh yeah thereâ€™s a lot of kids my age (13) on tiktok which is bad because weâ€™re all annoying as fuck. I see why Redditors donâ€™t like it.
