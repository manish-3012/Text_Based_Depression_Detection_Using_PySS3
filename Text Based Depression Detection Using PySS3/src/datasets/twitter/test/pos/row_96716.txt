Applying to USAFA is a much bigger deal than I thought. I mean, seriously, what even is this application process. I legit need to get a congressman or congresswoman from the US Congressional House of Representatives to endorse me in order to just even be considered for acceptance. It's also the only college I've seen that has multiple layers to it. When you first apply, you're considered a precandidate, and I was only promoted to candidate status last night, which just means I have more forms available to fill out.

Honestly, I'm most concerned about the Cadet Fitness Exam, which requires me to do an average of 13 pull-ups, 81 situps, 61 push-ups, and a 1-mile run in 6:30, all in quick succession. This is coming from a noodly nerd whose barely seen the sun in the last 10 months. I'm gonna have to train my ass off to get a good score on the CFA come January.

If anyone else is applying, let me know how it's going for you.
