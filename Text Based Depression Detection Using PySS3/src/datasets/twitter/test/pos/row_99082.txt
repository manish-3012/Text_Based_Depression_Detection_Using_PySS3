I blew up at my abusive parents after they called me abusive and now both of them want me homeless After 2 years of being bullied and abused by my parents (Much Verbal, a little physical) Iâ€™m at the end of pretending to like them. Itâ€™s been rough, and it did almost end with a suicide attempt that I was talked out of over the phone. I live in Canada, and so thanksgiving was today.

When I was told to come downstairs I was asked â€œDo you know where the seeds are?â€ (Seeds being a salad topping) and I answered â€œNoâ€ annoyed because I literally never used them. And they told me to leave, and not come back to the table, I got angry because Iâ€™d just done yard work for a while and itâ€™s getting cold. They starting making shit up, like â€œYouâ€™re already angry with usâ€ and I made it very clear I was only angry when they started yelling at me to leave. 

I asked my older brother for help here because I knew I was losing it, and instead of saying something to calm me down, he picked their side.

I said one fucking word and theyâ€™re trying to kick me out of the table.

And I started getting very angry, and I have very clear anger phases.

1-2 Iâ€™m annoyed
3-4 Iâ€™m angry but you canâ€™t see it
5-6 You can tell Iâ€™m kinda angry
7-8 Iâ€™m stating to do my quiet yell
9-10 I get loud, loud. And I mean the neighbours in sound proof rooms can hear me.

I was a 10 when she said the words â€œYouâ€™re abusiveâ€

Theyâ€™ve done so much shit to hurt me, year after year Iâ€™ve just taken it.

I just called the bitch a whore.

I donâ€™t call women whores ever, Iâ€™ve never even said the word before

I got crying angry, I honestly thought about murdering them. No not like the edgy 12 year old murder, I mean I was actually thinking about taking a knife and fucking stabbing them.

Yeah. Thatâ€™s how much theyâ€™ve fucked me up.

Now theyâ€™re trying to convince me to come back downstairs to talk it out, and Iâ€™ve made it clear Iâ€™m done trying to talk to them, Iâ€™m done being their family, and Iâ€™m going to try and convince my brother to make him my legal guardian so I can finally stop living like they own me.

I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m going from here, if anything happens like this again I might just end up killing myself. I donâ€™t think I can ever get over this, Iâ€™m going to be stuck here forever.

Iâ€™m not lying, making this story up for Reddit, Iâ€™m a real person, this is a real story, these are my real thoughts. 

And before you say â€œCall the policeâ€ itâ€™s not as easy as that. My parents will take each otherâ€™s side and theyâ€™re often believed more than any kid. They get my brother in their side, the only thing to back me up is years worth of Hearsay.

So please, if you even have to ask yourself if youâ€™re being abused, youâ€™re being abused and do everything in your power to control your own life.
