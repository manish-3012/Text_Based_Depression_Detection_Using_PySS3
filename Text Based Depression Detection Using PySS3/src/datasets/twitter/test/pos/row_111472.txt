How to convince my mum to let me outside and actually do stuff? So Iâ€™m 14 nearly 15 and almost all my friends are allowed to go to water parks, beach, shops ect by themselves but Iâ€™m not allowed Iâ€™m responsible and get good grades yet my mum wonâ€™t let me go anywhere while my dad will, my mum is the finale call, I donâ€™t even care about not being able to go but knowing that my parents ( practically my mum) trust me enough to do stuff is all I want.

Every holiday I almost do nothing but play games and occasionally go to friends houses and hate it and then my parents get mad for me doing nothing like wtf do you expect if I canâ€™t go anywhere so I came to this sub asking for advice because everything I tried hasnâ€™t worked thank you for anyone that helps .
