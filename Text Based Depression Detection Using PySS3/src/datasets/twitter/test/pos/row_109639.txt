Please give me advice on how to use Snapchat properly. A cute girl from my swim team added me on Snapchat and sent me a picture of her ceiling. I didnâ€™t know what to do and just sent her a picture of my ceiling. She sent me a picture of her face. I did the same. She then sent me another picture of her face and I did again.

Ok, but like what do I do??? Is what Iâ€™m doing good? I got some advice from people on discord and they told me to do this, but I just want to make sure that what Iâ€™m doing is ok.
