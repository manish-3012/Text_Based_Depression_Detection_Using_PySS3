My cat just died. My cat, Strawberry, just passed. He was 15. I honestly just dont know what to think. Ive never not lived with that cat, heâ€™s been around since before I have. He lived a good life, and he was comfortable in the end. When we got him, we were moving from kentucky back to tennessee. He was a couple of weeks old, just a small black kitten. Just before my family got in the car and left, he came running up and went straight to my sister, who was 2 at the time. My parents decided that they could keep him. Ive never lived without him. He lived a long life, and he lived every second of it. He will always be special, and will always hold a special place in my heart. RIP Old Man Cat 2005-2020.            


I just want people to know what Iâ€™m going through. I know that a lot of you probably dont care what im going through, but to those of you who do, I truly thank you.
