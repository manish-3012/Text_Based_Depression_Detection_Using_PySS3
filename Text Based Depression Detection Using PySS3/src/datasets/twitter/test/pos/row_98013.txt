Hey anyone else ever think about this Like where did we come from? What happened like 65 trillion years ago to lead where we are today? Also, how are we even here? How is our perception of reality even real? To clarify, why do we exist? When weâ€™re all extinct, will our galaxy just be an empty void, waiting for the next life forms to conquer the decaying ecosystems of whatever remains of earth whenever weâ€™re gone? How is anything real? Where did matter come from? What would have happened if the Big Bang never occurred? Would reality simply be just scattered dust, drifting endlessly in the cosmos for eternity?

Anyway, have fun sleeping tonight :)
