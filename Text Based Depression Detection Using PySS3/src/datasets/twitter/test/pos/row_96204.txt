Star Wars music somehow helps me focus when studying/doing homework As the title implies, Star Wars music has surprisingly been helping me focus a lot better when studying or doing homework. Prior to using this, I would just listen to the music that I normally listen to while doing work. But recently I found that I was not doing so well while listening to it anymore. I already know that music with lyrics or something will not be as good for helping you focus but it used to be totally fine for me. Some people use video game music because it is designed to help you keep focus on the game, but I just found that Star Wars music was just really nostalgic and helped me maintain focus for a longer period of time. 

Anyways that was my first post in this subreddit so thank you for listening to my TED talk :)
