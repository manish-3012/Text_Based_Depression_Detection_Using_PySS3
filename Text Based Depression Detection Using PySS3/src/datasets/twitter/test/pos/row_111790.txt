Iâ€™m tired of my dad He is constantly in a bad mood heâ€™s rude to me and my mom and I feel like Iâ€™m walking on eggshells. Heâ€™s been like this all my life and I wish my mom just divorced me. Itâ€™s clear that they donâ€™t care about each other and that there is no love in their relationship. My mom told me that he wasnâ€™t like this when they met. I canâ€™t remember how many times he told me that they were getting a divorce and they never did. I hate it that he pretends that nothing is wrong and gets mad at me when I donâ€™t forgive and forget and pretend that all is well. He wants me to like everything he likes and doesnâ€™t understand the fact that we are  different people. He puts everyone in a bad mood and the moment he walks in the house I feel angry, sad and unsafe. I wish he just died or left since he doesnâ€™t wanna be here. He is nothing like my mom and I donâ€™t understand why she married an man like him. Iâ€™m planning on cutting all contact with him when i become an adult and get him out of my life. He truly is one of the worst people I have ever met. I feel ashamed that I am related to him. Why wonâ€™t he just leave.
