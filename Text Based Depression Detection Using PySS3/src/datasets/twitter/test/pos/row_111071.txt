You ever just hear a song and then are constantly reminded and the event in which you heard that song? I just heard the kung fu fighting song and now I canâ€™t stop thinking about the time one fo my friends startled me coming into the classroom when I was half asleep by tapping me, and then me almost hurting them, and then like the seven students who actually showed singing that song when they saw me lash out. Then I wanted to leave and probably could have because the teacher didnâ€™t care, but I didnâ€™t want to make my friend feel bad or being any more attention to myself
