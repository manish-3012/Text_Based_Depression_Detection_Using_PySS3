Car crash Yeesh, I just remembered I was in a car crash yesterday. Like it slipped completely from my mind, Iâ€™m kinda denying it even happened. Like I was off collecting wood with my brother in leg high snow and it was reeeally fucking bad, but we were going to grab some to have a fire the next day and fuck around. We had to carry the bag of the wood like 2-3 miles and it was heavy as shit, then after like an hour of walking we got it back. 

It was a fucking amazing feeling, and all the hard shit was over, so now we just had to ride back. Heâ€™s the one with a license so he starts the car up and gets driving, and after travelling like a mile the car loses control on the ice, it drifts to the left and he tries to control it and goes right, it drifts to the right and we go off the road into a fucking ditch. A ton of people came and helped afterwards which wholesome, and we got out with possibly a damaged tire max. But it was really fucking surreal. 

Our parents donâ€™t even know because he thought it might change their minds on if they think heâ€™s safe to drive. So nobody knows shit. Same with our friend because heâ€™s the type to let it slip to his parent. So it feels like it didnâ€™t even happen, I just wanted to talk to someone about it i guess. It feels really weird no one knows.

TL;DR my brother crashed his car into a ditch due to ice and weâ€™ve not told anyone
