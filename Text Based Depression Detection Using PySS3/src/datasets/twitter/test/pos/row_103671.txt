Every energy drink I've ever had reviewed Redbull: makes you feel more focused, it tastes like carbonated nyquil with sugar. I love it.

Monster: like redbull but not as strong or carbonated 

Bang: I've had every flavor of bang, they taste similar because it's so strong and tart it's overwhelming tbh. Cotton candy is the worst flavor imo. It gives a weird feeling, euphoric kinda, it's the closest thing to cocaine you can buy on store shelves. It has so much caffeine 

Reign orange: definitely wakes you up, tastes like a melted cream popsicle, I genuinely don't like, it bang is better. (Also it's supposed to be only drank by people over 18 like wtf is that about?) 

Orange redbull: tastes like tangerine genuinely 

Orange monster: it tastes like a Beatles song and it's good 

Purple monster: it tastes like purple 

Blue redbull: tastes like dissapointment 

Winter redbull: melted blue jolly rancher 

Summer redbull: melted watermelon jolly rancher 

Low carb monster: it's like monster but worse 

Coffee: i can't drink coffee, I have ibs. 

Iced coffee: it tastes like ass 

Black coffee: it tastes like ass 

Ass: it tastes like coffee 

Water: 10/10 this is my favroite and the best beverage ever invented. Absolutely amazing and good.
