How do I find other teens in person? Most people can just go to a pub, or meet other adults at a park, or the store, or work. I do get that there is a global pandemic right now, but I have been on homeschool for a lot longer than the quarantine has been in effect. I have never even had a girlfriend who I know in person. Where am I supposed to start at finding friends? My parents won't let me go back to public school after the pandemic, so what am I supposed to do? It seems hopeless, I feel like I am not even gonna ever have real friends, or a girlfriend.
