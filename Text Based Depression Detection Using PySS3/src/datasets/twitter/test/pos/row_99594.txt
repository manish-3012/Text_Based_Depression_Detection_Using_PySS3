I don't think I'll be happy in life and I don't think that I care I have no real friends really, since everyone I meet likes me due to my apparently unnormal personality. My family is abandoning me because I don't talk a lot and I've never really had a romantic relationship since I dislike almost every girl and I'd probably only be interested in 0.0001% of all the girls on this planet, because I simply don't like those that don't think/act the way I do. I never had crushes either.. and I often think to myself that many people who are married are just unhappy. They get into fights over dumb things constantly. And just see the 'I hate my wife' boomer memes. If you really loved someone, you wouldn't joke about this, right?

Then work/school: For me school is the worst thing ever, I suffer daily when going there. And I had hope it may get better when I'll get into the 'real' life. And then every adult tells you that it's only gonna get worse from now on and they wish they'd still be in school. If it's only gonna get worse from now on, why bother thinking that you'll be happy later in life?

And of course with age come a lot of problems like pain. Back pain due to bad posture for example, then constant headaches etc.
My posture is the worst thing in the world. It's so bad and I'm already looking forward to the massive pains it'll give me.

But even with all this, I don't care anymore. I used to worry but I don't anymore. Life will suck and there's nothing I can do about it. I don't care anymore.
