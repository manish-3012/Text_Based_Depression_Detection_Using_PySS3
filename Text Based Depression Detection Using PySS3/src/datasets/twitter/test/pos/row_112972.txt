Sad hours again I am starting to feel pointless again 
I have realized that my crush probably doesent love me back 
So everything I lived for is down , school is also going awful
I have s shiton of Exams ,and the stress of assignments and studying just kills me , I am never as good as others , I am just a mess 
All I do is let people down , now where do I go 
What do I do , do I just stay here in my brining world and let the flames 
Bring me down , or so I try to get out knowing that I canâ€™t 
What was I thinking someone could love 
What was I thinking someday I could be successful
What was I thinking , that I could hold something perfect and nit destroy it 
That someone was going to catch my hand when I was drowning 
Itâ€™s very sad seeing everything you worked for fall apart 
And everything you loved turns into things you hate
I donâ€™t feel the point of anything anymore 
Where I am pointless chasing something that I canâ€™t catch 
I am just waiting for a saviour that never arrives 
I know I should get my shit and get out ,but I am paralyzed
So I am going to put this pretend to be happy mask on 
And drown is self hatred , because keeping on is pointless 
Itâ€™s sad that I lie to myself and I canâ€™t handle it 
That I am going thru the motions 
That o git no one to trust l
Why do I waste so much things in things that I though would make me happy , but they just left me more empty 
I though I could let the bad thoughts behind 
But this is a race ,and I canâ€™t keep up my pace
I leave them ,then they come back and kill me again
I have nearly everything I could ask for 
A house , a functioning family
A computer to play games
But I still feel like I got nothing 
I donâ€™t know what is this thing that I am looking for 
Is it love , is it a hobby 
Is it a sudden epiphany thatâ€™s gonna change the way I see life ?
The search begins again
