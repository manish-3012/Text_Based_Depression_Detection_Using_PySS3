What should I do? My cousin(10) was on the couch playing among us. When I was passing by to check on her, I saw her name as Hxrny Girl. I was surprised, she turned around, saw me, then she changed her name to Soft girl. I donâ€™t know if I should confront her or just tell my aunt so she can handle it.
Ps. They live with us so weâ€™re not spreading germs
