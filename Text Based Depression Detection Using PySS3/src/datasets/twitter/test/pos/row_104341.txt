how to focus during online class, and catch up with a shit ton of homework i had to make a whole new account just for this, so strap in because this is gonna be a mess.

(update: that account had low karma so i guess I'll have to deal with it and post in on main... here we go)

today my maths teacher sent a reminder in our class groupchat about how the kids who didn't turn in their online homework will get in big trouble, and there's a lot of details so let me just keep this short.

since 7th grade, I hadn't been focusing in my classes. history, maths, you name it. 

tw / self harm

ever since my maths teacher outed (is that the right word????) me on my self harming habits (?) i kinda lost all motivation. it's a VERY long story, so I'll keep this one short too.

i started self harming at 7th grade, mostly because i saw people on twitter do it and i was curious as to why they found it satisfactory, or whatever you're gonna call it and i tried it and oh boy did that last since today.

so the counselor, my maths teacher (who is also my homeroom teacher) kinda... traumatized me or something, it's hard to describe. i guess something snapped in me when the counselor forced me to show my cuts when i was obviously being uncomfortable and was literally crying at the time too. jesus christ, those are the wild times.

anyways, ever since that, i started hating everyone at school, the teachers, heck even all the students and i thought that they're all just pretentious fucks. I didn't have any motivation to pay ANY attention to class, and i used to be one of the top students in terms of grades, so hitting a wall was really hard on me.

and not to mention, my mom even found out about it which is also a long story and i unfortunately am too lazy to explain, so let's just leave it at that. so i guess i got pretty traumatized that the shock made me stop self harming daily, key word is daily here. i still do it when i want a quick happy pill when i truly do hit a wall again.

( self harm warning ends here. )

anyways, i guess iâ€™m a maladaptive daydreamer too, but that's a whole other story. I'll probably make a separate post for that later i guess. 

if you know the game omori, then it's just like that. i ran away from my problems by daydreaming and ignoring this whole situation I'm in.

are you getting confused? is this all too much to take in? oh well baby this is just the beginning. you brought it upon yourself when i told you this would be a mess. 

anyways, (2) in order to cope with all this, i, as a horny teenager, masturbate. well that's it that's the post.

whenever i felt sad or anything i didn't even deal with it and i just.... fap.... i guess...? and i guess that's dealing some damage to my academics. I didn't want to do my homework, I didn't wanna do anything, i just cared about fapping. I'm horny all the time. 

tl;dr im just a sexually pent up teenager with some mental issues who is struggling with grades and understanding stuff at school because I'm just that horny. send help.
