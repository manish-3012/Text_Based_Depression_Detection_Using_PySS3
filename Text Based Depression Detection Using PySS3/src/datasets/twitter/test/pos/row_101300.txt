can someone MAKE A SARCASTIC FONT please?! So basically, you know how we type lIkE tHiS, well yeah, it takes some extra time and it is very time consuming for us to type like that, so what if there was an actual font on mobile keyboard that let us type like that? That would be pretty sick, and then maybe we could get an extension where if you do a keyboard shortcut on desktop, it'll automatically start typing in sarcastic and then when we are done we can do the shortcut and turn it off!
