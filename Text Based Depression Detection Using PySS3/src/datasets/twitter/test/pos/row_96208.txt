I made a presentation about how my dreamjob was being a terrorist Pilot. So when i was in the first or second class we had to make a poster about our dream jobs. I wanted to be a pilot and when we went to the library to get books about our jobs i took one which was about dangerous jobs because it had military Pilots in it. 

So I read the part about Pilots and then looked further and found Terrorist. 

I thought it looked cool so I did what was natural. 

I put them together and had a presentation in front of the class and my teacher about how my dream job was to be a terrorist Pilot. 

TLDR: We had to make a poster about our dream job and I saw a page about terrorists so I made the poster about Terrorist Pilots.
