On the topic of humour Back story: I posted a 9/11 meme on discord and someone got offended. So I took it down and apologized.

So, here's what I think, humour is a selective thing. What I mean by that is, you might find something offensive or not funny, but someone else might. So, something like a 9/11 meme is hella funny to me but probably not to you. And I don't care if you get offended because that shit kills me. So, you not liking a joke I make doesn't mean it's not a good joke. For example (I didn't make this joke): How many cops does it take to screw a lightbulb? None, they just beat the room for being black. Now, I'm black and some people might think that the joke is offensive, but that shit is funny as hell. The thing about jokes is that there is no such thing as an appropriate joke. Most, if not all, jokes have their dark side. So, for you to say a joke is not okay is wrong. What you should say is that "I don't like that joke because I get offended by that kind of humor". So, stop getting all mad and stuff just because a joke isn't to your liking because nine times out of ten, the person telling the joke won't give a fuck or will laugh at you for being soft.
