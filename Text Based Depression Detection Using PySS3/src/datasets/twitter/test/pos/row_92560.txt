just ranting for a bit I feel like my entire life I have been dealt a shit hand, seemingly everything that can go wrong goes wrong. 

I literally feel like getting into a relationship is physically impossible, it feels like something that can and will never happen for me. No matter how hard I try it seems like I am destined to live out a life of loneliness. 

I feel that everyone is going on and I have been left behind. 

Earlier this year I had built up the courage to ask out a girl who I talked with a lot. Of course she rejected me, she didn't friendzone me because she didn't even want to be friends with me.

and the very moment I began to socialize and leave my socially anxious shell I was swept away by a fucking pandemic and have been unable to leave the house since.

 I probably have the capability to look good, I have clear skin and am not overweight, but I just never had anyone there to tell me how to look good. to tell me how to dress or how to style my hair.

My parents are extremely disconnected from me, they never understand what I am saying, or maybe they just refuse to listen idk.

I can't feel like my life will get better, it all seems so pre-determined and that it is impossible for me to change my future of loneliness.
