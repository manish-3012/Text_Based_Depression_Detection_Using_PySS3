Back from psych ward after suicide attempt Long story short what I tried didnâ€™t work and it landed me in the psych ward for a bit. Funny enough I just felt worse in there and now Iâ€™m just trying to recover from the hospital haha. I apologize to the people who dmed me trying to help and I will be explaining what happened to each of them. This subreddit has helped me out so much I would love to thank all you guys. You are great people.
