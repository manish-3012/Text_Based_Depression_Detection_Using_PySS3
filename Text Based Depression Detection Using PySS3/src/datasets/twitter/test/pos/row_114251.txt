Anyone do this? Iâ€™m really competitive, and I donâ€™t like it when someone thinks their superior to me. 

For instance, my friend was talking about how this chick in our dorm turned him down. So, I *coincidentally* ran into her outside her class and slept with her the next night. 

My roommate was bragging about how good at chess he was. Iâ€™d only played chess once, and he beat me 0-3. I didnâ€™t sleep for fucking three days doing chess puzzles. I came back and wiped him 1-7 just to watch his ego crumble. 

I will also sleep with someone just to feel powerful. Not because Iâ€™m horny or romantically interested but just to announce superiority to my peers. 

Same thing happens with grades. If I know the professor will post the highest grade after an exam, I will fucking study to perfection to make that score. And if I donâ€™t get the highest score, i dwell on it for a long time. 

I also have extreme contempt for people who are rude or smell bad, and especially if a person is back-talking someone who I respect. 


I know that it is a problem, and Iâ€™ve tried marijuana, but it only works in the moment. 

So I guess the question is: Is this normal, or should I see someone about this?
