I hate being told â€œyou are gonna regret that if you donâ€™t do itâ€ Because most of the times itâ€™s not true. Iâ€™m never, EVER gonna enjoy something Iâ€™m doing because Iâ€™m being pressured to do it. I need to ponder my decisions and it has to be a completely free choice for me to enjoy something. And it is of course cause Iâ€™m a stubborn, self oriented piece of shit, but idc, thatâ€™s what it is. So I hate so much being told â€œoh, you didnâ€™t go out with your friends? Well youâ€™re gonna regret it!â€ Bitch, no Iâ€™m not. If I go out without wanting to do it Iâ€™m NOT gonna have fun and Iâ€™m gonna regret not staying at home. Because I love staying at home writing and playing video games and listening to music and BEING FUCKING ALONE. But no, â€œyouâ€™re gonna regret not going to that party maybe the love of your life will be thereâ€ So what? Who gives a fuck? Why are you so invested in my business? Aaaaaahg
