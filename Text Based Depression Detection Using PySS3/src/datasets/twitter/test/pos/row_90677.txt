The truth behind the famous convertible meme. We all know the famous convertible meme, in which popular rapper DaBaby claims that he will: â€˜turn a (gentleman) into a convertible.â€™ The humorous imagery this conjures in oneâ€™s mind is arguably what has made it such a popular meme. However, what if I told you a dark, elusive secret lay behind these lyrics? Let me set the scene. The year is 2018, and DaBaby is pursuing Walmart for winter clothes for his infant. Suddenly, two armed men threaten DaBaby, who is forced to take action. He uses his own weapon to shoot the assailant, blasting the top third of his head off. The assailant does not survive. The more receptive among you will have already made the connection, but the true meaning of the lyrics: â€˜I will turn a (gentleman) into a convertible.â€™ is that famous rapper DaBaby, when threatened, can and will remove your head with a firearm, essentially removing your top layer; akin to a convertible. So I implore you, next time you consider making a â€˜convertibleâ€™ joke, think back to this cautionary tale, lest you too be turned into a convertible.
