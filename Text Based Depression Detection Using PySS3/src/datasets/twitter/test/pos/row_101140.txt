I have a childhood stuffed animal that I lost - and Iâ€™m super scared For my third birthday, my neighbors got me a stuffed monkey, that I named monkey (creative, I know) I soon fell in love with monkey and brought him with me everywhere. 10 years later, I still am. Because of covid, my mom had to bring me into her office. Itâ€™s a small place and she was the only one working. I brought monkey so I wouldnâ€™t be lonely and I wouldnâ€™t have an empty place in my lap. My mom had to go to cvs to get something, idk. I went with her, and I brought monkey. I left monkey in the car. I donâ€™t remember seeing monkey after that. I checked the car, did I not check well enough? Did he fall out of the car and is in the parking lot? Is he in the office still? Idk, and I canâ€™t sleep without him, and Iâ€™m worried and scared. Whenever Iâ€™m scared or sad, I hug monkey, but, there is no monkey for me to hug. Iâ€™m scared! Is he ok? Will I get him back??? Sorry for the rant and for me sounding like a 5 year old. Itâ€™s 2 AM, Iâ€™m still a kid and Iâ€™m sad and scared
