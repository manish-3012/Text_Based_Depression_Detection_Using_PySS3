Dating advice I don't know if this is fitting for this community, but i thought since im a teenager i thought i might ask here xd.

so i (17M) had a crush on a girl a year and a half ago. we started talking and chatting, we had fun, went on a lunch together(i geuss it was a date? xd). anyway, it was fun and we kept on talking a lot, i was going to teach her to play a simple song on guitar, etc. then she apped that she didnt really saw a relationship between us and just wanted to be friends. 

so i was pretty sad and had a tough time (it was my first crush who i dared to ask for a lunch or something). But i got over her.

 she had a boyfriend for a year after that, but they recently broke up. And now she kinda started talking to me again, and im getting the feels again. But idk what i should do... I don't want to be dumped by her again, and i'm a little afraid im just beeing used for like, fun times untill she finds someone true (i'm insecure af).

ohw yeah, i never had anything close to a relationship before, she was like the first and most real thing.

so yeah, help?
