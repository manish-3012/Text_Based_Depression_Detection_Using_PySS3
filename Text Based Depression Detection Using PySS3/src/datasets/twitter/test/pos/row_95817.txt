once my science teacher told us to find a partner of the opposite gender for a class activity And of course me being an awkward, annoying middle schooler with like, no friends I had no guy (Iâ€™m a girl) to be my partner which was the *most* upsetting and humiliating thing idk why this teacher couldnâ€™t have just picked partners for us 

I think I was tearing up a little especially since I thought the guy I liked at the time was walking over to me, and at first I was like !!! But then he walked to another girl :,( 

That was lowkey (highkey) self esteem crushing...
