I studied physics, a lil chemistry,also flipped through an add maths book yesterday They were all from my older brother's lol my school doesnt teach me those subjects yet but I will be able to next year.

so kinda nerdy thing to say but I'm a science kinda guy lol not rlly that good at it but it interests me and I wanna learn about things and I always find myself asking why to everything about this world,I remember wanting to be a scientist or an astronomer when I was little.I still do now idk if that would be possible tho but would be dope if that were to happen and I get a cool job in the science field. 

Also I'm rlly curious about the quantum mechanics and stuffs like that,my brain hurts thinking about it but I also listen to science related videos to sleep lol

Do you guys know that sleep scientist is actually a thing?They study about sleep,the reason,the importance,the ways,the process of it,and ways to help insomniacs or sumn like that pretty cool

Have you guys heard of bubble universe?String theory??They're pretty cool and complicated.Also some physicists believe that other dimensions exist like we have 1D 2D and 3D right?But what if instead of that we actually live in a 23 dimensional world?Some believe that that might actually exist while some not but maybe yk that there are higher dimensions besides our normal three.

But anyways the point is that everything is about why and how??It doesnt make any sense,or does it?I like that about science lol I like knowing stuffs
