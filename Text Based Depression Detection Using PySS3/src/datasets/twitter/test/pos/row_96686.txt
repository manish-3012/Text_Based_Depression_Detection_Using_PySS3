I love when an old memory surfaces Current thinking about how I got into a verbal altercation with a girl my freshman year of highschool. We were literally in class and just yelling at each other and the teacher didn't care. I couldn't even tell you what it was about anymore. Well fast forward a week or so and a friend said that the girl I was arguing with has had a hate book since middle school and now my name was in it. I move away that summer but 2 years later I go back to visit. Meet up with the same friend I previously mentioned who then tells me this girl is STILL TALKING SHIT ON MY NAME AND I HAVEN'T BEEN AT THE SCHOOL SINCE 2018. But my name apparently moved up on her hate list...


It's genuinely the funniest thing that's happened to me and it's the result of the only serious altercation I've been involved in. Like this girl really wanted to put her hands on me in Geometry but I just kept space lol. I love highschool ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
