I have managed to convince my sister that Juan the horse is one of the Percy Jackson books. She recently just started reading the second series about Percy Jackson, 'The Heroes of Olympus' and she asked me who is my favourite character. I told her it was Juan and now she believes that somewhere in the third part Jason Grace has a dream of Rome with a magical horse standing on a balcony.
