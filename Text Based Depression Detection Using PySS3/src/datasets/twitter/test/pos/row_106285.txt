Yea..so my gf broke up with me I'm not too heart broken because it's already happened once and she never did anything to help our relationship, but you want to know what really did it for me?......she wants to break up cus her parents are moving house....idfk who the hell gets so stressed out by moving house to the point where they have to call it quits with their gf/bf and I don't want to know. At least come up with a better excuse next time. Anyway thanks for reading to an Aussie Bois relationship drama and hope that yours will go better than mine lol
