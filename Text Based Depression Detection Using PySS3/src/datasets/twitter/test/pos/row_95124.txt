I support both I support black rights, and I think that anyone who tries to take away ANY rights of ANY person because of their race is a disgusting person all around. But at the same time I support the police. And before you get mad, I dont support any officer who tries to diminish the importance of someone because of race. To me, those aren't really police. But without the police we are all screwed. I just hope that the cops who have been caught doing this kind of stuff get the justice they claim they fight for.
