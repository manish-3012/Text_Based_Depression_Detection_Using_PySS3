About my last post My last post was about how I was comfortable with being trans. But I want to talk more about it. When I was about 8 or 9 I wanted to know what being a girl was like. (Not sex. I was 8 or 9) but know I want to know what being girl is like. Like if I was born a girl. But now I want to be full on girl. But I donâ€™t think my family would allow that. Although I am comfy with being trans. Anything I should know if I go full on?  Thank reddit I know you have my back.
