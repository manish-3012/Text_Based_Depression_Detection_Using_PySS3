Finally got a boyfriend after flirting with him for 4 MONTHS I have been flirting with him since June and have been on 6 hour calls with him before and he still had no clue I liked him!! He said he liked me but he thought I was only being nice to him. How??? It was very very obvious to everyone but him. Guys are so clueless but I'm honestly filled to the brim with joy that I can call him mine. So excited!! We have our first official date Saturday and I cannot wait
