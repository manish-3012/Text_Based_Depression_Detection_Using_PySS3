Essay grading, grading, and more grading I hate it, especially what the grading part was about. I was in class the other day, and our narrative essays over the dust bowl were being graded. The only thing is, for me, my essay got pared with the worst person imaginable, the person who never listens in class, probably has bad grades, and is the worst at his job. The reason he was grading it is cause of the teacher mixing up the essays, and the only reason why I knew he was grading it was cause of the one staple I had, nobody else had it.

I sat there, grading, and when the teacher said times up, I grabbed my paper. He congratulated me, saying good job, and you think we would live happily ever after right? WRONG. I got the score of 2,3,2, and a 4, basically a 75. Normally, I'm ok with this, but when we got out papers regraded, with a person of our choice, the new student in my classes gave me a 4 on something the other kid gave me a 2 on.

So what my grade is idk, but it's probably not gonna be good. I don't wanna blame any of the kids there, but let me tell you, luck has it's charms
