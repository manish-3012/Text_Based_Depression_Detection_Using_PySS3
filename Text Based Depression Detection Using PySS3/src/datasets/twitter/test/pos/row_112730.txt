Ghosting sucks So I met this girl right she goes to a different school district but about 30 min away from me. So we start talking and flirting and she seems to like me and me the same. Then she starts to ghost me and act like I don't exist. I mean if you don't wanna talk to someone just tell them or just block them. But honestly ghosting fucking sucks.
