Any Gamers around here? I'd really use a gaming buddy? Why?

I've spent the past 3 years making money off posting accs in csgo, apex, league, ov and r6 - I need some chill and a chill friend.

Who exactly am I searching for?

Friends I could lay back with and joke around, people who won't get offended by no joke (as long as its not normie ofc), no dry convos you know. When it comes to game choice its literally anything but these up there, Roblox, Fortnite and val.
