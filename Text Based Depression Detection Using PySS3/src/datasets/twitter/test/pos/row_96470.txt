Happy birthday! I rarely post on here but just like last year..

Happy birthday to someone I used to know. You're 18 now and I wish more than anything that you be celebrated, loved, and appreciated and you better enjoy every second of this day because I know you have good people around you who will celebrate you. Even if it's a little different this year. 
You don't know how badly I want to be one of those people to celebrate you and all you've done and how far you've come but I guess things just don't always work out. There's so much more I could say to you and so much more I wish you knew but like always I still wish the best for you every damn single day. I'd never want anything different. 
I hope you're doing well and again happy birthday you better enjoy it.
