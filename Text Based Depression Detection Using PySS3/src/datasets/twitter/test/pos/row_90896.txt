I dont want to chase these girls anymore Like i feel im better of alone even tho that also sucks.
Girls around me treat me like shit, like im not human. Im tall asf and i think i look average but they call me scary and ugly. I am friendly to people i wouldnt even hurt a fly except for if someone annoys me(thats common sence).

I have been blocked by girls because they say im weird while i never had talked to her literally never. I also feel that i cant express myself and be who i want because people make fun of you very fast. A lot of people around me drink and do weed and i dont, i have been made fun of because of that. It feels like i am never doing enough.

I think i should pass this schoolyear and work out more so i get buff asf instead of this bs now. Then they still wont care about me if i am buff but atleast ive bettered myself.
