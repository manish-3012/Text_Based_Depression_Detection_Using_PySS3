[TheFatRat &amp; Laura Brehm â€“ We'll Meet Again](https://youtu.be/hJqYc62NCKo)

Lyrics:

Suddenly, you're nowhere to be found.
I turn around and everything has changed...
Looking for a way to work it out.
I'm trying to find some peace to navigate.

â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢

The oak tree where I met you,
And the writing on the statue,
I still remember every word you said.
I'm not a soldier, but I'm fighting,
Can you hear me through the silence?
I won't give up 'cause there will be a day,
We'll meet again!

â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢

We'll meet again...

â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢

Everything we wanted turned to gold. (Turned to gold...)
The path we chose, the future on our side...
Never thought I'd do this on my own. (On my own...)
But now I wield the sword you left behind.

â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢

The oak tree where I met you,
And the writing on the statue,
I still remember every word you said.
I'm not a soldier, but I'm fighting,
Can you hear me through the silence?
I won't give up 'cause there will be a day,
We'll meet again!

â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢

We'll meet again...

â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢

Dark for the sunrise,
Clouds for a blue sky,
Space for the travelling star...
Strong from the inside,
You're still my life-line,
I feel you wherever you are...

â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢

The oak tree where I met you,
And the writing on the statue,
I still remember every word you said.
I'm not a soldier, but I'm fighting...
Can you hear me through the silence?
I won't give up 'cause there will be a day,
We'll meet again!

â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢

We'll meet again...

â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢~â€¢

We'll meet again.
