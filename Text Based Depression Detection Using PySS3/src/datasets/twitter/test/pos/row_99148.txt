Take your time and read the funniest joke I 've ever heard One day, in philosophy class teacher said to students that "I will ask you three questions and if you answer them correctly I will give you full mark"
Questions was:
1. What's logically incorrect but legal?
2. What's logically correct but illegal?
3. What's both logically incorrect and illegal?

One student stood up and answered:
1. Marriage of a 76 year old man with a 24 years old cute girl.
2. Cheating of this cute girl and having relation with another young boy.
3. This 76 years old man giving full mark to that young boy.
