Why is it so wrong to have an opinion or preference I said to my friend that I probably won't be getting a black gf any time soon, apperently that's racist. I just don't find that attractive, why would I have to force my self to like something like that or just straight up lie. I think it's crazy how you can be called racist for having preferences.
