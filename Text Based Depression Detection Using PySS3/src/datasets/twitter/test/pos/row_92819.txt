Did i jump in too fast? Plz read Basically i made a friend 2 days ago (i sort of like her). We both have just moved to italy and today we were talking about school. I was going to a different school than her and we both still havent signed up for our chosen schools. Bla bla bla she said "hey you should go to my school" and i said yeah sure lemme ask my mom. I took this seriously cause as said in the first sentence im kind of into her and i havent learned italian so it would be nice to have a friend. My mom agreed and also my dad. And im getting a feeling that she got a bit weirded out by this.
