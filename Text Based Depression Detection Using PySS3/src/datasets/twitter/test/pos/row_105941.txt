I am soo afraid of cristmas, I dont have any presents at all, I feel so bad Ik it's kinda my fault, but also kinda not because I was in an depressive episode and always said tomorrow, and from one day to another they closed all shops (which is reasonable, still didnt help me). And I dont even have something for my sister, and we're really close and she always has really thoughtfull presents and I'm too useless to even get her something. Also I'll have to be around people all day for the Christmas days, which I'm not a fan of
