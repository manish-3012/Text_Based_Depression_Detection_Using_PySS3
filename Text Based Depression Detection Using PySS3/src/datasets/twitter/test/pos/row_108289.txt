My girlfriend has a lot of problems, and its very overwhelming, even for me Im 15 and my gf is 16. We've been together only for a couple of months, but its become evident that there are a lot of things going on in her life, and its very stressful. I wont go into too much detail, but she has a lot of problems with affection, self doubt, her parents, school, and she's diagnosed with depression. Now dont get me wrong I listen to her anytime she talks about these things, and I try my best to be open and supportive, but the weight of what she's going through is really starting to set in, and im realizing that its really overwhelming and idk if I'll be able to keep up. I think im doing the most i can at the moment as far as listening and being understanding and patient, but im scared that these things will continue to pile up and get worse for her. I just dont know if theres anything I should do.
