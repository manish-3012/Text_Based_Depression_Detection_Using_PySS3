How do I not feel the big sad? I get the big sad sometimes and do not know why. I have dEpPrEsSiOn and AnXiEtY which makes me feel upset when I feel I have nothing to give others. Altho when I see cute dogs i feel a little better :). But when i dont see cute dogs and I think about sad stuff I feel really bad and just need a hug. Btw this isnt how I usually speak I just dont wanna really depressing
