I've seen more porn addiction-related posts recently, and I want to help everyone conquer their addiction and stop watching porn altogether. **Intro**

Porn is a menace, now more than ever. Think about it, how quickly can you find porn starting now? Probably a minute or less. That's insane, and it's an awful problem. Teens, adults, and now even adolescents (!) are succumbing to a porn addiction. According to [psychcentral.com](https://psychcentral.com/blog/sex/2013/05/the-prevalence-of-porn), the average age a person first views porn is *eleven*. Eleven is young, super young. Eleven year olds should be playing with legos and watching DanTDM instead of watching porn and jerking off.

**What is porn?** 

Porn, or pornography is footage, images, or animation of sex. This includes irl porn, animated porn (hentai included), and heck even fortnite porn (yes that exists ðŸ‘€.) Often, porn is studio produced, scripted, and very very fake. The guys are often pumped full of viagra and other drugs, and the girls are faking orgasm after orgasm as well as being 50% plastic 50% flesh.

**How do I know if I'm addicted?**
Porn addiction is pretty prevalent in todays society, with [5-8%](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/process-addiction/porn-addiction/related/pornography-statistics/) of adults being chronically addicted to pornography. This may not seem like a huge number, but keep in mind that porn is getting easier and easier to access. Also, aswell as the increased access to porn, my small, day by day usage was increasing into an addiction, which I have seen grow into an addiction.

**Yeah sure I use it, but what's so bad about porn?**
Porn usage (even once a day or less) can lead to several negative effects down the road should you continue using it. Negative effects such as PIED (porn-induced erectile dysfunction), which basically means your pp only gets hard with porn and nothing else, an unrealistic view of sex that objectifies women and sets the female beauty standard to big, fake breasts and skinny figures. Also, in hand with the failing sex education in America, many young kid's first view of sex is porn. Young boys grow up expecting their partners to do what the women in porn do. That leads to sexism and abusiveness and a slew of nasty stuff that men sometimes do to women.

**How can I stop?**
It's not easy to stop watching porn. Believe me, it's stupid difficult. You'll start making excuses like, "well it's only once a day, what's the harm?" or, "I'll only take a peek, it's just this once." But eventually you'll start realizing how dangerous porn is. You'll learn to jerk off without it, which actually feels way better since it lasts longer. Porn will start to disgust you, even when you're horny as hell. 
For me, r/pornfree helped my addiction alot. That may not work for some people, but they're a small and super supportive community that helped me reach 150 days pornfree. Another thing that helps is setting a counter for the amount of days that you're pornfree.

All in all, stopping porn is possible. It's hella difficult, and you might not believe what I'm saying. But, I hope that some of you try to nip porn in the butt, kick it in the balls and shove it off the empire state building.

Tl;dr porn bad lol
