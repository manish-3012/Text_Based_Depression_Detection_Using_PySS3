School Chaning Room Nightmare Hello so basically I have a swim class what seems perfecatally normal, only problem is.... there is a single changing room where 18+ (not age, number) boys get fully naked and change into their swimming suits. I didn't go to the class last year because I had a doctor's note but now I'm really fucking scared. Any tips on how to overcome this would be great because I'm scared shitless right now especially considering that while non of my classmates have said it, the behave very homosexual which in it self isn't a bad thing and I don't think anybody would look at my fat ass and go OMG I LIKE LIKE but still. Please help
