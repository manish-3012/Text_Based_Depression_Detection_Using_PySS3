I love my girlfriend so much Okay first off she's probably the smartest person I've ever met, she's also very kind and caring, she always give me her undivided attention. She has to be the most beautiful person in the world, she looks like a Greek goddess. She the only thing that doesn't make me hate myself, I really love her and I hope she knows how much I care about her.
