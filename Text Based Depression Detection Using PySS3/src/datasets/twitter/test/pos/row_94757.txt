I havenâ€™t had fun in months Ever since the first wave of online school in my area, my WiFi has been too slow to do anything more than load a google page. Downloads take days and online games (my favorite) are actually unplayable. This is especially infuriating because just before lockdown I bought my first PC and was super hyped to play it but now Iâ€™ve lost all excitement.
