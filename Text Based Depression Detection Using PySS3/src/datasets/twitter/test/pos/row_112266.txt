I just met the average fortnite player He is the son of my dad's friend and he is 8 years old and today i told him that i listen to travis scott and he told me he loved him but he couldn't even name one of his songs and he still believes in Santa thats your average fortnite player right there. Oh yea i went to his house and i watched him play he died as soon as he landed and fucking screeched my ears were bleeding
