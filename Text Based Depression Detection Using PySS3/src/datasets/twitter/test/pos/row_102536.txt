An accident ruined my relationship with my parents A few nights ago, I had to go the the bathroom. When I went into the hallway, I heard my parents having sex. It was unnecessarily loud and traumatized me. I canâ€™t even look my parents in the eyes anymore. I havenâ€™t talked to them about it yet but it got to me. Iâ€™ve been more socially awkward and I donâ€™t want to talk to anyone. I donâ€™t want to spend time with my parents anymore and donâ€™t even want to be around them. It fucked up my relationship with them.
