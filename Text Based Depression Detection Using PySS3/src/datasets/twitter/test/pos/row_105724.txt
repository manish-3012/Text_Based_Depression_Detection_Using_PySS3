Averages tell you nothing Letâ€™s do a little experiment, letâ€™s average Japans age of consent and there drinking age, you get 16.5, reasonable, but thatâ€™s not what they are there age of consent is 13 (about 3 years too low) and there drinking age is 20 (about 2-4 years too high) 

Also fun fact all phones sold in Japan have to have a really loud noise when they take a picture cuz panty shots are that big of a problem there
