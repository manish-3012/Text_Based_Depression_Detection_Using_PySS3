Romantic but with no outlet or idea of how to express it gang All this affection needs to go somewhere, otherwise I end up saying I love you to my pets every 5 minutes even if I have to walk all the way across the house to do it. I also end up fawning over pictures of people for admittedly embarrassing amounts of time
