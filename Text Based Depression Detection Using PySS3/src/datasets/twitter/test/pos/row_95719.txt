Just a thought, maybe anime labs should expand out of Australia cuz idk of an anime streaming service will be a viable strategy for long there Yeah their in New Zealand but thatâ€™s like two people 

Also how is Interspecies Reviewers still in anime labs in Australia, I think that falls under the category of 18+ from Japan
