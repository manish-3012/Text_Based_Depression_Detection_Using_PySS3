I guess this means I'm good at something apparently??? So, last week, a friend of mine asked me if I could do some artwork for the (relatively) new kindergarten she's working with

Me, being fresh to getting comissions, accepted of course, because how often does an 18 year old get deals like this? It's a first for me 


Even if it's not like a whole big wall, just a smaller cover thing, I consider it to be a big project

She asked me if I could do some typical child friendly art, specifically some butterflies, a sun, 2 bunnies under an umbrella, and something more, if I have ideas. I did a basic sketch kinda thing for the bunnies already, I think it's gonna be great! 

Give me some ideas on how I should do some parts of it, or what I should make. It'd be fun to include some of you guys' ideas :D 

Other than that, have a nice day everyone!
