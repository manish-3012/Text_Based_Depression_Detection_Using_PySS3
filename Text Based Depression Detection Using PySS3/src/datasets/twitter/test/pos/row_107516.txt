I hate how society royally bastardizes people who try to fit in with different social niches. I say something like, "I like historical weapons, so maybe I should sign up for a HEMA class." But there's that one guy who's like, "Lol! What a fucking mall ninja!"

I say something like, "You know, I think it's sad that anime doesn't get a lot of traction here with western audiences. There's a lot of great shows people are missing out on." But there's that one guy who's like, "Lol! You're a weeaboo who wants to be Japanese!"

I say something like, "You know, I really liked that book *Vindication of the Rights of Women.* Mary Wollstonecraft made a lot of great points in it." But here comes that asshole who's all like, "Lol! What a fucking simp!"

Just let people be fans of what they like without categorizing them into unappealing stereotypes. I can be a guy who owns a saber and have actual knowledge of how to use it. I can watch anime and still be hygienic. I can support women's rights and not just be using it as a way to get into someone's panties.
