Iâ€™m coming out as practice to reddit, as a lesbian After lurking for a while, I think I want to come out. Also, please note that I am a minor, so please do not sexualize me.

I realized it during Christmas time in 2020. But I realized I had a crush on girls long before that.

In third grade I remember having a crush on my best friend, but I got over that one. And over the years, I have been debating who I am.

For almost 2 years, I was comfortable with the label Pansexual, but only because I couldnâ€™t think of anything else.

But I realize now that I pretended to like guys to make my parents happy. Because if I could pretend like I liked guys, then I would make my parents happy. But Thatâ€™s not the way it works, and to be honest, I feel relived at finally realizing that I like girls only. And realizing that my parents donâ€™t care who I date as long as they donâ€™t groom me.

Iâ€™m coming out to reddit, as practice, but that doesnâ€™t change that Iâ€™m coming out for the first time. I have a lurking suspicion that I might be asexual, but thatâ€™s a thought for another day. For now, I can go this GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS


TL;DR I realized Iâ€™m a lesbian, and Iâ€™m happy with myself. For now.
