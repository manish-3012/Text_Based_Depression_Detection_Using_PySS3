umm someone just showed up at my house??? one of my guy â€œfriendsâ€ keeps trying to date me and he keeps simping for me (i donâ€™t like to use that word but itâ€™s the best word to describe it) 

iâ€™ve made it clear i donâ€™t want a relationship

my mom is quarantined and he said that he would send me a card, thatâ€™s fine just give it to me at school, but then he texted me and said â€œjust dropped off the card at your placeâ€ and it was ON MY FRONT PORCH

we arenâ€™t the kind of friends that show up at each otherâ€™s house to hangout often so thatâ€™s not an answer

he didnâ€™t even ring the bell or anything????? he didnâ€™t even say that he was gonna come by???? iâ€™m scared for my families safety 

iâ€™m 13f 
hes 13m

wtf do i do??
