Quick rant about the snowflakes I've been scrolling thru these posts and comments and it's honestly hurting me to see how many people just are so sensitive. While i do believe this generation is the greatest, i do believe this is the major problem with us.

You may be one of these people but don't worry, you can help fix the problem. 

When someone states their opinion or criticizes someone, do not get triggered. Do not try to change their opinion. 

If you disagree with them, either ignore them, or try to put yourself in their shoes. If you do this and you still cannot see why their opinion is as it is, that's fine. Just accept everyone is different and move on. 



Btw this was a guide for those people, in perspective you were already triggered. If you aren't incredibly sensitive, keep doing what your doing. 


Tl;dr
People are too sensitive these days so just be cautious before you respond to someone. Everyone is different and has different opinions so don't try to change that

if ur about to hate on me, ur one of those people. Just accept my opinion is different from yours and move on.
