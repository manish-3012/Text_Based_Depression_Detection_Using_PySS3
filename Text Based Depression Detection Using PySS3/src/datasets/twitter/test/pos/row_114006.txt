STOP OMG LITERALLY AS SOON AS A MONTH PASSES MY BRAIN FORGETS ALL THE BAD HE DID TO ME in the end he REFUSED to listen to my feelings

he love bombed me and made me feel like we were gonna be together forever and made me trust him. this allowed him to take back his i love youâ€™s whenever i wasnâ€™t perfect enough for him. i had to be perfect for him to want to love me

i CANâ€™T make peace with someone like that. thereâ€™s no use in trying. every time i tried i ended up getting frustrated bc he would only talk about other cute girls and â€œapologizeâ€ for things and then shit talk me to his â€œfriendsâ€ 

iâ€™m so FUCKED UP OVER THIS
