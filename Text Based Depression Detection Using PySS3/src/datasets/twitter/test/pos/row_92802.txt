I think my mother has completely lost it So basically a couple minutes ago my mom wakes me up to do something. I do, and she wants me to hold up a shelf with at least 20 pounds of stuff still on it. She wanted me to hold it up for at least 5 minutes. I physically cannot hold it up for that long. She was trying to put in a support, take the fucking shit of shelf. Now she is babbling like a mad fetus after being a miscarriage. The fuck?
