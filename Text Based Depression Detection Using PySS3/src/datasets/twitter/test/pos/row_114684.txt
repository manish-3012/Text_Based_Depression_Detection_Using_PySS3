How do I help my online friend through physical bullying? I would share an image if I can, but it's not allowed unfortunately.  
\[Image screenshot of my online friend with bruises and horrible injuries\]

My friend states that he is getting bullied my his childhood friends.  
He tried to report to the teachers, but the teachers ignored him and told him to "ignore" them.  
This made him lose his confidence and is afraid to tell his parents.

He is called a "simp" "online-dater" "trash" and many hurtful words because he talked to me.  
Even all these words, he still wouldn't leave me because I was the only good friend he has.

His money gets stolen, kicked on the stomach and chin, punched in the face which results in a nosebleed.

I can feel that he is going to take on his life anytime soon, I don't want him go because I don't want to lose an online friend, especially someone with the same birthday as mine (Our birthdays October 7th)  
Just yesterday, he attempted to commit suicide, but his brother stopped him.

I don't want him go, please I need advices. He means so much to me, we had fun together, despise being in a different state.
