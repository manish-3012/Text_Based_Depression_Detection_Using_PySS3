To whoever vandalized my car tonight On top of my house catching on fire last week, my injuries, my illness thats been making me weaker and weaker, me failing my classes, my jobs working me to death, and 1000 more things, thank you for adding another reason to the list of why I want to die.

Treat people the way you'd wanna be treated guys, its a simple fucking rule. There might be one less person on the planet tomorrow because of someone's terrible actions, and that needs to stop.

Don't just scroll past this, read it and understand that actions can hurt other people, and that what you do/say can deeply affect others.
