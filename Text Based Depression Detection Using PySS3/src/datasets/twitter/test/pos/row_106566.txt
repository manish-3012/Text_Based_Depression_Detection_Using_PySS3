Guys what do you think about my audition for britainâ€™s got talent? I was born at a very young age, the age of 0 infact. My parents were very abusive, they talked to me for 5 minutes after I detonated 16 megatonnes of tnt. I grew up to be a toddler, where i was infact SMALL! About 2ft tall infact. When i was a child, i got into the career of art and being a scumbag. I drew rtx duck images on the wall. So many infact, my parents had to hire an exterminator every 2 hours. It got so bad to the fact, my parents left me in my room for 13 minutes and 7 seconds, and I experienced pain and trauma in all those 13 seconds. Those were the most painful 5 years of my life.

I am here onto Britainâ€™s got talent to tell you a joke, why did the chicken cross the road?

Because the owner will never give him up.
Jesus wonâ€™t let him down.
The cars were gonna run around.
Hope desert him.
