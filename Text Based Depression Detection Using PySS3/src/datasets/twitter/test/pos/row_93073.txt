So I planned to confess to my crush... I wanted to do it in a day or two, and mainly because of my social anxiety, I had to plan out literally everything and prepare for every outcome. Not fun. Anyway, I felt like we'd been getting closer over the last few months, so I thought, maybe, just maybe. I was getting ready to confess in a day, but...

Turns out she's lesbian. Fuck.

NOTE: I don't have anything against LGBT+, it's just that I will literally never be able to have a relationship with her.
