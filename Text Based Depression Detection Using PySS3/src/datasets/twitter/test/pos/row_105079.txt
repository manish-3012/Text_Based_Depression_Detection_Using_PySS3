Why do parents think video games will rot your brain Because of this â€œfactâ€ I can only play 2 hours every day and no time on school days,  I would be fine if I could play on school days. Since I canâ€™t play on school days not counting fridays I can only play 6 hours a week, A WEEK! Some friends play that much a day. Also itâ€™s not like I donâ€™t exercise I do 3 travel sports.
