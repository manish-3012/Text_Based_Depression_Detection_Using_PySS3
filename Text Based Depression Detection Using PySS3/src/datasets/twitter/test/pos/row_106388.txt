What is with this community's obsession with trans people? Every day i see like 5 posts of cis people trying to decide things for trans people  
Examples:  
"Trans people can't know they are trans at 13!"  
"Trans people shouldn't be able to get HRT until they are 21"

Like, just stop, we can decide things for ourselves, we don't need someone who is cis to decide our entire life for us, thx
