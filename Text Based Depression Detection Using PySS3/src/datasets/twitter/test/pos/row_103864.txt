Guys need some help. Rude people in the comments. A couple of minutes back I posted pictures of planes I took with my new camera. Iâ€™ve been plane spotting for over an year and I love it. Itâ€™s really close to my heart. But a very rude person in the comments, u/erry991 has been attacking me, calling my hobby â€œuselessâ€ and â€œstupidâ€ . I have blocked him for now. He has really upset me on this beautiful happy day. Now my day is ruined and I almost cried. 

Just wanted the good side of r/teenagers to know.

If you want to look at the post. Look at my profile and go to the second most recent post ( after this one)
