Im concerned about what my crush may think Last night around 1~2 AM I was posting statuses updates in WhatsApp, whatevs, in one of those I talk about this guy I like so much. To which my crush replied with â€˜If you like him so much, why donâ€™t you talk more often?â€™

I didnâ€™t say much more than a simple, â€˜maybeâ€™ â€˜I donâ€™t knowâ€™, now Iâ€™m scared since he probably thinks I like someone else.. and if he felt something for me I feel like heâ€™s going to try to disassociate those feelings.. how do I tell him itâ€™s him at the same time not doing it directly? I donâ€™t know, just a rant.
