I know how to solve racism: BLM is bad. Now, when you saw the title, your mind probably did this thing called assuming, and you probably have a mental image of who I am and what I do based on a statement.

Assuming is both a good thing and a bad thing your brain does for you. If we can somehow get rid of the bad assumptions, then racism and other issues would be non-existent. 

Just like everyone thought George Floyd was innocent and wasn't resisting arrest, he was resisting arrest, and he was not innocent. (still, a fucked way to die tho) 

Just like how some bad people pull other people over and kill them, even though they are innocent.

People always assume instead of doing research. That's how riots start, how people die, and how war ignites, people are too caught up in what they assume is true then what's actually true.

But it ain't too late. Stop assuming. Literally, if another guy dies to a cop, don't start fucking riots and cause chaos, wait until appropriate evidence comes out, and act accordingly. That's how we stop this shit.
