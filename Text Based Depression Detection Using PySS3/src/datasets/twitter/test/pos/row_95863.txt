I hate it when people tell me that nobody saw this coming I remember February of senior year sitting in AP Lit and saying "shits gonna get real bad" to my friends sitting at my table. They of course asked what I was talking about, and then I went into my rant about this new disease in Wuhan, China. I remember one of my close friends at the time telling me (u/SuperSerratos your being a little dramatic). The girl who sat next to me (I had feelings for her at the time), gave me a look of concern. Throughout high school I've been known as the kid that is really smart, gets along with teachers, a giant meme, and well spoken. So for the next few weeks my friends and classmates were taken aback by me turning into a conspiracy nut about this flu in China. When Covid spread to Iran, I told my friends that things were gonna get serious and life wasn't gonna be the same. Instead they were concerned that I didn't ask the girl I liked to prom and just decided to not go (we never got a prom). Now I'll admit at the time it did seem like a lot of drastic measures but I would like to say in my defense that I never let it become an obsession; instead I lived a normal life and interacted normally with my friends but they made sure not to bring up China around me. Of all my friends only two of the bois had confidence in what I was saying, they had seen the news and now cases were appearing in NYC and Cali. Early March roles around and things start to heat up and in my  state Illinois, a lot of cases were popping up in Chicago. Hysteria was setting in and guess who suddenly became the local expert on the novel Coronavirus - 19, it was your boi u/SuperSerratos. Now that I'm gonna start University on zoom in by pj's; I'm just pissed off. Some kid on the Alabama side of Illinois was a step ahead of every government agency and politician. I saw Winnie the Pooh over in Beijing shoot China's economy in the foot over the flu and nobody in the USA thought, "hey if China is at DEFCON 1 over the flu, maybe its not just the flu?". Then the same thing happened to Iran, then Italy. At every level at every opportunity every adult failed to show that they could put two brain cells together and make a decision. Even right now, the town to the north of me is completely shut down because of a large outbreak but every night in my neighborhoods people host parties. Ironically the worst offenders were the police officers who live near me who's job it is to enforce restrictions. So whenever I hear local, state, or federal officials say they how nobody could have seen this, I just wanna say fuck you. I lost my senior year, no prom, never got to ask that girl out, never got to have graduation, the first time I sit in a college classroom will be as a Junior (I had enough ap credits that I skipped a year), and now as I sit in my room typing this everyday in my county 50 people daily get sick. The local hospital is at capacity and people still go out.

Kyle and Keeton if you by chance see this, thanks for believing me (even if Keeton is starting to think covid is overblown)

&amp;#x200B;

Hope still love ya even if you didn't believe me (since we are going to the same college I will bother you every day for an apology)

&amp;#x200B;

Erin yeah you definitely won't see this but sorry for not asking you to prom but also thanks for listening to my rants about economics, politics, etc. and just nodding your head pretending you know what I mean when I say "Quantitative Easing" or "JPOW and his money printer can eat it".

I said covid was serious back in February but nobody listened. I was right, they were wrong. I told ya so
