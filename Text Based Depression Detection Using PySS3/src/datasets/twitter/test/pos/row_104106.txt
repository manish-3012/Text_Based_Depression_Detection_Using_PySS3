Why is my room my favorite place It doesnâ€™t fucking make sense to me I donâ€™t have a television in there or any books but laying in my room as I slowly move closer to death is what I want to do and I donâ€™t know why, not suicidal but more not trying to prevent death as I lay motionless. Why do I enjoy it
