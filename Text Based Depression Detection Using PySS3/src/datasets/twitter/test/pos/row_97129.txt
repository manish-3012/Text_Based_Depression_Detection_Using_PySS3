Hey here's a rant of a dreamer Hello, welcome to my dream. I live in Portugal and my dream is to have a big farm in the USA. Have a calm life, a gorgeous wife 2 kids (preferably boys) and some dogs. Preferably Oregon because I love that place. I want to have a farm near a small town with some people that are like my family. Nowadays I live in Portugal, I have a big farm but I love the American life style and whether. And that's my dream thanks for listening and if you want, send me your dream to my dm, or don't. I'm here if any of you wants to talk.
