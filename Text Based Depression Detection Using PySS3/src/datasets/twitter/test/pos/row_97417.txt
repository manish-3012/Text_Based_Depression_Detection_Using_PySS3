Why do people say your teenage years are the best moments of your life? It has been 4 years since I became a teenager and I still have 3 more years to go but the recent years have proved to me that my teenage life has been really shitty to me

and it might get worse as the years go by (judging by the recent years)

i honestly prefer my childhood over my teenage years
