How to get over the fear of growing up? Last month I turned 15 years old (Btw Iâ€™m not accepting any messages cuz last time I did that some asshole tried to groom me) and recently Iâ€™ve had an intense fear of time going by, Iâ€™m really scared of turning 16 years old, which some people apparently consider a semi-adult; and itâ€™s only February, how do I get over this fear? And how do I learn to accept time? 


Also I hope youâ€™re having a great day today
