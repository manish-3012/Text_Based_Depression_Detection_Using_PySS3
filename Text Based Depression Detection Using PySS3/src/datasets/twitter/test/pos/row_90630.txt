So my mom's old teacher got arrested- Happy Late Thankgiving, yall-

So yesterday night, we were eating our Thanksgiving dinner, like every year, and my mom was scrolling through her Facebook, and (I think) she started to either laugh a bit or she said "oh my god", I didn't think much of it because usually whenever she laughs or says that, it's just some meme in another language she understands, or a funny video (ex. a house for a car \[no, not a RV, a literal house as a car\]) but it wasn't that, it was her old 5th-6th grade teacher that got arrested because of showing pornography to a student. *(he was in his mid-late 30's but looked around 24 from the picture they showed)* 

*S*howing porn to a student when you are an Adult is actually illegal since it's Child Sexual Abuse Imagery (according to Google) . What I also learned from my parents, school, and my old therapist is porn isn't accurate when it comes to sex since it's not really educational and it's mainly a Male's POV in the videos. &gt;!I knew this since a couples months or a year or a half a year ago, I watched porn and got caught watching it, don't ask.!&lt;

**(imma be off topic for a bit, but bear with me)**  It would be fine if it was a sex education video since, well, it's educational for students, it shows what happens when they get older, and it's more accurate, but if it's porn and if you are using it as a way to show it to a student, well \*BONK\* Horny jail for you. 

Anyway, back on topic. So yeah, my mom's old teacher got arrested, and I think he had a wife, at least that's what my mom said though. after my mom reading the article about him and how it happened My mom said,  *"welp, now his whole teaching career is fucked up entirely. He ain't getting another teaching job now after that."* 

Now that is what I call "Embarrassing".
