I fucking hate Twitter How fucking brain dead are you to try to cancel people like quackity over the language **HE NATIVELY SPEAKS??** How are you so fucking bored that you just go attack jacksepticeye over a joke because you canâ€™t cope with the fact that you donâ€™t have something? How is your life so fucking sad that you dox a person over them posting a picture of their Animal Crossing Character? This is why I will never use Twitter and I am disgusted at the fact that people defend these actions. 





So anyway, how has your day been Reddit?
