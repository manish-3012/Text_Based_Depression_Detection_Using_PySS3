My best friend, whoâ€™s bi, told me that she used to like me I had no idea she was bi until she told me that she used to like me (Iâ€™m straight). Keep in mind she â€œused to,â€ so she doesnâ€™t anymore. How do I respond to this? I have never dealt with this before and I donâ€™t know how- someone please help Iâ€™ve known her for 8 years and I donâ€™t want to say anything stupid!
