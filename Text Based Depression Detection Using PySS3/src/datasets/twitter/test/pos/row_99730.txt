I hate when teachers make all their documents/powerpoints automatically download 
Like I hate wanting to go look at the syllabus and having it just download or just a stupid document. No I dont want that on my laptop please just make it open on a new page as a pdf. If I deem it worthy to download I will, just please dont force my laptop to take it. Its just so annoying oh my :(
