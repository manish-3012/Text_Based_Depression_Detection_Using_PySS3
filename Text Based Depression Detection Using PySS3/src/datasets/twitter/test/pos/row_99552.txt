sheâ€™s gone i donâ€™t know. advice? rant?

when i started ninth grade, i had a thriving social life. i had a friend group. i has people that loved and accepted me. if i was having a bad day i had dozens of people i could talk to. the theatre community was like that. 


but it didnâ€™t help. i was depressed. iâ€™d attempted suicide so many times. i wish iâ€™d have stopped. i wish i hadnâ€™t lied to my school counsellor or my friends or my therapist when they asked if i was ok. 
 
 
because i didnâ€™t get to go back to that school. i went to treatment and i left social media. iâ€™ve been back home for almost two years. iâ€™m headed to college, but with no friends. i miss them. everyone thought i was gay (including me) and i had a fake gf as a joke. i miss her. even if we were always friends, i knew that there was someone who i could hang out with and who would listen. 

i miss by best friend, too. i miss them all, and theyâ€™re all gone. i realized that their contacts are still in my phone, but mine probably isnâ€™t in theirs. after all, i spent an amazing semester with them, while theyâ€™ve had years together.  
 


 
idk. i guess this was a rant. like i said, i donâ€™t exactly have anyone to tell it to. advice? due to covid i canâ€™t really go make friends and i just wish i could go back. i donâ€™t know if iâ€™ll ever have that kind of community again. iâ€™m doing college online bc i got a full scholarship to asuâ€™s online program. iâ€™m stuck. i donâ€™t like making online friends bc of the shit itâ€™s gotten me into in the past. i donâ€™t know what else to do.
