Who here likes space? Because you remind me of the stars, you remind me of the infinite galaxy, every time I look into your eyes I wonder why I haven't talked to you sooner, my love for you is ever-expanding, I would spend hours looking at the milky way that is your eyes, you are all I love, I would spend my life trying to find out why you're so beautiful.

To anyone who needs this, thanks for your time!
