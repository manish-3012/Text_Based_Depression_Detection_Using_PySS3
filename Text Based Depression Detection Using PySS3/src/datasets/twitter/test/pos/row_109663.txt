A friendly reminder of things you should probably be cleaning at least once a month... 1. All of your linens: sheets, pillowcase(s), blankets, comforters, quilts etc. Just take a day yall, just a few hours and it will be as good as new. I would say stuffed animals too but I know I have some with sentimental value that I just cant bring myself to throw in the washing machine lol.


2. Your water bottle/ coffee cup: I shouldn't need to explain this, especially in these COVID times. Make sure you clean the part where your mouth goes and the straw on the inside if your cup has it


3. Your bath towel and washcloth(s): again, ur gross, clean ya damn towels the same day you clean your linens. Same wash cycle (unless you are washing colors with whites, don't do that)


4. YOUR ROOM: doesn't even have to be a deep clean, but choose one thing to do at least. Vaccum, dust, take your dishes out of your room, organize, do laundry etc. Just try ok I promise you will feel better if you do.


5. Yourself: I understand mental illness, but please take care of yourself and your personal hygiene too. Take a nice bath, brush your hair, drink some water, eat, brush your teeth and be nice to yourself.


I don't even know if anyone will read all of that, but if ya did I hope you have a great rest of your night/ day :)
