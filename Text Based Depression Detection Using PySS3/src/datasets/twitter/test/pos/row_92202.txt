trump isnt so bad of a president would post this on r/politics, but that wouldnt fit the 'orange man bad' narrative they have on that shitty ass excuse for a sub and id get downvoted into bedrock by all the braindead leftists. sorry, enough of my ranting.


trumps perception to the general public is only the way it is because of mainstream leftist media. they take anything he says out of context and project it and use shove it down peoples throats so they believe their lies and deceit.


trump speaks truth, he says it like it is. unfortunately, people dont like that. because the truth hurts. but luckily for us, there are the 1%, such as myself, who have such glowing, ape brains full of knowledge and wokeness, we can comprehend trumps truly deep, profound, though-provoking and intellecutal speeches. i can confirm trump indeed is a species beyond our imagination. he has transcended the boundaries of human intelligence. anyway, enough about that. it was semi-ironic, by the way.


and who else have you yanks got to choose from? slow  ass sleepy joe who probably has more accusations of molesting minors than presidential experience. or kanye who, as a huge fan of him, i still dont believe it, lmao.


what the fuck has trump done that any other of your 44 presidents havent done or something worse.


anyway it doesnt matter because your country is fucked anyway. you may as well have harvey fucking weinstein in your office. go on, eat your cheeseburgers and shoot people
