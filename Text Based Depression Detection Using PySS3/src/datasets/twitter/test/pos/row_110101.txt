Youtubes really scummy for announcing theyre gunna stop doing community captions Like bruh theres people who are deaf and hearing impaired who rely on those to understand the video better. Plus people who watch channels in other languages use them to understand it in their native language.

Youtube really doesnt care about its platform tbh if its gunna remove an accessibility feature like that
