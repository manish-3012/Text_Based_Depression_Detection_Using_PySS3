I'm non religious and I'm just curious and i have to ask. I grew up non religious. And i still am. I know only 2families irl that are religious. And i was never involved in something like this. But is there like something in the Bible that in short says : "Everything non religious is bad, be mad at all people who think the opposite. " Or something like this. Because i saw a lot of stories where people scream at people that they should be glad that God gave them live ect. Isn't God supoosed to be like a nice person? And aren't they ashaming God by the way they are presenting him? 

I'm rly sorry if i sayd anything stupid. I'm just curious.
