ME AND MY CRUSH ARE OFFICIALLY DATING! So there was this girl I like, and I think she liked me too. We are in the same class but didn't really talk to each other. When the virus came, we had to do an assigment together, so we started talking more often. We got on really well, and continued to talk after the school ended. Now I asked her out and she said yes. We are going to the park, eat ice cream or something tomorrow.
I AM SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW
