Note to self: never try to sing in the kermit voice again So my friends and family think I do this good kermit impression. I don't think its nearly as good, but I tried making a cover with the kermit voice as a joke. Normally I'm pretty self conscious about my voice but I figured I'd give it a go.



It went horribly. I was even really trying to hit the notes, but I still fucked it up horribly. Idk if I should practice it or just give up entirely cause it feels like its cringe.
