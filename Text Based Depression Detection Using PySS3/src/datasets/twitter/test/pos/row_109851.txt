When will someone actually find me attractive and like me? This stuff hurts. I feel like Iâ€™ve been rejected so many times Iâ€™ve lost my will to go and find someone.  Every time I end up liking someone they always reject me. Why are girls so mean? :/ Is it something with my face? Is it my personal interests? Is there actually someone out there who has general feelings for me because at this point I want to give up.
