In need of tips and help I moved to a new country and school and In the place I live there isnt any "English" schools or anything like that, I have to learn the language. 

And after that one year I somehow managed to move from 8th grade to 9th I need help because I'm lost and my parents told me to try my best and I have to learn so many things...

can anyone give me tips or anything like that?

I'd appreciate it alot. :&gt;
