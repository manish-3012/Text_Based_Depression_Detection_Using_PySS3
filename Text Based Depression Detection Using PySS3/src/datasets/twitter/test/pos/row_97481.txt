I am not even mediocre Hereâ€™s the thing I keep trying to be mediocre at anything but Iâ€™m still bad so bad at everything, I see people my age and younger that are way better than me in the only things I thought I was decent, and even when someone says well you should just practice more I just think what is the point cause I try so much I really try and Iâ€™m still bad I see people here posting great art and talking about their friends and family saying how proud they were of them and then look at me sitting alone on my room making bad art that no one in my family will see and will get 10 likes on Reddit by someone strangers that I will never meet with 1 friend that hasnâ€™t talked to me in more than a month remembering that every time I try to make friends they stay with me for a week and then leave they always leave why does everybody leave I just want someone to really stay with me I keep hugging teddy bears and plushies hopping to hear a heart beat or fell some heat just wanting someone with me I would literally do anything for someone to stay I keep trying to get my shit together but I canâ€™t I donâ€™t even know weâ€™re to start and I just give up
