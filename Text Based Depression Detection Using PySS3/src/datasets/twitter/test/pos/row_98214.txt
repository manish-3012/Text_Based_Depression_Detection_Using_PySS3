Iâ€™m lost I donâ€™t have a good reason to get up every day. I just do. I donâ€™t feel like anyone wants to see me. I donâ€™t enjoy school or sports. I donâ€™t do anything fun on weekends. People are confusing and annoying. My crush likes me but is playing hard to get and avoiding me. I want something to look forward to. I want a reason to get through a class. I want a reason to do better and to be better.
