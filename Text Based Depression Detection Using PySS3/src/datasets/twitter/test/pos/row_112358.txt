My dad started a youtube channel He started a youtube channel where he talks about French politics. He put a lot of effort into it and I think the result is quite good considering he's 57 and not used to Youtube at all so he had to discover and adapt to nowadays standards of making Youtube videos. I'm quite proud of him and felt like sharing it with you guys. Not all boomers are boomers. 

For my French or French speaking fellas who want to watch it, here is one video from his channel that I find particularly interesting : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BWnr-Bb\_PY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BWnr-Bb_PY) .
