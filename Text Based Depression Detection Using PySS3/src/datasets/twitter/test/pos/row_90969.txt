Does anyone else just get nervous about every little thing? I donâ€™t know why i get nervous, but i worry about every little thing i do. if i eat that grain of rice will i be eating more than i should? if i text that person, am i being dry or giving bad vibes? does anyone else get this. it started about a year ago and it has taken over my life. does this happen to anyone else?
