Nothing like sending the girl you like a snap telling her she added u back. Now you are probably seeing the title and wondering what that is supposed to mean. Let me explain but first some background. I have never talked to girls outside of friendship. Now here we are a few days ago. I'm feeling the energy to make a move, but I don't have her on snap so I add her. My school had just got shut down cause of rona so I didn't have any chance to talk to her in person. Now fast forward to 2 hours ago, she finally added me back, and I didn't notice til about 13 minutes ago. When I finally noticed I opened snap and told my friend she added me back and asked if he thought I should wait til school in person resumed or if tonight was the move. Only it wasn't my friend who I sent that message to. It was her. Thankfully I noticed the name before she saw it, so I deleted the message but now she got a notification saying that not only was I typing but also that I deleted a message. So I say "sorry, please ignore that". Those words exactly. Then I text my friend. FOR REAL THIS TIME, that she added me back and that I just sent the text for him to her. His day was ruined and his disappointment was immeasurable. So she finally sees that whole fiasco and says ok. To which I reply "yuh, my b" Those exact words. So now I'm not sure whether she thinks I'm a weird freak or just an idiot. Now I'm not even sure if I should try and salvage the operation or completely call it a failure. The moral of the story pay more attention to who you are sending things.
