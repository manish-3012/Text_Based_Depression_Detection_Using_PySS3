So TIFU by moaning in public For the past few years I have given up on waiting for the shower to heat up. I just step in the cold stream, and let it warm up while I'm in  it. I usually moan when I step Into the cold water, originally because I thought it was funny, but now out of habit. 

Today at work my coworker spilled cold water on me and I moaned like a fucking dog trained by Pavlov and he just looked at me then walked out.

I want die.
