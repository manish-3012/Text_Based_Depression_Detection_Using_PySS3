Slight dilemma for me So I have this friend group and half the people in it are super toxic and overall just not fun to be around at all. The other half are some of my best friends on the planet and the funniest people I know. Iâ€™m not really sure what to do because I canâ€™t just start only hanging out with the half I like because thereâ€™s 4 other people even thought I personally donâ€™t like them.
