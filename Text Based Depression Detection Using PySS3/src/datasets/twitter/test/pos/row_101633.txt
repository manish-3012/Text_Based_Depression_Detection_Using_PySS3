I HAVE OVER OBSESSIVE PARENTS So i'm basically a huge nerd who spends most of her free time here....my parents are extremely pressurising (on an academic level not in any other way)...all my life i've thought of them as extremely perfect human beings with great jobs who excelled with their studies imminently and with great success..and somehow they expect me to be that too...does it count as child abuse for making your kid study for 12 hours each day?...if it is i'm done...i'm tired of meeting up to their standards...they want me to reach some kind of other universal level of academic excellence...i'm tired i need to sleep now-bye
