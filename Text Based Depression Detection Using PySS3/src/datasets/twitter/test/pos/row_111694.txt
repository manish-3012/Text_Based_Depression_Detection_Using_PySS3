I am going to stop watching porn After being diagnosed with post nut depression (self diagnose of course) I have come to the conclusion to stop. I will do my best and beat the horny. it has been around 20 hours since that last nut and I have never felt so alive. I feel like I can do this. I might have failed No Nut November, But this I can do. I hope this inspires your own journey.

\-truly yours, Jonnitro50
