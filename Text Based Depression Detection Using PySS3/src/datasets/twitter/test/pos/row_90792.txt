Do I have a problem? Iâ€™ve been under a lot of stress lately with my girlfriend(16F) and my best friend(16F) and itâ€™s just been hard on me so every once in a while Iâ€™ll drink at night. My best friend and my girlfriend both hate it yet theyâ€™re the ones to get drunk first and say shit that they wouldnâ€™t otherwise. But when I drink all of a sudden drinking is a problem because theyâ€™ve had people in their lives who were men and who drank. I asked what my girlfriend was doing tomorrow bc itâ€™s my day off and she says sheâ€™ll be cleaning all day so I told her Iâ€™m planning on getting drunk tonight with a friend and she says Iâ€™ve been drinking more lately and that Iâ€™m starting to remind her of her dad(alcoholic abusive) but Iâ€™ve only drank twice when things got bad for me. Now I wanna have a good time with a friend before my day off to deal with the hangover and Iâ€™m the bad guy. What do you guys think I should do, or any advice yâ€™all could give?
