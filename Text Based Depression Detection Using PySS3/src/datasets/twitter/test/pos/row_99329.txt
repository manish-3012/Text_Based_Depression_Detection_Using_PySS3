Help with crush Ok, so I have this crush right, her birthday is coming up, weâ€™ve been really good friends recently (talking for about 4-5 hours every night) and for her birthday sheâ€™s inviting me over, Iâ€™m not really sure if I should confess, I worry that it might ruin our friendship,I feel like even if sheâ€™s chill about it at the moment our friendship will never be the same, can anyone Iâ€™ve me advice on how to confess/should I confess?
