The feel bar has opened. Tell us what's bothering you. For me, it's about  a guy who said she would fuck a girl. The girl doesn't know that he said this. They are friends, but it disturbs me that the guy who she thinks is a friend is not a great friend after all.

That girl is my current gf. That's why it's bothering me more.
