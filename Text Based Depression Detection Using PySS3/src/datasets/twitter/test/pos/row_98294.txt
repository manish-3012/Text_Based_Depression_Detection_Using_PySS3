I'm going to highschool, tomorrow. I'm going in as a freshman tomorrow, it's online of course, not I'm not scared, nor excited. I don't have any friends that I know going there, so I'll be completely alone during school. But, I don't feel anything about it. I feel like that's kind of weird to not feel anything for. If you have any advice for my first year, of what I heard is hell, I'd like to hear it.
