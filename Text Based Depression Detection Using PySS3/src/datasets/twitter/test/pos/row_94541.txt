I feel like i have a evil prescence that lingers with me Do you ever get the feeling that something in your life goes bad on purpose because of something greater pulling the strings? Wether id be someone or something. Something that still happens to me to this day is that, whenever i go to sleep, ill wake up, but not actually be awake physically, only mentally. (No im not talking about sleep paralysis) when im in this state, im able to hear whats going on, (like the tv being on for example) but my eyes will still be closed, and im not able to move. Also when im in this state sometimes.........its very hard to explain, but it feels and sounds like im being swallowed by something, for the most part. Like im being put in those things lile im about to be chopped up. (If you don't understand then sorry, thats the best i can picture it you) I used to wake up alot during in the middle of the night. Usually around 2-4 am, because either id be my mom checking up on me, or 2 for no reason. But this paticualar reason has been going on ever since i was about 12. I was reading this thing today about how when you smell something burning, but theres nothing that could be indicating that something is burning than that means that theres a ghost/demon near you or watching you. Which happened at the park today 6 hours ago. I was swinging on the swings with people around doind sometime of dance lesson, and i smelled something being cooked. But there was absolutly nothing in sight in the park that could be the cause for the smell . I Also hear things that i shouldn't be able to hear. Like (and these are things that i actually happened and can recall)

Hearing my doorbell ring in the middle of the night( more than once a month)

Hearing something being moved in the other room.

Well to end this off, overall i think i just have bad energy
