My childhood friend died of cancer I knew her from kindergarten. She went to she same primary school as i did. Her name was Jette. She died of cancer in the end of the 1st grade.
She was very close to me and i have always supressed my sadness, but now it all comes up.

Ill stop my rant now because surely you have something better to do than read my post
