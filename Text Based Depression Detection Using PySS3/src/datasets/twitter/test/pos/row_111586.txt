I fucking hate the school system (vent) Like i wanted to get into programming because it's my dream to make games but I can't go to programming middle school because of some damn numbers that don't even mean fucking anything in the real world and now thanks to that i won't be able to do my dream job and will at the best have some 9-10 boring office work job because some asshole thought that making someones future depend on if they give a fuck about a class that doesn't even have a goddamn fuck to do with the job that the person want's to go on and if they just don't agree with the teacher about something or just have problems with learning that they will have their entire future fucked thanks to a system that is making 90% of students depressed and just is fucking awfull in general even though that person could have actually succeeded in the job but they now will probably not even be employed thanks to a system that is just so personality specific in an age that is just so emotionally unstable most of the times because hormones and shit is just fucking stupid. And i ain't the only person like this there are so many kids that just won't have any fucking future because they have to be "good" at something they are not interested in at all is just fucked. God damn
