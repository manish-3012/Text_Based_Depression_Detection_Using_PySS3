The sacred texts: How to talk to girls/How to get a girlfriend #  Introduction

Hello boys, welcome, you probably clicked on this post because of the title, but first we gotta set some things straight.

This is, by no means, a step-by-step guide on how to get a girl to like you/have a date, or some infallible rulebook of how to interact with someone you like, this is just a compilation of the knowledge I've gained through experience, investigation and good advice from other people that I think a lot of you need and would like to know.

And before you go on all reddit-detective on me, yes, this is a fairly new account, yes, you have no reason or obligation to believe me, do what you want with the things I say and the information contained in this post. I just recently discovered this subreddit and found out a lot of you feel insecure and would like help or advice in the seemingly impossible task of interacting with the mythical creatures we only hear about in whispers known as "females".

This post was inspired by another post in this same subreddit asking this question, and realized I could make a better, in depth guide about the topic and open discussion about the advice I want to share with you, this will be a **very long post**, but I do recommend you try reading it in it's entirety, with this out of the way, lets start.

# OK then?

Remember: girls are, like us (maybe) human beings, and everyone has a unique way of thinking, feeling, has different opinions, tastes and characteristics, meaning that if something works on a girl, there is no certainty it will work with other girls, so I pretend this to be a comprehensive general advice or guide to help you talk with a girl in a comfortable and more effective manner.

# Hygene

Girls smell you before they see you, seriously, a lot of girls i've talked to about the topic say the same, if they catch a whiff of a nice smellin' guy, they inmediatly turn their heads, so having general good hygene is a **must** in being likeable to a girl:

* **Shower or bath regularly**: you don't have to be Mr. Clean, but please keep yourself not-dirty.
* **Use deodorant**: if possible, a good brand roll on antiperspirant, those aerosols commercials look tempting, but not only you're damaging the environment, they are generally less effective than using a good roll on antipersiprant where it matters and using cologne or perfume for the rest, but DON'T overdo it. Another no-no is thinking you can skip a bath by just putting on some cologne, **N O** believe me, it is worse to be sweaty or smelly and trying to cover it up with some body spray.
* **Cut your nails**: having long nails is DISGUSTANG, as much as it is a useful tool in some cases, trim and clean them regularly, having long nails is a negative on the list, especially if they are dirty.
* **Skin care is great**: Keeping your face and skin clean and soft is something a lot of girls like, would you rather hug a soft satin pillow or a coarse wool one?, regarding facial hair, this is a bit more divided, some girls like beard as a sign of masculinity, others like clean faces, so i'd just advice you to do whatever you are comfortable with, if you like you, I like you.
* **Brush your teeth**: Having bad breath is a major turn down, brush your teeth regularly to keep them clean, floss and mouthwash, not only because of your health, but having a clean mouth is important, you don't approach a girl with morning breath or a strand of meat hanging out between your teeth, it is not a bad idea to keep a breath freshener with you just in case, but it is not by any means a replacement for oral hygene.
* **Clean your ears and nose**: If, like me, you produce an insane amount of earwax, clean it out, ***DON'T PUT Q-TIPS IN YOUR INNER EAR***, those are meant to clean the outside of the ear, if you have internal earwax problems, consult your doctor or otorinloca- otorhinolacri- ot- you know what I mean. Blow your nose and wash it if necessary, having a booger or a earwax clump visible in broad daylight is simply put **BAD.**

# Behavioral advice

Knowing how to behave and think is important, so take into consideration the following points:

* **Relax**: It is easy to get nervous and start talking incoherently, babbling and stuttering. You must remember that girls are human beings, like you they have goals, feelings, preferences etc. they are also capable of being comprehensive and empathic, if you overanalyze and start thinking "I'm gonna f\*ck up" "I can't do this" "Where do I even start" you'll start spiraling out of control into embarassment or just freezing in panic. Be chill about it and try to have a little more confidence in yourself, everyone makes mistakes, so if you are calm about it, and don't give too much importance to something that doesn't have it, chances are, she won't either, maybe you can even get a laugh out of it. Breathe in and out, you don't need to learn a new language to talk to a girl (unless that girl does actually speak in some other language, duh).
* **Don't be afraid**: She won't bite... I hope... but seriously, the thing is, a lot of you fear rejection, you don't want your friends to watch you fail or fear the embarassment that comes from it, and even if a girl rejects you or just plain avoids contact with you, the downsides are nothing in comparison to the possible reward, and sometimes, even if you don't get a date, you'll make a friend!
* **Be casual**: If it is the first or one of the first times you talk to your "objective" chances are, you don't know each other, find out what she likes, ask simple and non-agressive questions. You shouldn't talk about your impressive collection of videogames or the lore of your favorite anime in the first date or interaction, keep things simple and casual, if you talk about complicated stuff, or act like "i'm here for you, tell me anything" you'll be uninteresting or you will end up on the friendzone (dun-dun-dun).
* **Be polite**: It sounds like something you are taught when you were a child, but it's true, most girls dislike mean or foul-mouthed men, be polite and use a basic brain to mouth "filter", be chivalrous and respectful, thee needn't to talk in old english, but be careful as to what comes out of your mouth.
* **Be sincere:** Sincerity is impressive for girls, makes it easier for them to trust you, this is both good for talking to girls and to mantain a relationship, you don't need to tell her what you do when you're home alone at 2 am in your bedroom, but being sincere when she makes you a question is certainly attractive.
* **Be yourself**: It sounds like a clichÃ© but *to be yourself is all that you can do,* talking to girls really isn't complicated, and it's better to have a girl like you the way you are, than by the way you appear to be, if you deviate too much from the "real you" you are decieving her, and like with false advertising, it ends in dissapointment.
* **You are top priority:** we've all seen the "simp" memes, and if one thing we can learn from them is: you need to care for you, you need to love yourself before starting to love someone else, accept who you are, work on your self esteem and care, if you feel down talk to a friend or someone you trust, work on loving you for who you are, if you have depression or feel unwilling to try and better yourself up, talk with a professional, mental health is just as important as physical health, and sometimes you need to stop and think, if you are doing more for someone else than for yourself.

# What do THEY like?

There is no unequivocal definition as to what a girl likes, but in general there are somethings that are pleasant to girls:

* **Good hygene**: as seen at the start of the post.
* **Chivalry**: it's not dead, it's just different, be polite and nice towards girls, complimenting how they look or dress is fine, this is not "simping", it's just being more attractive, but it does not entitle you to the love or praise of a girl.
* **Be natural**: don't be robotic or talk in a scripted way, chill, and let the words flow, if you make a mistake, as pointed out before, it's not the end of the world, maybe you can even get a laugh about it, lighten the mood, and be yourself.
* **Good posture**: don't go walking like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, try to walk straight, head on and lean foward! walking curved down is body language for insecurity, cowardice and fear, which is definetly not attractive. Adding to it, when in a conversation, leaning ever so slightly foward makes you look more invigorated and interesting, slouching and leaning back has the opposite effect.
* **Smile**: Smiling is scientifically proven to make you look and be happier, you'll transmit a happier and more confident and comforting aura, making it easier for women to connect with you, it makes you look more attractive and likeable. If you feel insecure about your smile or teeth, or have medical issues with them, consult a professional.
* **Look her in the eyes**: Very important, makes you look interested and confident, you seem to be more trustworthy and easy to talk with, talking with someone that doesn't look you in the eyes is not only rude, it transmits disinterest and makes you look feel bored.
* **Be healthy**: some studies and polls show girls don't really look for super buff, he-man like men, and being a little bit overweight isn't unattractive, but y'know, working out, eating good, and getting in good shape is a plus for most girls.

# Read the signs!

Unfortunately, females are weird creatures, they rely much more on body language and hints to show interest or disinterest, so you must pay attention to how they move and feel around you.

**If a girl:**

* Smiles
* Leans towards you (if sitting together, feet or knees pointed towards you)
* Opens their eyes a bit more widely
* Looks slighly down (or up towards you with their heads down)
* Plays with their hair while talking to you
* Breathes slightly or comfortably
* Nods when you say something
* You both breathe or walk in a syncronized fashion (accidentally)

They are most likely attracted or interested in you.

**If a girl:**

* Constantly checks the time
* Leans away or turns her back on you
* Breathes heavily
* Looks uncomfortable
* Looks everywhere except towards you in a fast pace

Chances are, she wants you away from her proximity ASAP

**BEWARE**: be discrete, remember these are assumptions, don't take these signs too seriously as we as men, have more difficulties understanding and observating body language, so we are prone to misinterpeting things.

# DOs and DON'Ts

Some of these might sound a bit "simp" like or old fashioned but believe me, some chivalry doesn't hurt, something else that doesn't hurts is knowing what you shouldn't do:

**DON'T**

* Scratch your private parts, simply put: disgusting, if you absolutely need to, go to the bathroom. If a girl is reading this guide, which I doubt, consider that our package sometimes is quite difficult to deal with, things down there often get, against our will: "stiff", "sticky" and "itchy", not to mention, our gonads fall right in between our thighs, so sitting comfortably does take more space for a man than for a woman (this is no excuse for excessive manspreading, respect other's personal space), not to mention that it sometimes makes walking hard (in more than one way), because of things falling out of place down there.
* Be stingy, pay the bill, and if you can, leave tips, if you act greedy and very stingy, they will be less likely to consider a relationship with you.
* Be your mommy's child, please just don't, you're not 7 years old, and calling your mom "mommy" and/or relying too much on her is a sign of poor independence which is a no-no in the girl's books.
* Take a lengthy phone call that interrupts your conversation, this will make her feel not interesting and will make her bored.
* Let your palms sweat, if you have naturally sweaty hands, you can use some talc or baking soda to reduce moisture in your hands, grabbing a sweaty hand is by all accounts, gross.
* Look at her cleavage, a quick glance doesn't hurt, hell, you might not be aware that girls also do look at our... qualities... (they look at our butts, our "stuff" and, in some cases, abdominal and chest area) but if you're talking to her DO NOT stare at the incorrect eyes, it is disrespectful and mean.
* Talk about your geeks (or heavy/boring/serious topics) in a detailed manner, it is not wrong to say you like X thing or consume X content, but unless the girl is into the topic, don't talk about the lore of Neon Genesis Evangelion, or a generally considered weird taste or kink unless you already trust one another.
* Talk about your ex(es). Especially in a disrespectful manner, apart from being a depressing or party bummer topic, they will think that if they become your ex, you will also talk dirt on them when you break up.
* Drag a friend to a date, if you want to talk to a girl, do it alone, and if you asked her out on a date, don't bring someone else, it's supposed to be just for you two, having a third wheel is uncomfortable and is, in some ways, a breach to the privacy girls look when dating a guy.

**DOs**

* Try to make her laugh, *it's a simple spell but quite unbreakable*, if you can make a girl laugh with ease, you have practically already won the game, girls love guys that make them laugh, it just happens to be that way. Do remember, humor works differently with girls, don't be mean, rude or insensitive.
* Learn to dance, or if you have a nice voice, to sing: most girls like dancing, and men with good moves are a rare catch, so knowing how to move it is quite useful, especially if you live somewhere where dancing music is prominent. Singing is also a powerful weapon, if you have a nice voice, learning how to sing a song, if you can nicely sing a girl's favorite song, she'll be prone to falling in love with you, why do you think serenades have been the ultimate courtship tool of men for centuries now?
* Gift her stuff, gifting is an art, it makes you look attentive and caring, qualities females look in their partners, and makes you automatically more attractive, especially if you gift her something she likes or is fond of, if you know a girl likes, say ducks, gift her a duck plushie or something related to what she likes, this is bound to be more impactful than something expensive but uninteresting to her.
* Show interest in her topics, people like talking about what they like, this especially applies to girls, they like men who can listen, if you find out about something she likes, try to ask her or talk with her about it, she will feel comfortable talking about it, and by extent, comfortable talking with you.
