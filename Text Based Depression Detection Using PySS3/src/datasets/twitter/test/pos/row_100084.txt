Saving the Arctic Basically the US Government wants to allow drilling of oil and gas in the National Arctic Refugee. There's a petition going on and it only needs 100k signatures. On 20th of January the law will go into action and companies will start destroying the wildlife there. So if you don't mind, please go ahead and sign it. It only takes 30 seconds.
