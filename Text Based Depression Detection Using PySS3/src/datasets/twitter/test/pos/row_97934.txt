Why is literally burning down cities â€œpeacefulâ€ but protesting in front of a building full of rich corrupt politicians â€œterrorismâ€? And when did everyone suddenly start respecting and loving the police again?

It just seems anything goes if youâ€™re on the â€œcorrectâ€ side, while those same things are considered awful if youâ€™re on the â€œwrongâ€ side.

Idk Iâ€™m white and Iâ€™m male so Iâ€™m probably just racist or something.
