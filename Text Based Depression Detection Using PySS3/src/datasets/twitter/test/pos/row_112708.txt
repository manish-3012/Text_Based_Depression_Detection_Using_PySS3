Is it too much to ask for I just want to have someone that loves me the way I do. I'm not saying my parents don't love me, they do and they're amazing. I have everything I could ask them, and no I'm not spoiled. My parents literally gave me everything I wanted. A brother? Check. A dog? Check. A good laptop and gaming equipment? Check. The only things I want to have in life is someone that would love me. I want to cuddle with my girlfriend (which I don't have) in an oversized hoodie, under a blanket drinking hot tea in the middle of winter while we warm up each other with our body temperatures. I may sound spoiled but all I want is someone I would care for, and they would care for me. I may be asking for too much because I asked for everything I wanted and got basically everything I wanted, but if I could I would take everything I have and exchange it for the love of my life. I'm lonely. I don't have any friends, and I don't have anyone I could take care of. Those are the last 2 things I want in life. Not only that but recently I found out that my crush was a lesbian, because I confessed my feelings to her. This hurt like a motherfucker and I've been feeling worthless, down and depressed ever since then and it doesn't look like it's gonna change any time soon. If there's anything anyone could say to maybe make me feel better or something please say it I don't know what to do anymore
