I'm going to die because the people where I live are morons I was sitting in my health sciences class. My teacher, a *registered fucking nurse* has her mask below her nose. A handful of students do as well. Later on she starts coughing relentlessly. She just got back from a trip to Colorado. People ask her about it. She complains they they made her wear a mask on the plane, and a student said that whenever she sleeps on planes (saying it like it's a common occurrence) she just takes her mask off because she doesn't like it... 

The teacher said that everyone in Colorado were a bunch of "freaks" being so careful over the virus for things like people giving her dirty looks whenever she went somewhere without a mask, or her not getting room service or coffee multiple times per day in her hotel room. Like holy shit lady, this virus is fucking killing people and *if you get it it will kill you with your shitty ass lungs from whatever that disability is you have! Take this seriously!*

I asked her how well she thought Colorado was doing containing the spread of COVID-19 and she, someone who is supposed to be a nurse, said she "doesn't really think about all that statistics stuff" like it confused her. 

I am going to die. My health sciences class is, somehow, the worst class in my day for people being stupid about this virus. That is all.
