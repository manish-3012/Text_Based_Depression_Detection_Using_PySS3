I no longer flinch when a hand is raised at me or swung Itâ€™s almost been about 4 years since I cut ties with my abusive father and I just realized I no longer flinch or instinctively block whenever a hand is raised at me or jerks/flails at my face. This might not be much off a crazy achievement, but itâ€™s just something crazy I realized after thinking about that life after such a long time...
