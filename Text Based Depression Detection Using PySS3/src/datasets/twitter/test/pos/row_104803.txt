Does anyone want to help with level design? (Sorry if wrong flair?) I'm planning on creating a Mari0 server using a custom 'Playground' style map with platforming, puzzle, and PVP areas dotted around on a large map. I don't really have a vision for the map, other than disjointed rooms connected by pipes/doors. If anyone wants to help please DM me. thanks in advance!
