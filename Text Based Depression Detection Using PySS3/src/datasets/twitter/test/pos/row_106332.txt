Online classes were great We in Lithuania (European country) started to go to school, soon to be a month actually while wearing masks. I can't say I understand at school better than I did when there were online classes, since after 2 lessons and short 10 minute breaks between them everything that the teacher tells, gets converted to junk as my head starts hurting. And getting back home, tired and sleepy I have to get ready for tests and shit. You can't even really cheat while writing one.

When there were online classes, you could turn off your mic and webcam for the entire time. Heck, I even got to take sleep breaks myself occasionally. Some subjects didn't even have online lessons assigned to them, like PE and those less important ones meaning that you had a hour or even two hours break. Lessons were shorter due to 40 minutes limit by Zoom as well. There weren't any actual tests, they were more like quizzes and you could google for the answers as some of the teachers didn't even bother changing those premade questions. You could also google the assigned homework and find full answers too. And even harder homework was easier to get done, since my head didn't hurt. I didn't do my homework that I didn't have to submit to teachers, my geography teacher even hinted about that. So in summary, they were A LOT easier, kind of a miracle that happened this year. Hopefully my school eventually gets quarantined and there will be online classes once again.
