I'm so leftist that... Should I be no more? I'm an 18 year old guy, single but not depressed at all. I have developed leftist opinion seeing all the right wing people creating blunders out of the world. As an unusual teenager it really affects me while getting mixed with anyone around, literally anyone. Not even old people wanna talk to me because I debate or idealogically clash with their old fashioned thoughts. I'm so leftist in my thoughts and speeches that my own parents keep making me realise that I'm oversmart and the world's system won't change, so I must change my opinion and thought process! I don't have any close friends because they all believe in right wing operations and supporting the right political agenda and accepting things as it is. When I try to talk to girls, their everyday intellect concerns me and I drown in my thoughts of how can a person be so stupid?(happens with boys too, didn't mean to be sexist!)

Should I end my life as I'll always, be looked down upon by the idiots or should I look forward to make friends with left-wing people?
