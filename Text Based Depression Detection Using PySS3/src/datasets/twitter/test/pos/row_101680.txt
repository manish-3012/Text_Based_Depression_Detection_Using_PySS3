Why is everything less colourful now? I'm not complaining, I personally love achromacy. I prefer the change, I'm just asking why it exists. The 90's were vibrant and colourful, now everything is muted, gray, sterile and almost dystopian. Why is following this colour scheme associated with being more "modern" and why is it preferred by everyone?
