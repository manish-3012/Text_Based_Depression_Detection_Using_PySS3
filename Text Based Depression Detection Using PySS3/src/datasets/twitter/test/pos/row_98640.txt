My crush said no So I've been seeing a lot of posts about people asking out their crushes and stuff. All of these inspired me and I decided to tell my crush how I really feel. I sent her a message and she just responded with "eew no" and blocked me. I've been feeling really down and needed to vent. Thanks for listening.
