Is my mom strict? so basically i want to know whether or not my mom is strict or not, because i want to know if im just whining or being reasonable. So to start iâ€™m not allowed to hang out with anybody, like no one. She makes me do chores all day. I have a phone and i have instagram but she reads all my texts and controls who iâ€™m allowed to follow. I have downtime on my phone from 9:30 PM to 9:00 AM every day which basically means every app is locked. i donâ€™t have a sim card on my phone because she says she doesnâ€™t trust me. I have a bank account but iâ€™m not allowed to spend any money from it without her permission 
btw iâ€™m 14
