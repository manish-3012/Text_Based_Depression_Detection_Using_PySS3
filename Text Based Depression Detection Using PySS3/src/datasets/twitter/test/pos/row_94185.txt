Wow! What am I supposed to do? Math teacher said me and a cute girl would be a great couple, and said he has put together couples before. I'm not confident and can't tell if she is interested. My math teacher gave me chocolate to give to her( I couldnt because nervous) and a student put them on her desk. She ate them... What should I do? I don't want to ruin the opportunity.
