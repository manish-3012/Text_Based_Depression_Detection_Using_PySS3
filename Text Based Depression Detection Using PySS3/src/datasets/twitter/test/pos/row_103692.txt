Day 11 of begging for awards heyyyyyy! you're great! you're awesome. thanks for sorting by new! you're doing the world a favor. see, if you don't sort by new, then no posts would get discovered, and only people who have many followers would get to hot, which means that no new redditors could have their posts discovered! at least I'm pretty sure that's how it works. anyway, plz give me awards. thanks!
