I am already annoyed and i woke up a couple of minutes agoâ€” So like, Iâ€™m in the family group chat, aka me, my sister and my mom. And like, itâ€™s fucking 11:44. Yes I wake up at this hour as last night I fell asleep around 5 am or something. 

So my sister, had a small conversation with my mom because my mom was gonna order us some food, and like, I donâ€™t care what food you give me, unless itâ€™s something I donâ€™t like and my mom sort of knows what I donâ€™t like. 

So my mom messages me while Iâ€™m still sleeping, but then I woke up to my sister randomly spamming the chat. Like, bitch Iâ€™m trying to sleep here. And then seconds after I get a call from my mom asking me the same thing.

Like, I get it you are trying to get my opinion but I donâ€™t care what kind off food you order.


So, sorry for the rant, Iâ€™m very annoyed.
