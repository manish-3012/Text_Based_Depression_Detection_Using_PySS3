I cant sleep in a room with my sister She snores very loudly. And i cant sleep at night. I haven't had a good night's rest in like a week or two. Id usually drown it out with some headphones but her snoring has gotten so loud no headphones will work. 

 I also cant get mad at her for it because she has a nasal problem but its so infuriating and i just want to sleep :(  Im just so tired man. Its 3:30 am right now and i think i will just have to wait until my aunt wakes up to go to work at 8. I would sleep in the living room but its so god damn loud i can hear it in there too. I just wanna cry and sleep now :((( but i share a room with the love child of darth Vader and the boar from the lion king. 

Now i lay here crying cuz my sister is snoring, and now i feel shitty cuz its such a stupid thing to be crying about. 

**help me**
