I donâ€™t feel love for anyone. Just lust. Anyone else? When I was younger (14-17), I felt strong â€œloveâ€ emotions for multiple girls and had many â€œcrushesâ€. However, I never feel that anymore. Iâ€™m 19, soon to be 20, and I feel no desire to even pursue a relationship because I never get that â€œbutterflies in stomach feelingâ€ anymore. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. I feel love for my family and some of my friends but I never even feel â€œloveâ€ for anyone else, even if Iâ€™m extremely attracted to them. I always feel the regular lustful feelings, but I never want to do anything long term or even attempt at dating because I donâ€™t â€œloveâ€ them. I remember in the past I could literally â€œfall in loveâ€ with a girl within 10 minutes of meeting them. That is never the case anymore. Anyone else experience this? Is something wrong with me?
