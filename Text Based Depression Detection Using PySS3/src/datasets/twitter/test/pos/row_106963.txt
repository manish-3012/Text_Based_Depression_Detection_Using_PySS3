Some ppl should realize their lives would be more enjoyable if they made better lifestyle choices Like a healthy balanced diet with 3 meals a day, consistent hydration, and good amount of sleep as well as taking vitamins everyday like omega 3 or magnesium for ur brain and getting some sunlight/being active 

Tbh itâ€™s not rlly that hard once u start taking those small steps toward bettering urself all it takes is some effort otherwise of course ur gonna hate ur life what would u expect depriving ur mind and body of its essentials
