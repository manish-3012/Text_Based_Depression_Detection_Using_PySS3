Hmmmm lot of you probably wont like this but lets do it. So I know 2020 has been the worst year for most if not all of us. But for a minute put away all the bad things that happened. Go back and try to remember, what one good thing happened to you in 2020.  I'll list mine. 

1. I started watching anime
2. I fell into the Vtuber rabbit hole. 
3. I started playing Tf2 (Team Fortress 2)
4. I got better at talking to people strangely enough. 

So tell me what good thing happened last year. even if its something super small it doesnt matter.
