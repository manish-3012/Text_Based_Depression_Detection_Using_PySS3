What are some IOS or mobile games I should try? So I found an Ipad a few days ago that got lost in my house for a solid year and was originally for my mum and its pretty new and functional and my game taste is pretty boring ngl. All i play is Clash Of Clans at the very moment and I wanna get a better taste at mobile games. Any suggestions?! (bonus points if its anime related)
