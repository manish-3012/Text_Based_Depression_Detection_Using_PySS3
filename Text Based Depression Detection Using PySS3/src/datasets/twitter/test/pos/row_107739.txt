i donâ€™t like who i am and i want to fix it so some hard shit made me do an overview of myself and i really donâ€™t like who i am, i donâ€™t have a good personality, iâ€™m not funny, iâ€™m skinny af, and just really donâ€™t like myself. but hereâ€™s the thing after fully realizing this i hate the thought of hating myself so i have to fix it. iâ€™m starting off with working out and eating better. i have a friend thatâ€™s going to help me with that but i think the biggest thing is my personality. if i was another person, i definitely wouldnâ€™t be friends with myself. i just want to be nicer, funnier, and be seen as a guy that people (and myself) like to talk to and be around. i donâ€™t really know how to change this tbh. 

i feel like iâ€™m an asshole half of the time and annoy people whenever i say anything and even i get annoyed at myself when i talk so i really need to fix this. if anyone knows how, please say something.
i need to change.
