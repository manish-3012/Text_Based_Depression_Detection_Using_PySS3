My crush teases me about my height So Iâ€™m a 5â€™2 foot female and my crush is a 6 foot  male, weâ€™re both 15. Lately heâ€™s been teasing me a lot about my height and how heâ€™s so much taller than me. Is this an attempt at flirting? I like him a lot but Iâ€™m not completely sure if he likes me back yet

Thanks in advance:)
