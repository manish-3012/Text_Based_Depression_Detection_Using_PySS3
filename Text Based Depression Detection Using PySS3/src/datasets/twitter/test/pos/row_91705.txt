I turned 14 today!!! So today is my birthday!!! Yeah! Well, as I'm writing this there's only like 5 minutes of my birthday left, but I have to be honest, this was a great birthday. I got to spend it with my mom, my dad, and a family friend that worked with my mom in two of her stores and took care of me when I was a baby, she's the closest thing I have to a sister and I'm really glad I got to spend the day with her and her baby daughter. Anyways, I'm finally 14!!! I still have the face and height of an 8 year old girl, but whatever. It's not my birthday anymore as I'm writing this so, to clarify, I was born November 12th, not the 13th. I just realized tomorrow (or now, I guess today) is going to be Friday 13th. Cool. Cool, cool, cool. Ha, Community reference (or Brooklyn 99, whichever you prefer). If you're wondering why I'm writing this when it's not my birthday anymore, well I spent the whole day socializing (I'm really fucking exhausted) and wasn't able to get online until now. So I'm writing this right now. Ok bye, I'm 14!!!
