They say it is not OK to want to be someone else or to compare yourself with another one, but... We all know it is kinda difficult. We always have that person in your social group. Maybe we don't talk with him/her, maybe this person is only someone you only know by sight. But he/she is there. We can think that this person, let's call it "X", has a better life than us, because we are teenagers and all of us wants lots of friends, a boyfriend/girlfriend, going to some parties, having fun 24/7, a few luxuries like a PC gamer, a great camera to take photos, the perfect bedroom, the latest iPhone... But, you know what? When you think about this, you are totally wrong. You shouldn't feel useless because X has more knowledge than you, you shouldn't feel sad because X has more friends than you, you shouldn't feel alone because X goes to more parties than you. And remember, all the stuff I mentioned before is barely always seen and known though social network such as Instagram, and the things are incredibly different when someone is behind a screen. 


You shouldn't compare yourself with someone else. You are unique, don't forget that.
