Bad posture The title says it all really, Iâ€™ve got bad posture and I really hate Iâ€™m but nothing seems to be helping with it. Iâ€™m 16 and want to get into relationships but feel as though my bad posture really makes me look bad, Iâ€™m also small which makes it worse. Does anybody have anything that could help me, as I feel itâ€™s more common for people to get posture nowadays and maybe some of you know some things that could help me, I would really appreciate it ðŸ˜Š
