So, this happened.  Hi everyone, I am a livestreamer desperate for more viewers on twitch and youtube. I won't advertise my channels so that my post doesnt get deleted, but they are all on my profile. I play Overwatch and Minecraft mon-fri nights and a whole bunch of other games on weekends. I have failed to gain much traction so far and I really need to. I stream over 200 hours a month on both twitch and youtube, I make my own art and my own video edits. Twitch has 0 discoverability, and I am really trying here to get to the actual people that could possibly be interested, but it's hard because most venues do not permit advertising, so I came here just asking you to give me a chance and check me out. If I suck, and you hate what I do, I'd love to hear about it so that I can improve. Thanks!
