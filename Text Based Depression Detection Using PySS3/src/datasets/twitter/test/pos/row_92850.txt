What is your political ideology? I'm genuinely curious about the average teenager's political ideology. If you can, I would like you to take [AltValues](https://altvalues.github.io/) or [SapplyValues](https://sapplyvalues.github.io/index.html). If you're 18 and a registered voter, tell me your political affiliation.

I'm registered as "unaffiliated" because I detest the two-party system. I don't really like to align myself to a political quiz or ideology but if I must, then I'm most likely a centrist/pragmatist. Here is my [AltValues result](https://altvalues.github.io/results.html?social=33.3&amp;econ=33.3&amp;essence=25.0&amp;moral=41.7&amp;apply=62.5&amp;ecol=50.0&amp;socpol=66.7&amp;relig=62.5&amp;aesth=50.0).
