I hate this website sometimes Like I will be in a subreddit of a topic I am new to and I ask a simple question and people reply being assholes because I didn't know something. The worst part is they fucking report the post and these stupid bots get it taken down. Why can't people answer the question instead of being a prick. Like why does a new person asking a simple question bother you so much? So what if the question may be stupid? They don't know shit so how will they know it's stupid! This is why I hate asking people for advice because shit like this happens.
