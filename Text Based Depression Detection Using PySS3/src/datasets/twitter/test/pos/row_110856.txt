Everything is going down Long story short, my parents are divorced, in the pandemic my mom lost 1 put of 2 of her jobs and now she is struggling with money. My mom wants to get 20,000$ from my dad to pay off the debt from the bank so we would have more money per  month, but my dad doesn't want to. I have a huge exam in the summer, we will enter in online school in this Monday so I can't see my best friend (a girl, who is the only one except my family who knows about this) and from what I heard an economic crisis is coming, meaning less money, where is happiness? Even tho I'm in the lowest point of my life, I don't have suicidal thoughts. But I'm just really anxious and panicked and very sad. What can I do?
