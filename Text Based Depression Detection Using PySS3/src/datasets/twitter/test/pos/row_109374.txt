School is bullshit School is bullshit, Iâ€™ve learned more things on my own than in school. School isnâ€™t to make you learn things itâ€™s to make you memorize useless shit that will never help you in real life. Like Iâ€™m supposed to write a 3 page essay about if the the narrator for the Edgar Allen Poe story â€œThe tell-tale heartâ€ is a psychopath or a sociopath. WHO FUCKING CARES?? THEYâ€™LL BOTH KILL ME. I canâ€™t think of a single way that will ever help me. Iâ€™m mean, like in the future itâ€™ll be like â€œsir youâ€™ve committed tax fraudâ€ â€œRight, but the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cellâ€ â€œwhy do you want this job?â€ â€œWell the narrator of the tell tale heart is a psychopathâ€ â€œsir thatâ€™s not how you write a checkâ€ â€œwell the square root of 36 is 6.â€ Do you see what I mean?? I mean what the fuck?! School wonâ€™t help me in life except give me a piece of paper that helps me get a job, WHICH THEY DIDNâ€™T TEACH ME HOW TO APPLY FOR. Have a nice day while I fail several classes.
