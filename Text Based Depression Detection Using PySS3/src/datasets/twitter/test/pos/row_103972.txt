I'm so tired so many classes.

Online class.

Google meets,zoom meetings,,,assignments,,ah...why is every subject at least 1 hour and a half???

I have like around 5 subjects to study a day (or more than that) and they dont even give a break time to rest for a while or sumn

They do but they're lik ok 5 mins break time to go to the toilet

Like dang wtf I couldnt even take a shower and sat through the class and not even paying attention while they're just talking and blabbering things I dont understand 

I literally gave up I dont understand physics it's still going on rn but I'm in my room writing this post instead
