a couple of weeks ago my friend and i were at school and wanted to jump out of the window to have a snowball fight. i told her weâ€™d get in trouble and she said â€œthatâ€™s future usâ€™s problem.â€ we proceeded to jump out the window and built a small snowman. the teacher locked the window on us and we had to walk to the main entrance of the school building in the freezing could weather

i had fun and will now be making all of my decisions by saying â€œthatâ€™s future meâ€™s problem.â€
