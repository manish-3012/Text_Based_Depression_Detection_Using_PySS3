Should i buy a switch? With my current job i would need about a week and a half of saving to get a nintendo switch but i dont know how i would use it. I think it would be cool to have a portable gaming device that i could take anywhere and it would be cool to put it on a big tv and play with friends but i really dont know if its worth it, help me out
