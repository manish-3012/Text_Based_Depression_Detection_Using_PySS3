I just turned in my recorded speech and after giving it another watch realized that my phone screen is reflecting in my glasses where I should have had a note card Itâ€™s right at the bottom of my glasses and probably not noticeable but itâ€™ll take just one â€œhmmâ€ moment and I done for. Should I rerecord it?
