My dog just died My dog was just hit by a car... his name was Albus, and he was the sweetest little thing... he was a chug ( 25% chihuahua, 75% pug) and he would always be so happy to see me when i woke up or came back from a walk, and now heâ€™s gone... and I really donâ€™t know what to do without him. So please be supportive, because I actually donâ€™t know if I can handle any hate.
