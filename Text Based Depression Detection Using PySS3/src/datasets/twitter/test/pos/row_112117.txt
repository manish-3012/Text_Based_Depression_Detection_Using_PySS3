I felt like something was wrong with me because my dad left us If you are growing up and your dad isn't part of your daily life, then you may be like I was.

I grew up in the 70s and 80s with four older siblings and our mom.

We saw our dad once or twice a year, since he lived out of state, and wasn't around for us.

I didn't realize it then, but as I got older I started to feel like something must have been wrong with me, if dad could bring himself to leave our family.

I was fortunate in that I had a couple of men in the neighborhood who took me under their wing.  I could go to them with "dad questions".  I even got chewed out by them once in a while, and believe it or not, that made me feel good, because I knew they cared about me.

Last year I started a YouTube channel for boys growing up without a dad in their daily lives.  (Girls are welcome too).

If you feel like there is something missing in your life because your dad isn't there, then you may want to check out the channel at [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodnY\_LHqZm9WPQ7pzLr\_aQ/](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodnY_LHqZm9WPQ7pzLr_aQ/).  My goal is just to help you feel how valuable you are, even if your dad isn't in your daily life.

If you have a dad question, ask it in the channel comments, or here, and I'll try to make a video for you about it.
