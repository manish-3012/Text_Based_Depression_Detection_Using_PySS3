Hey guys, need to talk? Like I fuck around a ton on this subreddit and it's pure gold just being a degenerate lmao. It all extremely fun but man, when I see posts of people saying how absolutely terrible there days was and even some saying they want to kill themselves is legitamatley heartbreaking. If anyone's is going through anything negative or really just slightly annoyed, pissed off, etc., Feel free to ask for some help ðŸ¥°
