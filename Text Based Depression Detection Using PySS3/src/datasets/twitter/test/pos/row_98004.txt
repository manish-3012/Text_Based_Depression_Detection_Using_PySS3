Friend's meeting some foreigner on a date and needs advice I'll be relaying all the replies I get to him cause he won't make an account and ask these himself even though I tell him to.



What's happening: He's meeting some foreigner in 3 days and doesn't want to mess it up and comes to me -a straight guy who can't talk to girls from his own school- for advice. I don't have any description of the other dude. And he needs advice like what to talk about and how to behave.




Data On Previous Events: My friend has done this with a bunch of other guys before and none of them panned out very well and he's had some run ins with some weirdos a few times before. Also he's had physical relations but nothing beyond first base. He might just be juggling a few too many people at once if you ask me...




A tiny speck of info that might be necessary: HE'S 17



Some advice would be really nice don't make me go back empty handed pls


Edit: Ask me anything related to all this I got permission to answer
