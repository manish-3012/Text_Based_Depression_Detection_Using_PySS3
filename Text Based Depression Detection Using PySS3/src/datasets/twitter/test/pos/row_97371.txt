I can't stand people who make a post and delete it the second someone is critical of them. If you're going to chicken out two seconds after someone disagrees with you, then you probably shouldn't put your opinion on the internet. There's always going to be people who have a different opinion. You either have to defend your ideals or respectfully admit you were wrong. Or just ignore the "haters"
