I lost a friend last week... So we were biking to his house and then his front wheel hit a small pebble. He fell off the bike and hit the back of his head on the ground very hard in front of his house. You could say it sounded like fine china getting broken.

I asked him if he was okay and he said he felt a bit dizzy and nauseous. So we went inside. I said goodbye to his mom because it was already late (6:45pm) and I went back to mine.

The next day I went to visit him and he wasn't home, but his sister was. She said that he went to the hospital because during the night he kept getting constant headaches and chills and stuff. I was worried af at this point because I knew the guy for a long time (8 years) and I hoped he was okay. The next day he fell into a coma. His mom described the situation as a "between life and death" kind of thing. Days passed (because the fall happened 3 weeks prior) and his condition became worse. He had suffered a brain aneurysm and the blood vessel at the base of his brain popped so it caused an intracranial haemorrhage. 

On Wednesday morning, he died. He was 15 years old. I was devastated and I couldn't even fucking believe it. He was buried yesterday. We spent a lot of time together and did so many awesome things. 

We played football(soccer) together, we played Fortnite together, we even studied together. He's not my best friend but however we still got along well.

The point I'm trying to make is, if you have some friends that have your interests at heart, make sure you keep them close because you don't know when they'll go.

Edit: Incase you're wondering, where I am, the COVID-19 restrictions have been relaxed.
