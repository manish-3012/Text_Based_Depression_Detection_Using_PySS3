You guys need to start defending your claims You'll make a very strong statement we'll go with a common example "you're cute" after you make this claim you have to support it with evidence and explain why you believe this claim is true. Why do you belive this person is cute you have to explain it you can't just be throwing compliments out without a good reason.
