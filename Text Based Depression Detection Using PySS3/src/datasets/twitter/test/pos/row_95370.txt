Okay call me out if Iâ€™m overthinking, which I might be due to the lack of socializing Iâ€™ve done- But I went to one of my classes and there was this guy there and before everyone else went in except two people and he asked what my name was, and said it was nice to meet me?

But he didnâ€™t say it with anyone else?? Also thought I caught him staying *but who knows*
