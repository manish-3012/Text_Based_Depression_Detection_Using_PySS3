Just a thought So I have been talking to a couple of people on reddit cause I have been going through some shit, and we got into the subject of how we will tell our problems to random strangers but not to people we know, I believe it is because they are going to be in a position of loving and wanting to help while my parents come across as wanting to fix whatever it is the I did. What do y'all think?
