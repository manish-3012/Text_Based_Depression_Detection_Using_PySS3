Mental illness hope?Guys, I'm trying really hard, really damn hard. I'm pouring tears right now. I have intrusive thoughts that don't leave me. I've been having the for 6-7 months. From waking up to sleeping I think about the same thing all day. I had to quit working, and now I'm skipping school. I have no friends, and I'm rotting. I'm useless. I'm insane. I have held a rifle muzzle to my mouth but never took the shot. I have held knifes to my wrist and stomach but never punctured myself. I have tried really hard. I live with my mom, and I live her for how she has helped me, but I really have no hope. I've tried meds, self therapy, I don't know what else to try. I am going insane. I want to end my life before I become a maniac without a soul. I don't want to be selfish with my life and take it for granted, but granted you were in my shoes you would bot consider this a life, you would consider this hell. Please, how do I muster up the courage to end my life. Help, please.
