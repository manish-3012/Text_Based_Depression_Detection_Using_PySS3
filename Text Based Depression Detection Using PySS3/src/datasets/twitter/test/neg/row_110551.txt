My envy towards my sister is leading to become increasingly suicidalI am this close to committing suicide.  I am very sensitive, obsessive, emotional, anxious, idealistic, bitter and miserable, lazy, and unforgiving nature.

My younger sister is motivated, observant, perceptive, diligent, calm, thick-skinned, confident, realistic, skeptical, logical, rational, objective, intelligent, fair, honest, positive, forgiving, reserved, tolerant, open-minded, independent, self-controlled, humorous, analytical, quick thinking, respectful, wise and unapologetic.

I keep wishing I could have her life and personality and gifts.
