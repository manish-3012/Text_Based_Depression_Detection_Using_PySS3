The main thing stopping me from ending it allWhenever I think about committing suicide, I can't help but think about how certain people who had nothing to do with me / treated me like garbage will take advantage of me dying. I don't want to be someone's sob story to feed their own bullshit. It's kind of weird though, obviously none of that would matter when I'm dead. But I can't help but feel angry about it while I'm alive. 

I guess I kinda just want to see if anyone else feels the same.
