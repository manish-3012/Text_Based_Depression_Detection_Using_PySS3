Finding it hard to continueYesterday my partner died of suicide. He left me a note explaining i was his world and he loved me but he was in too much pain and nothing was improving for him. That i was in a place in his heart. 

It hurts a lot. I miss him so much. 
Iâ€™m going around with his scarf around my neck. I miss him so much it hurts. 
I just really want to join him in death ðŸ˜­
