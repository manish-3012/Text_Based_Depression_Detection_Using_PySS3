I just can't...It's getting to be too difficult to live. My antidepressants just aren't working anymore and I received a letter that pretty much told me that due to my bipolar and anorexia, I'm not eligible for transgender hormone treatment.

I can't see a future for me. I'm doing my first year of sixth form for the second time and it's all getting to me. I feel anxious every waking moment. I can barely sleep at night, I just stay awake thinking about ways I could end all of this. I have class in 6 hours and I just don't care. I feel myself edging towards a breakdown more and more each day and I feel this horrific, white-hot rage building up inside of me. 

The only way I can deal with this is by starving myself. The last time I was weighed which was about a week ago, I was 45kg at 5' 11' and I'm still actively trying to lose more weight. Today was the first day I've eaten a proper meal since Friday and I felt guilty after every bite but my parents are essentially force-feeding me. I know that if I lived alone, I'd have starved myself to death by now.

I want this all to end.
