Need help. Six days remainHi

I have sold/donated most of my possessions and made funeral arrangements. Please suggest some activities I can distract myself with until Sunday. I have made up my mind and am done thinking about it.

I am in a motel for the week. I have $483 left. No car, but there are buses within walking distance. I hate traveling almost as much as people. Drugs are not an option since I don't know how to buy them.

Edit: I'm 37. Trans, post-op 12 years. Life sucks. Didn't get better.
