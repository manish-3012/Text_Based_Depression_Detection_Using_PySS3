I dont know what to doAs the title shows, I just dont know what to do anymore. For years I've been treated unfairly by my mother, who refuses to acknowledge me as more than her chore- doer. Of course we had a few good days every now and then, but she has never admitted or even cared that she treats me like garbage. If I do anything that isnt to her liking I get punished to ridiculous lengths. For some background I'm 16m living with my mother and sister, my father is still here he just travels a lot for work. Both my mother and sister hate me, and my mother treats my sister like royalty while treating me like trash. I have often though of killing myself and even done research, but in the end I know that unless someone hands me a gun I wont be able to do it. I have no friends that I can talk to and no relatives that I keep in touch with. I really have nothing to live for at this point, and the abuse wont stop until I move out. Please help me, because I dont know if I'll survive much more of this shitty life and shitty house.
