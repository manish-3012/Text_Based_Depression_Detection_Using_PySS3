Dear Friend,So life hadn't been the best for me... Right now my parents found out that I've been using my credit card (Which is only for saving) to buy things that honestly, cannot be found in this county.
I'm scared of their reaction, I did buy lots of things (But barely any of them were around 2 hundred or something) I just want to go out or kick the bucket.... but I just can't, right now I'm supposed to be having a sleepover with my pals but... I'm just too depressed... thinking about my parents' reaction the shit I bought... feeling insecure about my face....

Dear friend,
Do you think that... I'll look much better if I had a nosejob? If I ran away from home? If I confessed to be my parents about my closeted sexuality and atheism? Will it actually be worth it if I offed myself, leaving my friends behind? 

Please answer my questions, kindly my dear friend...
