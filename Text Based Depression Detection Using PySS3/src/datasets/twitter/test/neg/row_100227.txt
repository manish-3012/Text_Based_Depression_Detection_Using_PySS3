Help me: Why is suicide wrong?I know this is a very controversial topic, but this place seems populated, and many here seem to be very against suicide. So let me present a very simple case of a few ideologies. 

First: The right to life [, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness]. If one is to assert that life is a right, why does one not have the right to not live? Let's explore an analogy of other rights that we assert all mankind has. How about Freedom of Speech? You have a voice. To not exclude those who cannot speak, we all have forms of communication, and with them we are permitted to speak any idea we wish. Yes, we are given the right to speech. No, we are not obligated to speak. If you choose not to speak, nobody can assert that by not speaking you have violated your right to speak and are therefor held against that right by being forced to speak. Doesn't that sound a bit silly? And so, with a right to life, why are we forced to live? Assume that one has felt a reasonable amount of good, bad, and happy. If one is satisfied with life, should one be forced to continue living? No matter how many more years I live, the good things will always be good, and the bad things will always be bad. I'm not looking for some crazy plot twist at the end of the tunnel. 

Second: Just to get a religious perspective out of the way, the Bible, which I hold to be of no value besides scattered insightful principles of humanity living with humanity offered, suggests in no way aside that our bodies and lives are not our property but the property of God that suicide is some sort of "sin". Suicides in the Bible (because suicides are in the Bible) are presented quite simply and factually. So if there's a soul, I'm pretty sure it's not at risk here.

Third: More thoughts! All the thoughts. The only reason I have been given to not kill oneself is that "It would make [people] sad!" What the fuck. Really? That's the reason you want me to stick around, and that's the reason you give, yet you call ME selfish? Excuse me?

EDIT: So, I'm back. I'm crying a lot now. I guess that's a thing I do. Let's talk about things I'm not able to deal with. How alone I feel. Besides the loss of the SO, my grandmother passed away a few weeks ago. She raised me, all by herself. And she knew she was dying, but she just let it happen. She'd never been to a doctor, but she was so sick. But she just let it happen. I've tried calling all of my friends. I need someone to talk to. They all say "Tomorrow, man, ok?" I fucking need someone to talk to now. I've screamed how important this is. What the fuck is wrong with people?
I took a bottle of sleeping pills the other night. Like, a whole fucking bottle. I felt dying again. I felt not being able to feel my legs, and I felt myself drifting to sleep, and I thought it was over. But I woke up a few hours later. I didn't throw up. I didn't fall back asleep. I haven't since. I've just cried like fucking crazy, and I've been very weak. I guess it was a small bottle, eh? Something like that.

Let's discuss this, because, we all know, discussing it is the reason we're here.
