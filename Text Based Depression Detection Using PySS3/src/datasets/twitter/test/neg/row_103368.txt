fucking donei (M16) have been through a number of things in my life. family mental illness, parents splitting up, physical, emotional and sexual abuse, brother who is now in a hospital beating my mom and fighting me, disordered eating and self hatred.

but what really just fucking got to me was my dad, who i rarely talk to told his new fucking girlfriend my deepest, darkest, most painful and most hidden intimate secret ever
(due to certain circumstances he acquired this knowledge and knew full well the damage it would do to me if he said anything)

i had a fucking meltdown and phoned him saying iâ€™d kick the shit out of him but i never want to see him again.
this fucking broke me and i feel so violated and hurt, thereâ€™s no way i can fight after this
