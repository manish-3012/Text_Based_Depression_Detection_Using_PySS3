Feel like I should be in a trash bagJust about everything seems to be going wrong with no way out. I was very close to an actual suicide attempt not even a few days ago, but it still feels like I should've gone through with it. I lost my job, have no money, stopped speaking and hanging out with close friends a while ago for no reason, and just recently feel like I lost my fiancÃ©. It's just a huge mess and it feels like all is lost. I just don't know what to do.
