Wanting to die from an autistic perspectiveLittle background on me, I'm a male 3rd year college student who's been diagnosed with high-functioning autism, moderate-to-severe OCD, and ADD.

I actually spent about an hour trying to write out a decent, comprehensive post of how I feel, but gave up and deleted it because trying to organize my thoughts into communicable form was too stressful. But I guess that's precisely why I'm in this situation, wanting to die. I don't think I have any future. Everybody scares me. I don't understand anyone. Through years of training, I can carry a conversation and be likable, but when it comes to forging a deeper connection *insert metaphor about impossibility here*. I'm so incredibly lonely. I feel like I've been left behind, I'm surrounded by happy people living their happy lives. I want people to take notice of me, to see what happens to the people who fall through the evolutionary cracks and don't get to have normal brains. I started cutting myself a few months ago, but now I can't stop thinking about how badly I want to take it all the way. To give up in the most permanent way possible. I want my death to show everyone that knows me what true sadness looks like, and maybe leave a little dark smudge on their monopoly of happiness.
