Think im going to kill myself but then i dontRight now i feel nothing which probably could be described as being in a good mood
I feel so empty and ugly and lonely but i also feel empty and thats it
I want to go and not feel the fear of knowing ill ve suividal soon
No one loves me back ever and it hurts so much and everyone will leave me and i have like 2 people i love so much (not romantically) but they are going to get fed up of me soon
Meanwhile the girl i love will never love me back because im so ugly and stupid and cant do anything right
I have a few hobbies but not many that make life seem great but the sometimes i feel like i dont want to go because of them and my friends ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
