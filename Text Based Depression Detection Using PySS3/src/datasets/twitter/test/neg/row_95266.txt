Every time you post about suicide people try and say your problems are fixableGuess what! Life can be really good when youâ€™re not born with a fucking mental illness that ruins everything! Who would have thought! Iâ€™m tired of jerks always trying to make my mental illness sound like itâ€™s problems Iâ€™m causing for myself or whatever.  
   
Seriously right before killing myself Iâ€™ll make sure to leave a final post somewhere on Reddit where â€œgood intentionedâ€ assholes come along and tell you the reason your life is so shit because you havenâ€™t worked hard enough for what you want.  
  
Yep couldnâ€™t be anything to do with the fact I was molested as a kid, as physically disfigured, severely mentally ill.  
  
Nope, just a lazy person looking for â€œan easy way outâ€ (also â€” whatâ€™s wrong with taking the easy way out? Thereâ€™s no reward for whoever suffers the most and lives. Society is constantly rewarding those who can find faster/easier/cheaper ways of doing things â€” so why not ending your life early to avoid suffering? Lol)
