Just ventingI only feel alright when I'm on drugs as of late - the people here have been and continue to be seriously helpful, the watchers here are good people. I can feel it brewing though, today was a decent day and in the back of my head I already know this sense of normalcy where I've only thought about killing myself in passing today is going to end and it really feels like this might be the one.  It's like dark clouds and I see them headed my way and I don't know how to stop them... I'm not sure I want to because maybe this will be what makes me finally do it. Just fuck, I fucking hate this shit I'm so tired of pretending to be okay so I don't bother people - I'm tired of wanting to ask for help or just unload on people but not doing it because I realize I'll be a burden. I just want peace. I probably won't do anything because all I can think of now when I really think about killing myself is the grief I'd cause others and I'm just filled with overwhelming guilt. But is it so much to ask for me to want to fucking die and just be done with this fucking shit? Sorry if I bummed anyone out or made anyones day worse I just needed to vent.

If anyone wants to talk feel free to pm me, I could use a distraction if anyone has nothing better to do and is cool with just talking.
