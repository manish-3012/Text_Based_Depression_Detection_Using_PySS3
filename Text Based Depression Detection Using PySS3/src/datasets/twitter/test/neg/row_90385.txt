Hopefully this will inspire a few of you who are on the edge.Short story because I don't see a need to imbelish. Literally the day after I decided not to drink a poisonous concoction I made from various bathroom cleaners, I got my first girlfriend. That year, I got 1st in a state academic competition. I went on a vacation to South Dakota and saw the Badlands with my family. Remember that you'll never know if it gets better or not if you stop being here.
