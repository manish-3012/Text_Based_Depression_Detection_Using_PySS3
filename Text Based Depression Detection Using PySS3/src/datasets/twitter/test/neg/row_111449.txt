Just told my mom I'm a lesbian. It didn't go well.I was already suicidal before I told her. It was such a huge secret to hold in, and I felt like on top of everything else it was too much to handle. I told her literally 20 minutes ago in a fit of tears. Her response? "Well then you're a liar because you've been pretending to be straight for your whole life. Go have a nice future with Kate, Kaitlyn or whoever the fuck you find in life, I just can't believe you would let your ex-boyfriend make you give up on men." I can't stop crying, this on top of everything else is just too much. 

My ex-boyfriend raped me, and she knows this. She thinks that it somehow made me gay and now I'm not giving men a chance because of this. Which quite honestly, may be a factor but I've been bisexual at least all along and I told her this. It's very much a low blow of her. 

I just don't know what to do, I'm already suffering from a major heartbreak, existential crisis and suicidal feelings for several months now. I live at home and commute to college and want nothing more than to get the fuck out of here right now. She's never going to accept me. I'm never going to have a happy wedding or anything like that with my family. 

I just want to fucking kill myself right now. There is no point in living anymore.
