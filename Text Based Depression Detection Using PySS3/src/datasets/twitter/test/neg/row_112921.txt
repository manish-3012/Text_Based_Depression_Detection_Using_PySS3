I Feel UselessI just... I feel like crap every day. My boyfriend is amazing and cares for me but I feel like his love could be redirected to someone who deserves it. He keeps saying he'd rather spend a night listening to my issues that 10 minutes listenimg to my euology. But I doubt that... He doesn't know how bad things get. He doesn't know about the bullying, about my extended family. Nothing... I tell him I trust him and I do... But settings I couldn't bring myself. To tell him... Like how I want to KMS every damn day.
