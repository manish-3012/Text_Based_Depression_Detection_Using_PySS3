PostBye world

I couldnâ€™t find love

And thatâ€™s the meaning of life

I couldnâ€™t find it anywhere

And I had so much love to give

My brain is broken because my parents didnâ€™t love me and abused me

And I canâ€™t fix it even though Iâ€™ve spent alot of money and 8 years on therapy

I hate them so much. All they want to do is take from me
