hi. just looking for opinion please don't bash.I'm not suicidal because i'm depressed, it's because i think i may end up hurting people. I've had exteremly bad out bursts of anger before. And one where people were seriously hurt and needed to be rushed to the ER. I'm not a big bully either. I honestly don't want to hurt anything. I'm a tiny person. I've had a number of treatments but they haven't done a thing. But i don't see my future going anywhere good. And if it's not going to go anywhere good then i don't want my future to go anywhere.
