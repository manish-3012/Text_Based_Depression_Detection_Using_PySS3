supportI have been depressed for a long time. Some days are better than others. I have run out of people to lean on. I am here looking for some support because i truly feel like i have no friends to lean on, and my family, while im sure they love me, i feel will put a lot more worry on them.

There are a million posts here about "nobody gives a shit if I die" and "my life has taken a turn for the worst" posts. I am no implying to discredit those in any way. however that's not what I wish to post. its strange, the suicide hot lines(in my experience anyway), they are just a person acknowledging that "yeah, that is shitty". and somehow somebody listening and acknowledging your problems, is an extremely powerful thing. tonight is not a particularly good night for me, and I am just looking to reach out to some people, hence why I am here. But it would be cool to be able to talk to the same person every once in a while that i need help, but i feel like that's a steep glass.

Im looking for resources... i spent a good while erasing this sections and re-writing it, i think i just want a friend, and i feel like that's a stupid thing to reach to the internet for, but i am out of options.

Idk, maybe im ranting, but i dont feel like it, thanks for reading.

tl;dr: i feel pretty bleh, i would like to have people around.
