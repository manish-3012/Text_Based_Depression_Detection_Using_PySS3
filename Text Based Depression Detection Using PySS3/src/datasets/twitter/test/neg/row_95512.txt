No idea what to sayHi,

I tried to look at other suicide help prevention online, but i don't want to talk over the phone and all the chat clients require to be in the US apparently...

I justg fuck up everything i try, and i'm sure most people would be better off without me. I failed my school year, my parents had to help with money once again... It feels like my life is crumbling apart and i'm the only responsible.

I'm currently cuddling with my cat, but even she is getting tired of my bullshit.

Sorry, i'm a non native english speaker, this post is probably a mess.
