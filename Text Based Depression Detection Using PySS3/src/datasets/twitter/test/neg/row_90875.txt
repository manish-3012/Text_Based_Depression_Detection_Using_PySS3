Iâ€™m going to do itIâ€™m going to check myself into a psychiatric hospital today. I just have to wait one hour until I can leave work. I texted my boss this morning, telling her that Iâ€™m not okay and that I needed to get help. Two hours later I get back â€œcan you hold off until 2?â€ WTF
I was so close to veering my car off the side of the road last night. So close to downing a bottle of pills this morning. 
I need help now. But I have to wait. One more painstakingly slow hour where my head is in constant pain and my body wants to give up. One more hour.
