I was raped and am suicidal and no psychiatrist will see me for 4 months.I am diagnosed with PTSD from a childhood incident. After I graduated from university, I couldnâ€™t see my psychiatrist anymore and had to find an outside doctor. My town is well-known for having a shortage of psychiatrists, so against my wishes my meds lapsed and Iâ€™ve fallen off of them for the past two years. Itâ€™s been hard, but mostly manageable through things like deep breathing, meditation, and marijuana. 

I was raped on New Years Eve and have been increasingly suicidal since - I ended up throwing out a bunch of old ropes and such in a moment of clarity because I know thatâ€™s how Iâ€™d do it. 

I broke down today in a fit of tears and tried to find a psychiatrist via the ER doctor who processed my rape - she said no one is available until the end of April. Not in the hospital, not in the outpatient centers, no private clinics - nada. 

I feel I canâ€™t even trust myself to not step into traffic tomorrow, let alone for the next 4 months. They said my only option is to be committed for three days in our local psych ward - I was there two years ago and it was horrible. I wasnâ€™t allowed to shower or brush my teeth or change my clothes. I was injected with Valium multiple times a day for no reason (I was never violent or even self-harmed, I just cried a lot). I was treated like a sack of flesh they had to deal with. 

I really donâ€™t want to go there again but Iâ€™m afraid it might be my only option. I need medical care and no one seems to be willing to do it unless I waltz into the ER with a knife to my neck.
