Why do people love meI want to kill myself but just canâ€™t because of all of my family who love me so much. Iâ€™m such a fuckup I donâ€™t know how they still manage to look at me in the eyes and say â€œI love youâ€ every day. I have no good traits other than being selfless. How is that enough for people to love me? 

I want to die, but I donâ€™t want to hurt people. I think if a gun appeared in my hand right now I wouldnâ€™t do it. I hate being loved for no good reason
