It's a funny double standard...Me: I don't want to live anymore...

Then: but imagine how much better life might get!!!1!

Me: yeah but what if it gets worse?

Them: OMGZ don't focus on what ifffs!!!!!!1!

gottit, live solely for the good what ifs, but also don't consider what ifs if they aren't the good ones because #positivevibes

You're not a fucking hypocrite at all huh?
