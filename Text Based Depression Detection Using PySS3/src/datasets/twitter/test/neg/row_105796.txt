Tonight I'm going into the woods and stabbing myself to death.If you're interested as to why simply read the posts I've contributed.

I came here as a means to find a reason to go on, if only another few months so I could enjoy my favorite videogames again before I died, and I had planned on finding a comfortable way. Like using nitrous gas and a white walker inflatable pool ball. 

After the time I have spent here I see my original notions about human beings were dead on accurate. I must have insulted someone, or a group of people whom value their ideals more than my life or the lives of others. Due to this fact with tears in my eyes I say finally, I'm leaving this world tonight. 

I found the exit, I found a way out. 
None of you will ever be able to hurt me again. I hate you all.

I'd hate to share this with people, but this is happening in my inbox,
