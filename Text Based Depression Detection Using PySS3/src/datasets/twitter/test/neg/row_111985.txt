My head is spinning in dark thoughts right now. Can't really sleep.I feel so fucking horrible rn, it's like my head is just spinning in dying dreams. I want to puke. I know if I commit suicide, everyone will be sad, but it's just very difficult just to not think about this. I hate myself for being  so weak, I hate myself for not being able to continue Uni, I hate myself for thinking of stopping, my dad said that I don't have strenght and that I should've pushed a little harder, but honestly, honest to god, I might not make it until new year. I saw a psychiatrist Monday, he prescribed me some AD and told me to wait.   
My mom will be sad, I'll destroy the lives of my brothers, and my dad might explode, I'll disappoint everyone. I am so sorry. Like, it's difficult for me to even get up some morning and I cannot. I just want to stop, switch the light off, the world to be quiet.  
I self harmed so I have urges to do it right now, get rid of this shit that is myself.
