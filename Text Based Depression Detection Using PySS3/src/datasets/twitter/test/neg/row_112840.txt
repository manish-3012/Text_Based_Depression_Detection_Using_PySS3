I canâ€™t put up with life anymoreI havenâ€™t enjoyed living at any point since I was 11. My teenage years have been beyond horrible, Iâ€™ve been betrayed by my closest friends, my parents are controlling and I let myself down constantly. Iâ€™ve tried twice before and wish I had succeeded. I donâ€™t see any hope, Iâ€™m a massive slut and keep making mistakes and regretting them and Iâ€™ve done it again and I hate myself for it. I need to end this cycle soon. This is completely rational and Iâ€™ve thought about it a lot and know itâ€™s the right thing to do.
