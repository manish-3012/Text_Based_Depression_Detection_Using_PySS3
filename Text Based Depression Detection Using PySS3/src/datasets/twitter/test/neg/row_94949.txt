My chronic physical health issue and my inability to succeed at anything as a human being are giving me few reasons to go on. The world wants me dead.I suffer from Marfan Syndrome affecting my chest, including cardiac and respiratory systems. It's a struggle for me to even walk short distances, or sleep each day. That means all my active hobbies and enjoyment are lost to me. I have lost friends, family, jobs, pets and money to this one condition. There is no cure and a possibility of early death I live in fear of. 

All I have left is the stuff I can do from a bed in online environments. However I'm an absolute snowflake and so stupid I still can't tie my shoes at the age of 27. I'm frequently mocked online because no matter how hard I try, I always end up the loser, be it in conversation or video game. Dozens have wished me dead. Meanwhile I see everyone else breeze through things with minimal effort, then come back and remind me how stupid I am. My IQ is already very low, I can't read between lines, and no matter how many hours I put into learning something, I never actually learn it. The only reason I got through school was because of intervention from my teachers.

I can't get a relationship because I can't leave the house - not that anyone would want an ugly, weird sounding burden like me - I've never succeeded at anything in my life, I can't learn let alone from my mistakes. Heck before my health turned, I was fired from a Voluntary job!!! . I'm that useless!! All I can do these days is whine online. Meanwhile even when I try to get help for my physical health, everyone STILL exclusively treats it as anxiety. My own father doesn't believe the illness and thinks I'm feigning it for attention. My mother blamed me for her contraction of cancer she passed away from. My sister hated me long before because I couldn't tolerate her short temper. My friends have broken contact because I can no longer travel to them. I'm on the verge of bankruptcy even with benefits.

Sorry this is a rant but how can I go on? The world hates me, I fail at everything I try, my illness has doomed me to a shut in life. I've lost everything and have no competency to get anything back. I bet I couldn't even commit suicide properly because I can't get the needed tools, and I'm too cowardly to do it anyway. It hurts to live in fear, depression and idiocy, but I can't die like do much of the planet wants me to.
