I want to get in my car and just drive.On the way home from work, I wanted to just get all the fuel I could buy (which isn't much), and just get on the interstate and drive. Put the pedal to the floor and just see how long I could maintain top speed. Once I get going to where there is a lot of distance between any cars and me, see how fast I could turn 90 degrees. 

Or maybe go to my old job, grab one of the realistic fake guns, and see if I could get some cop to shoot me.

Or anything else really. The only thing I don't want to do is take a ton of medicine. I'm never doing that again. I was in severe pain for a month.
