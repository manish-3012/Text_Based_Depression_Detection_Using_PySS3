SuÃ¯cide?Iâ€™ve been entertaining the idea of suicide for about 6 months now. My life has been a struggle for the past 10 years or so. I suffer from anxiety and panic. For the past 10 years Iâ€™ve been fighting and struggling this feeling of helplessness. 6 months ago I decided to just stop resisting and let it wash over me. Because of this I started to suffer depressions and disassociation.

I still have 30 grams of cocaine in the house. Is it enough to kill me if I would dissolve it into water and drink it all at once?
