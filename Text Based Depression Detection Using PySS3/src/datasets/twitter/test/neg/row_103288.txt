Wide awakeI'm not sure exactly why I'm feeling all of these feelings all of a sudden, stress piling up maybe. I've been taking anti depressants for a few months now and they've been good. I've been doing good. I got ready for bed and just started crying. I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. I feel like a failure, like I'll never amount to anything, and I will continuously fuck up and disappoint people. I just don't want to be me. And I don't know why I can't make these negative thoughts go away. If I smoked weed I know I could get to sleep, but I don't want to abuse it like that. I have to be up in 5 hours but as soon as I close my eyes all those little demons start poking at my brain and testing me, seeing how many new names they can call me to make me feel worthless.
