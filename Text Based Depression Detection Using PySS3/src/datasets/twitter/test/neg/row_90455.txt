Nobody will remember me for very long after I die. I can erase myself and never come back.That's a nice thought. I just wish I could completely and painlessly disappear. I don't care how painful it is for me. I just don't want a few people to be in pain. If there even is anyone who cares.

What will happen when I die? My parents won't care. I'm sure of that. Maybe my friends will care a little. A few of them know I'm suicidal. That's ok. I've left in my notes that it's not their fault. It's my parents fault and my own fault. My absence might be noticed in a few reddit communities but I will be forgotten soon after. I'm afraid that if people remember me, they won't do it right. My parents will say "oh, he was so nice and considerate" and forget who I was. Well, they never even knew the real me. Nobody does. I just want someone to be here for me and I have nobody. 

I can do this soon. I will die and be forgotten forever. That's good.
