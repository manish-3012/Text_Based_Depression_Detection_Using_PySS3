My best friend committed suicideI attended her funeral last week which was on valentineâ€™s. She was always aesthetic that way. Me and my best friend have a peculiar relationship. I met her at a mental hospital and weâ€™re the same age. We immediately clicked. We were roomies for about a month and in that time we talked about what we thought about life and death. It was the first time I felt someone actually understood me. We also faced crisis moments when we felt suicidal or having an episode (bipolar and bpd) and we were there for each other through the worst of times. We always had each otherâ€™s backs. 

A year later and we are still best friends. We were still not doing well due to our mental health. We decided on a suicide pact. 

We both bailed on each other though haha. We both told our Therapists because we didnâ€™t want the other to die. 

This year, she was doing a course to help people with mental health issues. She was going to graduate. I am studying psychology and working part time. We were doing well. Finally. 

We would text and check on each other. She told me she was feeling so so down. I said me too. We were supposed to meet for dinner the next day but I fell sick. 

Two days later, she ended her life. I cried like Iâ€™ve never cried before. I just couldnâ€™t register in my head that she was gone. No more hugs. No more jokes and pranks. No more I love yous and creating trouble. No more you. 

So, Iâ€™ve decided that I am going to end my life. I am going to join her and weâ€™ll finally be happy.
