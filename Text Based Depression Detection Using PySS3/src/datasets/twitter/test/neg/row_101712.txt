I just don't see a point in anything anymoreI'm alone. I have no friends whatsoever, I can't even bring myself to go up to someone and talk to them. I keep reassuring myself that it will get better and try to pull myself out of this depression, but honestly, it always comes back to this.

I don't know what to do, I told myself I could be different. College just started, I thought I could just make myself be more social and interact with people more.

Nope, that was futile. I can't do it. All I do is worry and nitpick every little thing I do because I constantly feel like everyone is judging me, and even though I know they're not, that thought doesn't exactly help to counteract the initial one.


Really, I don't even know I'm telling you guys this. I probably don't even have the balls to go through with it. It probably won't get better, I probably won't make any friends this year, and I probably won't even kill myself. 


I really don't even know what I'm doing here, I just needed somewhere to vent and I guess this is a good place as any to do so.


Reassuring myself that it will get better has only given me extremely short-lived peace that is rudely interrupted rather quickly when I realize that I'll always be an unattractive loser with no friends whose only social contact is with family, who pretty much have an obligation to 'love' me.
