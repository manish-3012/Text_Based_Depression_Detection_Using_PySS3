Why not suicide?Hello Reddit, I have been thinking about this for a while, and have finally pushed my self to post this.
I am a 16 year old male, I will turn 17 in 2 days from now.  My life has not been the best, but not the worst, but that is not what I want to talk about.  What I want to talk about is, why not suicide?

My views on suicide are this.  It is like playing a game, and using a cheat to skip to the end, once it has been completed that is it, you will soon forget about the entire thing, and the entire time spent playing it would have been pointless.  While I have constant suicidal thoughts, and a plan,  I do not have enough emotional or physical strength to bring my self to do it.  My life has driven off in the wrong direction, with all the good parts of it left behind,  My future looks bleak at best and I am miserable and depressed, with social anxiety, and constant anxiety attacks ripping out any emotional strength I have left to get by.  But it is not the depression, nor the social anxiety, or any bad parts of my life that make me think of suicide, it is the fact that I see no point in life, and see no point in living, I am lost.  Even if I live a happy life, in the end it is all pointless, one day everyone is forgotten, everything they did becomes pointless.  So why live? I fear that one day soon I will get to my tipping point and go ahead with my plans.  I just thought I should post this here and get other peoples views.

My mind is constantly taunting me with these thoughts.  I feel pointless.  To me life is nothing, help me Reddit, I used to be scared of my suicidal thoughts, I no longer fear them, I now really consider them.

tl;dr Hard time getting by in life.  I view life as a pointless thing, and my suicidal thoughts no longer scare me but I honestly consider going through with them.

EDIT: These are just my views on life.  I do not want anyone to read this and agree with me, it is just a personal thing, if you feel the same way please comment, maybe we can help each other
