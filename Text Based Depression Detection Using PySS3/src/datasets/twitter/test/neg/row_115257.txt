Depression p2If you haven't read my first port go read that first.
I've tried talking to my parents but they give shity excuses and nothing changes. I feel like i don't deserve to be fed or even continue breathing. My grandparents are still an option but its a hard decision and I've taken about a month since they said i could. Its a tough choice.
