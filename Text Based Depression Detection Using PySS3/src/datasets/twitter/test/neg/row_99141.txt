My cat is dying, I feel like I should die tooHe is all I have and my little baby. I was abused and neglected as a child, I was moved from one place to another and never had a real family or stability, but my cat was always there. He was my stability, my safety. He was quite literally all I had.
I've had him since I was 9 and he was just a few weeks old, my neighbor tried to drown him so I took him and could talk my mom into letting me keep him. He had just opened his eyes and I had to feed him with a syringe for the first week. He follows me everywhere, comes when I call and he was always there. He can do tricks and is very affectionate.

I am very careful with what I feed him, trying to give him only the best. He still got kidney failure, we will know if there is anything we can do by tomorrow or if it's too late. He hasn't eaten in a few days and can't even climb up my bed anymore.

I feel like without him my life is empty. I will have no stability left, I want to die with him

You will probably find this to be cringe and I get that, but he was the only emotional connection I've ever had in my life. He was always there and the only thing I that didn't leave or abandon me. I need him
I have nobody in my life. He is all I have.
