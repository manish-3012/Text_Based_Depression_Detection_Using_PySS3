I tried to kill myself today, changed my mind, but now I regret that choice.I took the rest of the bottle of my medication to try and kill myself with an overdose, but after 5 minutes I got cold feet and made myself throw up. Now I just feel so pathetic, that I don't even have the courage to do this one simple thing. I wish I'd just gone through with it, but I never do.

My life is a dead end, I hate every single day, there shouldn't be anything holding me back. I don't understand what I'm so afraid of.
