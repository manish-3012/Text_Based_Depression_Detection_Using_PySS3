Iâ€™m not a fool.Iâ€™ve never thought about killing myself or cutting. Iâ€™ve always made jokes about it but never took it seriously. I always thought it was dumb to even consider hurting yourself over something or someone, until today. Iâ€™ve never felt so down in my life. I know I wonâ€™t be able to kill myself, cause Iâ€™m too afraid that Iâ€™ll end up living. Cutting myself is something I cringe at. Hurting myself so I can feel more pain? I get other peopleâ€™s perspectives and I wonâ€™t bash on them for it, itâ€™s just not me. I donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore. My heart hurts, my eyes are tired of crying constantly, I canâ€™t even get up out of bed. Suicide isnâ€™t my answer, but it seems to always be in my brain now.
