Might've lost my job todayIt's a long story but today at work I got really angry and I yelled at another emoloyee, yelled that I wanted to kill myself, and stormed out. I was literally screaming at the top lungs when I left, not even saying anything just like screams of agony. Since I left, which was about 7 hours ago, only one person has messaged me to seen if I'm okay. I don't know if I still have a job, I probably don't. I don't want to be here anymore, I hate going to work, I don't have any hobbies or many friends. Everyday is so painful I feel like I'm always on the verge of a breakdown.
