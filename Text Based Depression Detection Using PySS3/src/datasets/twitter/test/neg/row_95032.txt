Iâ€™ve had it. I started looking up toxic drug interactions. Whatâ€™s my best option for getting immediate help?Iâ€™m bipolar 2, ADHD/RSD. Iâ€™m scared to go to the hospital. The one near me is awful and Iâ€™ve already had a bad experience (unrelated reason). I see a psychiatrist, my next appointment is Monday. I need help. Iâ€™ve been googling toxic drug interactions and my boyfriend is too high and mad at me to help. Iâ€™m scared to make my situation worse by telling my doctor because heâ€™ll make me go to the ER. I need help immediately. I donâ€™t think I can make it until Monday.
