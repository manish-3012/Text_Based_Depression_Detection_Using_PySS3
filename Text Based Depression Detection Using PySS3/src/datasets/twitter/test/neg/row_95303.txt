Anybody else wishing that they could run away instead of killing themselves?I wish I had some money saved away and a car, I wish I could drive away and never come back to my life. 

I always wish for a simple life, I always dream iâ€™m driving to Uruguay and that iâ€™m changing my name to Hermano or whatever the fuck, Iâ€™d teach kids to swim and spend my days getting stoned by myself. Iâ€™d volunteer at a soup kitchen and write my books at night.

But that never happens, iâ€™m completely by myself and in a relationship where iâ€™m most likely being used. Nobody gives a fuck about me. I just want to be better.
