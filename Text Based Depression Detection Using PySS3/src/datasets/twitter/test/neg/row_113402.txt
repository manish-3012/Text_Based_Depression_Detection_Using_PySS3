I just want to take a bunch of pills and sleep.I hate asking for help. But I need it. I keep having horrible anxiety attacks every day. And at night, I don't want to sleep. I have horrible, violent nightmares every night that usually entail me being abducted, beaten, raped, and eventually murdered. And this has been going on for almost two years. Every day is a nightmare as well from the anxiety attacks. I've been to doctors. I've been to counseling. Meds don't help me and nobody wants to give me Valium to help with the panic because I'm under 18. My 18th birthday is in a flipping month. I'm sick of living this way. I feel trapped in between two realities. Neither of which is better than the other. By day I'm panic-ridden, and by night I'm haunted by my own subconscious to the point where I wake up gasping for breath and in a cold sweat. I can't take it anymore. There is nothing in my life that makes me feel okay anymore. I don't even feel like my own friends care. I just want to sleep. Without the nightmares.
