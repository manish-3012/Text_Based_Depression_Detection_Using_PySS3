Anyone here because all your relationships are shit?No matter how much I try to be there for people they eventually just start treating me like shit one way or another and I honestly canâ€™t wrap my mind around it or make sense of it. I donâ€™t know what the hell is wrong with me but Iâ€™ve had this issue for years and Its created real destruction in my life. I went from being a pushover, because thatâ€™s gotten me into a ton of trouble in and of itself, to trying to be assertive which seems to have gotten me into more trouble and all the people around me are now saying Iâ€™m crazy because I have issues with everyone. I just feel like Iâ€™m being disrespected and demeaned and after me trying to treat you with decency and you throw back unwarranted disrespect at me yeah I will get angry. I feel so alone and like Iâ€™m going insane. Everyone around me treats me like Iâ€™m at beneath their human level. I just donâ€™t see a point to my life if I donâ€™t have relationships that are real
