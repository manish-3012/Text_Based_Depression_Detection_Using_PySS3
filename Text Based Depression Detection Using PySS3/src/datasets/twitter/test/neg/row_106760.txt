Oh, father...I was home for winter break and on my way home got pulled over and got a court summons, on top of that i found out i failed 2 classes that i tried my heart out in.. my father just got home from Afghanistan and i was incredibly happy but its been hell because i havent told him or my mother because i feel like a complete disappointment and he constantlu aggros over nothing so i could only imagine this.. both of my younger brothers are borderline perfect in his eyes and im always falling short, im leaving them a note tomorrow when i leave to go back to school.. in saidbnite im letting them know i love them but i couldnt handle the stress and constant disappointment of my father.
