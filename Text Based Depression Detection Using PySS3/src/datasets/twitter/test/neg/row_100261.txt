I AM FUCKING SICK OF RELAPSINGI feel so fucking worthless. No, I *am* fucking worthless and it's because I let depression control me when it actually fucking matters. How many more fucking years am I going to do this? Probably the rest of my life at this going rate and if that's the case, I'd rather stop fucking breathing.

Fuck this life, fuck my useless ass, fuck everything.
