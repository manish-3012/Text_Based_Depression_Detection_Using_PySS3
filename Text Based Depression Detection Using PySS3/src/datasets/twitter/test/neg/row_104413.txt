All the emotionsI been feeling the need to give up on the math part of Ged even after finishing and doing a good score on the other topics. Its been going on for almost a year of just re-learning it all over again. Then dealing with being lost in the program? for the third time. I just get angry and frustrated now when I try to study again and I feel like I let everyone down. Then I think what could I do? in career-wise? I just wanna go to art school and use alot of creativity. The area I live is in the middle of nowhere so I feel trap. I've been homeschool for along time and I'm tired of the social distancing since forever. Friends are far away, then its like they aren't my friends at the same time?  I dont know, I dont feel like I have a real bond with anyone. I dont wanna hear" Oh they will miss you" They dont write to me unless I write to them. My existence is weak and I was hardly remembered at all when I did go to high school and I know im gonna be hardly remembered since most of my friends are online and never see my face. I probably talk to like 4 or 5 people once in awhile.  If I go it would not be a big deal. I mess up too much and let everyone and myself down.
