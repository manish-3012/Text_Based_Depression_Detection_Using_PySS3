(16/m) will probably kill myself before 2018Ive always been depressed, as long as i can remember.  Summers are better but school always makes it much worse.  I probably would have tried to kill myself last may if i had a car.  Now i do.  Last may was the worst its ever been, i transferred to an early college program so im taking classes at the CC instead of my shitass high school.  Ive only been in school for two weeks and its progressing way faster than normal.  Idk why i want to die, nothing traumatic has happened to me, but i do, i hate myself so much, ill probably CO myself if this doesnt get better soon.
