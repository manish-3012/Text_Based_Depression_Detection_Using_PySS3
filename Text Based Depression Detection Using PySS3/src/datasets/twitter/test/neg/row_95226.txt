I'm starting to think I'm not allowed to feel OKEvery single time things are going even just alright, they get ruined. It's like God or the universe or something just wants to fuck with me. Well whatever it is won. A long time ago.

I give up. I wish I killed myself so many times. I don't even have the guts to attempt it.
