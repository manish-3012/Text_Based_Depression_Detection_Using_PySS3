[Advice] I'm too big of a pussy to kill myself, but it seems like the easy way out. So for about 9 weeks ago, I made my last post in hear, talking about how everything looked brighter, and only had one concern; how bad would my relapse be when I started in high school?  
9 weeks later and I have the answer: HUGE! I feel like sh\*t. the worst I've felt in the 2 years I've had depression (triggered by anxiety). So here comes a bit of a long one;  
I have had anxiety for at least the past 4 years, and probably longer (just can't remember it). My mother is one of the big causes. She has an unbearable temper, and she always gets mad over the stupidest things like "is the shopping backs, on the right or the left". She yells and insults everyone around her for several hours, once she started, and if one tries to stop her, she turns violent.  
My father is a nice guy, but we have the same question together "what to do with mom?" my father is, sorry to say it, too big of a pussy to get a divorce, even though he claims mom has been like this for 33 years.  
My parents also hold too tight and are to afraid to lose control over me and my life. Everything from my scheme, to social events, and even coaching is a problem! they need to know everything and at least 14 days ahead.  
Now let's look at my classmates; From kindergarten to 7th grade, I was in the same class. We were 26 students. 24 of them hated me and bullied me almost every day. It started verbally but quickly became physically, with people trying to choke me for example. And in 5th grade, everything became worse since I got an operation in my lip, which went wrong, so my lip is now double size and consists of 50% lip and 50% scar. My classmates thought it looked like botox, and so my name, Sebastian, was replaced with botox.  
I survived all 7 years and now started 7th grade in a "new" school. cause it was only a different department. so people knew "botox" and people already knew to bully me and pick on me.  
All this culminated made me build a lot of different "defence" personalities, and I slowly forgot the sensitive, caring guy I was. I ended up becoming an anti-social, ice-cold, it geek, which claimed he was alcohol intolerant (which I'm not)  
In 8th grade, I finally started at a new school. a high school, elite science class, lasting 5 years. And this is where my depression starts because people were so sweet and welcoming out here, but I had forgotten how to be me! I had forgotten how to be the goofy, emotional and caring guy I've always been.  
A war against my self and my many different personalities started, and after 2 years, a corona crisis, and probably the worst summer holiday in the history of mankind, I thought "this is it... I'm me!" but then highschool started again, and after just 2 weeks I've hit rock bottom again. Worse than ever before. Looking at my experience, I even think there's a bit of stress this time.  
I apologise for the very very long text, but if you've hung on this far, can you give me any advice? What should I do? cause I'm tired of feeling this way, and I just want to remember who I am, and my classmates to forget the asshole they know. btw, I've given up on my mother... she will never be better
