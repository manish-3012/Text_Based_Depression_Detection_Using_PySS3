Slowly poisoning myselfI just don't want to live. So I keep drinking and eating bad food. Debating when and what I want to start smoking. A vape would probably kill me fastest as there's a lot of scummy products on the market.

I used to donate blood but have been medically denied for the past 2 years due to my worsening health. My heart rate and blood pressure and cholesterol are awful. I feel like garbage every day.

But it lets me know I'm getting closer to the end of this wretched trudge through an apathetic existence. 

I'll die alone and probably leave what I have to my nieces.
