if i donâ€™t get in, im killing myself.i know you see this shit and roll your eyes. please donâ€™t pretend to know my life. this is the last chance of things improving for me. this is my last cry for help, my last attempt. if i donâ€™t get in thereâ€™s no way i will be able to power through. not anymore. i have nothing going for me. if i get in im beating the odds. if i dont iâ€™ll be doing just as horrible as everyone expects of me, and iâ€™ll have to go back to a certain place. iâ€™ve cried about possibly going back there 6 times tonight. i canâ€™t. this is it for me
