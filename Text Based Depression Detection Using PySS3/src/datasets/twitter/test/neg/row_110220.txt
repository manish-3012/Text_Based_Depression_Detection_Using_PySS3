Attempted and failed. Feeling numb.I attempted a few weeks ago. I tried once before many years ago when I was in high school. So this was my second time trying. I wonâ€™t go into detail but it involved poisonous fumes. I was lying there and I started to feel it working- dizziness and extreme tiredness. On the brink of passing out. But then the smoke alarm started going off. It was really loud and it woke up some primal survival instinct and my body was screaming at me to go outside and get some air. I crawled and stumbled out of the house and went outside. My head was pounding and I felt sick to my stomach. I took deep breaths of air. Then I sat there weighing my options. I could go back inside and deactivate the smoke alarms and try again. Or I could call someone. I ended up calling someone. While she was on her way I opened all the doors and windows of my house to air it out. When she arrived I cried and told her what I tried to do. 

Looking back now weeks later...everything still feels really surreal. I feel like Iâ€™m not supposed to be here. I didnâ€™t plan on still being here. So Iâ€™m awkwardly and slowly trying to get back on my feet. Because my lifeâ€™s obligations and responsibilities are still there. Itâ€™s a really strange place to be in mentally. Going through the motions of life is really fucking difficult because Iâ€™m still extremely depressed and I honestly still want to die. But Iâ€™m still here. For now.
