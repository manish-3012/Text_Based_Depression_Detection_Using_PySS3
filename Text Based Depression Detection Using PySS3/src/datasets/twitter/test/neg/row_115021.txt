I don't think it will get better.So much has happened in these last couple of weeks and I have literally lost everything. I lost scholarships, I lost my only friends, I lost my boyfriend, and I lost my house. On top of all that, I found out I am pregnant the morning before my boyfriend dumped me. That just made it suck even worse. I don't know what to do. Everything is just too hard and I know that for me it will never get better. I even felt from a young age that I would not live long so that doesn't help. I don't want to die, but I can't live like this. I need relief.
