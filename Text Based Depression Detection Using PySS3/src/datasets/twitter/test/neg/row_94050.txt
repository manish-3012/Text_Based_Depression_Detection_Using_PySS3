I have decided to kill myself this weekendThere are a lot of things that is bothering me and I canâ€™t handle it anymore. The main thing that has been bothering me the most is being gay and ugly. I hate what I look like. Iâ€™m disgusting as fuck. I havenâ€™t eaten anything in four days because I feel too disgusted with myself. In the year that I have been on dating apps I havenâ€™t gotten any matches or messages, and that shit absolutely destroyed me. I donâ€™t have friends because my Asperger makes it hard, and I just want someone to be here with me, but it seems like thatâ€™s impossible. So I guess this is a goodbye of some sorts. Iâ€™m not a strong person.
