is this who i actually ami feel so fucking unstable

these mood swings are killing me

ive been suicidal in the past 

but this shit takes the fucking cake

is this the real me?

is this who ive been pushing down by smoking every day?

or is it just my brain rewiring

it definitely feels real

as real as it gets

i don't know what to think anymore
