My thoughts at 5amThere is more to life than to watch other people live it.

That is something one of my teachers use to say and It always stuck with me. Now I'm here, feeling either depressed or not feeling anything because I feel empty. What can I say my life, my F\*CKING life is out of control. After years of dealing with cancer and not being able to work I have a job since june 2018. And it's making me so miserable. My boss often yells at me, tells me I ain't worth shit and that no one else will hire a person like me because of my medical history. And so far he is right, no other job where I applied offered me a job.

I got this financial debt that keeps holding me back and the sad thing about it, is the fact that i got this debts because I got sick. You know how fucked it is to have around 10k in debt just because you got sick? Not because I made a bad investment, not because I gambled away my savings. But because i got F\*CKING SICK. Life is hurting me so much and I've noticed that slowly more and more the thoughts pop up in my head, that only not being alive will stop the pain. At the same time, isn't pain a part of life. So I can appreciate the good times? But what is a good time? I don't have joy in my life. Everyday I go to bed I hope I won't wake up. I don't know what to do
