I'm losing care for any worldly desiresI'm 25, and life was going good until I went manic and said fuck everything currently, moved 5 states away trying to run from myself and start over just so I could have some more shit to worry about.  Everything's going kinda decent now but I'm still afraid I'm not longed for this world as I have no true desires or passions. I believe I'm so close to putting my soul to sleep and letting my shell of a body return to the earth.
