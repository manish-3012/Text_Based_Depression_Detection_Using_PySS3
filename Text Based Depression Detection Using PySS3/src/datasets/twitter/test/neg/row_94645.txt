Black HoleI have been suicidal since age 8. There have been times in my life where suicide was less seductive...now, at 65 I am finding few reasons not to take the step off the edge.

My marriage ended almost 20 years ago, I live alone with a dog
Two of my 3 children have cut ties. My grandchild has no contact.
I have no close friends, no job, no family, I own nothing, I have no hope for the future.

Why am I here?
