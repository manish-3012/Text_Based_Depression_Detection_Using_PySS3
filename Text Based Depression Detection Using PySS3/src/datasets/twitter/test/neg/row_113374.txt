Please help. I know its long but i really need help.This is my first post and im sorry if its in the wrong category but ive never actually been on reddit before. I know its a long one but i needed to explain.


Hi im a 17 year old male.  I was at a house party 2 days ago. My best friend (also male) since i was 4 was with me and about 7 others. Me and some other people took mdma. My best friend ( lets just say his name is jake for instance) had some alcohol and was a bit tipsy but not drunk. I was in good company and wasnt feeling down or sad or anything like that. Me jake and another friend (male) were in the bedroom and we were just talking. We got talking about how the other person was kicked out his house and me and jake were telling him how if he needed anything we were there. I work so i offered up saying â€œif u ever need food or drink and cant afford it il buy you a take away or somethingâ€. The guy left the bedroom and the door was closed. It was just me and jake. And with a topic like that we got onto the topic of our feelings and i cant remember exactly but i told him that i am suicidal. I was calm and collected and knew what i was saying and it is the truth. I told him that the only thing that has kept me alive is the fact that (please dont laugh because it might seem weird to some of you) a. I dont want to pass the hurt and the pain im feeling onto friends and family because i know the pain they would feel would be alot worse and its selfish for me to pass the hurt onto someone else and b. Because im a virgin. I dont want to die a virgin i want to have atleast that experience if not anything else. I told jake i didnt want to tell anyone because then they would have to live with the fact that they know im suicidal and if i do commit suicide then they would probably think that they are partly to blame for not doing more, when it is soooo not their fault. He had tears in his eyes and made me promise not to do it and that even though we argue sometimes he cares about me and he sees me as his best friend too and hugged me tight. I promised him and we hugged abit more. The night moved on and i pushed the conversation to the back of my mind. I flew abroad for a holiday the next day and am currently on holiday but that conversation is replaying constantly in my mind and is making me feel down and sad. I half regret telling him because now i feel like ive burdened my best friend, even though i even said to him that i didnt want to tell anyone because it would burden whoever i told, but i chose to burden my best friend.l for some stupid reason. I feel like he will always think about me differently because of what ive told him and i know he will. Anyone would. They would care more and be more cautious and wont say certain things that they would say before. But i dont want that. I want everything between us to be like normal. The relationship i had with him was probably the one perfect thing in my life and i feel like ive completely messed it up. Ive been abroad for 2 days total and want to go back soo bad. I dont know whether its because the night before i flew out was soo fun and good or whether i just dont want to be here but then part of me also feels like i dont want to go back because then il have to see him again and that is when il realise that things have changed and il realise what exactly has changed. Im a person that realises ALL the little things and i know that. And i know that il pick up on the little differences and over think them. I dont know what to do and i need help. I dont want to go to a doctor and get diagnosed with anything because then i know il just blame all my feelings on whatever im diagnosed with. Or if im not diagnosed il just think that im overthinking and push my feelings to the side.

Can someone please give me advice. It would mean alot thank you

Reading over this i realise how bad i feel that, the burden that i didnt want to give to anyone, i then gave to my best friend.
