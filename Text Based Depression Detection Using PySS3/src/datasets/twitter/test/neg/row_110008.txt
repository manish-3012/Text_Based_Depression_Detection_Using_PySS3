Fucked up beyond recognition I was recently diagnosed with huntington's disease and i don't know what to do. I have at most 17 years before onset, i didn't know 17 years could feel like such a short time. the reason i am posting this is because i don't know what to do with the time i have left. i am no longer afraid of dying instead im afraid that i will end my life before i have lived, each day it gets harder and harder to wake up and put a smile on my face. 

Before i knew my time would be cut short i was planning on going to university ( im currently on a gap year ) and i feel like such a disappointment and waste of potential. Each day it gets worse and i get closer to the edge, each night i hope i wont wake up. I dont want to be swallowed by dementia and degrading control over my own body i guess im just afraid of losing who i am, isnt it better to go out as me?
