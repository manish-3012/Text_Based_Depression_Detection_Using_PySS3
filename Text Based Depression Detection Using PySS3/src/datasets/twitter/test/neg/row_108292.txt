suicide hotline people are shitI wasted 30 minutes trying to explain my situation to some bitch who obviously should not be anywhere near depressed people. i eventually gave up and rated their service "bullshit." I really don't know why I posted this here, maybe as a heads-up for people who are thinking of going there?
