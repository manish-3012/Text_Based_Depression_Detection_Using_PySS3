Made an attempt yesterday (?)*BACKSTORY*

If Iâ€™m going to be completely honest with you guys, life has been a shit show this 2020 as is with most of you guys. I lost my full-time job to drugs (Xanax, cocaine, and LOTS of over-the-counter sleeping medications) because I thought they would help me get over moving out of my parentsâ€™ place which my twin brother still resides. Being the one twin thatâ€™s always been the â€œproblem childâ€ has never been an easy feat for me. My first attempt was when I was 16 and it was seen as â€œattention seekingâ€. I come from a Polish family that is very strict when it comes to respect and I was quite the little asshole if I do say so myself (I honestly still think I am) but I digress. 

3 days ago I took probably around 2100mg of Quetiapine, passed out after around 20 minutes. It felt great. Like a warm embrace of unconsciousness enveloping me into a hopefully permanent darkness. I wake up in the emergency room barely conscious. â€œItâ€™s only 9 oâ€™ clock?â€ I murmured in a state of drowsiness. Thatâ€™s when I notice a paramedic sitting right next to me saying â€œyes, 9 oâ€™ clock 2 days after we picked you upâ€ I was shocked but also disheartened. I finally thought I built up the courage to do it but I failed once again. I was stuck in my emergency tent and I couldnâ€™t even get up because my body felt like it had been hit by a car.

Today is my 3rd day and in my city there is a 72 hour hold form which you are not allowed to leave the hospital. I really just want to get out of here and actually succeed in something. Give my parents the one, straight, gifted son that they look up to so much and for me to just disappear. If I still manage to get my 90 100mg Seroquel after my 72 hour hold I want to try and I want to succeed. I know this is all so SO selfish but it felt so right. It felt so peaceful. So tranquil. Thank you to anybody reading my words. I would end this off by saying â€œdonâ€™t do itâ€ or â€œthink of those that love youâ€ but sadly, I canâ€™t. And I think thatâ€™s alright.
