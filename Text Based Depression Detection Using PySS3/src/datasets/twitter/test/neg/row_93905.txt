I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m 18, pregnant with severe antenatal depression and single as of today, my formally abusive boyfriend has started becoming increasingly aggressive now so I had to leave, he wouldnâ€™t let me out the flat but after a bit of minor violence he realised he had to let me go, my stomach is now in agony and on my way hope I collapsed and was incredibly sick until it was just pure stomach acid. Iâ€™m petrified in case my baby is hurt and they are the only reason Iâ€™m alive so if somethingâ€™s happened I refuse to continue. But if my baby is okay Iâ€™m in an awful position. I live in a vulnerable womenâ€™s hostel and surviving off Â£190 a month with an extra Â£20 a week from a part time fast food job. I canâ€™t do it by myself and I donâ€™t have a family that can support me. Iâ€™m not getting back with my boyfriend. I canâ€™t risk him hurting my child
