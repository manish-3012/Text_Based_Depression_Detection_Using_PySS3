Feeling like i've tried everything and still feel awful.I'm 25. I live alone. I was bullied in school and kindergarten. I never had any friends. My relatives never understood me. My father left me when i was young. I don't have a job and live off of support money from government. I'm not really able to go outside. I'm a game developer. I've been developing things for years now and feel like i'm not making any progress. I'm hoping to get a job at this area eventually. I'm not happy with what i'm making and am not really feeling like i'm progressing. I only like really complex games, like Path of Exile but lately that game is only getting more new player friendly, so i don't even feel like playing it anymore and need to develop my own things more but am stuck. There really aren't any other games out there either that can help, i've had all my life to try different games. I have a strong case of OCD, ADHD, autism and schizophrenia. I need to always be bacteria free, need to do something complex and hear voices telling me annoying things. I'm getting medical help but it really isn't helping. I'm attracted to females born with penises because i'm gay, can't stand men and don't want kids. I don't like the voice of men, how hairy they are, how manly they are, they are usually less sensitive and i probably don't also like them because of my father. I prefer being male though. They'd also have to share what other problems i have, understand or i simply have to become more normal. I'm also into supernatural things, like reiki, aliens, ghosts and more. I'm also practicing Reiki to help with all this but it's not really helping. Looking for any kind of support that might help in this situation. How can i find someone i like? How can i develop better things? How can i deal with the stress?
