Reading articles of why famous and presumably happy people might have commited suicide pushes me closer.So when i read arcticles about famous people killing themselves, and the article mentions why they do so, it makes me grow a larger understanding of how someone can get to that point, and in turn, allows me to understand why my feelings of suicide aren't so far fetched. Some days, the thought of killing myself seems like such a great alternative to much else. Random thought. I like to think that im too proud to do so but some days creep up on me and my mindset gets ever closer to that point.

I guess what I am looking for is if people feel similiar and/or advice?

I'm not a miserable or sad person. I joke a lot and find ways to have good times but at the end of the day, when im alone without disraction, i find myslef in these low points.
