Thanks giving sucks.I feel so violated, my family members are to touchy and even tho i told them i don't want to be in pics or give hugs they wouldn't leave me alone. So many people i barely know just grabbed me and i wasn't ready for it. I got overstimulated really fast and felt the urge to cut all day. I snuck into the bathroom and had a panic attack/cut a bit with my blade in my phone case. after that i was calmer but still wanted to just go home. I wish people would just respect my boundaries and leave me alone. I'm so tired of people, i wish i could just be alone all the time.
