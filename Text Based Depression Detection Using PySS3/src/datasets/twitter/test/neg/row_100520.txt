Nobody can knowNobody knows how hard it's been. How alone and rejected I've felt for the past 8 months especially. Nobody around can understand how alone it feels to have noone trust you, noone care for what is happening in your head, noone thinking about except youraelf. Im So fucking alone. I cant even open up and tell people I want to hang out anymore. I just stay alone because it's easier than accidently showing my suicidal intentions and getting snitched on again. Just living so that others wont have their life fucked up by your suicide. Nobody can understand how much I hate myself and everything that I've done. I hate myself so much. I deserve the worst. Nobody can understand why I cut myself. Why is there nothing I can do. Why did I have to this to myself. 

Why didnt I just kill myself when I had the chance.
