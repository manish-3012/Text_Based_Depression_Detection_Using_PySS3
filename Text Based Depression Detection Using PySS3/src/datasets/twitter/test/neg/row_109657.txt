Venting, I have no one to talk to so i'm just getting this off of my chestMy past ex's have moved on, found love, are thriving and doing so well.  My most recent ex rubs his new relationship in my face.  I've been mentally unwell and our breakup made everything worse.  I can't get him out of my head and I see him daily at school.  I'm still trying to finish all of the work in school I missed from when I was out due to bad mental health issues and physical illness on top of it.  I have mental breakdowns daily, saying i'm gonna kill myself and that today will be the day.  This stress is overwhelming and it's driving me insane.  I found out some kid i like too just isn't interested and i know that isnt a big deal and usually i'd just be a bit hurt but after I found that out today I just had a breakdown.  I've had so much going on that something as tiny as that made me break down.  My life has been hell since the summer when my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer.  Ever since then it's been a long journey (she's cancer free now!).  From that to my PANS flaring up to my grades plummeting and a bad breakup.  It's just been one thing after another and i'm so tired of it all.  I know all of this may seem so stupid but it's just really getting to me.  I'm a junior in highschool and this is one of the most important years when it comes to applying to colleges.  It's honestly just been a nightmare.  I no longer have many friends either due to my ex.  I sit alone a lot and don't have many people to talk to.  I'm sorry if there's some spelling errors or if theres a lot of run on sentences i'm just using this as a way to vent after a bad mental breakdown.
