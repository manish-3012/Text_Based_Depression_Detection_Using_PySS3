It is timeI simply cannot do this another day. May you all be stronger than I was. I see no point in carrying on.  It's simply time. If every day is to feel like the past few years, or Heaven forbid yesterday, I simply want nothing to do with it. I m sorry that I am so weak. May each of you find some strength to keep holding and pushing on. I'm simply out of compassion for myself.
