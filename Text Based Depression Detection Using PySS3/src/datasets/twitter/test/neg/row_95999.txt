I kind of feel relieved at the thought of dyingI've done it multiple times now, googling painless ways to commit suicide. Nothing useful came up, but part of me today thought "Well I mean it's gonna be painful and then you'll die", in a sense at least. I've thought and looked up several methods.

I just wanna make sure it ends, rather than make it worse. I'm tired of my life, I find it difficult to trust anyone, nearly impossible to feel at ease. I'm constantly running after things and people just to get the bare minimum which I can't even get my hands on.

I'm considering writing a suicide note, how I'll do it remains to be figured out, but I'm honestly getting more and more convinced that it's the way to go for me. I'm sorry if this going to sound cruel, but any positive affirmations won't help, they never did, my life is still the same, no matter how much I push for change.
