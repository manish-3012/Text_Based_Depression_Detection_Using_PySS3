I'm happy and excited about my plan.Theres no where else I can really post this on reddit I think, but I really just need to tell someone about this. It's weird, but I'm actually excited about killing myself. I have a plan for this Saturday, when a parcel arrives which is going to help me. I'm a broken person at this point, I've attempted before and a whim, and have recieved "help" but that hasn't worked and now at this point, I am unwilling to help myself anymore. My self harm stopped working at suppressing the thoughts, I don't know why I'm still doing it at this point, I think it's to keep me focused on the end goal now, stop things from breaking down before the event. I've done my research this time, and have bought all the appropriate stuff. All I can do is wait and carefully avoid anything that will give me second thoughts, and plunge in to stuff that will send me down further. Once I'm dead I won't be alive to give a shit anymore:)))
