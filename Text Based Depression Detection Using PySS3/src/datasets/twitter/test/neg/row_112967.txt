why do redditers do this?They say their life sucks , and that they are going to end it but give literally no context into their life, i mean i know its the internet and its scary but why not write a whole page about why your life sucks, you don't have to give super details that will give you away, i did go read it, i mean maybe people just hate reading long shit, but at least it gives me perspective on why your life sucks. idk just venting i guess.
