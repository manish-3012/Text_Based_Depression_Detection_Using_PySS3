Someone I know attempted suicide, and now Iâ€™m getting thoughts again.Title pretty much sums it up, but someone I know recently tried to kill himself and Iâ€™m finding it hard not to think about taking my own life.

Iâ€™ve been having such graphic and intense thoughts for a few months now, worse than any Iâ€™ve had in the past. When I got the news yesterday that someone I know attempted suicide, my thoughts have intensified a lot. 

I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to. Iâ€™ve been alone in this for so many years and I just donâ€™t want to fight it anymore. 

I feel stuck. Thereâ€™s so much I want to do but I feel like I canâ€™t do it. I feel like itâ€™s pointless even trying anymore.
