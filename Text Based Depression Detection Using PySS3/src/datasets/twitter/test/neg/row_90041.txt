I have wanted to die since I was 12. Iâ€™m 19. It never gets better.Iâ€™m just stuck here watching myself and everyone around me suffer. I despise getting older. I never had a life and have both mental and physical disabilities. I failed to complete suicide 3 times, once in almost complete secrecy. I was hospitalised for about two weeks and it was awful. My mother is immature, narcissistic, and ignorant. She cannot parent. 
I have a very loving and caring partner and am for once in a healthy relationship, but we live on separate coastsâ€” though eventually plan to move in together. That is in the distant future as I am in a circumstance that does not allow me to finish applications very soon. 
Iâ€™m stuck. Everyone is hurting. I am hurting. Iâ€™m pretending Iâ€™m not because everyone else is already in so much pain. I just want to stop breathing. /r/
