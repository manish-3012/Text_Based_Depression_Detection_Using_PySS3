Regretful lifeMy life is a waste. Exactly 31 years and 3 month of meaningless experience leading up to this. I've been jobless for many years. My disease are getting worse each day yet I'm still stupid fighting against it. Watching all my effort taken away from me slowly one after another is painful. The only thing that's left is my little hope called dream. That one day I'll reclaim back everything I've lost. I missed my old self. I wasn't the best but I always walk through it no matter how difficult the path is. I admire my old self. I don't know when the exact moment I lost that will and determination. Maybe I lost it due to aging, maybe the disease kills the fighting spirit or maybe, I already reach my limit. I'm hopeless
