Depressed..I wanna start by saying I am 19. I grew up with my stepdad and mom. They were abusive, but also good liars and never left bruises. Mostly emotional abuse, telling me I am not good enough for anything, saying I am worthless, ugly and stupid. I never met my real dad. I found his name and number when I turned 18. I was planning on meeting him, he lives in another state. Thing is he died in november. I was supposed to see him right around now.. I just wanted a parent who loves me. I wanted to give him a hug and finally have a dad. 

I am living in an apartment with my boyfriend. I have 2 cats, one is a service animal/support animal who helps me with my depression. Lately it has been bad though. 

My boyfriend lost his job because his car tire blew up. It took like 3 days to get fixed cause we had to get special tires and his job fired him. My car was not working at the time either, its really old. We both live out in the middle of no where, we have to drive 40~ min to work. I lost my job a few weeks ago. I got really sick with the flu. I seen 2 doctors and went to the hospital. I was in bed for 2 weeks, really sick. I normally work overnights to support us. I made a previous post on reddit asking for food about a month ago when I was just supporting us. I am grateful for the food I got.. but now it got so much worse. We are both unemployed. I cant get unemployment because being sick apparently isn't a good enough reason. My boyfriend can't either.. he said he tried. We dont have money for rent, or food. His parents can't help us. I don't know what to do anymore. I have all these hospital bills and doctor bills and my old school loans, I have bad credit already and am in debt. I am 19 and shouldn't be dealing with all this shit. Too much has happened already and it doesnt get better...
I tried asking reddit for more help with food. but people keep downvoting me and i am starving idk
