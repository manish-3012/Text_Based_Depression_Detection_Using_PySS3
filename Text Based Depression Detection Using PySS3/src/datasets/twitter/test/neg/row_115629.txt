Life currently falling apart, thinking of suicide but too afraid to commit to the act.Yeah.

I have trauma from the past.
My family is mentally and can be physically abusive.
I don't care that my biological father left me why should I? My so called step dad isn't any better I don't need parents.
I'm 16 and obviously can't move out.
I want to spread my blood on the walls by slicing my arm, but I can't cut, it hurts way too much to do it with a kitchen knife.
I want to attempt suicide.
I want to stop hearing my noisy neighbors who make my anxiety worse with their noise every minute to the point I'm ndanely aware of each step they take. EACH STEP THEY TAKE MAKES MY WALLS AND CEILING TREMBLE 
My downstairs neighbors blast their bass in their car and it wakes me up is it bad that I want to murder someone.
I want to go deaf, I just want to go deaf.
I was abused, my brother was abused, I don't care about him though, because he became abusive to me.
I want to bring this family to the ground.
I want to bang my head against the wall again.
Why is my fucking life like this please help me please fucking help me I just want at least someone to acknowledge everything I want someone new someone who doesn't remind me of my horrible path someone anyone I don't know what to say at this point.



I need someone

Please help me.
