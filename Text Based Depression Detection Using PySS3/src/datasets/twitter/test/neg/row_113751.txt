I feel unloved and uselessMy girlfriend of around 2 years just left me yesterday for a guy she met 5 days ago. I told her I just want her to be happy. We were gonna get married. I love her. Every memory with her was amazing, we never fought, we talked about our futures together all the time, and now... It's over. I just can't understand how that can be undone in 5 days. The only conclusion I can come to is i'm simply not as good as I thought I was and apparently whoever I love just loves me back until they find someone else, because this is the second time this has happened, the first time the girl and I had dated for 3 years. If I'm simply not as good as others, and if years worth of love can be tossed out at the drop of a hat, what's the point of going on?
