Been lying to everyone for 4 yearsI have been lying to my closest friends, my girlfriend &amp; my family for about 4 years already... I am about 23 000â‚¬ in debt &amp; I have been just telling everyone "It' okay... but I think I might do it this weekend. Apend a little bit of happy time with my loved ones first.

Long story ahead! (TL;DR at the bottom)6

TL;DR from my childhood: I was molested sezually in fist grade by my neigbour &amp; through 4 - 9 grade I was verbally &amp; physically bullied, blackmailed, shit on, pissed on, sodomized &amp; used as a laughing stock. Atleast 2 beatdowns a week. 1 in monday &amp; 1 in Friday


It all started when I was 19 in year 2016 and my then girlfriend (now ex) broke up with me because she could not live with me because I was not behaving like adult (trust me, she was not either) so I started bunking in my best friends place.

After about 6 months I was feeling quilty because I had no income, no saving, nothing &amp; was just freeloading in my friends (lets call him Jiri) place. I could not get back to my moms place because there was no more free rooms in there &amp; my father lived WAY out of the city and there were no transports to my school from there.

So after about 6 months I finalky found a cheap rental apartment next to my school &amp; I also knew that if I move there I could get enough money from Welfare to pay the bils &amp; get food. So I moved in there &amp; at first I was fucking happy with my life. I was joyfull &amp; felt good.

Then when winter came a thing called Kaamos (I dont know wjat to call it in english) came. No sunlight, always dark, some kids started to bully me at school. My anxiety &amp; deppression kicked in &amp; I could not sleep well &amp; would just stay under the planket ir at the computer hanging with my friends. That lasted for a few month.

Not before long got expelled from my school because I never went there. I just stayed at home, drowning my sorrows by playing video games (mainly R6S) with my friends. Not long after Jiri tried to ask me if I was okay. Always told "Yeah. Its all good"

Few months later I was out of money, behind on rent &amp; bills, had no cash for food. I still just sat there &amp; played video games. Also my aunt &amp; granpa died at that time. I took it pretty jard. Started self harm again after a few years if being clean. And it is juat the beginning...

After that I managed to somehiw get together my with my ex-gf &amp; bunked with her for about 4-6 weeks by saing "I had a vacation out of school" (yeah, fucking stupid of me) after I got caught of that she threw me out &amp; I did not know what to do. I have not visited my apartment at all in that time. I had not payed any bills for the last 4 months or so. So I went ro my gradmas place &amp; stayed there for about a month or so

Now it was Summer if 2017 I had met my Soul Mate &amp; my now new girlfriend. My friend Jiri took me back at his place to stay &amp; I promised to help with anything I could. I just told everybody that I had a big debt &amp; that the Unemployed money I got went straight to paying off the debts. Then after they believed it I told that to my family &amp; they bought it, thou my father was diaapointed in me. (After that I have just met / talked to him 3-5 times until this date.)

Now I was unofficialy living with Jiri. My debt collecrors had no idea where I was. I was baaically on the run. But after few months I did not even remember it. I was just having fun playing &amp; drinking my life away with Jiri, Johanna &amp; my other friends. No one had any idea.

Again time went fast. It wa a full year since I moved ro live on my own. It was always on the back of my head. I was atill doing self harm but I drank alcohol to not remember at all. Then one day Jiri said that "We are move to a rental place" I could move (unofficially) with him. I was happy. So we moved in winter &amp; befire christmas we were moved in a new place.

No this lie had survived officially an year already. But it started to took its toll on me.. I was afraid of my phone ringing, afraid of going to public areas &amp; I haven't talked with my dad for over 6 months. And I just said to my Mom &amp; everybody else that It's okay

So now nothing happenes for a while. We were in the new place. Drinking, playing &amp; derping around. I was just always afraid that Jiri woild kick me out because I did not have any money because "it went to the debt paying" but in reality I had not done anything ti get rhe monwy evsn. I was toi afraid. But I always helped the bdat I could &amp; I think that was enough for him. I'm glad he was my best friend.

Now it was summer again I had been applied to school (I was forced to seek a education for myself) &amp; i knew that it was a mistake. Why you may ask? Because after the summer was gone &amp; it was August i was in a school again. And because I was in school I needed to put my address on the right place. In the house where I lived with Jiri... you see where this is going?!

So school started like shit. I had my anxiety in top gear because of alcohol &amp; the lie i had been tellling for 1,5 years already. Evdn I believed in my own lie at this point!!! Aftrer just one weel at school I quit it. I could blt handle it.... and after that... Came the envelopes if my own demise. Bills, bills, mlre bills... but I was wise &amp; had saved some money over the year and thought I payed them all... then in November 2018 came a bill of almost 5000â‚¬...  and after that another 2500â‚¬ &amp; so on &amp; so on... i cried, I was in shock... so I made a bucket list.

1. Next christmas get in contact with dad
2. Take Johanna out on a real first date
3. Get Jiri something nice for christmas
4. Just have fun &lt;3

So christmas went by, always on my toes. January 3.2019 Johanna invited me to her place. I have been here ever since this day... I ca not go back to Jiris place, I have not spoke to Jirk in almost a month now... not after there has been letters from court. I have not told Johanna about anything, not even Jiri. No one knows about this. Jiri only saw the letters I told him it's okay. I just....

I have fucked myself up so badly... it has now been 3 weeks since the last letter &amp; I think the next one is something bad... I never wanted to hurt anybody. I never wanted to involve anyone else in this but I might have now... I regret EVERYTHING I have but Jiri &amp; my family &amp; friends trough... I'm such a disapointment to everyone... such a lazy fucker...if only.. if only I could see another way.... last 3 weeks I have not slept at all... if I have a wake up at 6 a.m. just be sure that if by someway they now I'm here I can jump off the balcony...

I know I have 99,9% brought this upon myself but at elementary school &amp; junior High school I learned to lie about my problems. Because at that time I also did not want to worry or involve anyone in my problems....

I always tries to make everyone around me smile &amp; be happy... I ques I never had time for myself.. old habits die hard. Once you learn to keep it in.. it will never come out.

So I thought that Saturday is my last moment with friends &amp; in Sunday this week I will do it..

There is a railroad track nearby, that will do :3
