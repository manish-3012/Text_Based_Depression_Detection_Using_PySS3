Want to die because of my past with hentai&amp;#x200B;

This is kind of gonna be a long post and ive never posted here before or really used reddit much but i really need to get this off my chest. idk if i should mark this as nsfw but it does get a bit explicit

So im 19F and ever since I was about 12 ive been hypersexual. I found out what porn was around that age and would go and watch it and get off to it. I know as a kid i shouldnt have been watching that stuff but at the time i thought since everyone else was doing it then it was ok to do it too. At around the same time, I started getting into anime and things of the like. These two paths eventually criss-crossed and morphed into me watching hentai to masturbate. I watched hentai videos as well as read hentai comics for years up until about a year ago. During this time I would sometimes delve into harder genres of hentai (i.e. shota/loli - if u dont know what these are pls dont look them up ) and I never really thought about it too much until a yr ago.

I'm not making excuses for what i did, but at the time it never really crossed my mind that these were more than just drawings. I've always seen the internet as something seperate from reality even thought I know thats not the case. It hadn't even crossed my mind that in some places these drawings are illegal - as they should be.

Anyway, once I realized what I had been doing and snapped out of whatever cloud of ignorance I was in, I panicked and felt disgusted. I began to question if I was a pedo. I had never felt attraction to any real children nor will I ever but it made me second guess myself. Idk if I have POCD or am really a pedophile but I would rather kill myself than harm a child in that way. I even cry when I hear about stuff like that on the news. I dont think i was even attracted to the drawings in the first place, it was more of the other kinks involved. Or maybe it was the drawings idk but I feel absolutely disgusted. I still have no explanation for why it never crossed my mind that this was more than just "anime" and that what i was looking at was something that happens in real life to real people. I always saw people normalizing it and as a teen i dont think I really thought about it too much.

Now, I want to kill myself over this. Everyday im wracked with guilt for what ive done and how i could even like that shit in the first place. Sometimes my panic attacks get so bad I vomit because I cant handle even thinking about it. I cant help but think of myself as a pedophile and even when i try to combat those thoughts it feels like im making them worse. I dont see real children in that way and never would but just looking at my history points to me being one. I cant look people in the eye without thinking about how much theyd hate me if they found out.

To add to this, at around age 13-15 I was sexually abused by a cousin of mine. He was often over our house and we spent alot of time together since I was about 7. It wasnt until I was 13 that our time spent together started getting creepy and sexual. It evolved into him sometimes pinning me to the floor to kiss me when i refused to kiss him and touching me in inappropriate places. It got so bad to the point that it almost escalated to full on rape. He was in his early 20s to make matters worse. Eventually the police got involved but he ended up killing himself before he could be arrested. Alot of my family turned on me because of this and told me he would still be alive if I just didnt say anything or even accused me of lying about the whole ordeal to bring attention away from my previous suicide attempt.

Now I worry that somehow theyll find out about what I did in the past or that ill be arrested for what I did even though its technically in a legal gray area. If they do find out ill have no choice but to kill myself, and I contemplate killing myself now just so that they never find out. Im also scared that even if they didnt care about what i did that theyll put me on the same level as my cousin and call me a sex offender and think i was just a creep lying about the whole thing that happened.

Everyday is just so tiring now. If im not dealing with the guilt from what i used to look at, im dealing with the intrusive thoughts about being a pedo, and if im not dealing with that, then im worrying about whether or not im going to jail. Im scared that by even posting this someone is going to report me and im going to jail. i dont want to go to jail and ruin my life. I had just started to find life worth living and going to jail for some disgusting drawings is not how i wanted my life to go. At this point it seems like the only escape IS suicide and I dont know what to do. I used to go to a therapist for my depression, ptsd, and anxiety so im sure my parents wouldnt question me going to another one but I dont think I can talk to a therapist about this without them thinking i deserve jail or should rot in hell.

I dont expect forgiveness because I know what I did was wrong but Im trying really hard to move on from it. Ive quit every type of porn and refuse to look at or do anything sexual because it reminds me of what ive done. I just wish I had stopped wayyyyy earlier and gotten off the internet at such a young age. I dont support the people who say "its just drawings!!" cuz even though i had thought that way i know its not the case. It does real harm and should be abhorred. I just want to know are there other options besides suicide at this point
