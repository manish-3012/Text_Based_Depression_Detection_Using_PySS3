I HAVE NO CHOICE(Just getingbit off my chest) 
'm really struggling atm,  I dont want to be here, so bad, but I have children (and grandchildren). I cannot bear to put them through the pain of loosing a mother, I have suffered loss my whole life and know the damage it can cause. 
   I live with extreme physical pain and overwhelming emotional pain everyday. My problem is, knowing I cannot depart, is depressing me even more! I love my kids so much, I will bear this pain every day of my life, but then some days, I start to convince myself that they would be better off without me, I know that's irrational thinking and push it aside but it still niggles. 
    Now my husband is being a childish needy jerk and its not helping my irrational thinking. 
   I feel so lost &amp; alone.
