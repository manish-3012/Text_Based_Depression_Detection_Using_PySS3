Does anyone else look at their wrists?Iâ€™ve never self-harmed. Unless you count punching brick walls.

Iâ€™m 28 years old. A man.

Iâ€™ve always been depressed all my life, never diagnosed. Thereâ€™s a certain sickness that resides in me and itâ€™s destructive and forgetful too. 

My flaws are evident.

I feel too much. I canâ€™t take heart break. 
Generally itâ€™s a weakness. I hate how past relationships come back to me as being perfect. I labour and suffer over how terrible I was during that time.

I live in repeat. My weed and alcohol addiction has pivoted again. I almost drink 2 units of alcohol a day. I smoke 3 joints.

Iâ€™ve tried quitting weed multiple periods in my life, I suffered for it. I always relapse. I forget how shit it feels to be on weed like this.

If Iâ€™m not smoking weed, I have to drink every other day.

Lately my biggest problem is remembering previous exes, thinking about them and current life.

Thinking whether I missed out on the love of my life by not just staying and dealing with the problems.

Please tell me you are like me. I am scared and the closest people donâ€™t seem like me. I donâ€™t want to kill myself but ever so often I look at my wrists and I think: â€˜it would be easierâ€™. Heck I think Iâ€™d even like the pain.

It scares me. It scares me that the past haunts me and my current insecurities have crippled me in this memory-verse hell off delusions. 


Please tell me there are heart broken idiots like me at the age of 28 who are thinking of a loved ex and feeling like they were a kid when they should have been an adult. And I donâ€™t mean a cheat, I donâ€™t know what I mean.

Please god I hurt
