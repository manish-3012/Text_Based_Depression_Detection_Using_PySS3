Just want someone to careBefore school started, I was really confident and knew what I was doing. Now, a month later, I am seriously considering killing myself. The only thing really stopping me is fear and my family at this point. I feel like I'm not useful for anything, I barely have a place among my friends and only get invited to places because I don't talk much, mostly listen. I'm not attractive, my grades are starting to slip, not very good at a lot of things either. Not sure where all my confidence went, but I just want this to be over, suicide or getting over it. I think it might've started at the realization that no one actually cares a lot for me. Sure, my parents care, but it feels like they don't understand and would just try to force religion down my throat. Anyway, I've never had a best friend, girlfriend, or anyone who actually asks how I'm doing. Starting to think the world easily forget me.

Sorry if it got off topic, this has been building up for awhile
