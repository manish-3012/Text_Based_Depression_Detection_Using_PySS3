Just turned 21It's a miracle that I am still alive considering how I've long have been depressed and thought over suicide. But there hasn't been any progress. I think I went worse every single fucking day. I am such a worthless uthankful piece of shit only make everything worse... Just hope to die by car accident or something today as always
