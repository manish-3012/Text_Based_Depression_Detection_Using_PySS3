You know when you're depressed for a year and you feel like you'll never recover from it? What happens when you've been like that for five years? I don't want to spend my whole life like this.21 now, was probably younger than 16 when I started being depressed. I've seen therapists probably somewhere in the double digits during that time. Tried to go to college, tried to move out of my parents' house a year later, ended up stuck back here like an idiot and re-enrolling in that same school I can't afford or will feel comfortable at, just for the sake of leaving. No friends. No interests. No real goals. I live in a sea of suburbs. I'm too old to be here and my parents are too old to be supporting me. Tried to break a gaming addiction, didn't feel any better. Two older brothers who are excelling at everything they do. 

I must have experienced all that I can out of life. I don't want to keep living this way, there's no getting better for me. I fantasize every single night about stabbing my chest or slamming my car into a building. I'm sorry if anyone reads this. It's fucked up that anyone should be allowed to feel this way. It's not right, I hate every second of it.
