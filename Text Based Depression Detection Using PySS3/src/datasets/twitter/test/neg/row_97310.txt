GoodbyeNow this post isnt about me killing myself but about me leaving the sub. After some help from some friends I don't think I will need to use the sub anymore but that does not mean j will be completely gone from it. I just think that I don't need the sub right now because my life hasn't been shut lately. Thank you for listening and take care.
