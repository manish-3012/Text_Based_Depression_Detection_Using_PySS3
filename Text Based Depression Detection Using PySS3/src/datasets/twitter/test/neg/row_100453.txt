I never really understood self-harm until yesterday.I'm on a downward spiral, I cut myself intentionally several times out of the pure hatred I feel for myself. I just fuck everything up. It felt relieving and the burning sensation felt good. It stopped me thinking about things for a short while and made the anxiety go for a bit. Removed photo, proof im not larping on my profile.

I used to be angry at the world, but now I'm just angry with myself. I thought I had finally found a bit of happiness. I'm fucked in the head and am falling to pieces. I hate what I've become. I'm lost. I've made myself physically ill with worry and stress. Medication isn't working any more, I've been passed around several therapists over the years and I'm still broken. There is literally no hope for me. I'm so lonely. I can't stop overthinking things.

I made the biggest mistakes of my life the other month, I feel awful for it even though it wasn't intentional what I did. I embarrassed myself in front of her, one of the only people I have ever cared about and I'm so ashamed. I hate myself and what I've done. I fucking thought the world of her. I never meant to hurt her. Being the stupid cunt I am I just misread the situation. It's fucking horrible going from talking everyday to someone to nothing.

Nobody understands how horrible it is to have paranoia, having to worry that people judge you on lies. I've developed so many anxiety-related behaviours because of a years-long harassment campaign; I'm paranoid that people are in contact with him, I don't feel safe going to certain areas, I changed my name, I deeply care about people's options of me. Whenever I hear sirens I panic a bit inside (being interviewed like a criminal and have accusations chucked at you is one of the most horrible experiences). I could have prevented most of this if I'd gone through with getting a restraining order but I was too fucking cowardly to do it. I've had to live with having false accusations against me, being blackmailed and harassed. This isn't a life at all. I feel like nobody believes me either and it's fucking horrible. I thought I had got past all of this but it still follows me. If people are going to judge me on shit I haven't even done then I don't want to be alive.

I'm at one of the lowest points of my life. I'm so embarrassed of how I've acted, ashamed of what I've done. I can't talk to anyone about it. I'm so fucking lost and I can't live life alone any more. I've got nobody. I don't want to live with this on my conscience any more. I didn't mean to hurt her and she won't believe me. I'm so fucking on edge. I just want to be normal and happy for more than 5 minutes. I don't know if I'll cut again but honestly it gave me a moment of peace. There is literally nobody who cares about me. I'm at the end of my tether and don't know what to do any more
