My partner is depressed and suicidalI'm 23, he's 24. We have been dating for a year and a half now.

After we got to know each other, he started asking me all kinds of questions about whether or not he is adequate, and I ended up working out that he is very depressed. I like him as a person despite the flaws that he sees in himself, and I want him to be happy.

He confessed to me that he tried to kill himself when he was in high school because he had no friends and got put in a mental hospital. He says that he still feels suicidal all the time when he is lonely and almost did it again after a bad breakup.

I went to a two week conference earlier this year, and he said that being alone for that long really set him off. I'm going to be working at a camp this summer and won't be in town much, and I'm really scared for him now.

I'm wondering what I can do to talk him out of it and make him feel loved. If he killed himself, I think I would as well. I love him and it really distresses me that he feels this way.

He has friends. He has my friends. He has family. But he just works and then sits alone for days on end when I'm not around.
