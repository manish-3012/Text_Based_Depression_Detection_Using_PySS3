Life simply has a way of kicking me back into a suicidal spiralToday I had a bit of a shit day, some Jackass skipped red light and almost crashed me, then he got angry and smashed my side mirror (because I live in an underdeveloped hellscape of a country and in a remarkably violent city inside that violent hellhole, where people in general think with their dicks and ovaries instead of their brains), this is obviously gonna cost me a ton of cash, cash that just keeps leaking out of my bank account but not coming back in.

My familyâ€™s company is about to go bankrupt, and Iâ€™m not anywhere near actually being able to graduate from college, nor do I have any real talent for any kind of job to make any money, even then jobs here pay miserable wages, my relatively decent living conditions are about to banish and itâ€™s pretty likely Iâ€™ll end up homeless by 2021 or 2022, and when in the streets here well, letâ€™s just say people on the street that donâ€™t end up under the protection of some drug dealers are just mysteriously shot during the night by people that are totally not police officers.

Then on top of that people are mad at me because Iâ€™m not â€œmy usual cheerful selfâ€ because I had a shit day, I had been trying to get out of the circle of negative thoughts, I tried to actually learn something thatâ€™s not just playing games, watching series and then feeling guilty, and then a few weeks ago my mom thought it was a good idea for me to take my cousin with me to Cali, all heâ€™s done in the last 3 weeks is disrupting my day to day, and being an annoying leech, he wants nice food everyday but wonâ€™t cook it himself, then they I have to clean the mountains of dishes, the apartment is a fucking mess, he uses my TV and my PS4 all the fucking time.

Now everyoneâ€™s angry because I dared to complain about the shit day I had.

And Iâ€™m at the peak of my suicidal thoughts, maybe I should get an Uber home and just jump off the top floor, or off a bridge.

The last few years have been devoid of any major happiness or motivation to do anything in life, Itâ€™s really hard to picture my future being anything better than the hole Iâ€™m in right now, if anything it is gonna be a whole lot worse. I could just save myself all this bullshit and end it prematurely, Iâ€™m gonna end up dead anyways, and after Iâ€™m dead I wonâ€™t even realize I was even alive, I will just cease to exist... all I ever was and all my memories will just cease to be, and so will all my problems.

And yeah, I guess this is petty, and my problems are stupid and little, maybe Iâ€™m just a man child, but I needed a place to vent and I really have nowhere else, so whoever took the time to read this whole text wall, thanks for putting up with my stupid rant.
