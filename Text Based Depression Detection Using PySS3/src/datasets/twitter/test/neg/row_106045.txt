Society hates the male genderI'm so sick of my problems not mattering because I'm a guy. Nobody cares about your problems if you're a guy. They just don't matter period. Even if you're suicidal people talk down to you. You're problems don't matter. You're just seen as weak. I simply wish I wasn't born. It feels like society is against me. I should just kill myself. I have ways to do it quickly.
