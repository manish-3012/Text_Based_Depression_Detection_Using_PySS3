My gf is tired of life and she has contemplated suicide. I need advice or something that help her!I've been with my gf for over 2 years now . I'm 23 and shes about the same age. Last year she has tried to kill herself with pills.  One day after we had a nice date we went home, she went to the bathroom and came out saying she took a lot of pills.  I freaked out and took her to the hospital.  I was with her the entire 3 days in the hospital.  Fast forward to now, its been a year since her last attempt, but now I'm really worried because I don't want to lose her. I need her in my life. She is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I try to be there for you.  I don't judge her for the things she has done. She tells me everyday how she is unhappy with life and that she has accomplished nothing in life and that she feels no one cares about her. I've been trying to be encouraging for her and giving her hope that there's so much to live for and how things will get better.  I just don't know what to do anymore.  I feel that I'm going to lose her ðŸ¥ºðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

She does go to therapy and she takes medication but says that shes getting worse now. She was raped by her father for many years and was impregnated twice but she had to get rid of it because she said it wasn't right. She went through a lot of trauma and I've been there to listen to her past and be her support.  She blames herself that it happened to her and she feels disgusting and constantly having night terrors. 

I would just like to have some kind of help please. I don't want to lose her. I love her to death.
