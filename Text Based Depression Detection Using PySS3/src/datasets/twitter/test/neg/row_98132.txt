Everyday I don't kill myself is a mistake2 years a quadriplegic. Two years of this pointless worthless life. I exist to only afford the high costs of survival as a quadriplegic. Since I left rehab my days consist of being violated, working, eating, being violated again and sleeping. On repeat over and over again. Choice, freedom and privacy all gone.  

Dreams crushed, privacy stripped away, a spectator to life. This life is pointless.

I hope for the strength to shut off the survival instinct and pilot my chair into traffic.
