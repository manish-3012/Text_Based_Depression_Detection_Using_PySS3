Bleach round two23 y/o F. Diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder II (depressive) at age 18. 

Drank bleach once in one of my numerous suicide attempts a couple years ago but was helped in time..taken to the hospital where they made me drink milk to neutralize it. 

I'm in my last semester of college but I'm about to fail out because I've been so depressed this semester I can't leave my bed, let alone my apartment. I can't function..hardly bathe or brush my teeth. I just can't do anything anymore except have suicidal ideation and cry. 

I've been hospitalized 4 times because of this over the past five years. I can't check myself into a hospital now because I still can't afford to pay off the bills for the previous hospitalizations. 

I'm already in tens of thousands of dollars in debt from school, I have no prospects for when I graduate and I'm already bipolar and that just doesn't go away....I really just can't see myself going through my entire life feeling like this. 

I really think it's time.
