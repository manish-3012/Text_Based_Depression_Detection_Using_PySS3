Hello.I'll just go straight to the point because i'm really bad at writing.

I'm underage and still live with my parents. I don't necessarily want to kill myself but that's my last resort. What i want is to go to another family, that gives me more freedom. I really don't like my parents but reporting them to kid abuse isn't quite right because they aren't really abusing anyone. But i'm not happy, they limited my social interactions to a minimum from the start. Because of that i didn't socialise  quite well so i was bullied a lot. Running away is a bad idea too, authorities would catch me in an instant plus nobuddy would adopt me. Is there a way to move to another family? If not, how much sleeping pills would be enough for overdose? 180cm tall, 74 kg. 
I just wanna say that i'm not that bad of a child (at least i think) and have seen many worse. I know that i sound like an edgy 13 year old but i really feel bad.
