I can't endure this anymoreim sitting here unable to even complete highschool while i watch other people enjoy their life and have sucess. ive already attempted suicide before but barely managed to survive. People said theres help and it will get better. a year later and i still cant find a reason to even get out of my bed. dont even have a reason to be depressed at all. sometimes i feel like im just faking it. i doubt anyone really cares and i dont evne know why im writing this here. its currently 3 am and i just hope i wont wake up tomorrow. I'll make sure that i do it properly this time.
