Suicidal ThoughtsSo, my mom caught me trying to sneak a large amount of alcohol up to my room last night; which is definitely not allowed and against the safety plan. I had planned on drinking until I blacked out so I wouldnâ€™t have to think or feel. I just want the suicidal thoughts to stop and that was the only way I could think of to achieve that. I dk. I guess at this point Iâ€™ll try to make it through the weekend without acting on any of my suicidal impulses. But Iâ€™m just tired of trying to fight it. It would be easier to just give up ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸
