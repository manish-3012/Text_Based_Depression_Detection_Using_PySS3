Skipped class and work today to set up a therapist appointmentI was going to admit myself to a mental hospital, but I have way too many responsibilities. I canâ€™t just detach myself from the real world for an entire week or two; I have bills to pay and things to take care of. So thatâ€™s not an option. 

My intake appointment is this Friday morning. Really I wouldnâ€™t do this if it wasnâ€™t for an excused withdrawal at my college. I just donâ€™t want to be hit with debt for dropping out this semester. Donâ€™t worry, Iâ€™ll go back, but I need a break. Iâ€™m switching to working full time only after this. My insurance will probably be taken away soon so I wonâ€™t have to worry about the income restrictions anyway.
