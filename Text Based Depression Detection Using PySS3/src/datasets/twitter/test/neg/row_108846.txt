Thought of suicide for a long time but canâ€™t bring myself to do it.&gt; undergraduate
&gt; lost all motivation to study 
&gt;funding my own education by providing tuition to other kids 
&gt; family sucks 
&gt; dad as me to quit school cos he canâ€™t pay the bills at home 
&gt; older brother equality useless / not working/ not contributing due to his entitled attitude. Dad and mum donâ€™t bother asking him cause he somewhat entitled due to his mental illness 
&gt; toxic negative
&gt; ditched and dumped 
&gt; I am really tired 
&gt; I donâ€™t see the point of living anymore
