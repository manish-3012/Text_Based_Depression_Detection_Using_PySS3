I will always hate people for being happy and I hate myself for itWhenever any person I know gets into a relationship or has any person they love besides me, I start to hate the world, me, but especially them. All just because they have something i can't have. I have never found love before and whenever anyone around me does so I genuinely can't be happy for them. I always just wish it's over soon.
I wish miserable things to people that maybe hold me dear (at least they say they do..) and I can't solve the problem, not even my therapist knows a solution. 
Please help.
