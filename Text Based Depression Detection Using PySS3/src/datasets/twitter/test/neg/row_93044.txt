What's the damn point of life if you're a social retard?I have no real close friends and I have only dated once in my entire life and that was with a girl for only 2 months.  

I cannot date to save my fucking life.  I'm a straight up retard when it comes to dating.  What's the point of life if you live it alone and without any intimacy?  I might as well be dead.  The handful of times I've tried to ask a girl out has gone so fucking badly.  And they always end up either rejecting me or telling me they have a boyfriend.  

It fucking sucks especially these days.  There's this woman I really like but she has a boyfriend.  I think about her a lot and it's driving me fucking insane.

What's the damn point if I'm 22 years old and have the dating experience of a goddamn 5th grader?  

I seriously doubt anything will change in the future
