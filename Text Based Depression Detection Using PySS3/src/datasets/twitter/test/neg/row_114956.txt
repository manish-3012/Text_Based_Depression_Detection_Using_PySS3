Another one of those dayHey,

I'm a senior in high school (what a surprise, right,) and things have just been getting worse. I feel silly calling myself depressed, because my life is too good to justify that- I have essentially unlimited food, air-conditioned comfort, the benefits of modern technology, enough money, I won the unfortunate societal lottery and came out white, tall, and with a well-educated family. But whatever-you-call-it, this feeling, or lack thereof, is getting worse. It started out it foolish way- a girl, of course (yet another clichÃ©). I am far to shy in this regard to get anywhere near her (she's way out of my league, if you'd like to operate on those standards), and just as you'd imagine she finally got a boyfriend whom she absolutely adores. Recently I've been seeing more and more of them at school, just around in the buildings where I am at, and while it had started in this general sense of envy, it moved to rage, then to this sense of "depression." The guy is the type that I wanted NOT to be growing up- he sees no value in learning, in art, in any of those things I've tried so hard for so long to appreciate and foster in myself. But it seems those around me have deemed him more worthy, so if I know (and I can't help but think I know) that people like that are so bad, what does that make me? This general sense of worthlessness has since been creeping into my daily life, and I'm noticing more and more that there will be days, weekends, whole weeks where I will forget to be happy, and forget that you can be happy. Then when I realize I've just spent time acting like a moody child for so long, I think about how stupid and foolish all of my problems are in the first place, and how I have no right to be sad and....it spirals. It's getting worse, and I'm starting to get worried that in one of those days, or weekends, or weeks, when I forget what it is to be happy, and forget to be happy, something really bad is going to happen, and I'm damn scared.

Thanks
