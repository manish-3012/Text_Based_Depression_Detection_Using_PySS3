Money problems I feel I can't overcome have pushed me to a horrible place. I've never been the kind of guy to even consider suicide, but monetary issues surrounding a failed business venture have absolutely killed me. I'm approaching on $10,000 in debt, my car's transmission just failed three days ago, and I have been eating peoples left overs at McDonald's recently. 


I feel there is no way to overcome this other than taking the cowards way out. The only thing that has been stopping me is my love for my mom and friends, but even after weeks of thinking about it, it's starting to matter less. Something tells me they would be okay with it if they knew how truly unhappy I was.
