You're all probably getting sick of meI just feel like I have nowhere else to go. Last night was bad. I didn't sleep at all, and we are out of food right now. I can't even get a $2 frozen meal from Walmart. No ride to take me up the street, can't shop alone due to disability. I just feel numb today.

I felt so good a few hours ago. Now I just... I'm not all here.
