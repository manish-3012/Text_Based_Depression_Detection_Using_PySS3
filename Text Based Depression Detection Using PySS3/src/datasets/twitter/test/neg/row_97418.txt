Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (15M)Yessir this is my whole life basically, this rare ass condition ruins my life and tears me apart to the brink of wanting to take my life. What is crmo you ask? A bone infection where inflammation keeps coming back and it is really painful. I canâ€™t run as I have it in my right hip and one leg is bigger then the other by a short amount. I watch others run in gym class or do things I canâ€™t and I canâ€™t handle it this burden is terrible and I want it to end. I have had this since I was in 4th grade I am now in 10th, crmo only happens in 1  IN A MILLION kids and is getting more rare as time goes on. I have a lot of friends and a decent life but when depression and knowing your limited to movements and sports itâ€™s not a fun time. Itâ€™s getting worse as time goes on and there is no cure. The pain usually strikes worst at night to the point where Iâ€™m griping my thigh and crying and screaming for it to stop, it usually feels like someone is taking a metal baseball bat and a knife and constantly hitting your bone.  This life is torturing me and I think Iâ€™m in hell.
