How do you do it?The decision to commit suicide,that is.

I mean,don't get me wrong:I think(especially nowadays) that speeding up a natural process such as death to escape,say WWIII or the end of the world is very valid to me,but still..I'm just curious as to how some of you guys settled on suicide.

And how do you reconcile the fact that you'll be leaving a lot of people behind and that your suicide attempt may even fail?

I mean,that scares me! I mean,I don't wanna fail my attempt if/when I do it..I'd rather die than live as an invalid,for one..

And Why I settled on suicide? Because I don't want to see the fucking end of the world because of the twisted motherfucker that we have in the white house,and add to the fact that him and his ilk want me dead anyway(I'm a black man born to an immigrant family).

If we can't control the world,then we can control how and when we die,no?

Fuck this world,and here I see that a lot of you have the same mentality.

What is the point of living at all when one or two people can pretty cause the end of humanity as we know it?

Isn't just better to die? why the fuck does suicide have to be so motherfucking scary?!

What are we supposed to do otherwise? Suffer and be murdered by some(in my case) KKK/Neo-Nazi fuckhead that thinks Trump is god?

Fuck that shit.

I hate being scared of death,especially when it seems like a very good and even the right way out.

Life is rapidly approaching the "not worth living" stage,if not,we're there already!

All I need in two years if things continue is a bottle of Jack Daniels and a .45 and say...two hours to myself...
