It's not that I want to die, it's just that I'm suicidal.I have a medical condition. I've been receiving treatment for it with certain medications for ~10 years now. It took a bit of trial and error to find which medication worked and which didn't, but we found something that was working, mostly. Not ideal, but certainly better than nothing.

My condition is, in terms of the pain it causes me, comparable to late-stage cancer. I am awake most of the night crying. I am unable to work.

And now, my medication is being taken away. I have been spit on by nurses, doctors scream at me that I am "basically a heroin addict", because the medication used to treat my condition is an opiate painkiller. I have been told that, regardless of what I say or do, my medication will be stopped.

I must learn how to face this pain without relying on the "crutch" of painkillers. Any attempt at seeking relief from my suffering is to be reported as "drug seeking behaviour" and may be prosecuted as a crime.

The doctors and nurses speak to me as if I am a child, saying things like "nobody can expect to be 100% comfortable, 100% of the time" and "of course you're going to feel bad the first few days without the drugs, but that's just what getting clean is like!"

I! Am! Not! An! Addict!

I am not getting high off my medication! I have been taking it responsibly for ten years!

But because of some political bullshit that has nothing to do with actual medical science or practice, I'm losing access to the medication that makes my life just a little bit bearable.

I'm already awake all hours of the night screaming for the gods to show mercy and kill me. I'm already only able to leave my home with the help of a mobility scooter. I'm already in astronomical amounts of pain. And that's not touching on how people spit on me, harass me, and threaten me because I use a mobility scooter despite not being elderly. As we know, only the elderly have mobility issues, obviously, I'm just some lazy fat fuck.

Once I'm out of medication, it's going to get ten thousand times worse.

There is no way for a human being to live through that kind of torture and suffering.

I do not want medical advice. I am seeing a doctor and several hospital specialists besides. I am active in communities related to my disease. If there is a suggestion that exists that I have not tried, it will not be on the first page of Google.

Honestly the whole "I haven't heard of your condition until I googled it, but I'm 100% convinced that there's a simple solution you just haven't tried" thing just adds to the suicidal feelings. Do people really think I'm so stupid that I haven't tried basic common sense like "drink enough water" or "get enough exercise"? Do people really think I want to be sick so badly that I haven't even googled my condition once?

I do not want advice of the "get another doctor" or "report your doctor to the board" sort. It isn't helpful. The problems I'm facing are systemic. Trying to find a new doctor is called "doctor shopping" and is considered proof of drug-seeking behaviour. Reporting my doctor to the board will be seen as "you're reporting your doctor because they won't give you opiates any more; this proves that you are an addict". There is no scenario in which any of that will end well for me.

I'm not trying to swat away every possible suggestion, but the same tired "drink water, eat kale, and do yoga: remember you're only sick because you're a lazy, bad person who doesn't take care of themself" and "just get another doctor lol clearly you're too dumb to have thought of that because there can't possibly be a reason why that won't work" suggestions just make me feel like I'm less than human because of how stupid people think I am.
