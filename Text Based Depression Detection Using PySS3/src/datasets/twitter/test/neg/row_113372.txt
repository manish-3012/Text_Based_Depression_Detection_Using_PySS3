I killed my mom and now I have to kill my selfA few months ago my mom had open heart surgery that was done wrong and she was in and out of the hospital several times. The last time she went in she had to be put on life support and transferred to another hospital. She was there for weeks and they couldnâ€™t figure out what was wrong with her, she kept getting infections that they had never seen before and nothing they did would work. Eventually they called me and my dad in and told me I had to make the call, do they leave her on life support or do they take her off and let her die. I told them to take her off and I have regretted it every day since. I literally told them to kill my mother and I canâ€™t live with it anymore. My mental health was already shit, I have several major mental health disorders and am disabled because of it. I also have a severe self harm addiction that has gotten so bad that I currently have 5 fascia cuts Iâ€™m trying to heal and am planning another one. I just donâ€™t see a way out and I donâ€™t know what to do.
