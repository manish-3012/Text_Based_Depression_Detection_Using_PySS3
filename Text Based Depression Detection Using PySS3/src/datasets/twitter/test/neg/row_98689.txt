Iâ€™m so sick of thisLast year, I was diagnosed with Depression and PTSD which I have dealt with for my entire life. However, since it was with my school psychologist, I never got treatment and I canâ€™t afford to get treatment. I never had any friends and in my region, if you donâ€™t have any friends that last past middle school, you just wonâ€™t get any new friends no matter how hard you try. Everyone who Iâ€™ve ever gotten close to has ended up using me or I fucked up and hurt them. I donâ€™t have family to fall back on because my siblings are both significantly older than me and we never formed a close connection and my parents arenâ€™t helpful either. My dad is a narcissist who has manipulated most of my life and my mom had severe postpartum depression and we never connectedâ€”even though weâ€™re closer, it feels like itâ€™s too late. Every single year has been 18 years of things getting progressively worse and worse and Iâ€™m just so sick of it. I have nothing to give back to society and I fuck everything up and I donâ€™t want to do this anymore.
