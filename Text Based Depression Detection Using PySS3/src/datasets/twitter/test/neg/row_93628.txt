I can't even think of a title to my suicide post, that's how boring I amAnother day of waking up to a total of zero notifications on my phone. However today I had a class I only have once a week, I get excited for this class because there's a girl I have a crush on. I asked her out twice and she shot me down both times, but being a pathetic virgin who's desperate for female contact I still get excited just to see her. Today while partnered with her for a writing thing I found out she has a boyfriend. 

What a lucky guy he must be, he gets to have sex with her, feel her amazing body and spend all the time in the world with her. Meanwhile I've been rejected by every girl I have ever asked out and the closest thing to sex I'll ever get is masturbating. 

I could go on and on about stories of my life that brought me here but main point here is I'm tired: tired of feeling sad and depressed, tired of feeling unloved, tired of being envious of people who have friends and lovers who send them things to look down on their phone for, tired of knowing how ugly I am compared to others, tired of getting so angry I imagine stomping people to death, and most of all just tired of life 

There is a hierarchy of people, some are worth much more than others. Me however, I'm worth nothing
