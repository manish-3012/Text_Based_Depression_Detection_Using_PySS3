Aging has ruined meI have completely unblossomed. I'm only 17. I was an average child that became stunning in yr 9. I thought everyone was naturally nice, I was so naive. I really feel a loss of identity. Anybody that knew me then I can tell are shocked at how badly I look now. I'm that typical hot girl that's going to grow up ugly in her 20s while everyone looks better. I'm really lost, I know I shouldn't be living by others opinions but that's what I've been doing unconsciously and now idk. I have nothing else of worth besides my looks that are now gone. I overheard my mum saying my older sister is prettier and aging better. 
I'm going to kill myself. I've talked to the school counsellor before absolutely refuse to go to talk to a stranger about my problems again. Her and everyone won't look me in the eye they just stare at my blotchy acne covered skin.
People who I thought cared about me were just using me, I can't even trust my family. I'm going to kill myself probably by kitchen knife. I've learnt how to sharpen it, found the pulse in my neck which is probably my artery flowing blood. I might stab myself in my backyard, so any sound I make is less likely to be heard. But before that I'll do some exercise in the cold weather so it's a bit more effective. I was going with bathroom but I don't want the stench to be there.
I've never felt any form of love and never received it truly. My family treated me like a trophy and only feeds me so they don't look bad. I hate everyone so much including myself. Online as long as it's just text messages Idc, but if I met anyone in real life I'd be revolted.
