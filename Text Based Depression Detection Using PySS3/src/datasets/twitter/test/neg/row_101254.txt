Losing S/O, hopeless situation, don't know what to do. We've been with her for over five years now and fought with more bullshit than any couple should have to due to our circumstances. Things were always hard for her in her personal life, and things were fine the first few years, but the last year or so she has been constantly depressed and has been reflecting it on everything around her. She doesn't do anything anymore, she doesn't talk to anyone anymore, and she's becoming self destructive (started smoking/cutting again). She could overcome if she got out of the situation that's holding her down (horrible family life, soul sucking job, etc) and there is every opportunity to do so, however, I've done everything in my power to help, and she refuses to help herself. She has no friends I can reach out to and try to bring her around either. Though I see it as an absolute last resort, psychiatry has been brought up, but she doesn't want to see a doctor/psychiatrist. Not for any particular reason, just the usual random dismissal that she uses to push off going to the doctor or otherwise helping herself in general. She's changed drastically since we first met, and though from time to time she will come back and act normal, the next day she disappears again. 

I'm at a loss. I can't help her, she won't help herself. I will not abandon her, but the situation has all but killed our relationship. Relationship or not, I can't watch her fall apart like this. I can't just say "well you're broken, good luck with that!". I feel like I'm doomed to watch her fall apart from a distance, completely powerless to help. When that happens, I have a feeling I'll eventually find myself posting here of my own accord. I can't let this happen, I won't let it fucking happen, but what can I do, words have failed, actions have failed, and I'm miles away.
