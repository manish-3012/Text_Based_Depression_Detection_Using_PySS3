TAKE IT DAY BY DAY FRIENDS BUT DONT YOU QUIT[SIX MONTHS AGO](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bpbvfo/considering_an_overdose/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

I think I made this post back in May when I was at my lowest point.  Iâ€™m six months, Iâ€™m in an entirely different place â€” so much so, I FORGOT I was contemplating ending my life just a few short months ago.  Since I made that post, Iâ€™m not only doing much better and Iâ€™m much happier, Iâ€™m THRIVING.  I have managed to save almost 10k that Iâ€™ll be using toward personal investments to better my life.  Iâ€™m no longer with this man and in many ways, Iâ€™m doing much better than him.  Not that I wish negative things on him despite how heâ€™s treated me, but itâ€™s worth mentioning.  

I say this to say HOLD THE FUCK ON.  Please donâ€™t end your life when things are at their darkest.  Thatâ€™s the universe FORCING YOU TO FIGHT because whatâ€™s on the other side of the upward battle is a newer, stronger model of your former self.  A newer, better you with FORTITUDE.  A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH.  A STRONGER MENTALITY.  You can create POSITIVE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN YOUR LIFE when you fight for them, especially when things look bleak.  

You have to FIGHT to live your best life.  Hold on and FIGHT for what you want to change in your life!  I KNOW IT SOUNDS HARD, BUT THATS THE POINT.  I KNOW IT SOUNDS IMPOSSIBLE.  BUT ITS NOT.   Fight for your life, fight for your passions, fight to see another day to fulfill your greatest desires because you fucking deserve it and donâ€™t let anyone or anything ever convince you otherwise!  

I know everyoneâ€™s fight is different!  Mine may seem insignificant in comparison to yours and thatâ€™s fair!  Iâ€™ve been suicidal before, been in the hospital, been on meds, had the note written you name it.  This time was different; I felt like I had NOTHING LEFT in this world.  But this time I superseded my self limiting beliefs and I swear to you Iâ€™m in an amazing place right now mentally, emotionally, and physically.  So much can change in 6 months...please fight to see your new story!

I donâ€™t know you but I love you and I wish you an abundance of everlasting joy, a wealth of positivity and the fortitude to see towards tomorrow and create your happiest reality!  I mean it I love you!
