The night time is the worst.Everything is quiet and there's no distraction from my thoughts. I think of feeling very hopeless, feeling worthless and I do think of suicide. Having to care for my pets has stopped me before. But I see that I'm spending less and less time with them. As for people, I haven't seen any in months. The few I have kept in touch with seem happy to let me initiate and break off contact when I want.

Lately I'm just trying to get through each night without doing anything permanent. It's not that I think things will get better or that I feel like I'm worth saving. I don't actually know why I'm holding off. I do know that the idea of going through with my plans gets stronger with time. I've never had to manage my survival in 24-hour increments before.

I'm going out for a drive. It takes my mind off of things.
