I think I'm finally gonna do it.Hi everyone.


I'm writing this is kind of a suicide note/writing of my thoughts. I know nobody really cares how I feel, but I feel like writing this and having it out for people to see is enough for me to maybe feel at peace.


To everyone I know,
I never really thought I'd ever try to kill myself again. Or really want to. It's not really a "oh I want the pain to go away" kind of killing myself, but moreso a "I realized I just don't want to live anymore." kind of killing myself. May not seem that theres a difference, but there is one.
For starters, I used to think life went a lot better than people or my parents said. Sure, thats unrealistic, but even at an early age I knew I was dramatic. I'd make up lavish stories to make others and myself feel better. I'd make up lavish lies to save myself from guilt and trouble. I'd put on acts of crying and hysteria to bring sympathy and love. Because it was the only way I got it young.
When I was 4 years old, my sister molested me. She touched me, and told me to keep it a secret. It worried me for a while, because I remember it felt good. And I was ashamed. I hid it from my mother.
When I was 6, my sister pinned me down to my bed and threatened to kill me. She looked me straight in my eyes and told me she would kill me in my sleep, and make it to where I would have a painful quiet death.
When I was 10 she moved out, and the fighting stopped with my parents and her. But my brain grew darker, and I cried. I was alone, and I felt terrible.
When I was 13, I fell in love with a boy who said all the right things that made me feel loved and whole again. He knew how to sing me lullabies that would lull me to sleep, and kiss me in ways that made my heart skip. 
When I was 14, this boy raped me every night he stayed with me, and emotionally and physically abused me.
When I was 15, another boy mentally and emotionally abused me.
When I was 17, I was alone. Manic, I dated someone way younger than I. Then I dated someone my age, who then only wanted me for sex. I stayed, because I felt wanted.
When I was 17, I met a current boy. He told me things I had never heard, and spoke in ways that made me feel like he understood me. The darkness in my head began to make sense.
And then I turned 18. I was labeled with Bipolar, PTSD, Depression, anxiety. I was given 5 pills to take a day. I was given back pain. I used drugs, alcohol. The darkness still came. I went to therapy, to college. I became hypersexual, and extremely manic and depressed. I became reckless, inconsiderate, hopeless. I became unloveable.
And here I am, 18. I stand 5'3. I have long brown hair and brown eyes. I'm female. 
And I stand here with cuts down my legs, and tear stained cheeks and I think, "what is there left?"
And the answer is?
Nothing.
