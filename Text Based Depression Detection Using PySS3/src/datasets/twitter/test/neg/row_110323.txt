Living is overratedSometimes I feel like people are trying to scam me into staying alive for their own good, or for â€˜the greater goodâ€™. They always say the same thing: life is wonderful, of course there are bad sides but the good sides make it worthwhile, etc... The thing is- I already know that! Itâ€™s not like I hate life or think itâ€™s miserable, I just feel like Iâ€™m ready to move on to the next journey. Iâ€™m just done with living, no hard feelings. 

Before, whenever I used to get suicidal thoughts Iâ€™d always be in a really dark place. But recently everything just seems so clear to me. Iâ€™ve begun to plan out my own death in a couple of years time (hopefully I can join the 27 club), will try to settle my debts and get some sort of insurance and make the whole thing look like an accident so my family wonâ€™t be so burdened when Iâ€™m gone. I donâ€™t really feel anything about this, itâ€™s just a task like planning out a vacation. Itâ€™s like- I know for sure that I will take my own life one day, just need to work out the complications. 

Limiting my time give me a strong sense of control over my life. No more living aimlessly not knowing when youâ€™re gonna die. Itâ€™s the ultimate reassurance.
