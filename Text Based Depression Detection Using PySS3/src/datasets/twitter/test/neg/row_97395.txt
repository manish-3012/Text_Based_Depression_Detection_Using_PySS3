Been unemployed for almost 3 years.  I will be dead at the end of this month.  Period.Title pretty much says it all.  I am done.  I've never lived the life I've wanted and I've always felt worthless.  Me killing myself would be a devastation to my family, but I wouldn't be causing them to spend so much damn money.

And my boyfriend would be able to have his horrible problems without mine getting in the way.  I think I'd love to just be dead.  Not feel anything anymore.  I am fucking DONE.

I don't think anyone will really care, but I'll update at the end of this month with the words "Goodbye" before I do the deed.  I'll be suffocating myself shortly after that.

Edit:  Just talking to you people has made this seem a little better.  But I'm still frustrated.  I want to work TOMORROW and I have no idea how to do that.

edit 2: I'm going to log for a bit and try and sleep.  Wake up fresh and try again tomorrow.  But I cannot express how horribly being unemployed can make you feel.  I'm normally not a suicidal person at all, but this has pushed me to the most extreme emotions I've ever felt.  Thank you to all who have responded.  I will try to be on tomorrow to see if there are any new responses.
