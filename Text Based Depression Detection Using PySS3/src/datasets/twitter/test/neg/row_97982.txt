There are things I havent told peopleI havent told people that I have to stop myself from even considering having a relationship with others because I know that it will only give me another reason to live.  I havent told people that I think having kids is an incredibly selfish thing to do.  I havent told people that I wish my parents would die so that I dont have anything tying me to life anymore.  I havent told people that my lifes goal is to drown myself in liquor before hanging myself with my yellow scarf in my closet.

Its feels good to tell you now though.  Thank you.
