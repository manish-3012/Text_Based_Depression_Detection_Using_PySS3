I couldn't take care of a friendI'm unsure if this is the appropriate place to post so I apologize in advance if it's not.

Around two years ago, I met one of the best people in my life. I was at one of the lowest points of my life back then. I had recently come out of the hospital and was still in a recovery period. She always made sure to check up on me, whether that was seeing how I was doing when I woke up in the morning, making sure I had enough water to stay hydrated throughout the day, staying by my side when I had trouble functioning in general. I would go as far to say that she acted as my nurse during that period.

I later ended up in the hospital again. Not too long after I was out of the hospital that time, I wound up homeless. She and I talked over the phone around this time, and she told me that she got into a car accident.

That was one of the last times we talked. I wish I could've tried to figure out how to support her back then. Instead I looked after myself, scrambling to figure out where I was going to sleep for the night.

People in my life now have told me that I shouldn't feel responsible for what happened back then and that I shouldn't be too hard on myself. I'm not sure how to feel about it all. I am afraid that these feelings of guilt will only worsen if I avoid addressing them completely.

**TL;DR**

A good friend took very good care of me, but I couldn't do the same for her.
