I'm done faking it.I'm drowning in my thoughts it's getting to hard for me to even function the only thing that gets me to sleep is taking extra anxiety and sleeping pills I'm scared I feel like I'm losing touch with reality I cant cry anymore I'm numb I'm sick of faking a smile my suicidal thoughts have taken over.


I went out with my family yesterday and my mind kept telling to jump into the busy high way I'm so empty I don't know how much longer I can do it
