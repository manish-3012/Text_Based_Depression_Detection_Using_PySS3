I don't want to live anymore.I hate this meaningless world and all the hollow charitable connections I found there. I'm sick of everyone pitying me, I'm sick of constantly letting people into my heart only to realise that they only did that as a donation to lonely people like me. I'm sick of living in my toxic family. I just want to be alone! FOREVER ALONE! If I just disappear, no one would care. I should just disappear. I should just die. I want to die. I doubt that I'm going to let myself live much longer because this suffering is too much.
