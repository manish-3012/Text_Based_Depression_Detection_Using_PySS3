My life is so friggin horrible and messed up. And I'm actually excited about killing myself and I'm looking forward to my death.Yep, you heard it right. My life is so damn horrible, so much so that I'm actually excited about dying so that i can be finally free from this miserable life I'm living. Is it really weird to feel this way ? Or is it normal for suicidal people like me to feel this way?. It's like, I would prefer death 10 times more than being trapped in my miserable life. So I guess it's okay to feel excited about dying in my situation.
