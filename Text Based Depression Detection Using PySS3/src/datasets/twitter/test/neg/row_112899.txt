I've never been this close before.I... I'm new to this. I've had suicidal thoughts when I was younger but this is the only time I've ever really been driven to almost doing it. My mother is the absolute WORST with politics, so anytime someone tries to have a conversation with her she blows up on them and then drags my dad into it. 

My brother tried to ask her something about Bernie or some shit and she went on an unrelated rant about corona virus and then I tried to mediate like a dumbass and I was screamed at as well.

She and Dad and my brother got into a pissing match and I escaped to the basement to cry it out. But then she came down and told me how worthless and selfish and high and mighty I am and brought up my inability to find work and my own place. It just.... This whole thing is the last straw. This isn't even the first time she made us all bolt because she was in some fucking fit.

I have my athame, I have all of my brothers weapons. I'm so fucking close to doing it just so I don't have to be here anymore. I've wanted to die since I was 12 and now at 20 I may actually go through with it.
