I don't knowI've felt lonely for as long as I can remember. I've never had many friends, and even fewer who have cared about me on a personal level. It's always given me a bit of anxiety and many nights of going to bed upset knowing I'd spent another day by myself. I've put up with a lot of dumb things and made some dumb decisions in the attempt to feel included and cared about.

For a few months around the beginning of the year, my boyfriend made me feel legitimately happy and worth something - for the first time in a long time. I guess he made me forget that I didn't have anybody else, because he was all the company I needed. Some life issues have come up with his work and family, and we haven't talked much or spent much time together in about 4 months. 

My point isn't that I'm feeling so depressed because of him, it's really the opposite; he 'fixed' me, but the void his presence filled is back now because he just can't be around. I'm back to having no one who gives a shit about me, no one who wants to spend time with me, pretty much crying myself to sleep every other night because I'm no better off than I was years ago in high school. I celebrated my 21st birthday alone a few weeks ago. My dad forgot about our plans to go out and my mom blew me off to celebrate my stepfather's birthday instead, as we share the same date.

I've spent so much energy trying to figure out what's wrong with me for not being able to have what other people have in terms of friendships or even personal bonds to family that it doesn't matter much anymore. I'm 80% sure life just doesn't want me to be happy, and I'm starting to become apathetic to that as well. I've been quickly losing the little motivation I actually had to do anything at all. The only thing I care about still is my boyfriend, as needy as that may sound.

I wouldn't say I'm suicidal, but I've definitely had those thoughts. What would be different if I just decided not to go on, who would care, who would miss me? Aside from my parents and boyfriend, life really wouldn't skip a beat for anybody. Sometimes it doesn't seem like the worst idea.

Before anyone opens with the typical response I've seen in this subreddit of "I'm so sorry to hear what you're going through," please don't. A lot of my life is surely my own fault, although I don't have the energy left to fix it, and pity isn't what I'm looking for. To be honest, I'm really not sure what I want from this post, but there isn't anyone I can tell about the way I've been feeling. I really don't know. Maybe some strangers will care in their own detached sort of ways.
