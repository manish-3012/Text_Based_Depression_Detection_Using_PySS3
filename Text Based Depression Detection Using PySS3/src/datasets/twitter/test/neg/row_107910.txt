I need helpI'm an idiot. I find it hard to talk about my suicidal thoughts with people because they would look at me in a different light. A lot of things in my life are really fucked and I would much rather just die. I realize that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but I would rather take the easier way out.

Sorry I'm being pretty vague. I'm kind of paranoid that people that I know would read this and figure out it was me.

I don't know anymore...
