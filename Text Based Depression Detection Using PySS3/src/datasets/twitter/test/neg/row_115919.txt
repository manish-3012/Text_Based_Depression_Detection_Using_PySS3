Here I am again SW...It's been over a month since my true love left me. It's been a few weeks since my last post about my brother going to prison. Last night I was coming off a 20 hour MDMA binge. And was drunk. It was a very blissful moment where I could have been completely happy dying. As I sat in my room thinking about the past months. I really did realize how unhappy I am with everything. I have great ambition but I just don't feel like I can accomplish it. Memories flooded me about all the great times me and my ex had. my brain was being filled with all the times I had made my brother smile and tell each other how important we are to each other. He called me the other night and hinted a lot of things. Some of which a lot of us can relate to. 

In this moment of pure euphoria. It turned to darkness. I started to full out ball crying on the ground in emotional pain. The suffering is to great. I have no reason to live. The two most important people in my life want nothing to do with me(My ex) or are going to kill theirself.. Why do I even push on ward? Chances are I won't make it through life without my brother. He's the reason i'm alive today. When i was ODing in a suicide attempt he called 911. I'm such a selfish prick. Everyone has been so good to me and treated me right and nothing I do matters. I'm now just sitting in my dark room drinking and contemplating weather to use the shotgun or a different way. SW I ask for some advice. I beg for it. I just can't do it. Im shaking, crying and just want it to stop.

Edit..: fuck it all..
