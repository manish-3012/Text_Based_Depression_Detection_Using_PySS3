Dying from the insideHow can you be alive when you are dying from the inside?
When the days keep repeating it self over and over 
And you don't leave your room for few months just because you don't have the power to step outside. Because you already know what's out there ..
Nothing. Just the same community and the same people that you never asked to be born around them. 
Although i keep fighting back and believing that i could leave and believe that i have a chance to make it out of here .. but NO. 
I never had a chance
I never managed to grab one chance. Even tho i have lived 20 years 
Actually i didn't live in that "20" years, it's just a number to me 
Because i'm already dead and i have never lived 
I didn't even live like a normal human beings 
I have never hugged or even held a girl hands. 
I have never went to an open big library to read and enjoy the reading atmospheres. 
I have never went to a festival 
I have never knew what i really like to do all the time or how to find myself
Because we don't have that. At all. 
I kept jumping from a hobby to another month after month thinking it's not the right for me, while in reality i'm only reading it online and watching videos about it and just practice it in my room if capable. 
It's hell ladies and gentlemen 
It's hell to be born in Iraq.
