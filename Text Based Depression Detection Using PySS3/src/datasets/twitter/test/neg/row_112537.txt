I don't wanna wake up tomorrow.I hate everything about my life. I keep looking on Facebook and seeing people in college and watching relationships blossom...I get none of that no matter how hard I try. I'm stuck with a shitty retail job where I get overworked and yelled at constantly. My dad refuses to speak to me after he found out I couldn't get into college. What the fuck's the point?  When I die nobody will care after like a week. It's for the best
