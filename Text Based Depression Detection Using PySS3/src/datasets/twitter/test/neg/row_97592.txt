Why should I keep going?My life seems good. I have an apartment with my girlfriend and a good job but something's missing. I can't find a happy place or feel anything except for the urge to not exist anymore. So why stay? I plan to talk to my girlfriend about it tonight because I made a promise to her to always speak up about my depression and suicidal thoughts.
