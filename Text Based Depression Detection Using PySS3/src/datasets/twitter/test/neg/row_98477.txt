I want to kill myself because I am ill.long story short, I got infected with herpes simplex virus from my girlfriend when I kissed her. I had dry mouth/pharyngitis for one or two months. I visited many doctors and in the mean time I got MRSA in my sinuses and they are still there.

Every now and then I get ulcers on my lips and inside my mouth and I feel like it's due to herpes. I cannot breathe through my nose anymore. I visited doctors countless times. I think suicide is the only solution....

&amp;#x200B;

what is the least painful and most effective way to do it? I told my friends and they almost sent me to psychiatric hospital.
