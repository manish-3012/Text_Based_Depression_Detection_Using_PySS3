Thought about suicide for the first time last night. Just want to get this off my chest.TL;DR Thought about suicide last night, feeling really calm but paranoid now. don't know what to do.

I'm a 15 y/o male and have felt empty, alone, and depressed for the last couple of months, even though I have a good life. I have friends at school, no one picks on me, I take flight training, and a great supportive family. Last night for the first time I actually cried myself to sleep and the thought of killing myself came up. For about an hour or so I was planning what it would be like and how to prepare for it in great detail. The next morning I woke up at four in the morning really scared (like shaking scared) and paranoid that someone was coming after me. A few hours later I am going to school, feeling really calm, now I just don't know what to do. I'm back home and have just been in bed for hours. If you made it this far thanks for reading, I just wanted to get this off of my chest.
