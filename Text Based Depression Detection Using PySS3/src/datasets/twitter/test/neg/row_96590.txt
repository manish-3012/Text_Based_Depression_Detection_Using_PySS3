Just Turned 40 &amp; Iâ€™m TiredIâ€™ve just turned 40. Iâ€™m nearly bald, slightly overweight, but funny, smart, and honestly cute. However, I drink too much. Iâ€™ve dropped out of 12 Step shit and counseling. In the past week, Iâ€™ve googled how to tie a noose twice. I was in a relationship with someone for 12 years and not sure how to move past her. I keep moving up in a job that does nothing for me. Iâ€™m in a religion thatâ€™s basically somewhere to go each week. Iâ€™m still here because my family would be devastated if I cashed out.
