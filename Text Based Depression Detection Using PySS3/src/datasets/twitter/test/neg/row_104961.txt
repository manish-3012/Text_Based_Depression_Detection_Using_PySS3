Over a yearSo its been over a year since I tried to kill my self by hanging. That was December 17th 2014. After that I was in a hospital to get help until I was released a year ago today. So much of my life has changed, for better and worse, and in the days leading up to my one year anniversary I was shrouded with anxiety and stress. I'm still not sure whether I am happy that I survived. There are still times that I resent the person who found me and saved my life. There are still times where I feel just as alone and trapped. I have sought help but none of my sources were a good fit or else seemed to go no where. Maybe I just need to be more patient, maybe I need to be more willing. I don't know, it just feels good to talk about it. Most of the people in my life still kind of tip toe around me like I'm a ticking time bomb of disaster waiting to unleash my fury. I cant really blame anyone for that but it does aid to the feeling of being alienated and alone. Maybe I just need to nut up. Anywho thanks for listening... or reading, maybe i just needed to vent.
