I'm the only one considering killing myself on this end of year?I tought that my end of the year would be bad, but oh boy, it was actually worse than i tought. I've made myself a promisse to kill myself on january 1, 2020 because living has become an unworthy hindrance . With no firearms in my possesion anymore,  [I only have this](https://i.imgur.com/4pRYRhY.png) to try to kill myself now, as i have no balls to jump in front of a train or a moving bus for a quick death. I honestly don't know what to do, at one side i know that the next year will be the same as this one, and on another side, i still have a very tiny hope that it may get better next year
