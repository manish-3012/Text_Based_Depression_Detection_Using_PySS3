I turn 18 on 4/20, and honestly, I just wanna end it all.I was originally going to post on r/depression but I figured why not here. I've been planning on killing myself for the past month and I just need some place to vent and lately, all I've been thinking about is ending it. I'm 17 and feel so empty and alone. I just sat in my car and thought over the past 18 years of my life. What do I have to show for it? Nothing. This is the internet so I might as well spill my guts on my personal secrets that barely two souls know. You can choose to believe this or not, I really don't care. But in 1998 I was diagnosed with Mild-Severe Autism. I couldn't speak and all I would do is scream and throw tempertantrums. To keep it short, By 2000/2001, I made a full recovery. I was told the best job I'd ever have is pumping gas and I'd be in a wheelchair and diapers until 12. Oh, hey fuck you to Dr. Dickface who said that. Here I fucking am. Anyways, I was a medical breakthrough. Sure, yeah it's awesome! I'm one of the few kids and I can actually remember and detail what it was like to have Autism. Sure, most people think it's a blessing. But why me? I'm literally nothing special. I'm just a dumb fucking kid. Sometimes I feel I got the blessing someone else deserved. I was "undiagnosed" of Autism. I'm known as a normal kid I guess. I run cross country play basketball, work out and make music. So you wouldn't know unless I told you. 

But as I am thinking through my life, I remember everything. In fourth grade, I went to a Christian school. I'll never forget the kids emailing me (back when emails were cool) telling me to kill myself. **EVEN THE PRINCIPAL'S FUCKING KIDS EMAILED ME TELLING ME TO KILL MYSELF** saying "if you wanna be cool drink acid and kill yourself you suck like hell at football." My mom printed them off and took them to him and he had the audacity to call her a fucking liar. Then I leave the school, come back in sixth grade. Miraculously, I'm the "cool" kid. Just for a year though. then in 8th grade I go back to public school and everybody and their fucking brother didn't like me. Like I get I'm kind of fucking annoying but Jesus Christ. The kids would make jokes and dubbed me "jew nose" that was my name. How fun. So throughout that entire year I'm harassed and it bleeds into Freshman year. Instagram posts of me "Ew why the fuck are you sitting at this table no one likes you" !!!!! cool. So I switch schools again and only go two days a week. I'm well liked for the most part then suddenly the popular girl has beef with me and now? Only about two kids can tolerate me in that school. 


Look, I know most of this is mumbo jumbo, but it's real. It's really fucking real. At the past three schools I've been at, I've been the looser. I can't make friends at the schools I go to. However, at the other schools I have "a lot of 'friends'" Sure? Friends who only wanna hang out if it involves us either: Smoking, drinking, or if girls are there. If it doesn't benefit them? "Nah man I can't hang sorry." But the second girls weed or alcohol is brought into play, suddenly they can hang. I have no real friends here. My only real one moved to Texas about a year ago. For the past year, I have been so fucking alone. Wanna know who my only friends are? My family and my dogs. Outside of that? I'm alone. I see all of these people I think are my friends or used to be having fun all the time. Everyone is partying every weekend and I never get invited to do a damn thing. And when I do get invited which is rarely? It's either: A dead ass thing where everyone sits there awkwardly, or it's just a group of kids. doing nothing. You get the point? To sum up the entirety of my high school and middle school life? I am the nobody. If I hang out with anyone, it is only to turn up but other than that? No such thing as hanging out. People only wanna hang out if it benefits  them.

And again, most of this may not sound so bad or anything but. To sum it up, the past four years, I have been so lonely. I've cut myself up like crazy freshman year. My bestfriend at the time saw my arms, rolled their eyes and said "Oh my God." and walked away. Last year, on my birthday, not even ONE of my bestfriends said happy birthday. Wanna know how many people said happy birthday to me including my family? About 5 or 6. The year before though was a lot more. I probably sound like a dick but sigh. **I'm about to be 18 and I'm looking back on my life... Everyone I know lived such a great life full of fun and I never got that. I never got to really experience a fun high school life. Everyone I know has gotten accepted into their dream college and I haven't even applied cause I'm stupid and I don;t know what I wanna do with my life. the more I think about it, the more I realize maybe life just isn't for me. Which is why after my birthday, I'm planning on driving down to where it's legal for assisted-suicide. You know? Around the Mexico area. Life just isn't for me. It gets worse before it gets better. I got offered to have a fucking party for my birthday but I know only about two people would come. I'm just a nobody. People love to fuck around on me. I have such high expectations for my future but I know with my luck I'll end up in a shitty "Normal" 9-5 job and fucking hate it. So many people in my area have died lately too. And I think it's best I end it myself so I can prevent myself from feeling the pain of that. It's kind of like a kindness to myself, right? Ending my sadness AND preventing future suffering? I've been thinking about it heavily. The only thing that holds me back is going to hell and never seeing my family again. I don't know. I doubt anyone will read this. Half this shit won't even make sense. I'm just another fucked up kid with a bad attitude.**
