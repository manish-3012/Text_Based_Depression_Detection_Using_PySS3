The cord snapped...I was discharged earlier today. I turned on my phone, I noticed the insane amount of notifications I had received so I felt I needed to make a post.

I went through with my intentions. I chose a nice spot by a little stream, I watched the sunset for a while, just thinking. I decided to go do it, I hug for about 15 seconds before it got dark.

I woke up lying on back with a bunch of paramedics around my body, a dog walker noticed me on the ground unconscious. The cord had snapped not long after I passed out.

I feel terrible for the man who found me.

I was taken into the back of an ambulance while the paramedics took my vitals and talked. I couldn't talk, my mouth wouldn't move.

I was taken to a bed while more nurses looked me over and wanted to keep me over night.

The next day not too much happened, nurses kept checking in on me, a doctor came and talked.

I spoke with a mental health nurse yesterday, we spoke for a while, she wants me to arrange an appointment with my GP. 

She then mentioned if there isn't anything else wrong that I'd have to leave soon as they need the beds for new patients. They said I could stay the night but in the morning I was going to be released.

So here I am, back to square one, I'm still homeless. The hospital put me in contact with a charity that had some new clothes and tent waiting for me.

I don't know where to go or what to do with my life. I still want to die so not much has changed on that end.

I'm still shocked at all the messages I revived, truly amazing, thanks for that &lt;3

Andrew.
