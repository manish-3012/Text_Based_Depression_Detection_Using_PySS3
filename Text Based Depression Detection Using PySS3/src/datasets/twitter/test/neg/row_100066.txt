Does anyone here ever watch freak accidents that involves someone dying, and just wish that that person was you?I used to go on r/watchpeopledie and r/MorbidReality a lot and sometimes I would wish that the people dying there would be me.  It would make things so much easier because anyone who has even considered caring about me wouldn't have to feel guilty, thinking that they were the cause of my death.
