I can't do anything, nobody wants anything to do with me, and I'm completely and utterly without a single shred of hope at this point.I'm disabled. My family members stop all over me because of it. My friends have scattered to the wind. Employers tell me I can't do the job. Trained professionals belittle me. Even the things I used to enjoy doing, I can't even do anymore. I'm a fucking vegetable with nothing or nobody to turn to and no end in sight. Honestly, with literally no way out, seems like there is literally no reason to keep living. I can't even call a hotline because they report you to the police which ruins your life even more. I'm totally and completely fucked. Fuck this shit.
