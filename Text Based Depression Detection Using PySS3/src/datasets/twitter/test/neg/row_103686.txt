Not a suicidal post, but please readLately I've been really "unskilled" in everything, like everything everything. When it comes to things that I love like video games for example I get beat up by people that I usually (used to) beat easily. It's like they've gone better and I've gone worst at the same time. This applies to academic things, sports, anything where the better person wins. It's making me depressed to be honest and making me even weaker than I'm already becoming. I try practicing these things (tutoring, doing ball tricks or excercising, playing nonstop) but I only fail. I'm pretty self-confident, but I lose that confidence when I see those people achieve things or win things. Jealousy. I try to make this motivate me but it just wont. I try to  accept it but I can't. My goal isn't to be the best, but rather to become better and better and see the best of myself. However I just can't seem to accomplish this goal cause of all these other competitors that destroy me. This has also made me consider suicide. I'm 15 FYI
