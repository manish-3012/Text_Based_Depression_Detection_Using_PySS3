I canâ€™t bear life, anymore.It has just gotten a lot to bear. 

Stuff happens, and I end up spiralling myself into another dimension because of how short-tempered I am. And, I donâ€™t like being angry, I donâ€™t even think itâ€™s worth the after-effects. It overwhelms me, and I canâ€™t control it. Iâ€™ve alienated God knows how many friends and people from myself. Itâ€™s not fun being cripplingly alone, and to add to your own misery.

I canâ€™t go see a psychiatrist, and I donâ€™t know what else I could possibly do, at this point. I just want to be calm, and happy.
