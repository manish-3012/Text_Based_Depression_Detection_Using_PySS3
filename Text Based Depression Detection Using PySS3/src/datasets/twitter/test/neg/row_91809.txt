I'm about to get kicked out of collegeFirst, sorry if my english is not so good. Here we go. My family's not doing so good financially. My parents asked our relatives for money just to send me to one of the best universities in my country. Problem is, said university kicks out students who don't reach a certain GPA. My relatives said that they'll only help us if and only if I'm enrolled in said university I'm pretty sure that I won't make it because I fucked up this semester because of some problem. My last final exams are tomorrow, and most of my blockmates are looking forward to summer. I'm planning to kill myself before coming home on Friday. I've already given some of my stuff to my friends and I already have a gun. Only thing holding me back are the people that I'll probably hurt if I pull the trigger.
