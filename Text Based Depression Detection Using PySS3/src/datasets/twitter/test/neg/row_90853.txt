Letting my thoughts outI'm a 16 year old loser. I'm a high school dropout and I have no future ahead of me. I have no friends, no hobbies, and no reason to live. 

Throughout my life I've had one close friend. I was/am in love with her and she was the one person who I could go to talk about my feelings with. We don't talk anymore for a bunch of reasons (biggest one being that I have feelings for her and it'd be painful for me to just remain friends). The last time we talked was 7-8 months ago and I still think of her daily. 

The only thing I do is sleep. When I'm not asleep I watch anime or listen to music or something until I eventually get tired. I can't do anything else because I can't get a license or a car and I live in the middle of nowhere so work isn't an option for me. 

The only thing that I'm the least bit good at is using and being on the computer, but my mom thinks that doing that is the source of all evil in the world. Jesus, I sound like a spoiled bitch complaining about how I can't get on the internet when I want to. 

This is my fucking life. I sit and do nothing all day. From time to time I get up to take a shower, eat and use the bathroom and then I go back in my room and sleep so I don't have to think about killing myself. This is how it will be for the next two years if I would choose to live. I think one person will miss me, that being my sister. I feel like shit for having to do this to her but I think she'll be able to get through it just fine. The people I talk to online will probably wonder where I went, nothing more than that though. I love the girl who was my best friend more than anything but she'll probably use my death to get more attention from her ex boyfriend. 

And then I'll be forgotten. Oh well.
