Into the woods31M here. I lost my job in education due to the quarantine. Ultimately it doesn't matter since the job made my persistent anxiety and depression worse. I've dealt with unhappiness constantly since I was a teen. At this point it's been so long since I've felt happy I don't even remember what its like. 

I have a dream of operating my own woodworking shop, but I grew up poor and I've never had access to tools. Woodshop was cancelled while I was in high school. I have no experience. Even if offered the opportunity, I'd turn it down because I feel like a useless burden anyway. Thus, I have no skills to offer nor any idea where to start even if motivation wasn't an issue. 

Believe it or not I have a master's in writing. Over the last decade I have forgotten how to write in any coherent way. My ideas all come at once and there's no way to make sense of them. When I do write I drift into violent territory. My characters are self destructive and suicidal. My prose is bloody and incoherent. Its made me hate the only talent I've ever had.

I just want to be happy but as the years wear on I'm realizing it's not going to happen. Quarantine has made me more introspective than ever. I used to drown out my depression with loud music, but the thoughts have only grown louder over the last few months. I just want silence. I want nothing more than a way out.

Lew Welch took a gun and disappeared into the wooded mountains of central California. His body was never found. It feels like he knew something I'm only just now learning. I love the woods and would love nothing more than to disappear between the pines.
