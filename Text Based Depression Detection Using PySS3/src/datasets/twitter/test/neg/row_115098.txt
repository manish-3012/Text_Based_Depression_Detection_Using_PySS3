Feeling like a failureMy life is miserable. I sometimes groan at the fact about my past failures and how I wasn't always the golden child. I feel so bad for my dad who I've caused the most amount of pain. I want to become a lot of things and my dad is willing to help me out on those things. I feel ashamed for my dad because I'll repeat the same thing I'd always do: play video games instead of doing real, actual work. I want to become a game developer,programmer,artist, and animator and I've been looking at some udemy courses for those things. I've been currently working on programming basics but still I feel bad for my dad. I feel bad for myself. I can't even do anything relating to these things because I'm lazy and making my dad spend money on me again is so disgusting. I still have thoughts about what I did to make him mad in the past and it still haunts me to this day.You guys can DM me on reddit,PM me or chat with me on reddit. I truly need help and I need someone with similar interests I mentioned and those who're good with those things to help me out. I feel lonely and I feel ugly,skinny,and not smart enough. I'm a happy kid but I feel unhappy. I had plans to join the marines but I didn't want to because I wouldn't be up with their standards. Please help me...I might go soon and Idk what to do. I need help and I'm asking you guys to help me out.
