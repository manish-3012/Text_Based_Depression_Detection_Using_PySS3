What if the future isn't better?The last day of highschool for me is tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've still got exams but classes are done forever. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been looking forward to this day pretty much since I started highschool 6 years ago. Because right from the start I hated it, and I don't know if there's any correlation but the start of highschool was also the time when my mental health got really bad and I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I mean, I'm sure it wasn't all because of school, I can't speak about my mental health (mostly because I don't remember) but I've had pretty strong thoughts about running away since I was like 7 or 8. 

&amp;#x200B;

I should be happy and in some ways I am. This is possibly the big turning point for me. I can study something I'm interested in for university, I can wake up each day excited at the days possibilities. I can get a job and use the income to gain a bit of independence from my family and although it would probably take a few more years I could eventually move out (my family and my interactions with them are a frequent initiator for thoughts of suicide and depression). 

&amp;#x200B;

But now I'm just thinking about what everyone is saying and what I've heard repeated by adults. That this (highschool) is the best time of our lives and that the outside world is horrible. People saying that its a sad thing for me to leave highschool because university is going to be worse. My dad saying that my future boss will yell at me daily even worse then what he does to me. Multiple people saying that having a job sucks. I'm just having so much doubt that things are gonna change for the better. University is pretty much the same as high school. And yeah I'll be studying something I "enjoy" but like i have barely lived and i have no idea if it is something that i truely enjoy.

And then with all this doubt of the future being better than the present i just get depressed and think of suicide. Because why keep living if the future is going to be worse? The fear of death is always a big factor stopping suicide but throughout my life I've also had the possibility that things will get better. But if life after highschool is apparently so shit then why live? I am literally just prolonging the pain. If i die now then that sucks but at least i won't have to live another like year or two years in constant pain.
