Just got hired for a "dream job".And I still want to kill myself. It's just a simple enginnering job with amazing pay and I should be happy. But I'm not. Even if I like it and the pay is good I just don't think I'll be able to cope with the fact that I will have to do this for another 40-50 years. What the fuck is wrong with me?
