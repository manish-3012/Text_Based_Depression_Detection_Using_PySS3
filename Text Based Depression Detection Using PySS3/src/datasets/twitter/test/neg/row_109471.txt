When people say "I would miss you"Does anyone else who feels suicidal actually get a little upset when people say things like "Suicide is Selfish" or "If you killed yourself it would upset me a lot." I understand that a lot of people commit suicide because they think no one would care, and in that case its helpful.

But the way I would feel if someone said it to me (I've never told anyone I'm suicidal because I don't want to upset them) is that they're taking my pain and making it about them and how they feel, and I feel guilty that that is my mindset. They would just be trying to help, but I almost feel like everyone just wants me to be alive but doesn't actually care about whether I'm living. I've been in so much pain for so long and I don't even have a good reason, and nothing seems to make me happy sometimes. I just know that I don't have a strong future ahead of me and will probably be alone while everyone moves up and gets married and has families. I feel like I want to die once I'm older than 25 (I'm 21 now) because its just going to go downhill. And by then, my friends will have enough going on that they wouldn't miss me as much.

And no, I don't feel like I deserve to be lonely and in pain for 50 more years just so everyone can be content knowing that I'm breathing.

But I also don't really want to die.
