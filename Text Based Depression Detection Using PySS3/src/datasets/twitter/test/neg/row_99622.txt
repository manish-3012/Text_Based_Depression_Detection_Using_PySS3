I was feelin a little erratic earlier, and was really suicidal. I came here, and got some help and was able to talk to people who helped me calm down and think things through. thank you all so much, this is an amazing community. I appreciate you allso earlier I had made some posts (now deleted, sorry) about me being suicidal and wanting to kill myself. I had taken some drugs and a lot of pills, but I am okay. I was really depressed about my situation, and even though I didnâ€™t fully explain it to some, the comments were still very meaningful and really helped me get through the feelings I was having. I believe now can last at least 3-6 more months to see if anything gets better. I really hope that it does. and for anyone else reading this who has a plan to kill themselves (like I do/did), I really wanna challenge you to do the same. think of where you wanna be in 3-6 months, figure out tiny steps you can take to get there, then start taking those steps! (may not help your feelings but i can try to offer advice for specific situations if anyone likes). I really hope that everyone here can find a reason to keep on living. mine is simply that other people felt a reason to try and talk to me and help me and I was really touched by that. so I think knowing people care, even if they donâ€™t know me, kinda makes me wanna more care as well.  i hope I can do this. thank you for reading (:
