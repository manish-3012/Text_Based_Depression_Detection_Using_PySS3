Thank you(I don't know where this is would be the most appropriate, the best I could think of was posting it here.)


I'm planning on committing suicide this weekend after  I donate all my stuff to those in need and hang out with my friends one last time. 

I just wanted to say thank you to Reddit and the Internet for providing me with the instances I was happy during my time alive. 

To whom it may concern, I am doing this because the people that were most important to me have now fully lost all trust, love, and care in me. I am not doing this because of a mistake but rather a relief of the life I've endured for 20 years. I am scared but I feel this is the best and most relieving option for me. I will be happy passing away and my only wish is for others to continue loving and nurturing their loved ones, also for others to be good people.

Again, I thank everyone on Reddit for all the positive memories ya'll have given me.
