exhausted all options. vaya con dios.hi all. i have exhausted all options of ever getting over my mental illness. i cannot afford therapy &amp; in general am just a messed up person. I'm shy, bad in social settings, and just generally messy. I'm a woman in my late 20's and have never even had a friend, or boyfriend, have never had sex, etc. I am so behind everyone in life, and my mental illness makes it impossible to catch up because it always trips me up. i don't think i can go on. whatever.
