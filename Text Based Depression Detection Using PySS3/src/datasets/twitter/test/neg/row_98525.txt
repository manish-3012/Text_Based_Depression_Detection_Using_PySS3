Don't know what to do nowI've been in a long distance relationship for the last two years with a German man. A year ago I had a suicide crisis which caused a temporary split and an inpatient stay at the local hospital's psych ward for me. We got back together and tried to make things better. I started going to therapy at the local county mental health center (sliding scale fee), seeing the psychiatrist there every few months for med adjustments and such, and have been diagnosed borderline personality disorder and severe recurrent major depression without psychotic features. I signed up for the list for the DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) group at the mental health center. In the meantime my boyfriend went to a clinic in northern Germany for his anxiety. We started having frequent arguments, usually my fault, though unintentionally. I don't like arguing and I never have and I've always felt horrible. He broke up with me a month ago but we tried to stay friends. I've tried to avoid arguments but we had another one this morning and I felt horrible about it but he's now decided we can't remain friends and wants me out of his life. He was the only friend I had at this point, everyone else bailed when I had my crisis a year ago. Now I don't know what to do. I'm devastated and afraid and still desperately in love with him and don't want things to end but I don't know what to do. I struggle with suicidal ideation in general, even with meds, but this is making it all worse. I both want to die and am terrified of dying at the same time. I don't know what to do anymore.
