Can't keep goingLong post ahead.

I have had a pretty tough life (for a lower-middle class white male, anyway) - an extremely abusive childhood, along with depression, anxiety, social isolation etc. Along with that, I have had an undiagnosed eating disorder since 13, and have been self harming since I was about 8. 

I've been treated for post-traumatic stress disorder, along with depression etc. and externally my life has improved a great deal since then. I have supportive friends and I am in a much safer place than I was, but I suffer from a crippling mood disorder that makes everything feel like a chore/completely impossible - and this is no exaggeration. Often I will wake up, force myself to eat breakfast, shower, and then go back to bed, sometimes for the rest of the day. This is typical of an average day for me. A bad one sees me do nothing but stay in bed all day and sleep for 15 hrs+.

It takes all I have to keep it together long enough to see my doctor or psychiatrist for an appointment, and then often I will have a few days of falling to pieces due to the effort it takes.

I have tried anti-depressants which have made my mood more unstable and have pushed me to the brink of making an ugly, slow and torturous exit. I'm currently on a low dose of anti-psychotics, but I'm not willing to be a walking zombie because most of my interests are intellectual. Call me picky, but if it was a choice between being half-awake for the rest of my life or having an early finish, I'd choose the latter.

I have interests and hobbies, people and things that I care about, and things I would like to achieve but I regularly have weeks or months of inability to care for myself which means I'm not capable of maintaining relationships, work or study. This leaves me in a place where I can't make goals or plans, and if I do make any they go along with the likely risk of having to cancel them which hits me hard. I don't think about the future because I have been caught like this for 11 years with my internal situation getting steadily worse - so from my perspective, it looks rather bleak.

When I am well enough, I eat quite healthily, exercise regularly and try to maintain contact with friends. This often works well for some time, however, the inevitable decline happens. I have tried pushing through this downward slide, but this only delays and worsens the depression. I have also tried letting myself do what I need/feel, but this also ends up with me in the same place, only sooner. I struggle with the knowing that at my best I am a very capable individual, but that for the most part I have very little functional capacity.

The core of the issue is that I don't want to be alive, and so I force myself to adopt a more merry outlook. This leaves me disconnected from and at odds to my emotional experiences, which no doubt adds to my depression. The problem is that if I were to let myself feel how I truly feel, I wouldn't have survived this long, and even if I did I would have shut myself off from the world completely. So, from my perspective it seems like a choice between being utterly and hopelessly depressed or ignoring how I feel and doing what I can before I end up feeling utterly and hopelessly depressed until I can force myself to ignore it again.

I have tried therapy, and when I was younger it was helpful. More recently, I have tried to find a suitable therapist, but between my trust issues and my being intelligent I only seem to find therapists who play stupid mind-games, ones who I can't feel safe around or ones who have philosophical positions which don't sit well with me. I know this sounds pretty lame, and in a way it is, but it's incredibly frustrating to have to constantly dumb yourself down to get a therapist to understand you, to have to be constantly on edge because the therapist is coercive and manipulative, or because their position is in contradiction to your values and beliefs. And it's hard enough to get out of bed, let alone to meet a complete stranger to go over details of horrible and traumatic past experiences over numerous appointments just to establish that the therapist is not a good fit for me and that I need to try and find a new one.

I have dealt with a strong urge to end it when I have been feeling at my worst but more and more it seems that even when I am not that low I have the same urge. I don't see any way that things are going to improve for me and I have suffered so much, and for so long that I feel like I can't keep holding myself back from giving up and finishing it. Anyway, thanks for reading.
