Tired of Trying... No-one else doesI've been married for 10 years, together with this man for 15 years. I have BPD and PTSD (caused by him) - the BPD was only recently diagnosed and I won't lie I have been terrible to him at times during our marriage. He has also gone through multiple periods of psychosis... Currently he believes he's leaving me and going to be a chief in Cherokee, NC (just waiting on the room to get ready). 
He refuses mental health treatment because of course he sees nothing wrong. His mental freak outs have resulted in financial ruin, and my inability to cope with him and myself ... God, I guess in reality we have been a toxic mess. I love him to death but he's so close to being that homeless guy walking down the street talking to himself. He won't seek mental help, but he did finally confirm he wants to divorce me. That I have been terrible, disgusting, nasty, and abusive through the whole relationship... And can't wait until he never has to see me again.
I am supposed to be starting intensive outpatient dialectical behavioral therapy tomorrow... That I sought out because I know I have a problem, and I wanted to save myself. I wanted to save us. 

I actually believed him when he told me he loved me and he would never leave me.

No person is worth dying for but the life I have left sure as Fuck isn't worth living for. I'm 35, my youth is over and my life is basically over.
