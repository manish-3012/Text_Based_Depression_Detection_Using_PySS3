If i didn't have mental problems I could've been happy to be alive (23M)Y'all don't know how it feels like to consume a vast sea if knowledge and at the same time try to keep being sane and stable. Because whenever i think deeply i feel like this whole world is passing by fast, i don't have any friends, just a girlfriend but she's toxic.

I may have depersonalization or derealization, it's literally fucking hell, am unemployed, I just have a GED and is afraid to look for a job because I have severe anxiety.

I've been planning my death since January and thought that after my temporary job I had back in May, I thought when i was laid off, I could end it all. But I meet my girlfriend and covid hit then my parents got it then am in the month that I plan on ending it. I know that i could buy a gun and end it but am too much of a coward, my parents are supportive and care about me but with my fucking mental problems I just can't no more, I feel like I could faint any moment or have a anxiety attack. Fuck my life, Fuck my brain, Fucking kill me God.
