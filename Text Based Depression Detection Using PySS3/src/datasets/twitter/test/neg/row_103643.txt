I hate the modern worldEnglish is not my first language but I will try my best to convey my feelings. I donâ€™t want to go to school. I donâ€™t want to study and worry about grades. I donâ€™t want to go to college. I donâ€™t want to worry about finding a stable job. I just want to admire the natural world. But the natural world have been destroyed for cities, buildings, and factories. What makes us so different from the cows we slaughter for food? Who decided whatâ€™s right from wrong? I may be thinking irrationally, but I just want to be in nature, explore the environment, talk to animals and critters. Playing games like breath of the wild and genshin impact make me realize I really hate this world. Is it selfish to want to watch the blue sky? Is it selfish that the sounds of trees blowing in the wind eases me? Is it selfish to want to live in this world with no worries, no grades, no work, no worrying about the future. Let me die of starvation and rabies. Let me die of disease. Let me live a short life. Please, just anything else but this modern world that expect me to abide by laws and have high expectations. I want to die because these fantasies I can never fulfill. I have no other dreams than this, and if this is unachievable then there is no other meaning to live.
