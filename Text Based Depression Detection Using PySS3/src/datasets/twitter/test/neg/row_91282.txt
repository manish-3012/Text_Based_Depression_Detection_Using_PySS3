I'm totally alone and have wanted to die for months...My partner of 5 years left me a month ago and I stupidly agreed to move into a new place with them (after we got evicted from our old place) today is moving day and I just want to die. I don't want to go on like this. They left me because my psychotic episodes got worse and worse until they were emotionally abusive. My ex has ptsd and got physical because I forced my way into his room and the police got involved. I can't stop thinking about all the violence and I want to fix things but I know that's impossible because he blames me for throwing away this relationship by not dealing with my mental illness. I've been diagnosed with bpd,schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, bipolar and my ex thinks I'm a narcissist.I'm so sick of being so ill. I'm so tired of my mental health ruining everything. My brain is so fucked up and I've already tried to kill myself like 5 times since I was 16. I wish I had the guts to actually do it. It would be so much better if I was dead. I don't want to live like this anymore. I don't want to move in with him. I just keep going back thinking maybe they'll love me again but they never will and I HATE myself for still loving someone who is so vocal about how disgusting they find me. I don't see the point anymore...
