Tonight :)Hello Reddit!

here's my 2nd post.

I think up to now I'm ready to kms today.

I have all planned

I'm planning on drinking meds I think around 80 capsules (Calm)

(is that enough? Cause, you know, I don't really wanna wake up with a sh!t in my mouth)

I already bought 30 pieces and today will add another 50.

I plan to buy some food (burgers) Coke &amp; water

go "under the bridge" 

lie there and fade away with sound of river

seems cool to me

hope there won't be anyone else ...

Reasons?

well first of all

I'm really tired of everything

And tired physically and mentally

I am not sociable 

I'm kind of a guy for whom it's better to be alone 

I have a job, which I sometimes like

but overall I'm fed up with everyday same sh!t

I don't have enough to move or start anew 

I have family

bad situation, really

so it maybe that I'm escaping as well

but anyway

it's my choice ok?

why judge me?

it's my life, why I can't choose when to end it?

did I ask to be born?

I think this is life hell

if I'm wrong, I hope to go at a worse place

I don't believe in afterlife

but who knows...

I'm just weak...

even now I'm so much scared as time passes.

it's 4 hours till I'm off the job

hope nothing prevents my plan

but part of me is so freaking scared :D

my heart beats damn faster :D 

but having like 5 minutes of smile in a whole week is not worth living for me.

I hope someday it will be a perfect world, where everyone has a purpose and don't suffer

Someday...

Thanks Reddit,

&amp;See you all someday (if there's afterlife :) )
