I can try anything, do anything or think about anything. In the end I want to kill myself.Today on the way home,  after I visited a good friend,  I caught myself in a spiral thinking about how I wouldn't be able to treat a  girlfriend  decently because I am depressed and I have my bad days.  And it's my dream to have a family but I don't think I can be there for them if I need to.  So there is no reason to try and I would be better if I would be dead.  Another dream of mine is to become an engineer and although I passed my tests this semester I wasn't able to go to most of any lecture or class.  I just went there and took the exam.  I can't be around people and that's pretty much why I can never be an electrical engineer.  Thus I want to die.  I can't fight this battle alone even though I tried for 10 years now,. It's so hard to scream for help and get marked as someone that just needs attention.  Sometimes it's seems people think I do therapy for fun.  Just because I am always smiling,  but it's some kind of defense mechanism.  And that makes me want to end my life.  I will end up alone because I am sick and tired to get rejected with:"you're a nice guy,  but I am just not looking for someone right now. " like there are to afraid to tell me that I am not good enough for them.  And why do I need to wait all this painful years for something that will obviously not happen.  I know I have friends but they all don't understand mental illness and they are most definitely not my support system.  They only way I can talk to someone is reddit and that makes my want to die,  because nobody I know cares about my shit and I honestly don't blame them.  Because nobody likes looser in this society and I definitely  am losing my life.
