Suicide notesIf I do decide to "end it all" should I write a note? I feel inclined to explain why I have decided to commit suicide. But then again I don't really. However, I feel that if I do not explain what my situation was in some form of message it may drive someone close to me to a point of depression and regret where they will then consider following my steps. But I don't know. I simply don't know. I have not told them that I repeatedly keep coming back to thoughts of suicide I have only confessed once and have seem to convinced them that I am perfectly fine. But now when they ask about my states of mind over the weeks or days I have taken to lying to them and saying I'm fine. So now I ponder if I should write a note to confess once more about my lies and thoughts. Or if I should take a more "*uck it" approach. I don't feel like I want to be the cause of more death.
