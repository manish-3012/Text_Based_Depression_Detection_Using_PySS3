Not sure why, but here I am.I used to be such a nice guy. I exercised, went to college, was a loving father and husband. I've always had anxiety and panic, but I never let it get in the way.

I started taking anti-depressants, and suddenly started to drink more. I became a different person. And that's where I am right now. I went from a loving family to living in my father's home. I see my son growing up from a distance, and the woman I love want nothing to do with me.

If you asked me a year ago, if I would be posting here, I'd laugh at you. But here I am. I am about ready to stop. I'm a very private person, so if you happen to repond to this, I will most likely talk to you in PM instead.
