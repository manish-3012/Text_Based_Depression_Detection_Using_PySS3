I've been where you are. I'd like to help. I'd like to listen. Please message me.A little background on me: I am a 21-year-old female that has struggled with depression for most of my life. It caused me to throw away one of the largest opportunities I have ever been given. My depression and anxiety completely changed my life. With help (and medication) I was able to turn it around and, although I'm not yet at the place I would like to be, I am finally happy and somewhat successful. 

I would like to listen or talk to anyone who is feeling like life may not be worth living. I KNOW how it feels...trust me. I want you all to know that I am here. Please message me at any time (day or night) if you need to.
