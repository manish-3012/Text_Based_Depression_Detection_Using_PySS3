I've started to think logically and calmly plotting it out. And that scares me.I thought I was over this. I thought that everything was getting better and that we would be OK. Instead it just feels like I'm falling behind again. Like life is trucking along and its dragging me along behind it. I can't get my footing. And every time I do I trip.
I'm tired of fighting what feels like a losing battle.
I drive home at night and think about how easy it would be to turn in front of a tractor trailer. People would miss me, yes. But at least the life insurance and would help them pay off my debt.
The girl I love would be better off. She wouldn't have to use her money to my for my bills anymore. She wouldn't be restricted on apartments because of my bad credit score.
I could ramble on, but I can't bring myself to. I'm tired and my eyes hurt. 
I know I could be in a much worse predicament, but it still doesn't change the feeling of wanting it to end.
Good night, and thank you to whoever reads this.
