All I have is him.  My boyfriend of two years. I'm scared to talk to him about these thoughts. Every time I'm upset he just says nice things to make me happy. We never actually talk about it. He sometimes says that he's getting "tired" of me being sad. I'm scared. He leaves me in screwed. I love him he can't do this he just can't :( I'm terrified of what my being is capable of. I need help and I just don't want this to end I love him.. I'm scared :/ thoughts are racing through my head about not only cutting but also suicide :/ it's been months since this started back up again...... He's going to end it and I won't be able to take it it'll hurt me too bad help me :'( he can't do this


Someone please help me it's getting worse pleas please
