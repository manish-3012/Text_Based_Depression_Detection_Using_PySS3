I'm feeling as though I'm falling into a ditch and barely hanging onI grew up in a househould where i was sexually, physically and severly emotional abused. I feel like a broken human being that is incapable of receiving or giving love. I feel like im that board that never breaks but always bends. My life has been constant struggles of trying to fit in. All i want to be is someone that desirable and that has value, but the more i look at life and my peers, all i want to do is just live for myself and manipulate and use others like they have done to me. I'm an 18 year old virgin and i feel like that will never change. I lost 130 pounds in the hope of getting some sort of reciprocal romance, but that's a pipe dream. I'm only 5"9 , I hate my forehead. I wasn't born handsome. Like fuck, i'm developing hatred for my dad for even bothering to reproduce at 5"7(thats fucking horrible to say, hes a great guy but seriously i wish i wasnt born). Mom is a sexual abuser and hasn't been talked to in over a year, i long for an apology. '

I can't express my SEVERE depresion to any of my friends because i have an extreme fear of being vulnerable and taken advantage of. The worst part is, that i was 340 pounds I busted my ass to lose 135 pounds and put on muscle. But i still have loose skin and i look like a walrus. Nobody understands, I don't believe in god, he wouldnt of done this to me.

I would never kill myself but in all honesty its becoming something popping in my head more and more and its becoming increasingly scary.
