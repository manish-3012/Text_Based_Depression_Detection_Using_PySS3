Need AdviceTonight I ended up having a brutal fight with my brother over some personal issues I have with him, my family separated us and I feel as if they think I'm the bad guy even tho my mom witnessed my brother start it all, I feel really depressed because I have let my family down in the past and I always have this thought in the back of my mind that I'm a disappointment to them, I've tried taking my life in the past because of issues then but nothing I tried worked, this time tho it feels as if I can do it, I don't want sympathy from a reddit post, only advice because I have no one else to turn to, is there anything I can do to feel better?
