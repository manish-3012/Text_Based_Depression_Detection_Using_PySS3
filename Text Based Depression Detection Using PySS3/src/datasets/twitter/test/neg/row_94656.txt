FfsIâ€™m going through that glorious cycle of wanting to kill myself again. Fantasising about every way of doing it. Iâ€™m in absolute agony it wonâ€™t leave me alone, no medication has helped. I canâ€™t get any help for any of the mental health teams, they seem like theyâ€™ve given up on me just as much as I have. Nothing helps. 
I just want out of this reoccurring feeling. Itâ€™s so painful. I just want to be dead.
If they donâ€™t want to help me then why donâ€™t they just leave me for dead. One less person being a headache for them.
