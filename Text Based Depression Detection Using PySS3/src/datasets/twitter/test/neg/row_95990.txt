Thank you.My thoughts would look much better 
Scattered on the ceiling 
Pick the pieces up 
Tell me whatâ€™s inside 
Find my feelings 
And what I had to hide
What about my tongue 
And why itâ€™s bitten off
What about my ears
Can they hear anymore 
What about my mouth
Does it lie like before
Tell me what you think 
Is there peace in my pain 

Iâ€™m at my wits end.. Iâ€™ve struggled with schizophrenia for around 6 years now. Iâ€™ve always been very depressed. But right now Iâ€™ve gotten the perfect storm of shit that has me so tired. I write to figure things out. To put my scattered thoughts on paper and understand.
