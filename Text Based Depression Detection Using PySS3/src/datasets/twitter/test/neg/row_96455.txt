Feeling worse everyday.This last week has been hell for me, I tried telling my parents I was depressed and that I didnt feel like going to school, they seemed moer concerned with my missing school than the fact that I sleep 2 hours every night because im so depressed that I stay up with a knife to my wrists. I dont want to feel this way anymore.
