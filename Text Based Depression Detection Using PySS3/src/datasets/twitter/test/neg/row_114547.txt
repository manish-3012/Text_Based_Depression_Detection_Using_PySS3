I just wanna die.Hi this is my first time here. Iâ€™m a 29 year old gay guy, I met my boyfriend in college 5 years ago I fell in love right away when I first saw him!  5 years later we are going through some rough patches. I have server depression and on the 23 of July we got into a big argument over us we never argue! Ever since then we are due but he says everything ok I need to relax. Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself in the past and never succeeded Iâ€™m freaking out daily and wanting to kill myself. I have no friends or family, I have no one and just want to end it all tonight. I hate everything and just wanna die. My doctor doesnâ€™t care to even help I always tell him I feel suicidal and he doesnâ€™t seem to care and just tells me to stick to the same meds. I feel like my time on this earth will be ended by me slitting my wrists.. I just canâ€™t anymore love is painful and it hurts humans suck! I fell so hard and idk what to do :(  sorry I just didnâ€™t know where to go and post this I just idk :/
