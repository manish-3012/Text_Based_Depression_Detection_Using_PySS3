I'm better off deadI am just an useless piece of shit. Everything I try and make effort end up in the worse way possible, I am shit at school, my relationship with my parents are close to none, my mum cheated on my dad and on top of all that I have to make this facade that I am well and don't need a psychiatrist. I just want to end this all and make it better for other people in my life. 

If you think that they'll care you are very wrong, maybe my parents will cry just a bit but they'll move on with their lives and forget about me and only remember me on the day of my death. Honestly being remember on the day of my death is too much if I am being honest.

Sorry if I'm not making that much sense but I wanted to get this shit out of my chest.
