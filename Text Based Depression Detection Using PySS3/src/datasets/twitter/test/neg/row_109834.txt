Every night I think about killing myselfIt's a strange feeling. There's nothing truly wrong with my life, yet I'm always tempted to do self-destructive things. The few friends I've told are the reason I refuse to act on my urges anymore. It would hurt them if I harmed myself. It's frustrating not being able to cut but I resist. I resist so my friends would not have to go through the pain and the grief. I care more about them than I care about myself.
