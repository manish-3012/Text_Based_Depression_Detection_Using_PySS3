Let me help you :)I promise this is not just a shameless plug. Ive been suffering with suicidal ideation for the last 5 years, been hospitalized 4 times, done PHP 3 times and almost attempted 2 times. Throughout that whole time one of the things that sucked the most was how ISOLATED I felt. WEIRD. OUT OF PLACE. NOT-NORMAL. People at school always staring and whispering. Well I am DONE. We are not FREAKS. I have taken one for the team haha and I have created a tik tok account [my tik tok](https://vm.tiktok.com/GC11wX/) where I am openly joking about inpatient and antidepressants and mental health. It helps me in time of deep depression to be creative and I believe it will help you laugh a little bit and probably ease some of the pain :) Again, not tryna be famous i just literally actually have 0 friends and mental health communities make me feel less alone ðŸ¥°
