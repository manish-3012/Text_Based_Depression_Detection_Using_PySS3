I feel hopeless.Since last year I've had so many suicidal thoughts floating around in my head. I've always kept it bottled up making dark i wanna die jokes every now and then to release it a bit. But it's been getting to me now I really can't go a day without thinking that I wanna die. Like what's the point I'm in chronic neck and back pain due to my scoliosis, I'm an awkward and anxious shit who can't make conversations with anyone, I can't even get a Part time job how am I going to get a job in the career I want, I'm a mediocre student. I feel both angry and helpless. I don't really see the point of anything now. I'm still trying to go with the flow and plan for the potential future I might have, I definitely know im not going to attempt anything but the thoughts are there and most likely will always be there,and I can't stand them or bottle them up as well as I used to before. In a way I'm a bit scared that one day theses feelings will hit and out of impulse I'll try something, I don't want to tell my therapist about it honestly, The last therapist I told this too had me put inpatient for 3 weeks. I honestly don't even have any hope to get better i wish i could just end it.
