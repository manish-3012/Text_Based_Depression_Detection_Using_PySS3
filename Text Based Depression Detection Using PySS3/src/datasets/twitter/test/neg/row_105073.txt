I had a self harm relapse tonightJust got some really shitty news that lead to me kind of spiraling and feeling really hopeless about the place I am right now. I kind of lost control and didnâ€™t even realize what I was doing to myself until I saw that the â€œevidenceâ€ was literally ALL over my arm and now I also have massive bruises all over my body

The really fucked up thing is that i feel like it actually helped calm me down a little? 

Now Iâ€™m terrified because do have to go to school tomorrow and I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ll do if anyone finds out

I donâ€™t know what to do.
