The Only Relief I Get Is Considering SuicideMy life is more stressed now than ever. I feel nothing but impotence and weakness. All of my dreams are just out of my reach and there's nothing I can do to further myself towards them. I've tried distracting myself, but I only seem to have hobbies and games that frustrate or stress me out. And if I do something that is supposed to be calm and relaxing I get stuck in my head and feel like a pathetic piece of shit.

I'm tired of being pitied.

I'm tired of lying to myself that "maybe it'll all work out."

I'm tired of being crippled - because my weakness has ceased to be just a moment in my life and is now become a condition of my being.

I'm tired of feeling like my life is nothing more than pretending things are not the way they are.

I don't want to change my goals. If I'm not capable of my current dreams, then I'll have no dreams. And if I'm not dreaming I would prefer not be among the living.

I don't know how or when I'll do it. I don't even want to tell you guys I will, because I have a feeling I might be too much of a pussy to try and that this will just be another empty promise. Everyday the boxcutter at my work looks more and more friendly.

For years and years now, I've wanted one thing:

To tell people of my plights and my problems and to have them give me the okay to off myself. No suggestions. No solutions. No practical advice. Just permission to die without pity, without sorrow, and without love or hate. 

I hate myself for surrounding myself with good people. I'd rather that they'd have never met me. There are many out there who would be envious of my position in life, but I can't bring myself to be grateful. I don't take care of myself anymore -though I never really did.

My death will cause so much pain and suffering but I don't know if I really care anymore.

All of my life I've had nothing but doubts. Doubts about whether or not I existed, doubts about whether or not I really loved anybody or whether I was really loved by anybody, doubts about whether I could do what I've dreamt of doing. The only moment of clarity and peace that washed away my doubts, insecurities, worries, passions and discontentment was when I told myself that I was going to end in a given time period. I told my loved ones about this and I was promptly guilt tripped into staying alive and now I resent my mother, my brother, my sister and her husband and all of my closest friends.

If I cannot live a life I find worthwhile and death has been so comforting a thought, then why ought I live? 

I'd rather die than fall in love with someone else.

I'd rather die than give up on my dreams. And I've already given up on them.
