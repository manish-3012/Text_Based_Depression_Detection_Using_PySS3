I'm so tired of hearing, "You don't want to die, you just want the pain to end."No. Stop talking over me and telling me what I apparently want. You don't have my brain, you don't know what I'm thinking.

I went on a website today that claims to be supportive of those who are suicidal and self-harm... it has volunteers who will chat with you and so on.

I took a quiz on there that was titled something like "How much do you know about suicidal people?" I thought it would be funny to take, since, well... I am one.

One of the questions was (working from memory here, may not be the direct quote) "Suicidal people actually want to die." I clicked true because yes, I want to die.

It told me I was wrong, that most suicidal people just want the pain to end.

Now, I don't know the actual statistics, but I just feel like I'm constantly talked over and ignored whenever I say something about suicide.
