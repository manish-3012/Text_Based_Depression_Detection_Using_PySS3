Bipolar madnessI've been plagued with mental health issues since I was a teenager, and I guess it runs in the family since my father was an abusive and horrible alcoholic. Mom tried to commit suicide when I was 2 years old because of all the violence she was enduring. 

Fast forward to today, I am 25 years old and barely able to function. I have a full-time job, have had full-time jobs in the past and even graduated from a top-tier university. But I can't keep holding it together... I've been a caretaker, an administrator for an organization, and I just can't do anything for a long period of time without falling apart. I had a period of about 2 years where I did "well", still had my downs where I would sit for hours in my car to just cry, but as the years pile on, my condition becomes more and more debilitating. 

I was hospitalized 4x last year for suicidal ideation and an attempt that took me to the ICU. But I'm still here and I can't handle it anymore. I can't do anything without falling apart. I'm grasping at straws for hope where there is none and I'm tired of it. I'm starting to slip up and my new job and it's only been a month. I feel like a complete and utter failure because I went to college to make something more of myself and I can't function anywhere for more than a few months at a time!!! I hate myself for being alive right now and I screwed up this big event at work. I can't do anything when I'm like this  and I'm like this a lot. I've gone to therapy, seen various doctors, tried natural and cultural remedies, but for what? To fail constantly? This is no way to live and I wish people could understand that I can't handle it. I don't want to put my family in a bad place financially because of a cosign I have on a lease, but I know I'm going to do it. Maybe tonight, maybe later in the day.
