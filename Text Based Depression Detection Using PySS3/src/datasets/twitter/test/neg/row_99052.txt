In The Middle of NowhereI'm stumped. In fact, I think everyone is stumped when it comes to me and my life. Things aren't bad - I'm doing very well in a top school, I have friends who care, I have a great relationship with most of my family. Nontheless, I'm lost. 

I've had social anxiety since I was about 11-12 years old. I finally realized I couldn't live the same way when I was halfway through high school and saw a therapist and psychiatrist. I've been on several medications and every one works well until 6-8 months later and side effects emerge for some reason. 

I sweat constantly. I live in the northeast and right now still come home covered in sweat every evening. Ever since the first medicine I'd taken I'm still the same way, even without any medications. My face gets flushed for hours, like clockwork, every night. 5 to 9:30 every evening. I've been to dermatologists, tried the rosacea meds, tried laser treatments, kept food logs, tried extra exercise and no exercise. I assumed it was psychological, yet even here tonight on a Saturday evening with nothing to do I'm sitting here typing with an icepack on my face. I have no life now. Every evening involves sitting here trying to help myself to no avail. I've gone days without eating thinking the sweating and flushing could be caused by something I'm putting inside me. I'm a medical student and even I realize this is stupid, but I'm still desperate. Two dermatologists have said they're stumped; they cannot help me for either issue at all.

I then returned to my psychiatrist. He admitted my current medicine could be the cause and told me to lower my dosage. The problem is my lower dosage makes me incredibly depressed, something that never emerged before. Reluctantly I agreed and lowered it. The difference has been minimal at best. I call him again and he says to go back up to the higher dosage. I still know the higher dosage causes other problems for me. So I'm stuck here on a lower dosage that makes me depressed and anxious with a doctor telling me to take a higher dosage that may very well be causing physical symptoms making me even more anxious. In addition to that I have crippling stomach problems, which my gastroenterologist has been unable to find a cause for. When the problems come around I'll be spending hours curled up in a ball in bed, the only thing that seems to help with cramps. Additionally, I don't sleep, my hair is quickly falling out, and my joints hurt. 

I've had blood tests for thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, Lyme disease, celiac disease, everything. According to every doctor I see I should be a happy, healthy twenty-something. My parents constantly tell me it's in my head when I bring this up. I've tried high-vitamin diets and supplements thinking that may be the cause. I've tried, like right now, having nothing but bread and water for days. I've lost thirty pounds since September. 

Here I am. I have a list of medical problems that 1) doctors say don't exist and 2) my parents insist are purely due to my mind. I feel like I'm being eaten away inside physically and psychologically. I'm on anxiety and depression medication that causes problems at higher and lower dosages, and I have a psychiatrist that I'm paying 300 dollars per visit saying my only options are the higher or lower dosage and to "take the lesser of two evils." 

I don't want to be on it but I know I cannot function without SOMETHING. I feel like I'm being eaten alive physiologically and mentally and I've yet to find someone who will believe me when I say it's not just me dreading a college class or subconsciously hating my family or some crap. 

I'll beat someone here to it and say there are literally billions of people who have it worse than me. Every day I see children with cancerous tumors slowly spreading throughout their bodies and they spend their days smiling and laughing. Nonetheless I'm at a point now where I see no hope. The patient with terminal cancer is at least told the truth about their prognosis. The patient with a curable-yet-tough-to-beat illness that isn't responding to other treatments at least has someone who says "I know nothing is working, but we're going to keep trying and we won't stop until we start making you feel better." All I have is a heterogeneous group of people of different relationships and professions telling me "go home and push it out of your head. It is what it is." I feel like the boy who cried wolf when it comes to my health and mental issues. I know something is wrong, but nobody else will take my word for it. So here I am. I'm out of hope for helping any problems I've had. I've done my share, I've seen multiple experts, I've tried putting a smile on and pretending the world is just fine. Now the only thing I can think is that perhaps death is better than all of this. I can deal with having physical and mental health problems. I don't think I can deal with having nobody who believes me when I say there might be something wrong with me beyond "he just doesn't feel well." 

I don't know why I typed and shared this, to be honest. Maybe I just want to get it off my chest. Regardless, if anyone did brave that wall of text I want to thank you and wish you a happy weekend.
