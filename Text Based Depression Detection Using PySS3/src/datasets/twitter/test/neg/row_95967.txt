I've been in a volatile state for too long.I have huge personality issues and a severe tic disorder, both of which lasting over 5 years. Ive been in such a terrible state of mind for so long. I hate myself in every way possible, I get irrational emotions for literally no reason. I crash perfectly fine relationships by bringing so much shit in and overcomplicating literally everything. My classmates and my family until one point outright bully me because of my tic endlessly. I cant pass a single day without beating myself up over how fucking weird and broken I am. I'm 16. A 16 year old with several mental disorders, BPD traits, dysfunctional family relationships, going to a magnet school that shoves you do only the best. I cant drive because I'm a lazy pos and my mental instability doesn't allow me to anyway. I literally cant do anything right. What's hard to me is a breeze for literally everyone else. I'm actually just the trash on the side of the road that nobody cares about or bothers to pick up. I feel calm knowing I can literally just grab one of my dads handguns and end everything by pulling my finger a pound back, it honestly seems like the only way out of the dumpster fire that is the lazy pos, nobody, going nowhere me.
