Why is life so hardI'm not entirely sure if this is or isn't the right place to post looking at some of the others, maybe my curiosity isn't intense enough to be on this page but here goes.   


 I keep circling back to the thought of an easy way out IE just ending it all to put myself at rest, to stop feeling so alone and unwanted - a life without purpose or friends, and not for lack of trying either. My mental issues seem to keep people away from me, including any potential partners or lovers, and just friends in general. But most of all I just feel a void inside myself where I feel nothing but sadness, not sadness as in crying but just a sense of me missing something but I don't know what it is. I have worked so many jobs in my life so far, and I'm not even old, I've tried so many hobbies and even been on drugs/ alcohol which is/was only a short term solution to numbing myself and being able to some semblance of happiness in the moment by myself just watching some YouTube or something. I sometimes get invited out by work colleagues but I end up just sitting there realising I have nothing in common with these socialites, and I realise this is such a common occurrence nearly everywhere I go. I've even had counselling twice but nothing came of it, antidepressants once but that didn't make a dent. Sometimes I just feel life is too hard to live, and there is always one issue after another, and stresses every damn day. I have yet to have anything solid that seems to give me purpose or happiness in life.   


 If any of you out there have ever felt the same and somehow overcome it, I would love some advice. I'm not thinking of ending it all now, but I keep coming back to it and I want to find a way to just be happy and content with the misery that is my life. Thank you for reading.
