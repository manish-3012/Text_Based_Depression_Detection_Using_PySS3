One of my best friends has told me she's given up...          One of my best friends has told me she's given up, she's been through a lot of abuse physically and mentally throughout her life on top of being partially disabled and gay. She is one of the strongest people I've ever met (although never in person but we've grown close over quarantine time) and a lot of the time she's happy, joking, caring, and relatively happy. 

          But then out of the blue (or sometimes she'll start and go through the day/night) extremely depressed /anxious from all the above reasons on top of being in the closet to most people in her life and talk about how she sees no other options and after a month nobody would even remember her, or how people from her past who've caused her some of her trauma/PTSD can come up at anytime no holds barred.

          The other day I was getting really tired (been exhausted mentally and physically for my own various reasons) while she was trying to express her emotions about how she's been the last while and I basically crashed which I KNOW that's one of the worst things to do in a situation like that, I've been doing my best letting her know I'm here to the best of my ability to listen and give my non judgmental thoughts and just be here for her but it's not seemingly enough as she seems to be getting worse and worse in her mentality and I'm running out of ideas because I can only reassure her that her exes aren't the answer or that I'm there for her or that she does matter to the world and others.

          The anniversary of most of her traumas are coming up which I know is going to make it all significantly worse and I am going to do my best to be there for her but it's beginning to strain on my mental ability (through lack of sleep and otherwise) and also affecting my ability to aid her in her struggles.

          I have had many of my own issues with suicide through past relationships/friends or planning out my own "end" but nothing has compared to the challenge that I'm currently facing as I need to there for my friend but I need to do so in a way that doesn't lead to her suicide or my own mental deterioration.

And frankly... I just don't know what to do...

TLDR: help
