Am I A Mistake?Everything I do is wrong. Hell, I can breathe and it would be *wrong.*

 I just want to be happy. I want to smile because I want to.  I want to cry because it's happy tears. I want to be a normal kid who's happy, 

I know it's sometime's my fault. That makes it worse. I try so hard and I could never succeed. They don't realize I'm just a kid. You used to care so much about how I was just a fucking kid, so when it comes to your disadvantage, it doesn't exist anymore? I'm a freaking kid who just wants to live life. Why do you treat me like an adult? Like it's *my* fault the actual adults in my life failed.

Am I a mistake?
