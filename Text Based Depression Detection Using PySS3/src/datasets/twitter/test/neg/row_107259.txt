A Friend of a Friend Committed Suicide Yesterday.I never knew the kid. I don't know anything about the kid, hell, I don't even know their name or Gender. So why is it causing such an emotional effect on me? I feel like i'm about to have an emotional breakdown. I just want to go out alone and cry. Maybe it's because it reminds me of my own suicide attempt back in September. Maybe it's because of the effect it's having on my friend. Whatever the case, I feel like I'm not gonna be able to make it through the day today. And, to top it off, tech week for theater starts to day. Fuck.

Kid, I never knew you, but I hope you managed to find peace within yourself. Rest in Peace.
