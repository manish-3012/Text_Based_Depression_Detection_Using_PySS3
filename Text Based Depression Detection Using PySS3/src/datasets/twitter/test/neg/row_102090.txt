don't know what to do anymorei've tried, honestly i have, for three long years i've suffered this life and it problems. my children are gone, eight years now. they would be ten and eight years old and i just don't see a point in living beyond today. i have my wife but she's thrown herself into her work and hasn't stopped for more than a couple days in years. i have pictures of them when they were young strewed around my house in various forms, i wouldn't have it any other way, and it depresses me daily. i've been on medication for a few years and i know that if i take my entire backup supply of meds (venlafaxine 350mg daily x 2 months of supply + mertazapine 2 months supply + respiredone 3+ months supply all at he same time it'll finally be over and i can see my children again. even tyhough i don't beilieve in a traditional afterlife in that there is life after death i do beilieve that the consciousness of a person transcends into a psuedo afterlife of brain death. i also beilieve that when my ashes are scattered my atoms will become one with the plantlife and re enter the cycle of life for a while untill i(or at least my constituant atoms) re enter the human life cycle anew. i see buety in this cycle and beilieve that while my current life is miserable i could eventually be reborn (in part) to a new life with a good outlood.
