I hate talking about it so much, but I don't know what else.I have so much wrong with me, I'm so alone, and have been like that for so long, my entire life actually. 

The only times people acknowledged was when I had panic attacks, cried, or was on the verge of suicide, and even at those times, barely. 

I have no one to talk to, no one I can trust, I hate talking about myself because it always makes me look like a troll or a beggar or overall a ''bad'' person. 

When I reach a certain condition, I deplete my bank account, and spending money gives me some sort of satisfaction, I don't earn much at all, and my disability prevents me from getting a normal job. 

I know I will kill myself, I know no one will acknowledge me, I know that posting this will only get me judged even more, I don't even know why I'm doing this, maybe I'm desperate for any attention, even if it's negative, never knew much else.

This is just horrible.
