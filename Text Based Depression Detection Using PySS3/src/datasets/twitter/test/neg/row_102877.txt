If the best you can do is wait...wait.Breathe, fool. Breathe.

No. It wasn't the best day. But there's more right? Supposedly.

Too bad you don't own a firearm.

Too bad you're too fat to be supported by the ceiling fan.

Too bad you hate pills.

Too bad gravity ONLY guarantees falling.

Too bad all else is too slow.

Too fuckin' bad.

Your Grandma called you today. That invalidates what you're feeling. Someone obviously someone loves you.

Why are you so fucked up? There's nothing to be fucked up about!

Breathe.

Why can't...doesn't even matter.

Low. And getting lower. It's too much to ask for help. You're too far gone. You're too stubborn. You're too determined.

This is not sadness. This is my life.

You suck at everything else but you're good at waiting; even as impatience as you are. Death is inevitable.At least do what you do best. Wait.
