Itâ€™s rational to kill myself.Iâ€™ve never been satisfied with my life. Even as a child I always looked to the future but that future is growing bleaker and bleaker. Iâ€™ve always been an angry freak and based off of my life so far, any buzz advice like â€œitâ€™s going to get betterâ€ is what retards tell other retards. How the fuck would someone know if another personâ€™s life gets better? Thousands of people around the world are thrashed around by things out of their control. If â€œit gets betterâ€ were true, people wouldnâ€™t have suicide attempts years apart. Itâ€™s bullshit. Some people just arenâ€™t compatible with life and have no hope of happiness, weâ€™ve all seen them. Iâ€™m a creature of reason a slim hope that life gets better isnâ€™t worth the 60 more years of possible torment.
