I have the method planned. Now it's a waiting game.To cut a long story short, I grew up in a House of Horrors where I was the dumping ground of all the family's problems. Both my parents were narcissistic and malignant people. My body and mind are broken after spending my formative years being a Scapegoat. 

I have a strong suspicion that my abuse started in babyhood because my mother has always made it clear that she hated me. My Ndad is an evil, vile monster who should never be allowed near kids again. Between beatings he often screamed that he would murder me and I believed him.

I have no friends, no SO and to top it all I have Stage 4 cancer now (lucky me!). No treatments have worked and the pain is worsening every day. There's a limit to how much SHIT LUCK a person can tolerate in their fucking lives. Well, my cunty family will get what they've always wanted. I believe that I was never meant for this world and I'm biding my time for when I end it soon.

I'll be damned if I spend the last of my days rotting in a hospice with my creepy family pretending to care. They only live 15 mins away from me but have abandoned me. My bitch sister ignores me and prefers to spend her time sucking up to strangers. She rarely gives me the fucking time of day even though I'm terminally ill.

This isn't a cry for help or any such bullshit. It's just a rant I wanted to put out there.
