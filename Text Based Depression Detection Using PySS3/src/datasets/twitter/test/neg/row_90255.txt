i want to kill myself but i am worried about my familyi am 17 years old, i dont have friends,i have anxiety, i talk with nobody at school, i never had a girlfriend, i am almost always getting bad grades at school even if i try my hardest to get good grades, tomorrow i have a test and i am going to fail it because all i can think about right now is killing myself. all i do is staying in my room studying or playing videogames. i started thinking about killing myself about 1 year ago but i just cant do it because i dont want my family to suffer.
