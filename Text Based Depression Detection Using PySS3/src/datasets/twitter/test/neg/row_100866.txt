Something. I don't know a title. I just need help. 

I want to die, and I can't stop it. No one will LISTEN. The people who've said that they will aren't listening. I'm being ignored. I know he's sitting in front of his computer. I know he's got my message. But he hasn't replied. Am I really that bad? Everyone has the right to be bored of me. 

I don't have a job. Soon all of my friends will and I'll be alone in this city. 

I know this sounds stupid and my reasons are invalid. But I want everything to go away. 

I don't know what I'm looking for here. Help me.
