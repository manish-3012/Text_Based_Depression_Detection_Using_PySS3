No pointokay so i was very in love with my boyfriend and he all of a sudden left me. i feel awful. im empty. i wanna die. can you die of a broken heart? my heart is shattered. i've been very suicidal before we started dating and suffer with depression and anxiety. i've tried 3 times to kill myself while in the relationship unrelated to problems with my boyfriend. but i feel worthless. i'm lonely. i will die this time and no doubt about that. this is pretty much closure to me.
