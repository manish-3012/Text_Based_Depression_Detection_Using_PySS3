I'll do itLast time was as close as possible to jump but this time I won't reach out to someone who isn't there. This time I won't be held back by knowing that they'd feel guilty this time I will just do it. I've seen before how people react and I know that they can stand it.
Before tomorrow morning I'll be gone
