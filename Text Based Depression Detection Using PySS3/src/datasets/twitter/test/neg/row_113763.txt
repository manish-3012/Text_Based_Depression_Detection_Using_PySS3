to be honest, my diet is a slow suicide attempti've stopped eating. i have been throwing up bile all night. when i dont eat, i starve for days, then i binge and eat 5 pizzas in a sitting and throw it up. then the process begins. i go to sleep hoping i'll die in my sleep so i dont have to deal with anything else. my grandmother has 100% financial control over me so i can't travel or do anything.

my friends have given me an "official warning" that i need to start behaving correctly (i have bpd and i cant control myself) and im just feeling untra triggered and i can't say anything back because these are the only friends i have and i guess having friends who are constantly trying to change you are better than none.
