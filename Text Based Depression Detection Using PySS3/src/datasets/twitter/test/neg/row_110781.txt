Quite often I wish my mother would die so I could just  end it. (This is not a true novelty account but I am going to delete this question after a bit.  I want this to be anon but also show I am not a troll.)

I feel like a sociopath, even though I do not meet the definition. 

I don't even really care for my mother that much. That's part of the problem. I don't really care about any person in particular and from what people have shown me, no one cares about me either.  I really like the idea of love but have not seen it. Everyone I have ever helped has either fucked me or not reciprocated when I needed something.

I used to actually feel happiness, but not in a long time.  

And yes I am depressed and I have been to many tens of thousands of dollars of therapy, but I still feel the same.  

Perhaps this should be in r/depression.
