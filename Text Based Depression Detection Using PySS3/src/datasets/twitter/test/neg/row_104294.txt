Please talk me out of this whole I feel I make deeper every day.Hi, before I start. I'd like to thank you for coming here, I understand there must be many people in a desolate place but you guys do make a diffidence.

I have been suffering from depression for quite some time now, due to either my past and guilt from things I've done to my friends which they do not know about. Lately I have been unable to sake the thought of taking my own life. The person I'm closest to is my friend Hayley I like her a lot. She had tried to commit suicide a few months back and it crushed me on the inside knowing that if I'd stayed in touch with her that it could of been avoided. 

Until about a week ago I have tried to keep this attidtude to life away from my friends and family. However, even after explaing this to Hayley, and her giving me advice etc. I still feel this way.

Now, as I'm writing this, I feel as if it could go 50/50 whether I want to get up tomorrow and see her again or just to end it. I have tried self harming in the last 2 weeks, it seemed to work as I am that down I didn't feel the pain. I ask you to please show me something to carry on for. I haven't said anything about my past that was awful but I hope you get the idea of my situation. Any questions are welcomed and supported. Thanks

TL;DR: Depressed and self harming, please show me a reason to carry on.
