is it selfish to want love and attention when you feel like dirt?My friends are really good to me, but it feels like it's never enough.
I guess i was just hoping somebody, anybody could make me happy, but it seems more and more unlikely.
There's only a few days left of school and i feel i might do something bad if i don't have these people around me anymore.
