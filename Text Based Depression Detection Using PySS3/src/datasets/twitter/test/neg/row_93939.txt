Just need to get it outI dunno, I guess I just need to vent. My whole life i've had fairly severe anxiety, and it developed into depression by around middle school. Not a bad life by any means, just the usual. Parents divorced, neither of them were around because of their own issues, and I just kinda was by myself pretty much all the time. My sister was there too thank god. She probably saved my life more times than I can imagine just because she was there, but she's younger than I am and we're both just so emotionally stunted. Anyways I just locked myself in my room and played video games, read, just found ways to escape. Never actually attempted suicide, just contemplated it a lot of the time. Found out recently that that's called "suicidal ideation," which is just kind of an interesting term. Wouldn't have really thought before that the was a term for that. Whatever. 

Didn't drink until college, but then I definitely started self medicating. Heavily. Just cigarettes and booze, but quite a bit of both. I met my best friends that I have (with a few exceptions whom I met later) then, and relied on them a lot, but I bottled a lot up then as I still do now. I just don't want to inconvenience anybody. Generally speaking though that was probably the happiest i've ever been, and probably ever will be. 

First actual diagnosis of anxiety and depression I got came years later when I was teaching. There's a little time gap there obviously, but I ended up doing teach for america and becoming a teacher. Taught for a couple years on the west side of chicago when after a while I noticed that I was too frequently for comfort thinking about how nice it would be if I just drove off the road, making it look like I fell asleep at the wheel or something inconspicuous. Finally I went to the doctor and got some help, and started medication. I thought that was all I needed, but at the same time I ended up leaving teaching to work in bars, so in hindsight I clearly wasn't mentally stable. I had spent so much time getting blackout drunk to try to numb myself that a bar hired me on part time, then more time, then offering me a salary and I just left teaching. 

Spent the following several years partying pretty much nonstop, until I met my now fiancee. She really helped me decide that it was time to face my shit. I actually wanted a life with her, and to grow old with her, and to be a person she'd be proud to be with, so I quit the full time bar life and went back to teaching, and was actually pretty happy. Stressed as all hell, but I loved teaching, I loved my partner, and things felt ok. 

By about 2/3 through the year I realized that I wasn't going to have enough money to make it through the summer with no pay, plus my fiancee talked literally non stop about how we needed to buy a house, and I knew my credit was bad do to a mountain of credit card debt, so I started working a side job bartending again. At the time I foolishly actually thought things were going well... For the first time in my life I didn't really have to worry about finances, the debt was disappearing, and I actually had money to just spend on myself, on my fiancee, etc.

Keep in mind, at the time I was still dealing with crippling anxiety and what had recently been diagnosed as persistent depressive disorder. I was recommended therapy and for the second time I didn't listen. I knew I should probably start it, but I didn't have time. Insurance was difficult to figure out. I had to keep saving money. All of that. And I thought I was dealing with it, so what was the difference. But then someone very important to me had a stroke out of nowhere, and I was working at a bar, and then I took a shot when I shouldn't have and wasn't eating when I should have and I was on medication anyways, so when the cops woke me up in my car (which was parked and off, keys not in the ignition mind you), I don't even remember anything until I woke up in jail.

So here I am. It's been about two months since that happened, and in all honesty the outcome in court wasn't bad, but that suicidal ideation definitely came back. I started with a therapist (that's where I learned what that term was), but today was when I had to plead out and then a minor hiccup with the wedding turned into a mental breakdown on my fiancee's end due to the culmination of everything (which I don't blame her for but I can't help her and don't know how to cope now), and basically I just feel worthless. Like everyone might be better off without me. I don't know. Can't even call the suicide prevention hotline because they might call emergency services and I can't afford that bill, nor can I afford to take days off my summer internship. I'm leaving a lot out right now, but that's because I'm just tired. I don't know. Just needed to get it out.
