I want to die painlessly as possible.I am planning to take a massive overdose of prescription pain killers. I already have a large stash of assorted anti depresetnts and a fair few pain killers. Its obvious i would be able to cause a lot of harm to myself. 

The main reason i havent taken the overdose yet is i dont want to fuck it up. The last thing i want to do is take the medication and cause irreversible damage and live a long painfull life as a dissabled person.

I simply want to take a large overdose while in bed, listen to music and slip away reletivly pain free.

Im currently looking for a reddit comunity or something simmilar where i could find out what the cocktail of drugs i have would do to a man of my size, fittness and general health. Would it cause me to slip into a coma and my heart stop beating? Or would it just cause massive internal bleeding that would slowly kill me over a few hours or days?
