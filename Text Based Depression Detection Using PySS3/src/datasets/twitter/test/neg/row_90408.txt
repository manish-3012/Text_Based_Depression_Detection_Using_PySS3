Out of options. I've done what I can...I've been thinking a lot about killing myself....again. This is not the first time I've considered suicide. 
I've been dealing with depression for five years. It's been mild and it's been really bad. What's kept me going throughout all these years, was my boyfriend. My one source of happiness.
He dumped me over Christmas break. Now I feel so lost...

I've tried everything I can think of. I started on 10mg of antidepressant (Cipralex) in the fall. That was working until the breakup. My doctor said I could go up to 15mg. It's not working.
I see a counselor as often as I can.
I exercise every day.
I surround myself with friends.
But my grades are dropping, I notice myself slowly closing off, I lie in bed all weekend, and I can't stop crying for more than a couple hours at a time.
Nothing seems to be helping. I want to give up. I honestly don't know what else I can do to turn my life around again.

I don't know what I'm asking for. Suggestions I guess?
