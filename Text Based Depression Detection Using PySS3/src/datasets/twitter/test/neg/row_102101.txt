Is this a good idea?I have thought about killing myself every day for a while. I have been on a combination of drugs for a while (unprescribed) and I want off of them. I also want to be in a safe environment to stabilize so Iâ€™ve been think about going into a mental institution. Is that a good idea? FMLA will cover my work days that I miss.
