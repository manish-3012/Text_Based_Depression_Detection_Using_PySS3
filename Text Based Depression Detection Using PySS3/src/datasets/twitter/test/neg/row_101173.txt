I need help and I feel trappedI'm depressed and have anxiety, I was on short term from my job for 6 months and in that time covid hit so I was unable to get reliable mental health support, I talk to a therapist I am on several anti depressants. I am doing all the things they say you should do. And they aren't working

I hate my job but can't quit. I have no energy or interest in hobbies, anytime I do something I just feel too exhausted to continue. I have stopped having sex with my husband because I just am too tired and just feel like shit about myself when we do.

It's not fair to him and I try to be present for him but most of the time I am thinking about how to kill myself with the least emotional damage to him as can. I love him so much but I hate myself and feel like he would be happier without me, sure he would be sad for a while but he would be free to move on.

I can imagine a scenario where things get better. I just don't want to exist anymore. I don't want to do anything I just want to walk off into the woods and dissapeare. I don't know how to fix this thought. 

How do I fix it?
