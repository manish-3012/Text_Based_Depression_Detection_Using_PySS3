They wouldn't care.Thinking curiously over the prospect of me forcefully treating myself to a vacation over in the popular destination After Life, I've come to a rather solid conclusion.

No one would care.

Let me lay out the cards, here. Picture a loser who's equipped with gangly hair and a freakish body. This lowly manchild had 7 or so "friends", but picture scenarios in which these *friends* ignore our faithful hero, lowly loser, and, in fact, would not severely be affected by lowly loser's untimely death.

By the way, I'm the lowly loser. Thought I'd clarify that.

After much internal debate, I could only settle on the belief that my suicide would lift a burden off of their sore backs, so to speak. Gone are the days of having to deal with their *undesirable* in the group, they are free! Sure, they'll have to fake somber and regret for awhile, public appearances and what not, and they may even engage in a depressing circlejerk where they all take turns discussing how they could've done *this* or *that*, all while they truly know that they are content with not doing *this* or *that*, as it saved them quite the trouble.

It's really quite depressing. It's not something that exactly inspires a sort of will to exist, eh? Perhaps tonight's the night.
