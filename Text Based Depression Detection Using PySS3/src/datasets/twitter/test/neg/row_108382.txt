Resonating soundsSo it's been constantly on my mind for months now. Used to be just when I was lying in bed, but now it's always on my mind.

I was reading this one person's "journal entries and personal reflections assembled over the final days of her life", and she knew she would go through with it a year and a half ago. She finally carried it out last week Monday. She chose the best method it seems. Anyway I empathize with her reasons. I feel sorry for her parents. They love her so much. 

In her journal she added a playlist of the music she'd been listening to. I've been listening to it for a while now and the music really resonates with me. It's a really good list. It's a little eerie listening to the music she was listening to just before she died, but I'm feeling it.
