Reality just hit me right in the face. The real world is too overwhelming for me. Iâ€™m weak and itâ€™s just too much.This is the real world. This is where the rat race begins. I wish I had savored my childhood more. The thought of spending the next 60 years trying to survive in a world that is constantly trying to fuck me over is upsetting. This is an eat or be eaten world and Iâ€™m all alone. I donâ€™t stand a chance here
