272 days until I overdose and hopefully find something moreStory time fuckers,I'm not depressed lol funny right?!

Let me paint a mental picture

I am 24 years old I'm tall with straight brown hair and I'm white AF i live in canada graduated highschool just barley and have accomplished well nothing but learning how to think as an individual. I'm not like disabled or crazy or unhealthy I would say I'm just I guess different. So I work at a convince store (my first job) i currently have stable housing situation rent is a little high but not at all unaffordable I am able to save and I have no debts 


I would say I am just a lost  dude, I have social barriers that I enact to keep people away Obviously i do not have a love life and remain distant from intimate connections, i have no friends or people I'm close with. I do not have many issues but one of the big ones is never being able to be financially free to basically persue what I need and want, I feel as if I'm slowly dying inside to the point that I'm just going to snap one day, i cannot handle this never ending pointless work to just barely get a taste of what I could get If I work hard lol some will say I'm lazy and I am to a degree but this life burns me out everything is just so boring and primitive for me.

Everyday I wake up dreading the experience I have to live through Wich compared to (lol) a lot of things in this world is laughable for me. Some might think hey fucker you sound entitled maybe??

I'm looking for something more and there is just nothing but void for me, I have tried a lot of things like meditation and hallucinating on dmt and mushrooms praying to god.now therapy normally I would be all over but I believe most if not all therapists are bias and there judgement is skewed on the best course of action for me as a person.

Basically in conclusion I think I might be damaged goods so the best recourse for my person would be self termination in the most painless way possible.

Here's hoping ðŸ˜

If you feel like it shoot me a message or comment it would be at least entertaining.
