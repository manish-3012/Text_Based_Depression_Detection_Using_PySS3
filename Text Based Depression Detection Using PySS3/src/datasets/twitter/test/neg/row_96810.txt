Should i just do itI have figured out how to take myself out in less than 30 secs, but then thereâ€™s voice in my head say â€œnaw, not yet, just one more dayâ€. Im not worried about going to hell because I donâ€™t believe that it exists. 

Having a way out gives me relief. I started taking lexapro and it gave me false sense of hope. Itâ€™s weird. It makes me believe that everything is just fine, but in-fact it isnâ€™t.
