I can't keep going on like thisEvery day it's like I have a fever. I'm in so much pain, I feel sick. I've been depressed all my life, but nothing like this. I've started cutting. I never understood it before. I get it now. I've only done much less visable methods of self harm. I think some people have noticed and it's only making it worse. Everyone who is around me gives me shit for being depressed. Some more than others. It's caused me to be detached, yet that just feels like more ammo for them to make fun of me. It seems no matter what I do it just makes everything worse. Even the people who say they care I feel are just waiting for me to either get over this or fucking do it already. I don't blame them. I don't fit in in this world. Everything makes me want to die. I've tried following my dreams, succeeded, but I'm empty. I can't feel joy. It's been so long since I have. I don't think I'll ever be ok. Every single day, ALL my thoughts, if I am not speaking directly to someone, are about suicide. Every day I say today is the day and I can't push myself. I'm afraid of the pain really, is all. I guess my default plan of hanging myself on a nearby tree maybe isn't the best. Then I think of jumping off something. By the time I have this thought I wonder if this is just my brain trying to put me off of it. The same brain that is dragging me down this into this pit. I don't know what to do. I just want it to be over. Is there anyone out there who understands this state I'm in?
