I should have kept that TrintellixA few weeks ago, my GP prescribed Trintellix to treat my depression. He started me at 10 mg. I took one pill, and had an adverse reaction an hour later. Itchiness, intensity of emotions and thoughts, trembling, teeth grinding... at one point I ended up on the floor of the kitchen scratching all my scabs open. The feeling was beyond euphoric. That endorphin rush was the most satisfying I had.

My then friend and roommate rushed me back to my doctor's office, and he bandaged me up and told me not to take anymore. He said I could go home, but my roommate said she "couldn't handle me", so she called an ambulance (which I'm still pissed about).

Same thing at the ER. Don't take it again. I still had two pills left. I ended up bringing them back to the pharmacy. I regret that now, because looking back on it, if I had kept them, they could have been my ticket out of here. That intensity of thought, that more extreme desire to hurt myself... I could be gone by now had I held on to them, because this drug removed any lingering amount of inhibition about killing myself.

I should have kept that Trintellix...
