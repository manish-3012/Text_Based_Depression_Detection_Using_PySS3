I donâ€™t wanna be here anymore.I work 6-7 days a week as a manager. I have a lot of stress from that. I always feel like Iâ€™m not good enough. I get suicide thoughts. I come home and drank tonight. Took a shower and next thing I know I was wrapping the towel around my neck chocking myself out thinking I want to die. Now Iâ€™m laying here not knowing what to do.
