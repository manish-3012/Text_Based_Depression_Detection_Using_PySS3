A few hoursWell, I gave life a try and can't do it after twenty eight years. I'm newly unemployed without insurance and need medication badly. To get anything is going to take two weeks which I don't have. I can't deal with this major depression I've been cursed with. The past week has been a struggle and I'm not strong enough to keep faction it. I'm going to miss my partner and friends. But I just can't keep going on like this after three years. I have zero quality of life at this point and I'm just ready to be dead. 

Whoever reads this thanks I guess. 

Edit: thanks everyone that tried to help. I can't deal with this severe depression anymore.
