Feeling pretty down and like life is meaningless.Havenâ€™t been doing so great lately. Life is the same thing on repeat, which would be fine if it didnâ€™t suck. But I just go through it. I have many 1-2 hours of free time a day to do what I want, a bit more on weekends.  But everything else is just pointless working to make life suck less. Today I got targetted and bullied on reddit and thought this was one of my last few safe places. Donâ€™t really see the point in life if this is what my life is. My life is just suffering and when it isnâ€™t full of sadness, it is full of anger or anxiety. Iâ€™m tired of always having to fight these feelings or prevent/control them.
