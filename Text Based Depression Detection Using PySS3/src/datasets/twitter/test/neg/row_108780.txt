Numb beyond beliefBasically I'm already dead. This is hell and I'm okay with it. The world is shit and I don't care. When my dad dies I will probably just feel relief for him and for myself, and after that, I'm going to hang myself as soon as I have some privacy. I will go out relieved that I don't have to live in this fucked up cruel shitstorm of a world anymore.

I don't need any response, I just wanted to let it out. Nothing can change my mind because for me it's a long term, rational choice. If you feel like you want to support me, acknowledge my right to an empty life of apathy and my right to suicide.
