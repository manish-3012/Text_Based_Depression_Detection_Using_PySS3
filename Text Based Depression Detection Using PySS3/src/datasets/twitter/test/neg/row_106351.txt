You think they'd be able to use my organs?If I were to blow my brains out on the sidewalk right outside the ER, with a big note pinned to my chest "take my organs, quickly!" you think it'd work?

It seems a shame to waste healthy organs when there are people in the world who actually want to live. I just want to trade places with them. I get their death, they get my liver and keep living instead of me. Seems fair to me.

Why isn't that legal? If I want to die and you want to live, why can't I just ask the doctor to put me under, take my heart and give it to you?
