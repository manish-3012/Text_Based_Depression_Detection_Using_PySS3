-They said that, if I started going to AA meetings, and got serious about my recovery, Iâ€™d feel better.

-They said that, if I found the right person, Iâ€™d feel better.

-They said that, if I found a nice SO, Iâ€™d feel better.

-They said that, if I got a decent job, Iâ€™d feel better.

-They said that, if I went to see a doctor and got some meds to help me out, Iâ€™d feel better.

They said that, if I started going to therapy, Iâ€™d feel better.
