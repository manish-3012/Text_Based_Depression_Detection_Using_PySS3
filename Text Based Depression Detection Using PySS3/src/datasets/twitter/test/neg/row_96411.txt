I'm doneI've recently talked about my relationship with my boyfriend on another subreddit
(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bsnk9y/my_boyfriend_35m_has_sent_multiple_women/)
We got into a argument today and I told him the house we are living in is his mother's. Not his. Which is true. He told me I should find a better man and that he's tired of being in a relationship. I've seen today that he's been messaging a girl online asking her what she's doing and he lied to me about that. His mother got involved and told him to leave. Thing is she wants me to stay so she could take care of me. I don't want to leave without him and he says we're going our separate ways in 2 weeks. I don't know what to do. I already tried to kill myself tonight but was interfered with. He's sleeping in the same room as me and I'm planning on trying again right now. I don't want his attention by trying to commit suicide. I genuinely want to die. But have nowhere to do it in peace. I don't know what to do
