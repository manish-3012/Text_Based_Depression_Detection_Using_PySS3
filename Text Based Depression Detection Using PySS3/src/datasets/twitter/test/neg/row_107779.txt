End? No, the journey doesn't end here. Death is just another path... One that we all must take.I've tried to tell my family how I feel but I don't think they really understand, or maybe they might think I'm overreacting. If I decide to end it, it won't make any difference to you guys. You don't really know me. We've never met. I'm so fucking tired and the pain in my chest is just too much now.
