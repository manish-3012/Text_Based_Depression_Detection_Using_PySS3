I hate myselfI am not happy about any part of my life. Nothing brings me joy anymore, I just feel empty. I don't want to die, I really don't but it seems so much better than whatever this shit is.

I turn 18 in about 2 weeks, that means easy access to alcohol. Right now, I drink whatever I can find. I fucking drank mouthwash the other day. I am going to be a drunk lowlife, that's my life. I know it. I already cover pretty much every other clichÃ©, may as well get that one as well.

I am writing this because there are some razor blades in my draw next to me and I am desperately trying not to grab them. My life is me trying, and failing, to not cut myself. 

I'm a fucking pathetic human being. I hate everything about me, I deserve to die. I shouldn't be alive. If anyone is looking for someone to kill, they can come to me because I don't give a shit.

People say they give a shit. They don't. It's all a fucking joke. I really want to disappear. Ever since I can remember, I've known I'm not going to make it to adulthood.
 Guess what, I'm starting to think I was right.
