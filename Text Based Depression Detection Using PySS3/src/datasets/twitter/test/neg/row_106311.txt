Regret is the worst feelingI'm an international student and I really regret it. I was unhappy in my shit 3rd world country and thought maybe if I left to a ''better'' place I would also feel better. I've always wanted to go to Canada or the U.S.A but my family isn't rich and can't afford to send me to these countries. So I saw an opportunity to go to an european country and took it. I've been living here for 1.5 months and hate it for reasons too long for me to list here. I'm finding it hard to deal with the feeling of regret. If I knew it was going to be like this I would have never thought about coming here in the first place. The only thing keeping me alive are my parents because they are wasting their money on me but honestly if I die right now they won't ever have to spend another dime on me, which is a good thing. I've been suicidal for 10 years of my life, it should have been obvious nothing would have improved by just switching places.      
EDIT:  the fact that I have no one to talk to and I have to resort to reddit really does not help my situation. I'm 100% alone - no friends, no acquaintances. So far I have interacted more with professors and the lady at the bank than with any other student because I was given a fucked up time table and don't watch any classes with people from my course.
