Autism is a perfectly valid reason to kill youselfI am an autistic woman. Nobody really wants us around. I mean, in some countries less than 100 years ago we'd just be gassed.

Look at the stats for employment/happiness for autistic people - they are shockingly low. I've been made fun of, teased, bullied, molested. No one wants to be my friend. Even though I am very high functioning, there's clearly something wrong with me.

Everyone says suicide is bad, but is it really? I just want to end my pain. I'm constantly used.
