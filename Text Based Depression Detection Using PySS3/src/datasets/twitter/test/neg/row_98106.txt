I felt happy for the first time in ages and then all that went awayI was happy yesterday and a few hours this morning. I felt like I could do anything, i had so much energy and hope everything was wonderful. 

I thought that the antidepressants finally worked, but it was just for a day? Now I'm really bad i feel like someone has beat me up with a bat. It was all so great and now it's not and I dont know what to do.

I tried doing the same things I did yesterday but it doesn't work. I'm desperately chasing happiness and I've never felt more miserable

How do I get it back? How do I become happy again? I felt amazing but now it's gone and I dont know what to do pls help
