A message from a suicidal idealistHello.i wish you well.if you're here,it's for a reason.i mean this subreddit,not a cliche,haha.I just wanted to share with you the thing that has won the debate against the suidal ideas the last few times for me.in the last 100 years, technology has advanced so quickly that the world we live in is entirely changed.technology is moving so incredibly quickly that WHATEVER your problem is, a happy solution is incredibly likely to be invented in the next twenty years.its okay if you cannot fathom how that will happen,thats okay,because the world definitely has smarter people than you :( ,and they are going to solve the problem :) .all you need to do is relax and try your best to be content with that as the answer,because it's a hell of a lot of a better one than any humans have had in history before.you are at an advantage by literally being alive rn,so try and be content with that.
