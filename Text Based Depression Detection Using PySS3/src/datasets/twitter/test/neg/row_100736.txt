How do you tell your friends you want to kill yourself?I want to share how I'm feeling so badly but I don't know how to. No one I know has an inkling of what's going on with me. I've kept this facade up for a long time but I really want to let other people in on my life. I've tried doing this on my own but nothing is working; my attitude hasn't changed and it's getting worse. For fuck's sake I have bullets already. My parents and family are out of the question. If I'm going to share what's truly going on with me, I want it to be with my friends first - less consequences. 

If I say something, I don't know how they will react or if they will even listen to what I have to say. I don't want to seem like I'm calling out for attention. I also don't want to drop this on them and make them worry about me - the whole reason why I've kept this from everyone is that I don't want to stir the pot and become a burden for everyone else. This is my problem and I need to fix it...simple. But fuck me, why can't this be simpler. I'm sitting in my room, lone and drunk as hell because I want to feel something and this is all I can think about. Sorry for the rambling but I wanted to ask.
