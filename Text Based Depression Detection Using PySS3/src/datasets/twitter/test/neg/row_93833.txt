uselessnobody would care if i died, would they? i don't blame them. i was never an important enough part of their lives. they ignore me until they want something from me, they pretend to care when they would rather have me gone. it's so shitty to care so much about everyone around you and not receive anything in return. death sounds like a better option than living so alone right now.
