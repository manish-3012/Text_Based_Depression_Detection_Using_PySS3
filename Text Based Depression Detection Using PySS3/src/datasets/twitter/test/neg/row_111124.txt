Persuade me that there are any reasons to live.As the title says. Life is miserable. I hate the way organic creatures live. DNA is vulnerable to damage and imperfect, leading to the event of slow deterioration of anything that is building you up. You live to lose everything and die forgotten. You can't trust anyone, get any love from anyone. Anything in this world can be denied, doubted, proven different from another point or simply bought with money.  


I can't live like this. I wanted to get an advice. I have got really no friends due to my personality. I have always been dominant, trying to develop at the most, willing to do the best and try however I could. Since I remember I was suicidal. I always had issues in my life, from early childhood to fucking high school. I have never taken drugs, never drank much but I also never hanged out, haf a girlfriend or anybody. I can't even seek for help in dating online or friends online, because it won't work. People aren't willing to risk anything for another person, they don't care. I don't believe in any sort of love, it must be driven just by instrincts and egoism. How can one fucking love anyone if they do shit in their life and then "change" or "learn" or seek for morons who will be their beta helpers and give warmth and care to somebody who spent their life fucking at clubs or being everywhere but not any close to books or education?  
Why does every person will always make fun of me having some sort of will or dreams to ever develop into scientific subjects or something that isnt clubs and pubs? I doubt that I could ever find anyone, it will take my years, 10,15 maybe more. I will spend my life being unhappy and depressed, wondering if to not end my fucking life at any new chance. It only gets worse. I am ageing and I missed out a lot. I always had a strong desire for a girl to care for me and love me, but I always demand a lot. How can one care of you if knowing that you're depressed they do nothing? If you miss them all the time and they ignore it? What if you love them the most in the world and it changes the other day? How is this anyhow sane? rational? Does anything in this fucking world matter? I am an agnostic, I am close to it. I dislike religions for many reasons. I cant even use this argument for living. How can somebody be religious and how can it come from any god if this makes people unhappy and how can one trust in any book or source if it was edited by people who by any religion are imperfect and can't decide about such things? This thing led to wars, everyone knew the best and slaughtered one another. What sort of a religion is this that punish a human for using a "god" created brain of a human?  


Religions dont persuade me. They tell me that I am handsome, that I am more or less smart. I can study, achieve something, have a job, but it's worthless. I could travel on the end of the world for somebody who would pledge and be trustworthy, somebody who would just care.  I havent found anyone, I hate people. I hate their stupidity, primitivity, their lack of argumentation, blind following of the others. I don't want to become like everyone, meaningless. It takes my happiness away but how can I by myself if I let all of my dreams die and bring nothing but depression to me? I just think about ending my life. I don't know if any sort of help would really anyhow help me. I doubt it. I would argue, discuss and those people are merely just humanists getting paid for tinkering in one's mind.   


How could I fall this low to listen to people who always hated me and always punished me, to those whom I always also hated?  
I can argue about anything, from relativity of your choices to moral dillemas. I always wanted to study something difficult, I cant live being aware that everything I ever achieve will be lost, and that nobody in this fucking world would ever approve or miss my existence. Whenever I dare to try getting to know somebody, I am told that I require too much. How can I require little from somebody for whom I would live? I would do anything in this world? Fs, how can I even discuss with people presenting such a stand? And on the other hand im a hypocrite. I would love to have what they have, happy life, fucking girls at the clubs and doing everything they ever desired. How can you ever be jealous of people who do that and yet hate them and how can you love somebody and be afraid that you could want more? What if you are specific and you can't even find anyone? I can be fucking good looking, and nobody will care because of my psyche. My personality that is making me somehow succesful but also self\-hurt and deppresed.Can I change my own brain and my logical stance? I analyse everything, every deed. I see many things people cant see. Am I this dumb to everyone? How can I want to live having nobody to live for? I want to be in a losy relationship and yet to be loved and safe. I have never tried things that they others did, I missed out. I was always studying or doing something else. I always had high standards, lately I just broke, I cant spend a day not trying to hook up or fucking being depressed. I could never find anyone around me, not similar to me. Not devouted, strong willed, smart and pretty.  What should I do if not to die? Should I live and always feel pain and jealousy? Desire things I fucking want and always wanted to try or have but never find people for it? I will get old, ugly, stupid and useless. Like a stupid pidgeon falling off a roof because it forgot that it had a brain. If not this, I can't even discuss with anyone. People can't do it, can't have any will to even try persuading me whenever I or them make mistakes. I might be harsh, but I always wanted honesty and loyalty, just to be fair. How can I be kind living at society of liars or people who's moral stance is as reversible as ice? Maybe im a hypocrite, should hypocrites live? Should dumb people like me fucking live if everyone finds me retarded or wrong? How could one logically justify my life if I can't be happy doing what I am or want to do? It's a failure, an artificial existence kept by little factors providing mere joy. Everything in this world seems like possible to get bored with. How could one even trust themselves. My stance is a fucking hypocrisy, but everything is and nothing can be deemed wrong. It is insane to live and call anyone or anything normal in a world which has no rules and is just a weeb of connctions of specific events. I think that I have a high sex desire and no one really gave me a chance, but I dont want to lower my standards, yet I cant ever find people for anything, I am wasting my entire life. And then, how can I not care about it, it is great, and even if it isnt, then everything else is just nothing. What is enjoyable in this world? Everything can be learned soon or later, and people will hate you for being different. The more far you go into the forest the more they hate your existence. What's the point in being smart if being an idiot would be so plausible? If I was a girl I would suck off random guys and be happy or the opposite. Not that? Right, I could always ignore one's reasoning and be closed for any argumentation, call them morons and probably beat them. No? The life would be great, I would get debts, get killed or get STD and get a social help for somewhere. Stressless life, full of sex, pleasure and what else, not requiring any effort? Why not, like everyone, everything and anytime.Because the internet is worthless, people cant sit home instead of sightseeing fucking amazing farmer fields around or they can never not want to visit clubs with music they hate, that is played too loud, right?  


They can't enjoy books or discussion, tea or just care and warmth. They also if are nerdy or shit can't have any sexual desire or desire to have someone pretty for themselves. Right? If I am so wrong then how can I be allowed to live? Why to live? Everyone will find me useless or wrong. My existence is just wrong.  The only thing keeping me is my family. I wouldn't want to upset them because of myself, but how long can one live a sad deprevided\-of\-happiness life? Slowly ageing and only becoming more frustrated or sad?   


Do you think that any therapy could help me? What's the point? I will either have to make myself an idiot and agree that my entire life is wrong and become like everyone or meaningless, or I will face somebody who can't persuade me and find me any logical reason to live. People always want more, I can't even trust myself, and I demand a lot from everyone, but I can't live anyhow different. It can help develop them and myself, and I don't feel satisfied having social contacts. I always want more or intimate relations and I cant fucking stop or can't enjoy people. I do like some, but that's so fake. I must be an egoist or just a mentally broken person. I can't enjoy things people enjoy. I find them illogical or boring. I don't feel like belonging to anywhere. I can't even get an advice, because I don't have friends. Just few, but they cant help.  


I'm too much of a fucking idealist, romantic or another sick, stupid and retarded person who doesn't belong in here.  
Always want too much, always gets too little or stay depressed in tears, missing somebody who doesn't have time or feelings for them.  Can you really persuade me that anything is worth living for? I might hold on a year, maybe two, or maybe just a week. The last time I loved somebody to the limits and, I wanted to die. I again was told that, proven, that my care and invested time or will is worth nothing and meaningless. That either can't understand or love people or the opposite. Whoever is wrong, it is always tragic to me. If I am so wrong, how can I live? If the others? how can I live with them?   


Do they offer instant\-lobotomy tickets to become a happy vegetable at somewhere? This is every aspect of life so depressing and meaningless?
