This world is so unfair.I don't even know. I'm just so sick of thinking all the time. I'm so paranoid about everything. To make matters worse my boyfriend e-cheated on me and now I'm paranoid about everything he's doing constantly. I'm paranoid that I'll never actually get anywhere in life. I'm paranoid that I'll never be not paranoid. I'm just so sick of every day being a challenge. Like what's the point in sticking around when it's so hard for me to live a life that doesn't revolve around negativity. Why not just leave it all behind and be free? This world rarely ever gives me anything I want. I don't want to end it but the thought crosses my mind so much. I could care less about the people I leave behind because they've never done anything for me.
