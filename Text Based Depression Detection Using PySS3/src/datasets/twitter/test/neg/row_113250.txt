Quite possibly lost my job possibly one of the worst things to happen me since I am severely depressed and I am having extreme suicidal urgesI am broke because I haven't had work in 2 weeks already now its going to be the 3rd week where the boss texted me the same thing " we don't have anything for you this week I will let you know if we have anything the next" work slows down in the winter season... these past 2 weeks all I have been doing is laying in bed staring at the ceiling my money slowly depleting from bills and food, now my source of income is possibly gone, going to work was my only distraction I had, it is too cold outside to at least go for a walk or go hiking, I wish I could play video games, draw, paint like I used to, but I am so depressed I lose interest so fast, I try eating, but I just feel so damn depressed I puke it up.. I miss my ex so damn much she was the only person I thought about when things got rough she kept me going, I wish I had any friends or at least someone to talk to... I don't even want to sleep because I know it is going to be the same tomorrow total depression... I just want to down a bottle and just go for it already.
