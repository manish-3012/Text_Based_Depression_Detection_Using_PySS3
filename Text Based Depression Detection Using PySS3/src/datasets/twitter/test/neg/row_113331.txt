sometimesI get this tingly sensation right on my wrists. I donâ€™t know what it is but everytime I feel suicidal (basically everyday) my wrists always start throbbing. Iâ€™m sure this is all in my head but maybe itâ€™s a sign? Iâ€™ve tried cutting myself before but it ended up looking more like scratches. I want to see blood the next time I try to cut myself, maybe I should do it? I still donâ€™t know what to use though...
