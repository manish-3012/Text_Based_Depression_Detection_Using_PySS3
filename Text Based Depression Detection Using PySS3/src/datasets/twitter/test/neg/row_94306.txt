Tired of life :'(I'm so fucking sick of this shit, i cant remember the last time i was actually happy its all just nothingness until i break down into tears every few weeks.

The girl i like is completely ignoring me yet i cant move on, it's not like any others will ever give me a chance &amp; im stuck in this stupid wheelchair for my life and that's only gonna get worse.

I cant see why i should keep going.
