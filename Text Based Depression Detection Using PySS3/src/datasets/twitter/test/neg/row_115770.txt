stuckI'm stuck

There was a point in my life where I really wanted to die. 

Now, I can't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I live a relatively privileged life. My family is kind, I have good friends, I go to a privileged school. I get to do and see things that many don't see in a lifetime. The world around me is beautiful. But I don't feel worthy of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I started feeling like I wanted to die. No idea why. I'm not clinically depressed. I have no mental illnesses that I know of. I just hated my soul. Not myself. I hated the being I had created. I was in pain. I am a very appreciative person. And that has become my downfall. I appreciate the world around me so much that I have diminished myself as a human being. I love everything. And I hate it.

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to die.

&amp;#x200B;

This feeling continued for a long time. But now I have reached a point where I realized that I am not worthy of feeling sad. That I am not allowed to feel the satisfaction of feeling suicidal. Because I am privileged and I am supposed to be happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel sad, then I feel angry, then I feel depressed, then I feel suicidal, then I feel mad at myself for being suicidal, and then I want to die all over again.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that if I were to kill myself, I would cause so much pain to all the people around me. They would think I was selfish to do that. Do i really exist just to please other people? Am I just sticking around so that other people don't have to suffer?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to die.

&amp;#x200B;

Because then other people will get hurt.

&amp;#x200B;

I go up to my room and cry my eyes out for fun. Then I sit, forcing myself to smile in the dark. Because I'm not supposed to be sad. I'm too privileged to feel sad. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I was never born. Then I could just not exist and nobody would feel the pain of me leaving. Because I was never there in the first place. But now I'm stuck here. I only matter when I want to leave. Otherwise, I'm meaningless. But perhaps I shouldn't pity myself. After all, that would be awfully selfish of me.

please help me. i just want to go home
