I know this a petty reason for wanting to die, but school is all I have...Currently I am a Junior in High school, however, this is no ordinary high school. My school is basically the culmination of the brightest minds across my state. Out of a class of about 120 kids last year, 44 achieved national merit on the PSAT. I do go to this school for a reason, I am very smart and I acknowledge that. however, these kids around me are just on a whole other level and I can't keep up. My grades have dropped from a 4.0 to a 3.88 and thats not counting this semester which is on par to be my worst one yet. I was doing ok handling school until about 2 hours ago I found out that I missed an A in biology by .1% due to me writing on my quiz "cytoplasm in the mitochondria" rather than simply "cytoplasm". I was crying and muffling my screams because I just hate myself for not being good enough. I completely understand that this is going to be downvoted and maybe rightfully so, its not nearly as bad as some of the people on here, but school is all I have in life so if I begin to fail in school, then I consider myself to be failing in life. And failures like me should kill themselves because they are worthless.
