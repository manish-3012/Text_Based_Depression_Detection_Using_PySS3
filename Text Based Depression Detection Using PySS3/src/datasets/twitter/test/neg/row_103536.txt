Waiting for an opportunityI'm gonna just wait until I have enough time alone to hang myself. That, or just hang myself from a bridge at my university, try and traumatize as many people as possible. I've been to the hospital once for two suicide attempts within a week and they didn't help at all. I have no friends and no family that I trust and I don't want to go back to the hospital because last time it lowered the grades in my classes. Life's not worth living without companionship and I am utterly alone with no one to talk to and nothing to talk about. 

Sorry if my writing is a little messed up, my thoughts are all jumbled up right now.

But for now I just have to wait. Wait for the right time to kill myself. No more excuses and no more failures.
