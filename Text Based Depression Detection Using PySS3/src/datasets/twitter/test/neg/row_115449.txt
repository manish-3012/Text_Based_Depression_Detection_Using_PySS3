Canâ€™t stop my mindI think every night I wish I wouldnâ€™t wake up. I thought the divorce would help the feelings. I thought therapy would help. I thought pills would help. But everyday is sad and all consuming. I canâ€™t think about anything other than my situation or killing myself often at the same time. Iâ€™m so tired of the next day coming. Finding myself praying to find the courage to do it vs the courage to not do it. Today isnâ€™t the day for me but it feels inevitable.
