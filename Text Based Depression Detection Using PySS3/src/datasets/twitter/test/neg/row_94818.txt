jumping off a bridge.iâ€™m taking one last bike ride up my favorite bridge and i plan on jumping off of it. iâ€™ve made a playlist of all the songs that have gotten me through and still have all the hand written letters from months ago when i was feeling this way, but nothing has changed.

iâ€™m sick of seeing this world in chaos, but iâ€™m beginning to feel nothing from it. i no longer feel anything from the worldâ€™s beauty, not in the way that i used to. that is more heartbreaking than anything. iâ€™m tired of feeling like a fuck up. iâ€™m tired of feeling less than. iâ€™m tired of striving for perfection. iâ€™m tired of feeling stupid. iâ€™m tired of being ugly. iâ€™m tired of failing in all aspects of my life. iâ€™m too tired do anything about it because it doesnâ€™t matter. iâ€™m tired of reaching out. iâ€™m tired. 

so iâ€™m jumping off a bridge next week. the date is sentimental, so it kind of works well and i wonâ€™t leave much of a mess. in fact, i will most likely sink from all of this weight that iâ€™ve been carrying. thanks for reading. i just needed to get it off my chest and i feel better about it now. i hope everyone here finds the peace that they deserve.
