I don't want to do anythingI'm in my late 20's and feel as if I have done everything I have wanted to do, nothing else interests me. Meeting up with friends, exercising, watching films, going to work takes a lot of effort and I don't really enjoy it, it's just a distraction.

My reality, living as I am now, I feel annoyed that I have to keep myself mentally and physically well to keep myself from getting/feeling worse. I browse this and the 2meirl4meirl subreddit constantly and I know this only adds fuel to the fire but at the same time it gives me relief.

I have tried a range of things to combat this mindset - Eating healthily, Exercising, Meditating, Reading, Therapy, Shrooms; they are not providing the long-term affects I am hoping for.

While I would have no problem with dying I don't think I am capable of taking my own life but I am worried that's what it will eventually develop into.

I looked back on my Facebook from almost 5-10 years ago and I'm envious of the nature I had before - young, wild and free; and this goes back to "I feel I have done everything I wanted".

I'm not placing blame on humanity or anything like that, I think it's amazing what Humans have accomplished giving us the lifestyle we have now and I know that makes me an ungrateful cunt. 

I genuinely don't know what to do from this point, I have been feeling like this for the past 3 years - going through the motions hoping something in my brain will give me an amazing revelation but I doubt that will happen.

Just wanted to say me piece, thanks for listening.
