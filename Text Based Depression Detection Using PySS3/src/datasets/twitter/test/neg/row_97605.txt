I want to dieI don't want to write this on the internet but I have no one else. I hate living. I'm not angst about life. I am just depressed all the time and wish to end the pain. I feel lost all the time. Most of my closest friends relationships have been distanced one way or another. I tried coping by being a drug addict. Now I'm sober and still feel the same way. I think the only thing keeping me from doing it is the thought of suicide as a weak move. A pussy decision. But I'm starting to disregard that concept. Help
