I don't know what to do anymore.I donâ€™t really know what to do anymore. Every person I become close with either leaves or hurts me in the end. I am so tired of the abandonment that I go through every time I try to make a new friend or have a relationship with someone. Iâ€™ve become so depressed by the fact that I will never have a true love or friend. Whenever I try to talk to someone I become a burden and they leave me just like everyone else did. The one person that was getting me through it all is now no longer talking to me and wonâ€™t even recognize that I exist. Now, on top of it all I am now finding out that I have been doing worse and worse at my job, which is causing me to become more and more depressed. After a year and a half I find that I have been on a downward slope and now I am getting almost daily talks with my boss. I just canâ€™t deal with it all anymore. The only place I find some sort of solace is when Iâ€™m sleeping but now Iâ€™ve started to have nightmares. I canâ€™t escape it. I am afraid to talk to a shrink because I am afraid of my parents finding out because my little brother is starting to become more and more depressed himself, and I donâ€™t want them to feel worse because of me. I just canâ€™t take it anymore. I want to just end it all but I donâ€™t know how. I just wish it would all go away.
