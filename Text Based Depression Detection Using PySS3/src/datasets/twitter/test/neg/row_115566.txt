Refusing Medical TreatmentI've noticed that in some places, patients have the right to refuse medical treatment.  It also seems that in some cases, this can extend to refusing treatment for a future condition.

Hypothetically, if one were to make a failed suicide attempt and beforehand document that they did not wish to be resuscitated or given any other treatments, would they granted the ability to pass away peacefully?  Would any consideration be given to their written wishes, or can a patient only refuse treatment at the time of the incident if they're deemed to possess the 'mental capacity'?

What is defined as 'mental capacity'? I'd imagine for someone suicidal they would be branded as lacking the necessary rational decision making skills and so wouldn't be granted the right to die after a failed attempt.  How is 'mental capacity' proven?

I'd imagine it all hinges on the person's mental capacity, as otherwise you would be able to refuse psychiatric treatment.

I'm in NSW, Australia if that helps -- but happy for people to provide general information, advice and opinions.

I'd post this on one of the relevant law subreddits, but figured people probably wouldn't be too willing to divulge and instead go into saviour mode.

Thanks.
