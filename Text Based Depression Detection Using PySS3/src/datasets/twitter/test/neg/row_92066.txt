Itâ€™s just part of livingIâ€™m realizing thatâ€™s my problem. Iâ€™m not even suicidal anymore. I donâ€™t want to do. But I envision it daily. I imagine myself throwing myself over a bridge. I see myself driving into a tree off the freeway. I see it happen as if itâ€™s visions. I get bored and my first thoughts are to cut myself. To slit my wrists, slit my shoulder, my thigh, my hands. I have a girlfriend who makes me realize without even trying that I am codependent. All these things point to me being fucked up. It kills me. I am running the most fucked up mindset. I wanna hurt myself. I want my death to mean something. I seek validation. I seek approval. I never get it. One day maybe I will relapse. I've already been secretly slitting myself. Maybe one day I won't even think. I'll just go. I want to matter. They all say that. I believe it.
