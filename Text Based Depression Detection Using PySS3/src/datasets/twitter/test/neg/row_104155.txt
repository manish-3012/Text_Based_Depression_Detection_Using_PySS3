I think at this point I'm surviving off of sheer curiosity. But It feels like I'm nearing the end.I know the world is in for a shitstorm of events over the next couple decades.. with the earth on its last legs and technology advancing like crazy, now Elon musk saying he thinks humans will integrate with AI to make our brains crazy super super computers. I'd like to see how things turn out.
But with that being said on a personal level I feel drained of all life and hope. I took a 'leave of absence' from college after 1.5 (awful) semesters and would have to go back next semester, but that's not even bothering me right now... It feels like I don't care about anything but at the same time care about everything. People are sick and evil all over the world including most of the people who have power. College is a big scam to trap people in debt and I want to learn but I just can never get any motivation, because of that I'm so out of touch with any desire of what I want to do.
My grandpa had a stroke about a month ago and hes probably dying and I couldn't even muster up the energy to visit him very much. I know he takes it personally and hes going to die thinking I dont care about him.
People always thought I was a really smart kid and would amount to something but I just dont care enough to do anything.
Even if I did I still get a panic attack every time I have to talk in front of a class or a group of people.
I used to think I could do something worthwhile but now I just feel like I'm wasting my life.
My parents dont really care, theyd rather just not think about it. 
There was one person who I thought cared and made life worth living but she broke up with me days before our 2 year anniversary, about a month ago. She was the only thing I have ever truly cared about.
I moved to a new city and have a job starting soon, that was just to do something rather than nothing.
Weed has helped in terms of being a distraction sometimes and actually makes me feel good enough to get some things done, but I dont want a distraction I wish I could just be healthy.. not to mention I'm on probation and will have to get drug tested.
I've been like this since I was a kid. Others would make fun of me for not having emotions, people call me lazy but I just dont have the energy. I'm so tired of living for absolutely nothing. I barely even cry anymore,  I'm just... nothing.
I can't even get the energy to eat a lot of the time, I've had like .5-1 meal a day the past week or so.
I'm pretty self aware and real about stuff, selective ignorance doesn't work as thoughts are always rushing around in my head and I can't really control that. I want to have fun and be friendly and do shit but I feel like so much human interaction is just fake.. maybe why our concept of fun is getting hammered to the point where we can't think.
I'm so tired I really just dont want to go on.
