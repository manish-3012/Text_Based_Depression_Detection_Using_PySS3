I just...I feel like I've lost my mind....I feel like a crazy person...I feel like everyone around me thinks I'm crazy...I feel like he thinks I'm crazy...
And it's just... really difficult to go on that way.
Maybe,I am. Maybe I should spare everyone from having to deal with me....
I cry all the time. Every morning I feel in a panic.
Maybe meds would help...maybe not...
