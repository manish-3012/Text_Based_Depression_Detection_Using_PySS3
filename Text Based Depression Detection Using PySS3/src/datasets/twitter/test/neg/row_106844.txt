My mother's a predictable, basic left-wing person who unknowingly doesn't think in her own personal, defying thought process and I seem like a complete contrast to her. My notably abusive father (who was also basic by being an abusive father) actually seemed like a better character than she is.Holy fucking shit, I live with the most normal lineage ever. I'm trying to be completely unconventional and unpredictable compared to them, and the only parent remaining is obligating me to live against those contrasting values because "learning is good" apparently. Yes, that is something my only parent actually has said. It doesn't support anything based on what ALL school employees British and American themselves have actually been doing to student bodies. Also she acts like she has a learning disability that's been nailed into her brain more than it has me. As in, she actually acts less logically comprehensible. Somehow she consents with my interests, but as soon as I try to affirm the "unconventional learning" side to those interests, she suddenly actively acts completely against them and being interested in only her own. How did I live with this insufferably positive character for 15 whole years and never try and stand up against her indirect carefree abuse? **Fucking kill me already, universe. DO...SOMETHING! I WANT SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE PLAGUE TO BE INCURRED IN ME RIGHT NOW SO I DON'T HAVE TO USE A WEAPON TO END THIS PASSIVE MADNESS! AAAARRRGGGHHH!!!** This left-wing torture is so intolerable. She's not the enlightened type of character at all. She's still acting completely compliant with everything surrounding her. Does she even know what she's doing and *why* she's doing it?? 

***I CAN'T TOLERATE THIS STUPIDLY PASSIVE SHIT, GOD DAMN IT! IT'S SO HARD TO LIVE KNOWING UNBELIEVABLE NORMAL, NAIVE, OVERPOTECTIVE PEOPLE LIKE WERE MENTORING ME BEFORE I TRIED TO DEFY THEM, ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THESE BASIC PEOPLE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTINUING TO MENTOR OTHER FAMILIES! FUUUUCK! FUCKING KILL ME ALREADY!!***
