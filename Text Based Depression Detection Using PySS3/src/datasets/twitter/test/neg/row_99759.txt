A PSA to those of you still in high schoolI'm going to tell you something I wished people had told me earlier.

High school is not real life.  Issues about school (and people in it) do not last forever.  They *seem* important to you right now, and they *seem* like a huge weight, and they *seem* like there's no escape, but that's just because high school is your life right now.

There are things I cried about in high school that I can't even remotely remember.  There are problems I had that made me depressed for weeks that I can't remember.  Of course there are going to be things that you do remember, especially things like broken hearts, but most of it will become a faded memory.

It's hard to see the forest through the trees.  It's fine if you read this and think I don't understand, or that I'm wrong, or disagree.  But as someone who's been there, I just want you to know that high school ends.  When you enter the real world, you'll probably be surprised.  People (well, most) don't segregate themselves to cliques, or by age, or any other nonsensical fashion.  You'll get a job and be friends with people you'd never have even looked at in high school.

Are there a lot of assholes?  Sure.  Are you still going to have problems?  Of course, life is full of them.  But the issues that revolve around high school constructs you face now are **temporary**.

Just try to keep that in the back of your head, it may help make some days easier.
