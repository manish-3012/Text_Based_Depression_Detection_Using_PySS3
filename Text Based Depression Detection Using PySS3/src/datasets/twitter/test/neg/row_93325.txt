I threw my life away for an abusive, mentally ill man and now I have nothing. I see no reason to continue.Two years ago I was making $55,000 a year, rented my own lovely apartment and my life was great. Except I was depressed and lonely and bored. I decided to treat myself with an extravagant three week holiday in Hawaii. There I met a man. We spent the whole weekend together and it was pretty fantastic. Though quite a few red flags went off about him, I chose to ignore them thinking I was only having a vacation fling. 


Fast forward two years:
I thought I met someone who loved me, but I met a disturbed, mentally ill alcoholic who was controlling and emotionally abusive. I was addicted to and codependant on him and I quit my excellent, secure, well paying job in a moment of dilusion thinking I was going to move to Hawaii and get married. I finally broke up with him in February because I couldn't take it anymore. Now I am unemployed, soon to be homeless as of June 30th because I won't be able to pay rent anymore, some of my best friends no longer want to be friends with me and I am completely hopeless. My life is not worth living. I think of suicide often. I'm 32 years old, single, I have no skills and no education. I'm currently going to counselling with the last of my money and it's not helping. Every job I've ever done I've hated every single minute of (even the "good" one). I don't want to work. I don't want to do anything. I just want to lie in a hole and wait to die.
