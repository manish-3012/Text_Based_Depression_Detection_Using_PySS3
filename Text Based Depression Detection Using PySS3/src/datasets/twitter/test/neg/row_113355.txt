i dont know what to doi just need to get a lot off my chest. i dont know whether im going to do it sooner rather than later. i really dont know what im doing.
on the 13th of december last year i was forced to go completely sober. before this i was an alcoholic. i guess i technically still am. im living with a friend and their mother and every day i seem to find a new way to piss the both of them off. i havent spoken to anyone besides them and my boyfriend since i went sober. i suffer from stpd and as a result i isolate myself pretty often to cope, but this is the longest ive had to go without interacting and i cant seem to shake it off. i had to spend my first christmas, new year, and birthday without family completely sober. it was my 18th. i try to sleep through the days because whenever im awake i get so bored and irrationally angry and i do incredibly stupid things on impulse. the only reason i havent taken the pills i keep saving is because my boyfriend said if i did it then he would too. im so exhausted. i keep reliving everything bad thats ever happened to me every second of the day. i cant eat without feeling sick. no matter how much or how little i sleep im still too tired to think. the days keep melting into one another and it feels like i dont even exist. it hasnt for a while now. i want to do it but i dont want anyone to be sad. what do i do. its been like this for months and it keeps getting worse no matter whether i drink or dont drink or what medications i take.
