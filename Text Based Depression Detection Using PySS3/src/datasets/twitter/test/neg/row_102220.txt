It's Time to Go, My Last Hope Is Goneso, I know I should be using a throwaway, but I don't really care anymore.  I've been struggling with chronic pain and severe depression for twenty years.  I recently tried to seek help from the medical profession and all they found was cancer.  No help for the pain, just a new source of fresh pain.  My partner of 2.5 years recently left for grad school and I support his decision fully, but within a day of leaving he hooked up with another man and makes no apologies for it.  I understand that being my partner was hard and that he needs to move on, but within days in another man's bed?  All I needed was a little push and he shoved me.  I've got to pull some things together and re-home my dogs, but I'm so lost and empty, I don't know where to turn.  I'm afraid my friends will try to stop me, so I can't talk to them.  Is there any way to do this without alerting authorities?  I'm too far gone to be talked out of it.  I'm not looking for that kind of help, I'm not looking for someone to assist, I'm just looking for someone to help me tie up the loose ends.  I don't have much energy left.
