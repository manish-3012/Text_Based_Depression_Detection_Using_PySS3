The final day is coming closeI put off CTB until I could get my affairs in order and I've just about done that now. Some goodbyes have been said, others will need to wait until right before. 

I'm fully broken at this point and yet completely  at peace with this decision. I was gonna go to the lake so I could be with my two kids forever who were miscarriages..but now I'm thinking in case someone thinks of trying to stop me I'm going to leave my truck and take the bus somewhere  more private where I wont be found 

I'm not looking  for help or anyone to "talk me out of it " but if anyone would like to make sure I'm not alone when I go, I would greatly appreciate  some company
