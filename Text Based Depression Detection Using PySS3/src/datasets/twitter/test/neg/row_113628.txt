I dont think i can do this anymoreFor the past month or so i have been depressed, I used to beable to drag myself out of it and find a purpose but the past few times have been horrible and a real struggle involving medication and therpy.

Ive got to the point again where everything leads to going on a drive to a quiet rarely visited spot and just ending it, its become so bad to the point its taking over my entire life, i cant focus on work which used to be the only time everything else would switch off.
My friends are essentially non existent, only contact me or speak to me when they need something, the usual advice for me telling them im really really down and im struggling is 'oh you need to find a boyfriend' and i just cant cope with it anymore...  I honestly just want to stop everything and not exist but i know i shouldnt and i know i need to get help but none of the help is helping and i cant shake this huge urge to just go.
