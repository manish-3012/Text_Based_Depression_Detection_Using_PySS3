DivorceMy wife told me, via text, this morning that weâ€™re separating. As a chronic pain sufferer, I had reached a point where making her happy was the only thing that gave my life any meaning.  Iâ€™m a terrible father who never developed the kind of relationship with my kids that I should have. Iâ€™m just waiting for each day to end. The only reason I donâ€™t kill myself is the trauma it would cause my kids.  How do you get through the day when nothing makes you happy anymore. All the things that used to give me joy came from physical things I canâ€™t do anymore and my wife who doesnâ€™t love me anymore.
