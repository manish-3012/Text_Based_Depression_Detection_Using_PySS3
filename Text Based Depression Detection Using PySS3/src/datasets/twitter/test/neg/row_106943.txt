Very few reasons to liveHey yâ€™all. Iâ€™m not gonna make this some sappy post about how much in my life has gone wrong or whatnot. Iâ€™m 18, and I literally wake up everyday with the thought of killing myself on my mind. I canâ€™t shake it. My life hasnâ€™t been great, and I donâ€™t really have any meaningful friends, I feel like theyâ€™re just fake. Donâ€™t hit me up for plans, hang out all the time without me or even asking if Iâ€™m free, and I just donâ€™t feel like I can trust them. I donâ€™t see how you can call someone your friend yet not even check up on them, text me once in a while at least yknow? Anyways, school isnâ€™t going great either, I shitted on this semester completely, which only added to my depression. I tried seeing a therapist but idk, I felt like it didnâ€™t help me at all. Last night I went out with a girl I have a crush on, we went under a bridge by the water and just talked for hours, it was dope. Even then, she would text another guy Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯. Guess I canâ€™t find love either. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ll do if I let myself be like this. I felt extremely bad two days ago and went to go see my best friend at his grave, I just wanted to vent and talk to him I guess. Well I drove far as fuck to his cemetery and there were people next to his grave sitting in chairs and under an umbrella and I didnâ€™t want to intrude. I canâ€™t even talk to my friend who literally never fucking moves from his grave. Fuck. Idk what the point of this post was, I guess I just hope you guys have better support than I have. Thanks for letting me post this, and if you read this far I just want to say that I hope you get better, I doubt I will.
