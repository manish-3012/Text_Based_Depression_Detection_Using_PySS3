Free fallingFor the last 9 years I haven't seem to be happy. I go through the motion of my everyday life, but nothing seems to bring me joy. When I was a kid, I remember never feeling sad. I had abusive parents, we grow up with next to nothing, and I was alway picked on because I had glasses and buck teeth. Yet, I was always happy. I would leave school, run home, grab my bike, and just ride all around town fortunate enough that my friends nearby. So we would go house to house getting everyone, growing our biker crew and meet head to the school to just be kids. Teenage years felt like it had a lot of happy moments. It wasn't until I graduated and became an adult that I suddenly felt sadness and now just emptiness. Still live broke, now unemployed, and trying hard to get through my bachelor program at school. My friends always tell me how they wish they had my brain since they are struggling through school, I always wish I could tell them I'd gladly trade for some of their happiness. I have no more family so that effects my lonliness, but overall I have a solid support group, I just can't feel what I once did. It was so long ago I almost wonder what happiness felt like or if I ever did feel it. I'm an EMT, I volunteer at my school as a tutor and program advisor for the EMS program, and coach little league. I try really hard to be a productive member of society and help people to the best of my abilities, but I always want to be alone. Locked in my room away from the outside world and wait for my demise. I don't want to necessarily die, I just don't want to exist anymore. I wish I could truly explain to someone, anyone what it feels like to have and sense of emptiness.
