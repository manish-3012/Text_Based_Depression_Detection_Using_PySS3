I just don't have anyone to talk to and I feel horribleI can barely write. Sorry.

I feel pathetic everytime I try to seek help because I alaways get nervous enough to make it sound less worrying than it should. People get uncomfortable and leave, or they get afraid or worried, which leads to them trying to help me while I feel like it's useless to keep trying to explain what's happening.

It destroys me slowly. Trying to say how sometimes the world loses its colours and I feel like it's useless to do anything. Like I'm getting closer to death. My legs struggle to keep me upright and I start to lose my bearings.

All while I hold a fake smile to tell people that I'm fine, so they don't... Well... Leave... Or treat me like the weird, sad, pitiful kid, which happens a lot.

All of this makes me feel like it's even more worthless to try and continue to fight back these feelings anyway...

My mom got scared... My dad doesn't care... My friends don't know what to do, and I don't want them to treat me overly nicely, or worry them to something that maybe resonates inside of them...

So

Maybe I'm sinking alone

But what difference would it make if I did...

Sure, people would be horribly sad
I would too

But it feels like the void that's pulling me is stronger than anything I can come up with... My friends are not to blame for not knowing what to do... But I just end up feeling alone.

My therapists feel like they also don't know what to do

So here I am

(Sorry, I dont want to sound preposterous or arrogant, I can barely filter how my words come out)
