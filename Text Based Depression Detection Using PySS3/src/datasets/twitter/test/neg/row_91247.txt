Life wants too much from meI just want to rest. I can't handle the burden of what this world wants from me. It's never enough.  My pure existence is never enough. I just want to sleep forever.  Fly away to a different place. Whenever i go to bed I hope that my dreams keep me there for as long as possible so I don't face my realities anymore.
