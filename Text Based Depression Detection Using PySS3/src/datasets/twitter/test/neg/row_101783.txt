Now what?Had my second session yesterday. Iâ€™m still the person who has to cope with so much collective trauma and self loathing and a history of self harm and suicide attempts and anxiety so bad it makes you scream. Now what? Do I just stop being broken? Do I ever have a life Iâ€™ll be proud of? Will I want and desire things again? Will I do anything other than sink inside the tar pit that is myself that removes my motivation and makes weeks go by with no progress?

Now what?
