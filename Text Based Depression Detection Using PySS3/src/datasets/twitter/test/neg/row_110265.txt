Too tired to care.I'm done.

He's right, without having had kids, no one would have ever cared about me. Under the mask, I am miserable and angry and so fucking tired. I'm in physical pain literally every day, and I've had a headache 4 days in a row.

Because I'm autistic, I can't fucking make a GD phone call, I'm scared of everything, and I have no friends.

Nothing will be better tomorrow, in fact, I'm sure it will be markedly worse.

E everyone would be better, happier; and my kids certainly deserve better than me. I emailed their dad to come get them, in Oregon while we're in the Midwest, so I hope he fucking listens, since he specifically told me if I try again he will take them so their step dad doesn't win. He's an alcoholic (step dad) so I'm certain once we're all out of his house and hid love goes back to normal, he'll be better off, too. After all, being told daily to not get drunk is a really big bummer.

I'm just waiting till I see the light go off downstairs, so I can grab the pills and wine and razors. I don't want anyone to save me, so I need to be very thorough.

What a fitting end to a disgusting trash bag life.

Remember to be good to one another, and listen to Greta, she seems to be the only one who cares about the planet, anymore.
