Oh to have a time machineNot to prevent myself from making all the stupid mistakes I have, but to just stop my parents from having one last kid. They really couldnâ€™t have stopped at 3? They had to make me, an ugly worthless unlovable piece of shit with no future? Itâ€™s not fair that I have to keep existing. I just want to be loved by anyone.
