I messed up my life, I donâ€™t see another way out but I donâ€™t want to kill myselfI did something bad at work thatâ€™ll cost me my career if I confess or get found out. Thereâ€™s no guarantee Iâ€™ll be found out, but if I am then I wonâ€™t be able to do what I want. I donâ€™t want to settle. I donâ€™t want to restructure my future.

But the guilt and fear are unbearable. I want out, but thereâ€™s literally no way out short of a miracle. Most of the time, I get caught up in fantasies where I get an email saying my workplace burned down, or my boss randomly decided to retire, or that the workplace has to lay people off and Iâ€™m one of those people, or that I get diagnosed with a disease thatâ€™ll give me 1 month to live.

At the same time, Iâ€™m too scared to kill myself. I have family and friends who love me, my cats depend on me, Iâ€™m actually religious and suicide is a sin. Iâ€™m not scared of hellâ€”Iâ€™m going there anywayâ€”but Iâ€™m worried about the community backlash. Plus, I donâ€™t know how to do it. My methods might fail, or I might spend my last minutes in pure agony.

I have no plan, but I donâ€™t see any other way.
