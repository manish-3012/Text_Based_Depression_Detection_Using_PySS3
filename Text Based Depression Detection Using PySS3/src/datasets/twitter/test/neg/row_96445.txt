I hate myselfIdk I guess I donâ€™t have a valid reason - I donâ€™t have depression or bipolar disorder, never been checked. Everyone already thinks I am a failure and I do too. I donâ€™t have the motivation to get up and do anything. Im lazy. Iâ€™m failing everything. I canâ€™t study, I want to and I know I can but I feel like shit and know Iâ€™ll never amount to anything no matter how much I try. Canâ€™t deal with school or people. And I blame myself for the POS I am.  Feel like there might be other people out there that feel the same.
