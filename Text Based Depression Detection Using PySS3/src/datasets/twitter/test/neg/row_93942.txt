Ending it in FebruaryI don't know what I want to achieve by posting this, maybe it'll help just to get it out idk. 
I'm going to end it next February. (After my little brothers birthday, I don't want to ruin Christmas or his birthday for my family) 
I don't WANT to die but I feel like it's what I HAVE to do. Like there's no other option for me. I've felt depressed and been just an anxious wreck for the past 3/4 years (I've never been diagnosed by a dr bc I'm scared, so I couldn't tell u wtf is wrong with me) 
Everything scares me, even before COVID. I'm supposed to be in college by now but I'm too scared and overwhelmed to do ANYTHING. I was almost kicked out bc it's causing my mum problems. Even if I wasn't scared, I don't know what I want to do, I have nothing to bring to any table. I don't even know what I enjoy doing anymore. 
I have no friends, at all. I was barely in school, pretty much dropping out at 14/15 and coming back to go to some one on one 'classes' so I could get some shit qualifications. Couldn't even tell you what qualifications I have, I don't understand any of it and I'm too scared and overwhelmed by it all. 
I had planned to kill myself on my 16th birthday but my mum had an operation and I didn't want to leave her in her state. 
My mum knows I've been struggling (she doesn't know anywhere near the whole extent, she didn't even know there was anything going on until I had a melt down and mentioned how I was already struggling and I didn't need her adding shit on top of it) but she doesn't want to pressure or force me to talk about anything, she just tries to subtly give me small jobs and things to stop me from just hiding in my bed. 
I don't know if I want to tell her my plans or not. I know she'd try to stop me but I feel she deserves to know. I love her and I know this will hurt her but I cant live like this.
