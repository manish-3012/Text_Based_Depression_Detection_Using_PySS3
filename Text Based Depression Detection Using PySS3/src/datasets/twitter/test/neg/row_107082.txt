What good is God?I follow his ways, I do as I'm told. I am fucking brainwashed from the "Christian" teachings I had as a child so I can't seem to drop the religion. But no matter what I do for God, no matter what I do for the world I am left a broken human being and no good comes to me. It has been years of suffering. Most would not have lasted this long. The only reason I'm still here is because I fear pain and the thought of the afterlife. Why can't one, ONE good thing happen to me? I just need ONE GOOD THING to restore my faith and give me hope that the world and my life aren't pointless.
