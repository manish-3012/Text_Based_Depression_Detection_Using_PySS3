I'm a liar, utterly depressed, and i'm really just lost right now
26, Male, Canada.

I'm the product of rape.

to make a very long story short, despite the criminal getting away with it , i didnt.

All my life my mother has blamed me and essentially instilled a mentality of "you must deserve the life you stole from me".
she will never admit this.

This in turn led to psychological and physical abuse, in an already garbage household. So thanks to the trauma, my brain isnt fully developed and is utterly broken.
To cope with the toxic environment i became a compulsive liar and while i am better, it is not cured.

But of course, like a good salesman, which is one of the only compliments i can give myself, theres more.

i left after 19 years, 1 abusive relationship , losing quite literally all my friends because of my mother and being seeing as a cry baby, nerd, know it all, who dosent clean in high school.

Its not that my mind dosent know the information. i just cant do it.

November 2018, my new girlfriend sent me to the hospital.
Literally, the first person to care enough to do that. 

I was told that essentially there was hope to cope, but not to heal.
i was prescribed 2 pills for life. Luckily the anti depressants help, the anti anxiety dont. The doctor and nurse told me it was a miracle i made it this far. i was told that i should not be working, that im not stable enough, but not unsafe.

i went back to work 2 weeks later.

im antisocial, always seemingly angry, i feel like im about to cry quite literally 24/7....but it rarely happens.
Even when it would be appropriate to cry.

Honestly i dont want help from you guys, i just need to share.
Nowadays as time moves along i realise that yes, i am broken. 

It's difficult to commit the effort of walking 3 meters to my fridge to grab a coke, which i am fully addicted to. 
It's my guilty pleasure
dont worry im talking cola.

I've so much to say,but i know everyone has problems i think ill keep it at this for now.

I've read the rules, i hope this dosent break them and that i understood them properly, thank you.
