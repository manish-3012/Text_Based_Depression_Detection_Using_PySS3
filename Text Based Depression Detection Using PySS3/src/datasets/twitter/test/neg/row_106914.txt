No one can help meI can't and don't want to help myself. I try to not fake being fine. Everyone in my life knows I'm depressed. I ask for help, I talk to people about it but nothing helps. Everything my therapist says makes me feel guilty of my depression. I feel like I am doing this to myself. I could just get up and smile but I don't. I forget how to do it sometimes. 

Yesterday I got confirmation that my low selfesteem is annoying and holds me back from doing anything right. I have 500 filters in my mind and I always hold back my voice in my throat incase I say something wrong. Every action that I begin is stupid. If someone else does it, it's fine. I feel like a horrible person for not being able to hold myself together.

I dream of suicide every day. I won't do it I think but I always think how much i want to cause pain for others. I am a horrible person. I just want love. I want to be noticed. I'm always down so no one cares anymore. When I ask for help, it's always the same. It's my fault. It's all my fault. I'm not able to do anything anymore. I'm disappointed in myself. Everyone else are too.

Yesterday I did such a big thing. I taught my choreography, i felt so proud. I was so happy that I did it. When I started to feel like otherwise, I TRIED to make it go away. I tried to tell myself it's fine, it was my first time doing this. I'm not used being in the center of attention. Making other people do things is not a comfortable thing to do for me. But I did it so well in my opinion. I'm still proud but no one else was.

I hate this. I don't know what to do. I'm gonna have a test now and I will fail it. I have so many things that are not done and I just hope I won't fail any classes. I'm so disappointed in myself. This is all my fault.
This is stupid.
