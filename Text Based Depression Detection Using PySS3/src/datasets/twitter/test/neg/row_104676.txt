How do you control your thoughts?Idk if this is the right community for this kind of question but I need help with something. Im not going to post the long story to save people's time so that they can get to others who need help (although I can if anyone's interested) but I really need help controlling my thoughts. Basically, my roomate and his brother sent their friends after me as stalkers for a few weeks and didnt tell me it was them. This fucked me up for obvious reasons but also because my roomate made himself into everything I had at the university I go to. I didnt have many friends and he basically forced all his friends and activities upon me while using me for all of it (as he was an Alpha male and I'm a simple introvert). 

I got depression and anxiety for a bit, though I seemed to have beat it last semster. However, its come back hard now that I've returned from summer and all my thoughts are consumed by my roomate and his brother trying to torment me. I know these are my own thoughts and not them but they are driving me crazy and are almost constant which is starting to drive me towards suicide as an option at a quickening rate. I have a therapist who hopefully might help in a little more than a week but I was wondering if anyone in this community had any techniques for controlling their thoughts as I'm tired of my thoughts being controlled by these two jackasses especially since I love thinking :(
