Hey.Howâ€™s it going? Good? Thatâ€™s nice. How Iâ€™m doing? Oh, same as you.  

Iâ€™m not good at making conversation. Actually, Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m one of the worst at it. I feel like everyone whoâ€™s friends with me, sees me as the person you talk to when no one else is online. Mind you, my entire life is online. I have no friends in real life. haha. My entire social existence is dependent on a single art forum Iâ€™ve been on for a couple years now. 

Having friends that arenâ€™t online is really hard for me. Maybe I just find comfort in being able to run away completely if I ever need to online. Iâ€™m really lonely all by myself. I dropped out of my high school and opted for online coursed in grade 11. I miss having to go to school. I had no friends still, but at least I was surrounded by people and occasionally got said hi too. 

I remember really hating school. I legitimately would eat my lunch in the washroom some days. Not often though, instead I would just opt out of lunch entirely, or walk to my dads office and eat there. I was worried someone might see me eating in the washroom, and feel pity for me. I was so lonely, and so depressed yet I was so terrified of someone wanting to reach out to me. I didn't want to be a bother. 

I used to be a selfless person. Because of that people would walk all over me. I was always the expendable friend. I never really had a mutual Best friend, anyone who came close to that always had a better person to call their best friend. I donâ€™t feel bad for myself because of this. Itâ€™s my fault after all for not being selfish. Iâ€™ve come to realize that itâ€™s important to be selfish, if you keep thinking about others eventually you forget to think about yourself. 

Iâ€™m so depressed. 

I donâ€™t like the world we live in, and Iâ€™m too weak of a person to do anything about it. I live in a first world country, my family is middle class. But Iâ€™m not happy. 

Child slaves, Racism, Sexism, Greed, itâ€™s so prevalent in people. One day humanity will over come that, weâ€™ll live in a wonderful utopia where everyone is an artist. But that day is far, far away. Until then, I donâ€™t feel like living anymore. 

People like me donâ€™t fit in. Iâ€™m lazy, un-motivated, un-disciplined, un-talented, ugly, mean, anti-social, anxious, timid and the list just goes on. I canâ€™t contribute anything to the world thatâ€™s good. My parents will  be burdened with me for the rest of their lives, dead or alive. 

Thatâ€™s a common argument I get. That by killing myself Iâ€™d be being selfish. Well you know what. Fuck you. Let me be selfish for once in my life. Let me do something for me for once.

I hate my family. Theyâ€™re holding me back from being happy. Them and well, my conscience. I donâ€™t want to leave them with such a shit memory of me. I thought for a while that if I acted like shit to them theyâ€™d hate me and it would make it easier on them. But I think that doesnâ€™t matter. No one likes losing, be it a child , sister, grand daughter. 

This is all so draining. Iâ€™m in my senior year now, but I definitely wonâ€™t be graduating when Iâ€™m suppose to. Iâ€™m way too behind in my classes. Maybe itâ€™ll take me an extra year to finish, maybe I wonâ€™t finish at all. 

Iâ€™m such a weak person. I canâ€™t be strong like most people are. I canâ€™t motivate or discipline myself to become a better person. Iâ€™m just some lazy scum meagerly surviving each day. 

I want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so bad. But Iâ€™m not strong enough to do it. Iâ€™m only human, Iâ€™m afraid of death. I worry about who I leave behind, and whether or not there IS anything to look forward too. 

But I am killing myself. 

Iâ€™m ruining my future by not finishing High School. Iâ€™m hurting myself by not eating enough. I sleep all day because I donâ€™t have the energy to be out and about doing shit. I can feel bones Iâ€™m not suppose to be able to feel. All of this is hurting my mind to top it. Iâ€™m too exhausted to think anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do. 

Is this even a suicide note anymore? Am I crying for help? Being an attention whore? 

I. Donâ€™t. Know.

I donâ€™t know anything. 

Itâ€™s so frustrating. 

Most days I feel nothing. I could draw, but I donâ€™t feel like it. I could pick up that guitar I got for Christmas, but I really donâ€™t feel like it. I could go play video games, but I just don't feel like it. I donâ€™t feel like eating. I donâ€™t feel like sleeping. I donâ€™t feel like doing anything. 

I donâ€™t know how I get through 24 hours of nothing every day. Time is just slipping from me. Iâ€™m suppose to be getting 1 course done every month. But I think its been 5 months since I Started, and I havenâ€™t finished any classes. I donâ€™t know where the time has gone. 

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. 

I donâ€™t know.
