i need some advice I'm going crazythe awkwardness and antisocial personality of mine is driving me to the edge. can some experienced person help me on socializing. I mean I'm the most awkward person I know and recently my best friend is bored with me. I don't blame her because I'm a boring person. this is nothing to elaborate on, this is a fact. I don't have any other friends or anyone I talk to for that matter so I know I'm the problem. I never have easy conversations I always think about topics to talk about when I'm gonna go out with someone (the reason they hang out with me is mostly  involuntary). so if you are a cool person please help me. what do you talk about people? what are some common topics? again, what do you talk about? what do you say when you run out of things to say? do you ever run out of things to say? why is everything I say so uninteresting? when you go out to eat, what makes them enjoy spending time with you? whatever advice you can give me because I believe I cannot keep on living with this miserable awkwardness, this makes me unhappy and being constantly unhappy makes me think about bad things about myself. I can't see myself continue on with myself, with this life... I'm sick and tired of being unhappy about this and this year is my last year alive if I can't change.
