I don't know what to doI don't know why I'm posting here. I'm sitting here in my truck at a gas station that I pulled over to. Just thinking about what I'm doing. 

I've thought about suicide everyday for a long time. 
I have ropes, guns, medicine. Whatever means I need really to get the job done. I just haven't decided if I'm really serious about it or not and I'm leaning towards not using a gun if I did. 

Anyway, the point of this post isn't for attention or anything crazy. I couldn't care less. I just want to know how people deal with this shit and when it came down to it what really helped. I don't know what else to do. 

 Never have taken antidepressants. It's not really all that appealing. I'm headed out to my favorite coffee shop to sit down and try to relax.

I already know people care about me but I don't care. Life goes on. The only real reason I haven't is because of my brother. I know he looks up to me. There's nothing worse than fucking up a kids whole world. To them the small things are everything. I know how it feels. 

I have chronic physical pain and I'm just tired and lonely with no one to really talk to about this.. Any helpful ideas?
