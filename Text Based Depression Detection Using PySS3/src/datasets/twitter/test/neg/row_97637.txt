I feel like a side character in my own lifeAs the title says, I just don't feel like I'm important to anyone except my family. It's not that I don't have friends, it's that I'm ditched/left out every time I try to hangout with them. I'll set up and come up with ideas for a get together and everyone agrees. When the time comes up for the event I usually get ditched and replaced by someone else. This happens like 50% of the time and it's starting to mentally get to me. Like why can't I come along, especially when I came up with the idea to hang out? Then I'll see on social media of those people having a blast and then it kills me because I wish I was there to enjoy it too. I don't know why it happens so often either. I just want to be apart of the fun with everyone else, why am I the only one that gets ditched?
