ReactionsIt may just be me, but I feel there has been an emphasis on controlling your reactions more so lately vs people being accountable for their actions. Like if someone cut you open your responsible for not bleeding everywhere. Like I can clearly hear someone ask "is that a reasonable reaction?" Or "Look at it in a positive light." as I do my best to hold myself together and not bleed out everywhere. Why am I  responsible for not reacting in an emotional manner if your not responsible for your actions? Or being reprimanded  for having a well known natural reaction to someones careless actions, like why would you put mentos in a Coca-Cola bottle and then get pissed at the mess YOUR ACTIONS created. I get the whole I control me, and others control themselves. I just feel the weight is always mine. I have been more mindful of my actions and reactions also, I'm doing my best to stay accountablefor my own happiness.

I havent been suicidal in a while and its creeping in and out. I want to forgive those whose actions caused the reactions that I am also trying to forgive myself for. But the guilt of everything being my fault based on my reactions is so heavy and I carry it everyday.
