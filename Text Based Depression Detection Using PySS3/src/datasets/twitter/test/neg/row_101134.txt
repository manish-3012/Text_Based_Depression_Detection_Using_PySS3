Life is simply not for everyone. I've moved my date to an even earlier one.I was going to end it all on the 5th of January but I'm moving to the 3rd. I just can't take it anymore. Things have gotten the best of me and it all proves I'm just not meant for this life. I don't have what it takes, I never have, and I never will. Things will only get worse from here on. Not better. It'll all get worse until I literally starve or freeze to death. Not another year of things getting worse. No more.

Life is not for everyone.
