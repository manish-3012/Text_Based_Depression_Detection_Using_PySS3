I have nothingI'm 30 this fall. Lifes been getting worse and worse over the last 10 years. Friends lost or drifted away, family isn't, I'm in debt, covid took my income, and my mental health is getting worse. My chronic pain is at an all time high and tonight I found out that the one person I was calling a friend isn't as close as I'd been led to believe. I officially have absolutely nothing to live for. Like nothing.

I've read the books and tried talked to a higher power. I've reached out to past friends and gone through therapy. I know all the "it'll get better"s and "have you tried"s. Hobbies, and food. Drugs and exercise. And yet, here you read. And here I am. Rock. Bottom. 

I'm in no immediate danger. I'm a coward. This isn't a suicide note. I'll be here tomorrow. But I'm just so tired of trying.
