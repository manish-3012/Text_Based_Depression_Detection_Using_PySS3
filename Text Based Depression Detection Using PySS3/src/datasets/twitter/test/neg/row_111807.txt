its different this time (18F)warning: this is reallllyy long and no tl;dr lol you dont have to read it

ive posted on here once before in early august, but since then i havent had suicidal thoughts so i just kind of forgot about it and them

ever since covid, i've been stuck living with my abusive (physically and emotionally) father for 8 months. up until very recently, everyday was the same. i'd wake up, do the same things: being on my phone &amp; doing online schoolwork (never leaving the house like ever because quarantine and being responsible) and go to bed. my dad loves me, but he's african and believes that physical punishment is the way to go for everything i do that upsets him. usually me not doing chores on time (which i really could be better about, but i'm severely depressed and i'm not even going to bother telling him because he won't understand)... or borrowing something and forgetting to return it that day. never anything serious, literally just like scissors or a marker... little things like that. he tries not to but i genuinely think there's something with him where he just cannot seem to get his anger out without hitting me. the last time he did this was in july, where he actually left a scar on my hand and it just shocked me that he actually did that. the time before that i guess he tried to not harm me so instead took a frying pan and smashed it on the floor next to my foot out of frustration and anger. he hasn't done anything physical to me since july, but he's extremely verbally abusive and calls me worthless and stuff like that. this will probably never stop. he just seems to have anger issues and is terrible at communicating.

one time the verbal abuse was so bad that it led to me self harming that night, something i'd never done. i immediately called my mom who i'm very close with (who has been working in a different country since february this year and hasnt been able to return because of travel restrictions)
and broke down crying explaining to her how bad he had been treating me and how it led me to self harming. he'd been secretly listening and my mom called him immediately after and she explained to me that he was sorry and wanted to change. that lasted about a few weeks, and he's now the same as before. that's just kind of a contributor to me feeling like this.

usually i'll have specific things in my life that trigger them to come back, but they usually result in me breaking down and feeling sorry for myself for a few hours while researching methods of painless suicide... today it was different though. i even found a completely painless way out by using helium.

i've had a bad week... i actually can't remember the last time i had a good day, everyday has just either been eh, or just terrible. but for about 8 days now, i cant seem to go one day without something going wrong. i was in a long distance "relationship" (not official) for about 1.5 months, with a guy i actually liked a lot. and he recently broke up with me because he didn't like me enough to continue doing long distance. i think this was my trigger this time. but like i said, my suicidal thoughts usually occur immediately after something significantly bad happens but they go away after a few hours and i forget they even happened. this time though, i think i reached a limit. i'm not blaming him or the breakup, it was bound to happen sooner or later. it was just a matter of waiting until the next bad thing happened to me and this just happened to be it. i've had depression hanging over me since i was 16, and him being there for those 1.5 months made it better. but that distraction is gone now, plus the fact that it ended badly. i'm usually a pretty optimistic person, but to a point where i'm unrealistic and naive for thinking everything will be okay. i think the breakup shocked me because i really thought we'd work it out (the unrealistic optimism) and my brain is just confused because for the millionth time, a bad outcome occurred in my life. i feel like my entire outlook on life has changed because of me reaching a limit after the breakup, to extreme negativity with everything i do, so its causing my suicidal thoughts to linger.... long enough for me to make entire pros and cons list of killing myself, a plan to donate my savings and belongings, and just a list of other things i want to do before i turn 19 in february. i set a date for dec 31st and i actually think i'm going to do it... i already decided pretty much everything and i want it to be before january because i am supposed to move to my college city and get an apartment with a roommate... but i dont want to traumatize her so i'm doing it before that...

i dont know what the point of this even is... i guess i just wanted to tell someone... because it feels different.... every day that i wake up i just wait for something bad to happen because i know it will, and it always does... like yesterday i actually shattered the back of my dad's new phone on accident so you can already guess how he reacted... and i feel terrible about it. and a few days before that i had an allergic reaction that completely destroyed my body from the chest down because i had hives and they left disgusting dark marks all over me. its like something just wants me to cave in and i have.... i'm just tired. i feel so peaceful now that i've come to this conclusion, and now my only worry is what i'm going to have to face after i die. 

thank you for reading if you made it this far :)
