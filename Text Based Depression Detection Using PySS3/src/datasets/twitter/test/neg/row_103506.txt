Someone Please Help MeI'm out of options; I have no one or nowhere else to turn. I don't know what to do anymore. My life has been one catastrophe after another, from childhood until months before me 25th birthday. I have nowhere else to turn, so I'm on reddit asking for help; I'm at my rope's end and I just don't know what to do anymore. I know many people have it so, so much worse than I have had it, but in my life I've went through six divorces, molestation and abuse by my mother, abandonment by my father, and now I'm facing a DUI charge that will result in jail time (no, I didn't kill anyone or damage any property.) Along with these issues, prior to the DUI, I have been suicidal the majority of my life. I have never sought professional help for my issues out of pure shame and embarrassment, even though I know I probably suffer from sever clinical depression and bipolar disorder. I've even had one major psychological break this year that seemed to come out of nowhere, where I woke up in the middle of the night screaming and crying about "the people with no faces" who were coming for me, as my roommate recounted, as I have no memory of the incident. 

I have tried so hard for my entire life to not be the product of my raising; I graduated high school, went to college, graduated college with honors, and have never had a problem with law of any kind until this year. I have struggled since I graduated to find a stable career, but now I work at a local dollar store, my love life has been torture; my current ex cheated on me at least three times while we were together, and everyone since then has been the same. And now that I have this DUI, and please don't lecture me on this, I've already lost my dream job, my girlfriend, and the respect of my friends and family over this, I don't know what to do. I've always tried to live life the right way, I've always done right by anyone that's been in my life, and no matter what I do, I find myself drawing the short straw. 

I've came to a conclusion: my life will either end in suicide, like I've always tried, and failed, to do, or I'm going to commit suicide through disappearing. I don't know what to do. I'm languishing in the life I currently live and I sincerely do not know how to cope any further. This may not be the place to post this, but someone please help me. I don't know what to do anymore...
