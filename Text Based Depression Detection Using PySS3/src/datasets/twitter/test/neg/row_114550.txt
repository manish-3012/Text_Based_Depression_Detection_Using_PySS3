Going in circles.If I go ask for help from mental health services theyll just refer me and then decide that i shpuld just go ahead with therapy which is what im doing. Im dping everything the services tell me to do. I take my medications but still all i can think about is killing myself. Im not living. Im doing what im told. Ive told them this and they say it takes time. The more time goes on the more courage i get to kill myself. Im too afraid of failing and that fear is all thats keeping me alive. Im at a loss at what to do.
