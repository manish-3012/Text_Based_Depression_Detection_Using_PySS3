I have been an outcast almost my entire lifeAside from few people, I always end up being abandoned or alone in the end...

I could barely make friends in two college careers, and I ended up either losing the friendship or drifting away from the few I could befriend one way or another... Same for sone high school and internet friends.

Why? What have I done so wrong to make people not reciprocate my friendship?

Why can't I be normal? Why can't most people accept me like I am, when they accept others so easily?

I'm tired of this, I'm tired of being discarded, abandoned and rejected... I don't want to live in this reality anymore, it really hurts...
