Is suicide ever acceptable?I have long story about my life, lost everything. On prozac 80mg and benzos to deal with anxiety, but I got my life stuck in a position where things are so bad I don't think they can be saved. In the circumstance is someone unable to find happiness is suicide ever acceptable?
