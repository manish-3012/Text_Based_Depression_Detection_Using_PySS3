Looking for support in hard times.I have survived a suicide attempt that i did mid-summer, and I often think of doing it again. Need support since I dont have many friends, and I feel like no one really cares about me. I just want a hug from anyone who can say it giong to be ok i am here for you, and that they actually care and are willing to be there for me when i need it. I often wish that my suicide attempt succeded, and i was free from all this pain and i cold actually be happy for once.
