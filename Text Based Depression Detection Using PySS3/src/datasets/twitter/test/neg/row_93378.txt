I feel civilization is going to collapse within my lifetime and it's starting to affect my sanity...Basically, I spend a lot of time on /r/collapse, and I've come to realize that this world will reach a brutal and horrifying end while I'm still alive. It's already starting to affect my mind, I'm starting to spend more and more of my time paranoid. I'm always afraid, especially for my family. I feel like this will all just end up turning me into a nutjobs and destroying my life. I'm already starting to think of offing myself to escape it, but, I also know that I may be overreacting. What can I do? Those motherfuckers on that sub are worthless, all they do is wax poetic about how amazing and unique it is to be amongst the last humans, as if I give a fuck about that. I just, please help me. I can't take this.
