im a dumbass that never does anything righti already feel ashamed for coming back with another post on here for the millionth time. This time I feel closer than ever. I really want to do it this time. i really want to finally end my life. Everything is hurting and my mind is tired. I feel like a pathetic fucking loser for even crying about my problems. Iâ€™m not good enough for anything and just expressing my feelings this way makes me feel embarrassed guilty and selfish. Because I know I make people happy I make my good friends and I can make strangers happy but Iâ€™m not anything. Iâ€™m worthless. My family blames me for everything and I canâ€™t support myself enough to break away from them nor would I want to since Iâ€™ve never been out of a shell. Iâ€™m not a person Iâ€™ve been kept inside and I feel like a robot where I had just developed traits and added it to the list inside me and pull them out when Iâ€™m with people. only certain people would probably know Iâ€™m hurting inside. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s worth living as though Iâ€™m a burden anymore. I donâ€™t want to be selfish and kill myself within the next few days but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to live by next year. Iâ€™ve already isolated from my friends and I donâ€™t plan to speak to many people so I could be forgotten and it wonâ€™t hurt as much.
