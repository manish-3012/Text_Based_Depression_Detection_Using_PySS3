I am a horrible personI think I'm going to need to kill myself, so the world will be a better place. I remember all the people who dislike, and all my ridiculous actions. Trying to improve my life doesn't sound like a good idea because I'll still be the same shitty person I have always been. Losing weight, finishing up my degree, and other positive self improvement would be wasted on me. I think the only way I can solve the problem is to kill myself.
