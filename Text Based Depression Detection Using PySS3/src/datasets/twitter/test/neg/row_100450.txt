Alternatives to suicide?My girlfriend of three years just left me and I'm moving across the country for work that isn't even guaranteed. My business is hanging on by a thread, one problem and I will have no income and can't collect ei. I have done everything right, worked diligently, was faithful and dependable, but for the past sometime all I have experienced is difficult times and I do not see any smooth sailing ahead and not sure if I have the strength to push on. I would prefer not to kill myself if I could get to calmer seas but I don't really see that happening. I don't believe I'm pessimistic, that's my honest appraisal.

If its just going to be like this for another ten years (its been like this that long already) must just be easier to bow out now. I am looking for constructive alternatives to suicide. What can I do to make things palatable? I have many friends, I am active socially and athletically. I work hard and I am earnest but things just keep coming up. My shell has gotten tougher but the inside is dying.

I keep working for a better life and as I get older my health has started failing, I had an extended stay in the hospital not long ago. If I am building a bridge to a better life, by the time I have the next piece built another has aged enough to fall apart. There is no progress, there is just a hole I keep digging to get out of but the more and faster I dig, the more the walls collapse in around me and bury me over and over and over again.

I can go on for this a bit longer but not another ten years, and I don't see it getting easier. It might, but I wouldn't bet on it.
