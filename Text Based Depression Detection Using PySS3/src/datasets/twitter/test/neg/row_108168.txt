I feel like I've already completely ruined my life beyond redemption and I'm only 22Basically title, I graduated college 2 years ago and I still haven't been able to get a job in the field I went to school for. On top of that, I've thrown away every opportunity and every network I had. There's no way I can get a good job now. It's so crushing to see all of my peers lead more successful lives than me. I'm going to get blackout drunk tonight and hang myself. That's the only way I can feel relief now.
