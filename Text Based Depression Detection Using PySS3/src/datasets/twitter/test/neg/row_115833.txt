my life is shit.my entire life is shit. i have no friends, most people hate me for no reason. my family hates me because im not as good as they want me to be. i have no talents and no career. im utterly useless in every way. i cant even tell the one girl who actually gives a shit, she girl who i am madly in love with, how i really feel about her. my entire life is completely pointless and theres no way it will ever get better. im not going to see a counselor or a physiologist all i want is to just shut my eyes and never have to deal with how shitty i am or my life is. i want nothing more right now than just to die and im scared that it might come to that. what the fuck are you guys going to do to keep me from that? i need help reddit, please help me.
