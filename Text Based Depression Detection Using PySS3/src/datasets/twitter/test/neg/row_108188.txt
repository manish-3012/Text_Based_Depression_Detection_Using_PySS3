Is my plan good enough?I've been considering suicide for the past 2 years and since then i've been cutting out friends and relatives out of my life. At this point i only speak to my mother and father as i live with them. Finally i started starving myself two days ago, i stopped eating completely and only drink coffee and a bit of water. I plan on doing this for at least two weeks and then i will get very drunk and also swallow 2 grams of benadryl and climb a tall building near my house and jump from the roof while i'm drunk, high and physically weak because of the starvation. Is this enough to be 100% deadly?


Edit: Thank you all for the support but i'm not here to seek attention or whatever. I'm just looking for an answer to my question, so i will ignore messages or comments trying to stop me.
