This is just a rant bc i need to get it outOkay so i start sixth form tomorrow and iâ€™m panicking. This is the start of my a levels which if i donâ€™t get high enough grades in i wonâ€™t be able to get into the universities i want to get into. I got my gcse results recently and i did really badly. Sure i passed almost everything but i got 2 grades lower than i was predicted in my 2 best subjects and i only got a 4 in english language which some universities wonâ€™t accept. And so now i think that i wonâ€™t be able to get what i need to get in my a levels. 
I already feel like iâ€™m probably going to self harm tomorrow bc thatâ€™s what i do when iâ€™m stressed - bad habit i know- . But i donâ€™t know how else to cope. I have an appointment with my schools psychiatrist on the 9th this will hopefully help a bit. 
And i have it in my head that if i fail my a levels and donâ€™t get into university i have no other options. 
And right now iâ€™m feeling really suicidal because i know how badly i did in my gcseâ€™s and i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll do any better at my a levels because i have no motivation even though there is one of my subjects i really like. 
And i canâ€™t focus half the time. 
sorry if this is too hard to understand
