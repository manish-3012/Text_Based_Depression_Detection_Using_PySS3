I am just a bunch of mental illnesses, I am in pain all the time. I can't connect with people (aspergers), and they don't want anyway (non-passing transgender), I hate everything about me (bpd) and can't achieve anything (ADHD). I am just rotting away in the prison of my body and mind.I have been that way for too long, to have hope that something will change for the better... decided that I have to do it for myself, give myself a treat that I really wanted for so long, I should take the responsibility.
