Anyone else feel like the universe just hates them?I don't even have the motivation to save myself anymore. I feel like the universe hates me. For what reason? Well, I'm not sure. Everyone tells me it's going to get better but I know more than anyone that it's not. The universe won't allow it. Whatever happiness I find just ends up getting torn from my grip. It's tiring.
