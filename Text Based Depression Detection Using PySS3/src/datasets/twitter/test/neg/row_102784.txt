How Do I Tell My Family I Tried?I'm tired of this life. I've spent years trying to get my life together, but there's just too much pain. Between being repeatedly raped by my own mother, my father's emotional abuse, and years of struggling to break into the profession, I've had no luck. The scars are still there and I still have no job. I'm tired.

I just want them to know I tried. I tried to heal and I tried to make a living. What do I put in the letter?
