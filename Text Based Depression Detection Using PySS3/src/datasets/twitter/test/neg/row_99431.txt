It is all about meI am not depressed. 

I am posting to bitch about myself. Let it be quasi-diary thingy. m'kay?

I, or as I came to know, some part of me really does not want me to be alive. I hate myself quite often. I hate my appearance, my personality (if there is any left). More and more time passes by, but self-acceptance does not "feel" right. That reminds me of Jesse from Breaking Bad: if you act bad, you have all the right to hate yourself.

Though the problem is that I am stuck in this self-loathing step and can't seem to get through it to real change. I should make a plan and just do it. And in here lies all the trick - I don't know where to start. I should erase myself, then it would be easier to build anew. 

Are there any methods of total self-destruction that would not result in my death? That is what I am asking myself quite often, when I dream of slitting my throat.
