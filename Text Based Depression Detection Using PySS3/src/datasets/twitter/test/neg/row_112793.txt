Iâ€™m not okayIâ€™m planning on committing suicide this weekend. Iâ€™ve been wanting to for a long time. I should have a while ago. I genuinely regret not committing suicide in September, Iâ€™ve only experienced pain. Iâ€™m so alone. No one to talk to. Gf broke up with, closest friend cutting me off. My life is a nightmare and Iâ€™m ready for it to end.
