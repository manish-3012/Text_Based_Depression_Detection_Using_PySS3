Need suggestionsI'm writing here because I have no idea where else to write. Currently I'm stuck in life and I have no idea what to do. Thanks to my past I have a few anxieties that prevent me from functioning like a normal person. I dropped out of high school, because I can't study anymore. All days I'm laying in my bed browsing reddit and daydreaming about getting out of this mess. I seriously have no idea what to do, I'm unemployed and I have no diploma or anything. Please  give me some suggestions on what to do.
