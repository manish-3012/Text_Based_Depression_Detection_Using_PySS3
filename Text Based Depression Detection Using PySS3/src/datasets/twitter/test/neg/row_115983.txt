I was about to do it...I just got back home. Sitting on the couch thinking. 

I woke up this morning and decided to skip on heading to my classes. I lied in bed for a while and then sat around the house not doing  anything. I eventually wrote out my suicide note and got in the car to head to the building where I used to hang out on the rooftop with some friends. I left my note in the car and took the elevator to the top. I got in the stairwell with the rooftop access and, for the first time ever, the door leading to the roof was locked. Not knowing what to do, I turned back around and  headed back home. I sat in my car for a while thinking of other ways I could do it. But now I'm just back home, lying on the couch, doing nothing.
