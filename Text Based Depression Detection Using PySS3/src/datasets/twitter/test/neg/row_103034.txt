Periodic suicidal thoughtsThoughts run in and out of my head at my lowest moments.  They're graphic and at times, disturbing.  I am unsure how to cope with these thoughts.  Are they a part of me and simply disturbing or are they foreign to my existence, a parasite to be purged?  What's the right attitude to have?
