Posted a suicide note on twitter, haven't attempted yet.I don't feel overwhelmingly suicidal, not enough to attempt again though. Three weeks ago I was going to jump under a train but didn't have the guts to do it, but almost did. Anyway, I wrote the note almost on a whim; I guess I wanted to see if my followers cared but I also wanted to make it seem I actually died. Haven't been active there since last night. I blocked my friend so she wouldn't see. If I gather the strength and attempt again I'll probably just erase all my social media accs. I have actual suicide notes for my loved ones I wrote ages ago. Yup.


This is very depressing (no shit) all in all but I just don't to live any longer like this, harming others and my future.
