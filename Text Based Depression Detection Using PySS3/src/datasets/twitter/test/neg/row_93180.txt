Someone give me attention.I'm lying in my bead right now. I just finished a 13 hour shift at work and I need to go back early in the morning. I need to be writing an English essay for school, but instead I'm here crying. I used to have friends that cared about me. I even had someone who cared enough about me to say that she liked me. But that's all gone. They told me that I'm too emotional and that I need to find new friends. I miss them. I miss so many people. I go my entire day and all I can think about is my old friends. I listen to songs that remind me of them on repeat. I can barely walk through my school hallways anymore in fear that I'll run into them. Without anyone, I'm nothing. I don't have anyone else to talk to anymore. All I do is go to work and cry. I was admitted into a hospital a few months ago because I had thoughts of attempting, but now I really want to die. Maybe it'll get their attention. It makes me happy to think of how they would react to my death. I just don't know anymore. Someone help.
