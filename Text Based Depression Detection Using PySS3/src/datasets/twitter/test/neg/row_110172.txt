A lifetime of being used and abusedIt all started when I was little. I guess I should preface this by saying that I am a 30 year old gay male and an only child.When I was a kid I often stayed over at my grandparents house and my cousins house. Well one time when I was little, my uncle picked me up to bring me over for a sleepover, we went to dinner and then to his house but the rest of his family was at church still when we got there. He took advantage of this and made me preform sexual acts on him and told me that I couldn't tell anyone or I would be in trouble and my parents would be upset and it would tear the family apart. I was so little and confused and scared and embarrassed so I never told anyone. 

Then, in fourth grade, I was being bullied while in a split class of fourth and fifth graders. I stayed after school one day to talk to my teacher because the bullying had been getting worse. This lead to me staying after class several times to talk to him and then before Christmas break, he made me preform sexual acts with him "in exchange for his help". I was so depressed and just wanted the bullying to stop and once again didn't want to embarrass my parents or upset them. This situation continued and escalated until almost the end of the year. He got so brave that he even used to rub my shoulders in the computer lab in front of my classmates and no one even asked me about it, though I doubt I'd have had the courage to tell the truth anyways. I just prayed for the school year to end so I could escape.

While these events never truly left me, I at least enjoyed several abuse free years thereafter. Until my second relationship during my freshman year of college. My boyfriend dated me for two months until we finally had sex, before which I had been a virgin. After that he stopped speaking to me other than to let me know he only wanted to date me long enough to take my virginity and to leave him alone.

In another relationship I suffered from gradually increasing physical abuse as he developed a drinking and drug problem. It went from grabbing me violently to hitting and slapping me and ended in him drugging and raping me.

After this I had a couple of normal relationships until my most recent ex. He was a recovering pill and heroin addict with almost a year clean and everything started off great. Until school and full time work took up a ton of my time and he kept complaining about not seeing me and he used this to slowly isolate me from all of my friends. Then the abuse slowly started as he relapsed. I thought I could help him, especially as a nursing student I figured I was the perfect person to help him get clean again and that things would go back to normal once that happened. Well that didn't happen, as several trips down flights of stairs taught me. That relationship ended with me being thrown through a glass door.

I feel like no matter what I do I'm just an object to people for them to own and control and I can't take it anymore. I've suffered so much depression and anxiety from everything and no counseling or medication has ever been able to truly help me. I feel so alone and worthless. And I blame myself. If I had spoken up in the beginning, or if I had had a sibling to turn to, or risked confiding in my parents even though they may have felt like they failed me, if I had gotten out sooner or just done something different maybe things wouldn't have ended up like this. But all I know is that I feel ruined. I don't want a future anymore. I just want to go on to a hopefully better after life so it can all go away.
