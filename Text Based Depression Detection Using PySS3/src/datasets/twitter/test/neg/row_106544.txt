Canâ€™t keep fightingI know this will get drowned out. After all, Iâ€™m just another sad excuse of a human that people will read about and forget. Honestly, Iâ€™m tired of trying to convince myself the people around me arenâ€™t lying when they say Iâ€™m â€œlovedâ€.
Iâ€™ve had anxiety and depression since I was 8 I think. I started being verbally abused at 5 so I think 8 is the earliest I saw record of me thinking about death. I have Aspergers, so I was shy and awkward. I had no friends as a kid outside my family, and the ones I had as I grew ditched me a lot. My mom kept me homeschooled until 8th grade, so I had nowhere to go and sometimes wouldnâ€™t leave the house for weeks. I was a devout Catholic at the time, so my self hatred was something I thought was good. I thought it was humility breaking my pride and desperately wanted to go be a martyr missionary. I wanted to go straight to heaven and stop hurting. I thought my developing body was horrible. I was told when I first got boobs I could never be anything but a trophy wife by other girls. My parents had divorced when I was a baby, so  I flew a lot. I was groped by tsa every time, even had one person jam their hand into me painfully like a karate chop, leaving me too afraid to fly now unless itâ€™s a small airport. I gained huge amounts of weight and developed an eating disorder where I ate just to stop hurting. I have small bones and am 5â€™4 as an adult , but as a kid I was 200lbs at ten. I canâ€™t get my brain to shut up about everything.

I should feel great. Iâ€™m now agnostic, 20 and people often tell me attractive. I have people ask about me from programs Iâ€™ve been in, actually missing me. Iâ€™m an actress and singer with hopes to pursue it full time. I have a wonderful friend group. I have the most wonderful boyfriend, someone so kind and accepting. But Iâ€™m terrified Iâ€™ll lose it all, that friends and boyfriend will get bored of me and leave, that people lie when they say kind things, that Iâ€™ll get nowhere with my dreams. I just want to stop hurting. Iâ€™m so tired of being afraid. I just want to go to my next life, where maybe I could really be happy.

Iâ€™m sorry for the long text, if anyone made it this far.
