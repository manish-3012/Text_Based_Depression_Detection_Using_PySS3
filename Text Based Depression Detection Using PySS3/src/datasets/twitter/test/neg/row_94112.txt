My girlfriend's motherLast night my girlfriend's mother had to go to the hospital for two self inflicted knife wounds to the leg. She is an alcoholic with borderline personality disorder. I am very worried that she will try to seriously injure or kill herself and she may try to injure or kill her family. I did not know where else to post this, what can I do? What resources are available to me? I am very worried about my girlfriends safety and do not know what to do.
