Why's it so fucking hard to die when you want toIts always either people stop you and won't let you or something will go wrong, then you'll be permanently fucking disabled and be even more miserable with even less chances to kill yourself. Fuck! I'm in a house with guns but with my luck something is gonna go wrong or get in the way. That and I can't stop thinking about what that last second feels like.
