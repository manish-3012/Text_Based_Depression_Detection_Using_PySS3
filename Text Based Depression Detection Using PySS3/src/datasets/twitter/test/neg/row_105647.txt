Idk anymoreI have no one to talk to about this so Iâ€™m just going to let it go on here. Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was 12. The feeling of being alone and the random voice telling me to kill myself has always been here. I hate the way I look. I dropped out of HS. Iâ€™ve never had a GF. Iâ€™m a Virgin. Iâ€™ve lost all my friends because I make stupid decisions while high on coke. I battle addiction. I just canâ€™t handle it anymore. The only thing that keeps me here is my siblings because I know they look up to me very much because Iâ€™m the oldest. I donâ€™t want them to have the burden of â€œmy older brother commit suicideâ€. Thereâ€™s nothing keeping me here though. I know itâ€™s my fate to end my life. Just depending when I get around to it finally. I just wish I could be happy and live a normal life. I make things harder for myself. It would destroy my dad and mom but I canâ€™t live my whole life miserable for them or anyone else. Itâ€™s has to end. Iâ€™m sorry. Please donâ€™t hate me or yourself. You guys always loved me and tired to give me everything I needed. I know itâ€™s selfish but Iâ€™m sorry.
