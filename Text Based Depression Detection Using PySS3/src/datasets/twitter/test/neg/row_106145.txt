venting about what i'd be leaving behindiâ€™m angry that i will never get to celebrate being free from self-harm. iâ€™m angry that iâ€™ll never get to see the lines in my face when i turn thirty. iâ€™m angry that i will never feel beautiful. iâ€™m angry that i will never find my fashion style. i am angry that i will never have a christmas with a group of friends who truly care about me.Â 

iâ€™m angry that i will never own or decorate my own house. iâ€™m angry that i will never get engaged, or married, to the love of my life. iâ€™m angry that i will never have a baby. iâ€™m angry that i wonâ€™t see my dog get gray around his muzzle.Â 

iâ€™m angry that i will never work with california condors, or turkey vultures, or any animal.Â iâ€™m angry that i wonâ€™t ever have any of my own research published. iâ€™m angry that i will never be renowned in my field, at least for being kind.Â 

iâ€™m angry that i will never live in another state or country. iâ€™m angry i will never see another country. iâ€™m angry that i will never see a world where people arenâ€™t killing the environment, or hurting each other.
