i think im going to kill myself today when i get homeim done suffering. nothing works out for me and all my friends have left me (for a good reason). im annoying and nuisance to this world and its people. it is not worth to keep struggling anymore when im sure im just a lost cause. im so sorry to everyone that has ever had to deal with me and i hope me killing myself will be good enough of an apology.
