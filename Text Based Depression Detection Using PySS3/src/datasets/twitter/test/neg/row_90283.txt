I'm Fueled By Nothing But SpiteI'm so fucking angry right now. I've been coping with a severe decline in my mental health for over 2 years now, suicidal ideation has been creeping in, but I fought it for 24 long months, and I'm finally done. A group of people who lied to my face and called me their friend spent the last 3 days blocking and burning every bridge between me and them. They imagine themselves as a support group, but they turned on me with no warning and dropped me like a bad habit. 

I was doing fine without them, I was crawling, but I was moving forward. Then they come along and fucking lie to me, make me think I finally have people I can trust with my thoughts and not be fucking alone with my own hell. I'm an idiot for trusting anyone. Silence, for three days, I manage to work through the complete despair and try and connect to some other groups. The "friends" who had overlap from this "support group" started cutting ties with mutual friends.

I can't fucking stand it. Am I so worthless and abhorrent that you need to avoid contact with me by proxy? Is it one for and all for one, unless that one is me? So I tell these fucks off finally, even though I know they won't even read what I send. I'm punching my own ticket, and they can all fuck off with their faux concern and patting themselves on the back for doing *nothing*.

I'm on borrowed time, and I finally feel free. So I agree to hang with another friend who because of distance has no clue about my depression. I can feel normal at least one more time before I prepare my death and finally free myself.

And one of those fuckers called the cops. I have to lie to my mother, tell her that it's just bs from a fucked up associate. Can't talk, cuts me off with no warning, but does an end around and narcs on me to the cops? Fuck that piece of shit. I'm still going to die, and all they did was make a sweet lady cry. 

If you're here to help people, to "save them", then this part is for you.

If you cut and run when someone needs you the most. If you hide like a coward while someone suffers, and then in the midnight hour follow some bullshit social "obligation" to save a life. Then these three words are for you:

Go.
Fuck.
Yourself.

I'd rather die to spite you than live and let you pat yourself on the back for other people's hard work. My only regret is that I'm not angry enough to slit my throat in front of you. Eat shit and die, I'll save you a spot in hell.
