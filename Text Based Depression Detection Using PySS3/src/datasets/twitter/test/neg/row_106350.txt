What to say to someone considering suicide?I don't really know if this belongs here, but a close friend of mine is considering suicide, and i don't really know what i should tell her to help or make her feel better. To give some context, she is having trouble with her mom and stepfather, not doing well in school, and relationship problems. She also thinks that nobody actually likes her, even telling me that she thinks she's bothering me and that i probably secretely dislike her during the chat we just had, and she thinks she is a waste of space, and she's just too cowardly to harm herself.
I really don't know how I can help, I'm sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit but this is the first one that came to my mind for this kind of topic.
