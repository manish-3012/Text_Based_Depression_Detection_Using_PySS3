The miracle of lifeI donâ€™t get people who say this. What about life is a miracle? I feel bad for every new person who is spawned into this world. They didnâ€™t ask for it, but their parents selfishly brought them into a world where you are forced to suffer every day.

Imagine all of those kids who were brought into this world by careless, abusive parents. Needless to say, I was one of them. Struggling to win over the affection of parents who hated them and beat them daily, and in the end begging for death to gods who didnâ€™t exist.

Even if you donâ€™t get abused, you still have to get a job you donâ€™t want to do so you can barely pay for things that you need to survive, which doesnâ€™t end until you are too fragile to continue.

I donâ€™t want someone to lie to me about it getting better. â€œPain is temporary while death is foreverâ€ Pain is not temporary, pain is life.

Life is not a miracle, itâ€™s a tragedy.

I canâ€™t be the only one who things this way.
