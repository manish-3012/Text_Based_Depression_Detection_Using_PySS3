What other option do I even have...?FUCK

&amp;#x200B;

I literally haven't felt content since before I have actual memory. I don't have any memory of feeling good. Yeah, I've had occasional moments where I'm happy like when I get a good grade on a test or improve at something. But that's all circumstantial and lasts for a moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fucking 18. I know that's young and everyone tells me how much time I have. But what's the point? I haven't left the house except for therapy for about a year now. I've been through 4 different antidepressants and like 8 other types of medicine that have either not worked or have just made me worse from side effects. I went to like 4 hours a week of outpatient therapy for a few months.  Then I spent 3 and a half months at a residential treatment center.

&amp;#x200B;

I have 9 fucking psychiatric disorders. 9! I've stopped defining myself by them but like... how do you deal with OCD that starts compulsions whenever you aren't doing anything and depression that makes it so you have no motivation to do anything?

&amp;#x200B;

The colleges I've always dreamed of going to are out of reach even after years of perfect grades. The job I've always dreamed of is out of reach even if I somehow manage to do better. An autistic non-binary politician on a cocktail of psychiatric meds is never getting elected.

&amp;#x200B;

I fail miserably at having relationships with anyone. I have no one. I am alone. I have no friends. All the ones I make I ruin because I am obnoxiously clingy because I am terrified of abandonment. No one will ever love me. The only person that has ever expressed affection for me killed themselves. Because that's the only type of person I can attract. My own family "loves" me but hates me. They look at me with disgust and ridicule me for not doing anything with my life. They refuse to spend any time with me because I am uninteresting and it is painful to spend time with me because there are so many small things that set me off. Talk with food in your mouth? Panic attack. Talk over me? Meltdown. Loud noises? I'm in a ball on the floor.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been so close to suicide. But I've always had this idea that I would get better. I don't have that hope anymore. I've been through every variety of therapy that exists. I've been on every med that each of 4 psychiatrists has recommended. And even if I can get better it's not worth it anymore. The pain of living is so much worse. Every day is fucking torture.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't talk to anyone. I have no friends to talk to and if I talk honestly to my parents or therapist they're just going to have me hospitalized. And I have enough trauma from that. They just wait for you to say you won't kill yourself and let you go. They don't do shit. My life is fucked. I'm just going to end up institutionalized when my parents stop being able to pay for therapy. Like, why should I do this?

&amp;#x200B;

Instead I'm just trapped here by the guilt. My mom has told me that if I killed myself she would kill herself right after. Do you know how much pressure that is!? And the person that finds me... I can't do that to my poor sister. 

&amp;#x200B;

WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO!!?!? I just want to be dead. I just want it to be over. Someone help me please. Come up with something I haven't thought of yet...
