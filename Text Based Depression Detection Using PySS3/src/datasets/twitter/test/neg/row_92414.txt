I'm going bald at 22.I have always since my teens had issues with my body image as im very skinny, I have other issues aswell but I did look pretty good and confident in clothes, within the recent year I have noticed extreme amounts of hair loss at the temples and shows no sign of slowing down, I have an appointment with a doctor in 15 days but everyday is unbareable, all I think of is my future and how utterly disgusting I will look with a bald head. I feel my youth has been robbed from me and I feel so much anger and sorrow. I have panic attacks at night and have trouble sleeping and cry helplessly. I can't see myself wanting to live the rest of my life without hair as I will look repulsive, the only thing making me look decent is my blonde hair. I have completely lost interest in doing anything and in life in general and just lie in bed, watching movies to forget, but I can't escape it.

''Just shave it off and grow a beard'' I don't want to. I can't even grow a beard and I have a small and weirdly shaped head. I feel so sad I don't know what to do, I feel like I have had enough mishaps in my life and this was just the final nail in the coffin. 
My dream was to one day have a wife as I have never had a girlfriend(I know, silly right?), I'm not that ugly honestly and I knew it was possible but now that too has changed.
