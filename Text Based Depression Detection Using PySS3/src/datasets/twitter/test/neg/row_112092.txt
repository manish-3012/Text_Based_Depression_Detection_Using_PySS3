Don't know what to say. I thought that writing what's going on might help, but you guys have your hands full with everyone in SW, and many of those you can help. I think I'm beyond help. I have no friends or anyone to talk to. I've taken xanax to calm myself down so I guess I'll go sleep. (not enough xanax to hurt myself) Everything just gets worse and worse.
