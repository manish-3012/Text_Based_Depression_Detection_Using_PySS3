I canâ€™t do this anymoreIâ€™m 20 years old and my whole life Iâ€™ve struggled with mental illness and trauma Iâ€™ve missed out on so much because I couldnâ€™t enjoy anything in my life. Iâ€™ve never had a friend and the people who I thought were my friends hurt me or raped me. I do have a ex girlfriend and I still love her and she wanted to be friends after we broke up but then she ghosted me which fucking hurts. My parents are disappointed in me and I still live with one of them and they never talk to me. I donâ€™t know what the fuck Iâ€™m doing with my life Iâ€™ve been out of high school for 3 years and I only have a few college credits and I canâ€™t keep a fucking job. Iâ€™ve been in and out of therapy for years and nothing fucking helps they just tell me the same things over and over and Iâ€™m so fucked that some therapists stop treating me entirely. I canâ€™t even do anything right now because of fucking covid so all I do is sit her and relive trauma and cry. 

I want to kill myself so fucking bad Iâ€™m sick and tired of being alone and getting hurt no one fucking cares they say they do but they donâ€™t Iâ€™m pretty sure if I die no one would cry about it or maybe all the people who fucked me over would act sad and say how â€œwe were such good friendsâ€ everything is bullshit and Iâ€™m just so fucking done with everything itâ€™ll never get better so whatâ€™s the point?
