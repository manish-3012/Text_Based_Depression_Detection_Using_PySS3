There is no escapeThe buddhists were right. Life IS suffering. From the cradle to the grave, you suffer. You suffer from hunger, the cold, work, heart break, aging and illness. There is no rest. And frankly, I have not had too many good times in my life to make up for all the bad. Life is enduring the suffering and misery. That's the truth. Maybe some have it a little better than others. They're lucky. But I will NOT kill myself. I am an agnostic, and I have looked at many philosophies and religions over the years. They all seem to say that suicide is the worst thing you can do as to the consequences in the afterlife, if you believe in that. Reincarnation, purgatory, hell, guilt and misery are not things I want to grapple with. So, there is no escape. I just have to endure it all and wait for death and hope something comes along to make me feel better for a minute or two.  Drugs, alcohol, distractions.... All lead to more misery. You cant escape.
