I have no effort to give.I have intrusive thoughts about killing myself but I wouldnâ€™t call them invasive or instinctual. But I just donâ€™t see the point.

Weâ€™re born without choice into this shit heap of a world and told what to do the moment we drop out of the womb. I donâ€™t want to work for anything, I just donâ€™t.

People say itâ€™ll get better but fuck if Iâ€™m waiting for hat. I even got a new job recently but I canâ€™t even tell if I like it or not, I worked myself up yesterday and burst into tears and called my mom asking me to pick me up. It was embarrassing. I go counselling which kind of helps, I know itâ€™s not gonna solve all my problems but I want it to. I just want an answer.

People say you need to force yourself to change, that you need to find the effort. I canâ€™t find it. I canâ€™t push myself to go workout or get on the shower or just work through the feeling. I canâ€™t stand there for 8 hours at a job I donâ€™t even know I want. I need the money, Iâ€™m sick of depending on my mom, but I just canâ€™t put in the effort.

I donâ€™t think itâ€™s gonna get better, I canâ€™t see tomorrow and I canâ€™t figure out what I want from life. I hate my life. Everyone says Iâ€™ve got so much going for me but I beg to differ. Iâ€™ve got an acting degree and commitment issues, yeah amazing life.

I just canâ€™t see his getting better. I never asked to be born and Iâ€™d sure as hell get a refund if I could but I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone. 

I canâ€™t even talk to my mom about my true feelings because Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll hurt her feelings. Thatâ€™s how much of an enigma I am. I know what I need to do to work Iâ€™m getting better but I just wonâ€™t do it, I canâ€™t. But why? Iâ€™m lying here on my bed trying to cry, thatâ€™s all I wanna do right now but I canâ€™t. No matter what I think about I just canâ€™t, itâ€™s only when I talk to someone I feel I can cry but even then it feels fake. I canâ€™t trust my own feelings because they change all the time. Iâ€™m about two hours Iâ€™ll forget this feeling and ill be embarrassed again, resume the usual life and then just wait for the next dip.

I canâ€™t commit to a job that I know I need. This cursed life, I jut want to cry and be normal.
