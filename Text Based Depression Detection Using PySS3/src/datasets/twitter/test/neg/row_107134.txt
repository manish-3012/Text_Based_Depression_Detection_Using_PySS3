ScaredI don't know what to do or what I am doing. I don't feel in control. I bought rope a few hours ago. I can't face going on or hurting my family. I don't know if I'm going to make it through the night. My thoughts are everywhere. I have a plan one second and then another the other second. I don't know what I'm expecting.
