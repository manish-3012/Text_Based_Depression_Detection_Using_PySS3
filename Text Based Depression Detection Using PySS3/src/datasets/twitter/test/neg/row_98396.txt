I cant do this shit anymore I am so close to killing myself, I have everything I'm just trying to find anything to stop myself, but I can't. My parents always say I just want attention and I'm faking. I'd talk to my friends but I stopped talking to them because all I do is disappoint them. I can't fucking do this anymore, if I ever cut myself they just say I want attention and punish me. I can't even eat anymore and school is fucking hell. I've written my note and I just have nobody to talk to. And everyone is constantly telling me to kill myself and that I'm a disappointment and at this point I just want to fucking do it. I want help but I have no way to get it.
