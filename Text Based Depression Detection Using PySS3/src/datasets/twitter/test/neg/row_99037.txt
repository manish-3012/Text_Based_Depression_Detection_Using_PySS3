boyfriend is better off without meIâ€™ve never thought this before. i normally believe people will be sad i died. it would ruin lives. this was the only thing stopping me from killing myself. now i believe heâ€™d be better without me. he says i make his life better, but if he knew what was happening, all iâ€™d do is make him sad. itâ€™s burdening. i need to end it as soon as possible to lessen the pain for him. but obviously, deep down this scares me- iâ€™m posting it on here. i want to die so badly, i feel like iâ€™ve been living on borrowed time for the past six months. iâ€™m so tired of this. i need to end it but i donâ€™t want to hurt anyone.  i was almost forced into inpatient, but talked my way out of it. i know itâ€™d ruin my life- theres no going back from that point. i cant get help. i donâ€™t know what to do anymore. i just want it to be over
