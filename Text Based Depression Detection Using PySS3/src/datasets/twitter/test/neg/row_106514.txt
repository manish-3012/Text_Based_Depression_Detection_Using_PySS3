Helium asphyxiationIâ€™ve heard itâ€™s a easy way to die. You use a gas mask to inhale the helium. Your body treats the helium like oxygen however because itâ€™s not your body starts to shut down. You initially pass out, which is why the gas mask is needed to ensure you keep breathing the helium in even after you pass out. Your brain starts to die then your organs. Iâ€™ve been researching that it only takes a matter of minutes before itâ€™s irreversible. Iâ€™m waiting for my gas mask and helium tank to arrive. No one has any idea. My mom thinks Iâ€™m a fat failure and I donâ€™t disagree.  My ex thinks Iâ€™m a burden and all my â€œfriendsâ€ are just people who Iâ€™ve crossed pastyâ€™s with. My father was the closest person to love me for who I am, but he died 8 years ago. I have no true friends that care about me. I donâ€™t have family I know more than a stranger on the street. Iâ€™m just waiting for my packages to arrive and off to freedom I go. Iâ€™m sorry if this sounds selfish, but I promise Iâ€™m saving the world from the misery I bring. I lived a lie for so long until I realized when I needed help I stood alone. If I asked for help I would be ridiculed. Treated as incompetent. I am not incompetent when I put my mind to it. 10 more days until freedom.
