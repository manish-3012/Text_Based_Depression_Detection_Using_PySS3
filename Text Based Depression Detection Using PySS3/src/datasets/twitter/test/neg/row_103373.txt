Why can't i just stop being a leech...My family, friends, and people in life help, despite being a leech to them, not giving much back to nothing. Why can't i just stop getting money out of their wallets to support me and just let me have just nothing. All i do to them is be a pesky bug, i should have never met my best friend, otherwise i have would have become friends with other people and leech off them. I just want to end this year with me cutting myself off from everyone and then end it so no one could care about after wards...
