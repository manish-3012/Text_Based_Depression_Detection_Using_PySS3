Being dead would solve my problemsI'm in so much debt, my job is closing doors for the next few weeks. Mom is getting laid off. Another recession is coming. I'm worried about rent and my credit cards are basically at their limit. I'm immunocompromised so I'm at risk for getting the virus but can't afford to stay home and isolate myself. 

The only reason I haven't killed myself off yet is because I promised my fiance that I wouldn't leave him alone. He's telling me that we have resources and rent covered for a few months but that doesn't help. 

But it's getting harder, if I'm around I'm going to continue using the resources that he could use to survive this mess. 

It feels like the zombie apocalypse is coming and I just don't want to suffer through it. I just want to kill myself before I get bitten.
