Its better to just never have been born and I'm tired of pretending it's not. Even on good days I think it would have been better to never have been born. Life is just work and struggle and burden. Many people take those things and forge themselves into a better person out of them. The strong, or just the deluded maybe. I don't know. It doesn't matter. I'm not sure if I can speak for anyone else, but I can surely speak for myself, I've had a pretty good life compared to most people, but when I look around I think 0, nothing, nullity would be preferable, easier, better. I don't think I'm delusional to think this way, disillusioned, sure. What I'm trying to say is that I think this is a perfectly valid point of view, and believing such doesn't make me sick, or broken or insane.
