hi.Im not even gonna do this on an alt, i just dont care anymore.

I have no one to go to now. My online also suicidal girlfriend whom ive been trying to help isn't responding to my texts after she got angry after i told her about one time i got harassed by a girl.
She thinks i wanted her to harass me and that i could just have pushed her away from me and had avoided it. 
well until yesterday i had her to talk to. i knew she didn't judge me and my fucked up narcissistic thoughts and twisted sense of logic.
Well now shes not there. i hope shes gonna come back but idk.

Thats why i turn to reddit.
I always lurk, i never post or comment anywhere. i dont wanna embarrass myself or say something wrong.
Thats also why i dont know if ill even press post on this post

Well do you wanna hear a bit about my girlfriend?
well you're reading this so i guess you do. She has OCD. She hasn't been diagnosed but she has it. no doubt. She has images in her head. compulsions, intrusive thoughts. That basically means she has extremely detailed pics in her head of accidents where she is in or someone she loves is in. And then she feels like those images are 150% gonna happen if she doesn't do X thing Y amount of times. And to her, it's so fucking real. it feels so real to her its insane. I got her to go to see a therapist and she told the therapist about her "rituals" she had to do to feel okay. 
That bitch of a thearpist responded with "Oh everyone has those. Thats a totally normal teenage thing to do. i have these rituals that i have to do in order to feel like im doing okay at the exam"
LIKE BITCH PLEASE. the therapist basically repeated what her mom had told her. in short "Don't worry that's totally normal".
I forgot to mention. She cuts. Her legs are covered in scars.
She didn't cut before I met her around 2 years ago on overwatch.
She now tells me she doesn't cut anymore because she knows how much it hurts me that she does. I don't believe she has stopped cutting. She just says so because she doesn't want me to worry.
Shes 16 and lives in Bulgaria with an alcoholic dad and a mom who says she's fine and everything she's feeling is normal.
I'm 16 and live in Denmark.
She and I have never met despite what I tell my friends(Hello to them if they are reading)
Now to me. Whats my story?
What is behind u/Kafkahead_peaks.
For starters my amazing reddit username is a combination of 3 things i love. Franz Kafka, Radiohead and Twin peaks. Interesting right? ive always wanted to tell that to someone. which is pretty pathetic if you ask me. Why do i wanna tell people what my fucking username means?
idk.

Well my story is that i live in Copenhagen Denmark, speak Danish natively (That's also why my English is quite shit)
My dad works 10-12 hours a day at his regular job. He's the boss of 200+ people. 
My mom is a researcher in some shit I don't understand anything about.
We also have a family company which my dad and I work on on the side.
so my dad works literally 15-17 hours a day.
But all that means we're in the top 1% of wealth wise
Am i bragging now? idk I don't mean it as bragging. I just say it to make you the reader understand a bit more about me.
Well im numb. i feel nothing. im the polar oppesite of my girlfriend. Shes scared, has anxiety attacks. Has irrational fears. hates herself. she has so many strong emotions.
I have nothing.
I feel nothing anymore.
I'm starting to get the same death images in my head as my girlfriend. But i feel nothing about them. they dont scare me
they're just there, flashing through my head like "Oh there is my mom lying dead on the floor, okay that's fine I guess"
they don't affect me. I feel nothing.
I dont hate myself.
I dont love myself.
I don't see myself as anything special. I'm just empty
I have the emptiest of feelings.
I fucking hate to say this but.
if everybody i know died tomorrow. i wouldn't feel anything
If my girlfriend killed herself I wouldn't feel anything
I'm numb to everything.
So yeah that's me.
An insignificant bisexual teenage boy.
