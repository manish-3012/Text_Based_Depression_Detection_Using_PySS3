Living with the urge.The first time I ever wanted to kill myself was middle school. I was overwhelmed by work, girls made fun of me, my grades were awful. I told my parents about how stressed I was, the talk they gave me was "If this is too much for you, then just wait for the real world." 

My conclusion was "Alright, if that's the case, suicide is my best option." 

I obviously didn't do it then (Unless ouijia boards have internet connection, woooooo) and I still haven't done it. My mom got me a therapist I saw throughout my teen years, haven't seen the lady in years but she definitely helped. I was an angry, frustrated, suicidal teen. I'm turning 20 this year. I guess since puberty is basically over, I'm a little more emotionally stable, but some nights I still feel the urges. Come on Tom, do it, end it, etc. I have several guns in the house, most of them my dad's but two of them are mine. I often remove my firing pins when I feel especially sad, basically making sure if I wanna finally end it, I'll have time to snap out of it. 

I don't think my urge to die will ever truly go away. It isn't as strong as it used to be, but it's still here. I'm unemployed, I'm unmotivated, and women still don't love me. I'm trying to fix these problems, but as I mull it over, I hear that little suggestion again. That permanent solution. Anyone else like this? Living with this awful temptation that, no matter how weak it gets, never seems to go away completely? How do you deal with it?
