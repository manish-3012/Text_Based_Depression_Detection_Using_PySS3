How to stay happy?I have posted on here several times before. Each time, I have been talked out of killing myself. However, I am tired of being talked out of it. I want to either stop being miserable, or just die. I recently quit my job at McDonalds because it was making me more suicidal than ever and have been going to college. I am scared of my horrible grades, as I think I may go on academic probation. After that, I will have large student loans pilled up on my head, no job, and no way to ever get a job that isn't a dead end job that makes me want to kill myself. Therefore, I have decided if I go on probation, I'll kill myself. I have gotten obsessed with the idea of death lately. I think about what death would be like and ways I could quickly die about 70% of the day. What is bothersome to me, is that other people who have the same situation, or even worse situations, are able to stay happy. This is frustrating to me, not because these people are happy, but because I feel like I am completely missing something that these people are. Is it genetic? Is it a mindset? If it is either, how could we ever change our mindsets or genetics, after all, we are who we are.



TL;DR I am extraordinarily unhappy because of many situations, and am likely going to kill myself at the end of the semester unless I can find a way to stay happy. I am tired of being talked out of it, this is a final decision. Instead, I want advice to be happy.
