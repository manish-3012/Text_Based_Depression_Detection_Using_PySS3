Iv posted a few times about how i have given myself a month to live. its now two weeks left and i want to leave an update every day now until then.Day 1: 
I have failed.
Today i found out after all i have done and all i am doing that i have already lost. In one week exactly i may have the only possible chance for me to make things right on the weekend. only 2 and a half days but the chances are practically zero. i have felt this way before and was able to work things out but this time i know it really may not work. after that the following week that is inevitable i will commit suicide as i will not be able to deal with it anymore. i am tired of fighting, so very tired, i have nothing left to give but my life now...i apologize for being vague but it is best if i am.
I will always love you.
