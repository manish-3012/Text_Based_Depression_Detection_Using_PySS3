I feel patheticEven though Iâ€™m staying with people I like and doing things Iâ€™d typically like to do, I still feel sad. I feel so pathetic that the only thing keeping me from killing myself is my cat. It makes me feel even worse when thinking about suicide or death because of it. Heâ€™d be devastated if I left him. Iâ€™ve been away from home for a few days and we both miss each other a lot. When Iâ€™m away he always sits at the window waiting for me to come home and it makes me feel terrible thinking about how much he misses me now. He might feel like he had done something wrong and me leaving is punishment. I wish I didnâ€™t feel or think as much as I do.
