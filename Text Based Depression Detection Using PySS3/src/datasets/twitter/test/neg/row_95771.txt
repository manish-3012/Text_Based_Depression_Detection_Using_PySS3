I feel suicidal but Iâ€™m not at the same timeHey guys, so Iâ€™ve had a very rough two years and a difficult upbringing in general. Iâ€™m 21, in college, and failing miserably.

Iâ€™m not interested in the work and just refuse to do it for whatever reason. Even when I try to, I canâ€™t bring myself to finish any assignment. I do exceptionally well on all my exams, I failed a class for not doing the busy work despite a 99 on the final, 95 on the one midterm, and 95 on the other midterm, and a 95 on one of the term essays.  While the class averages for those were all low 70s to low 80s. I didnâ€™t finish the second paper because I lost interest. My professor said my draft was amazing and he couldnâ€™t ask for much more besides elaborating one one topic. I never revised nor submitted it and my attendance was 20% so I failed. This has been a common trend for three years, and I canâ€™t get over it. Everything seems pointless. Why do busy work when I grasp topics and do well, Iâ€™d rather fail. Itâ€™s irrational and I understand that, but I donâ€™t know how to fix it. 

I have a therapist and am on antidepressants and both seem to have made strides in my mood and happiness. Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m generally happy, or maybe numb most of the time. Not sad. I get enjoyment out of things that I didnâ€™t for a while, and a lot of the issues in my life donâ€™t bother me anymore. My family is a train wreck; my mother tried committing suicide over a dozen times in the last two years, which led me me having her hospitalized 16 times. She lost her house, job, etc. My siblings moved in with family and assumed guardianship of them. Iâ€™ve been paying for a storage locker for all her belongings since May but itâ€™s going into foreclosure today, I canâ€™t afford to keep it up anymore. 

Iâ€™m also broke. Defaulted in every account I own and my car will likely be repossessed by the bank soon. In the deep depression I fell into as a result of assuming the role of parent, and worrying about everyone but me my whole life due to alcoholic parents and younger siblings, and especially the last two years due to my mothers instability, I stopped caring about me completely. Couldnâ€™t work, took a year off school, ran through my money, and let my bills pile up. They didnâ€™t seem to matter, nothing did. I finally got help in May and started therapy and meds, and now that Iâ€™m in a good place the gravity of my lack of responsibility for myself has set in. Iâ€™m set to lose everything I have, and I have no where to turn. 

Thatâ€™s where the odd part of the suicidal thoughts come in. Iâ€™m generally happy, no one sees anything off with me and everyone comments that I seem the best Iâ€™ve been in years. But I feel like itâ€™s the deepest facade Iâ€™ve put on yet. Iâ€™m constantly worrying about me for once. When will I lose my car, when are the banks going to go to court, where will I live next year, how am I going to support myself now that Iâ€™ve ruined my credit. I feel like my mothers instability ruined mine that Iâ€™ve had my whole life, and that everyone thinks I still have. When Iâ€™m alone; the only way out I can think is suicide. Iâ€™d rather die than lose all of the beautiful things that I own; that I hold on to as to give me a sense of normalcy. I canâ€™t hide behind my things anymore, canâ€™t put on this appearance of grandiosity even though my mother hasnâ€™t been able to provide it for years now. 

When Iâ€™m distracted, away from my apartment at school, visiting family or going on trips with other people, I forget. Iâ€™m happy again and I wouldnâ€™t want to give up my life for anything. But every time I come back to reality and realize how far Iâ€™ve fallen from trying to keep everyone else up, I just want to run away. 

I want to discuss this with my therapist, because itâ€™s just a though of escaping for good, not any strong intention yet. But I donâ€™t want to disappoint her either, and also donâ€™t want her to overreact. Iâ€™m not sure if this is the proper place to vent, just wanted to get it off my chest.
