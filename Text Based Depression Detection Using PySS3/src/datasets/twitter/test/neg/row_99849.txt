I'm sorry. I can't do this anymore. And nobody cares. I wish I had died when I tried it last year. I'm gonna do it tonightI can't keep doing this. I'm in intense pain that is preventing me from even reaching to anything. I tried to externalize things. I tried to see if I could make myself happy by making other people happy, so I started a youtube channel. I started writing and drawing for people. But according to people, my channel is crap and my writing isn't good. So I'm a good for nothing waste of space then. 


I tried to push through each day even when I was unhappy, but nobody cares. If I were gone, nothing would change. Nothing would fucking change. Everybody would love on like it was normal because I have no effect on anybody's life. I can't even make a ripple into anybody's life. 


I got torn apart yesterday for what I'm creating by people on reddit. Nothing I create is good, it seems. Nothing I do is good. Nobody cares about me. So today, I'm going to commit suicide. I'm going to finally get something right: my death. I want to die and I will do it tonight. And nobody will care. Life will go on as normal. 


I will kill myself tonight.
