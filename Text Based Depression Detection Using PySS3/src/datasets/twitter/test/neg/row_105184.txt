Tired of this shitI really thought things would get better. I really thought that things would progress past high school. Iâ€™m lonely, sad, and absolutely fucking heartbroken. It seems like when one small thing goes well for me, everything else falls apart. I feel like a burden on everyoneâ€™s lives, and I feel like an asshole to my family. Iâ€™m working so hard to become financially independent so I can stop being a drain on them. They donâ€™t deserve to have dealt with my bullshit.
I have struggled with severe mental illness for nearly 10 years now, been hospitalized a couple times after eating disorders, self harm, and suicide attempts. If it were up to me, I would erase myself from everyoneâ€™s memory, lock myself in a room, and drink and drug myself to death. But people donâ€™t want me to give up.
It just seems selfish and unfair that I canâ€™t just fucking die without hurting people. All I want to do right now is die. All I want to do is die.
