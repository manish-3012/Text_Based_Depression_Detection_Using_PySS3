Reddit Suicide NoteThis is for when I kill myself this is addressing the great Reddit Friends. So I'll begin with u/ben_86 you've been an amazing friend but im as weak as a person gets trust me I flinch at everything I'm terrified of dogs I'm just screwed up in the head. u/slickspider you're also an amazing friend since you live on another continent you were awake when I needed some questions answered. u/sweater_spaghetti thanks for being an amazing boyfriend and staying friends after we broke up. u/angelinwhite you were an amazing friend up until the end with all the accusations.
