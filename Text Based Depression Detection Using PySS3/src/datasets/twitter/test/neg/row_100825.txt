im so tired...divorced after 9 years of marriage.....i finally got the courage to date again after two years of dating she wanted to get married but left me at the alter....this heart break is killing me, literally . ive been in and out of the hospital the past 3 weeks bc my body is giving up, i dont want to die but i dont think its my choice now.
