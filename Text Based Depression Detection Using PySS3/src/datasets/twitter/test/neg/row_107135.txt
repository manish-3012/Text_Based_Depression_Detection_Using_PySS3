No One Gives A Fuck About Me, Not Even RedditWomen hate me, everyone hates me. No one cares, yet always constantly remind me how pathetic I am. What's the fucking point in being nice anymore? No one gives a fuck anyway, maybe I could set an example like Elliot Rodger did? At least he will be remembered. People are so pathetic, selfish &amp; self-serving, I fucking hate this planet.
