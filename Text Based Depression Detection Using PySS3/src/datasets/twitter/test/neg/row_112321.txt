Counseling.So frustrated right now. After I was hospitalized I had my firearms taken from me by the local sheriffâ€™s office. I was never charged with anything and I never lost my right to own firearms. Iâ€™ve been trying to get my firearms back, which has been a living nightmare. They orginally told me to go to counseling and have the counselor sign off and send them a letter to get my weapons back. So I did that just to be told I either need to get a court order to get my property back (300 dollars or so btw) or have an actual psychiatrist sign off on my mental state. So I just did 4 months of regular counseling for nothing.

Bureaucracy frustrates me to no end. I can go and buy a brand new firearm right now without any issue, but I canâ€™t get my already owned property back without going through hoops. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m being punished for being depressed in the past and getting caught.
