I'm just lost.I'm in a terrible spot in my life. I've just been hit by a car a few weeks back and suffered an injury that's stopping me from working. This has lead me to the worst financial position I've ever reached in my life. It's at the breaking point in a few days. 

I have the most amazing woman in my life that I feel like I truly don't deserve and frankly feel like a huge burden as of recently. We just got in an "argument" (moreso I'm a fucking idiot) and it's quiet at this point.. but clearly I've fucked up. It's overwhelming to think that I've hurt the most incredible, kind, and supporting woman. 

I'm just at a loss and for the first time in years I've been having suicidal thoughts. I just don't know how to cope with things right now.
