I don't understand why!All I've ever wanted was to be loved. I thought I had that for awhile, marriage, two beautiful children for whom I would do it all over again. After 18 years I could no longer pretend that everything was jolly. My husband worked away from home a lot and used that time to act as if he were still single. The kids and I were more of an inconvenience for him than anything. After being out of that relationship for a year I thought I was ready for another. I was lonely and had doubts that anyone would want to change that. When a man came along, online, and told me everything I wanted to here I hung on for fear I may never find anyone else to want me. That was a short lived relationship but long enough to drive a wedge between my children and myself. I will never forgive myself for that. Since then I have realised that I am quite capable and don't need a man in order to survive. My children have come back to me but I can't help thinking there is a scar that will never heal between us. I have had some interaction as far as relationships go however, they have never lasted. One fellow who had been visiting for a few months/year, told me I was an amazing, beautiful woman that he wished he'd met twenty years earlier, then he just faded away. That's what they seem to do, fade away never to be seen again. I am not a demanding woman, I'm easy going. I don't like to argue but I do have strong beliefs and opinions which I can defend, but I don't expect a man to think the same as I do about everything. If you're attracting the wrong type change what you're doing right? I have never pretended to be someone I'm not just to hold attention. I am me, honest, good communicator, I have a sense of humour and can see the positive in most things and people. Yet here I sit, alone. I can tell myself what a wonderful person I am and that if I like myself first others will also. It doesn't happen. Right now I feel like I'm old, overweight, ugly and not wanted by anyone. That's a damn lonely place to live. 
I've suffered with depression for many years and have been getting help with that. I am able to keep on a smoother path, only the occasional pothole which doesn't turn into a bottomless pit anymore, but I never seem to be able to climb up to see over the horizon either. I tend to self sabotage when I do go to the doctor, I have never wanted to be one to complain or give the poor me vibe, so I down play how I do feel most of the time. 
Is there any hope of me getting myself out of this rut? I tell myself once this crisis is over thing will be better but there is always another crisis! Is a struggle to get out of bed most days because I can't see where things are getting better so why even bother. What's the point? My kids could do just fine without me, in fact they take care of me more than the other way around and that makes me feel like a burden. No, I haven't felt suicidal for many years but I don't understand why everything has to take so much effort. I have to fight for everything. Nothing ever comes easy or simple. Why? Why me?
