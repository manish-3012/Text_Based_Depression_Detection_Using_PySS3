My mother is making me feel bad for getting helpSo, about a month ago, when I was feeling especially suicidal, I decided enough was enough, and, needing someone to talk to, I went to go see my next door neighbor. She was very accepting and willing to help me.

At the time, my parents weren't home, but while I was talking to my neighbor (this was in front of her house, by the way), my parents came back. 

Ever since then, my mom has been making fun of me for wanting to get help. She's been cracking jokes about me "crying on the sidewalk", and it's not exactly making my depression any better.
