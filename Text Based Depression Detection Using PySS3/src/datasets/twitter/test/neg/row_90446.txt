Any way to talk to somebody professional for no/low cost?I'm starting to think the frequency that I romanticize killing myself is approaching unhealthy. Starting to think I should talk to somebody trained in this sort of shit but don't want to burn through what little funds I have and be broke faster. I'm in the US.
