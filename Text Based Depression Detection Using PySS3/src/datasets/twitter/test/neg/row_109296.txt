its hard to figure out what you want to leave behindwhen you don't know that you're really leaving anything behind. maybe it all vanishes when I do.

maybe I'm just doing this for me. I'm using this as a way to work through things. maybe it'll all be gone when I go, but I'll have tied up every end in my mind.

thank you for listening. goodnight.
