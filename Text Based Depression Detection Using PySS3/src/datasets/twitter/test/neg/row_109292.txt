Not Urgently Close, But Need Wisdom/To VentI've had a major mental shift the past few days that's brought me away from the brink, but I spend a lot of time thinking about past mistakes and holding onto pain, and I feel like I'm talking to my loved ones about it too much, not respecting their space or being able to resume normal relationships with them. So I'd just like to vent here and welcome any thoughts on my situation, if anybody cares enough to read a massive ramble.

I'm a 24M with a history of suicidal tendencies, mostly from taking mistakes and major life changes way too hard and never letting go of them and moving on. Recently, my girlfriend of 7 years broke up with me. She had her reasons, and we talked through things, but she was vague about whether she wanted to break up for good, or just during the current semester so she could focus on her schoolwork and adjust her life a little. 

We were in a poly relationship with another couple who were very close friends. We had been romantically involved with them for about 2 years now, and when we broke up, the group thing got confusing. The other couple is married, so their relationship wasn't affected, but my ex and I each remained close to them, and everyone's feelings are still being sorted out. For now, my remaining girlfriend, the wife, and my boyfriend, the husband, remain romantically inclined towards me, but a little more distant and sort of....recovering. I haven't had any sort of sexual contact with either of them for quite so time, for other reasons that I'll go into later. But I do go over to their place a couple times a week, cuddle and kiss and hang out and we all remind each other how much we love each other.

I feel that my current mental state is burdening them, pushing them away. As I said, I've been much healthier this past week, but I had been having breakdowns almost daily, and I was constantly coming to them to talk about my latest thoughts and feelings. I feel that I'm not able to give the relationship time to heal, and I'm constantly afraid that it will fall apart or fade away because I couldn't relax and give up my desperation to see them all the time. It's not made any better by my near obsessiveness with hearing from them; I have very little schoolwork and my job only gives me 9 hours on the weekends. I have a lot of free time to sit around and wish they could talk to me, but they work extremely hard at a lot of things.

My girlfriend has her own problems. She's struggled with depression and anxiety for years, and has never had a significant sex drive. This has always worked well for the group, since I also have a low sex drive, while my ex and boyfriend fuck like rabbits. However, I do have a very strong emotional need for sex, and lately she has been on meds that completely inhibit her libido. Her husband is in a rough spot, because my ex has been pretty distant to him, and for me it adds another layer of worry about the relationship. How can I tell whether our lack of sex is from the meds or from our relationship being "downgraded"? What if she simply doesn't feel that way about me any more? I don't need to have sex with her, I could be perfectly happy the rest of my life being romantically close and celibate; but I'm scared of the symbolism, of the inability to decipher where our relationship is and whether it's healing.

Well, a couple weekends ago, my depression and emotional instability kicked in on overdrive and I was lucky to wake up the next morning. I was texting my ex; we had stayed in casual contact, and while at work I inquired about her day, she mentioned a scholarship, I asked how that was going, etc. She stopped answering my questions, I went back to work. Several hours later I was home, watching tv and having my nightly drink, and asked if she'd missed my last couple texts. No answer. I asked if she was ok. No answer. I asked if she was ignoring me or angry at me. No answer. I told her I was getting very worried. She responded, saying essentially that "we were broken up now, she didn't have to answer me if she didn't want to". My pent up hurt at being ignored, fear that something had happened to her, emotional issues from the break up, and several stronger emotions held back for years of the relationship, all came out at once. I exploded. Called her a huge dick. Told her that ignoring me was hurtful and that a decent human being would at least take two seconds to tyoe out "I'm busy" or "I can't talk right now" or let someone know they were safe when asked. Texting all of this to her fed my anger, and also made me have even more dangerous emotions: instant guilt and fear, anguish, regret. I started texting apologies and tried to call her. My girlfriend, who had apparently been sitting on the couch with the two of them when my ex had suddenly burtlst into tears, sent me a very angry text telling me I was abusive and threatening to end our friendship. She would not respond to me either. I finally got in touch with my boyfriend. He was stern, serious, dark, and unforgiving. He told me that none of them would be sympathetic to my pain. That neither of the girls would talk to me. That there was no way to fix this and I deserved to feel awful. He told me that it was fine to feel hurt when ignored, but the amount that I felt hurt by it was "invalid", not normal, not reasonable. During our phone conversation, I started drinking my whiskey pretty agressively. We talked until about 3:30am, and he expressed concern for me while maintaining his original tone. I called another friend, mostly drunk at this point, and talked until I had to throw up around 5am or something. I tried to express how much pain I felt to my boyfriend, how I couldn't get past any mistake, and knowing that I'd hurt the three people I love most was too much to bear. But I eventually passed out, and he came by the mext morning. 

He climbed into my bed with me and cuddled me for a while. We talked about a lot of things. He told me that it wasn't as bad as I seemed to think, that he was glad I was still alive, that all three of them still loved me. We talked about all of the relationships. We had talked before about how my ex had been emotionally abusive to me, and how there had been a double standard in how everyone treated me. I said that last night felt like the intense eye-opening extreme of that. I asked how often he had seen my ex abuse me, from 1 to 10. He said about 7. I asked how many of those times were as bad or worse than what I did the night before. He said most of them. I asked how many times they had reacted to her that way; had his wife ever threatened to stop being her friend? Had he ever talked to her the way he talked to me? Had everyone ever stopped talking to her? He said no. I told him that I felt singled out, held to an impossible standard, and I felt like the pain she had caused me by ignoring me was completely discounted or considered worthless. Well, our moral debate on whether it's ok to ignore someone even if it causes them emotional pain continued for several days, but my underlying point, my feeling of being treated unfairly, he agreed with. None of this made me feel any better about what I had done; I knew I had been very, very wrong, I knew I had caused pain, and I knew that nothing justified it and nothing would erase it. The amount of hurt I feel knowing that I hurt the people I love is awful, unlike anything I've ever felt. I've had intractable nerve pain that high doses of Vicodin didn't even touch, and I would take that back in a second to undo this.

I fear that it changed their feelings towards me in ways that will never heal. I went to their place the night after the incident, expecting anger and coldness and being told off. Instead I got hugs and reassurances and therapy. Forgiveness and wisdom and love. But I still feel scarred. I still feel like the relationships are scarred. I feel like my girlfriend is still angry, still disappointed, still scared I might hurt her again. I feel like she loves me less because of what I did, and that she'll never feel the same about me again. My boyfriend acts much more normal towards me, but I still worry that I don't deserve his love or respect anymore.  I haven't spoke to my ex since then. I want to apologize, in person, but I worry that it's too soon or even that she will just never want to talk to me again. 

Most of the day I feel normal again, I can forgive myself and go about my routine and thinking about my partners makes me smile. I text them a couple times a day, saying good morning and maybe flirting a little, and they tend to not answer because they are very busy. I ask if I can come over a lot, I know they'll be busy most nights but I ask just in case. I worry that I'm pushing too hard, and they aren't quite ready for so much attention yet. I worry that they aren't back to where we were before yet, and I don't know if or when we will be. But then when I go over, we're all very physical and emotional and intimate and I feel much more secure.

One thing I worry about is becoming a better partner. What I want from our relationship, eventually, is to be a very important part of their lives. I want to be supportive, and helpful, and make them happy. I feel like I'm not good at any of those things, except that I like to do chores for them when I'm there. I never know what to say to make them happy, and they don't come to me to talk or open up when I try to offer a shoulder. They don't invite me over, and my girlfriend doesn't initiate (or usually respond to) conversations. She's busier than anybody I know, and very introverted, so I don't blame her for that and I try not to be upset about it. I know that I can't be a replacment for either of them, they've been together much longer, and have a mich deeper emotional connection. I'm fine with that; the world doesn't revolve around me. So I feel like I have a healthy outlook on that at least. But I still feel like what I do want is a pipe dream, and I never make any progress on improving myself. I think in terms like "never" even though it's been maybe three weeks. I'm not good at waiting or thinking long-term.

A few days ago I walked out of my lab because I felt close again, and went to the school counselors. I talked with a lady for a while, and it was mostly just me pouring out things that had happened or thoughts I was having and her nodding and writing down notes. But when I left, I had a completely different perspective that's difficult to put into words. I realized how to take a step back from all my friends and loved ones without discounting their support. I realized that nothing that could happen in the future would undo the happiness and memories with my partners. I felt more aware of my issues, and less like an outside observer who was just looking at them; now I understood them, internalized them, I knew I could fix them with the right help. I've felt better ever since, still broken but not in danger. I knew I would have bad days, like today, but I just need to vomit the thoughts out again, and I wanted to find a different audience than my loved ones, and give them some breathing room. I wanted to get this out, and then go back to behaving normally with them so that we can all start moving forward together again. I still don't like waiting for things to get better, and I'm still terrified of the future; and despite learning how to forgive myself, my actions and words still haunt me. But I know now that staying stuck in the past and letting my breakdowns control me will keep my relationship stuck as well, and possibly harm it. Instead, I want to move on and let my partners help me get better. I was worried about being too unhealthy for a relationship to be fair to them, and torn between the idea that people who love each other should be able to help each other through anything; and I think my recent attitude change is the difference between the two ideas. If I was unwilling to move forward, if every day was going to be breakdowns over the same thing and Ibwas making no effort to change, I wouldn't be able to maintsin a healthy relationship with them. But now I feel like, even though I'm broken, they will stand by me and help me heal and continue to love me.

I started all of this rambling at the pit of suffering from the incident mentioned above. Remembering how I felt, how much I hurt everyone, how afraid I was that I'd ruined everything and how sure I was that I was a horrible person. I'm ending it feeling broken but loved, and hopeful about the future. For now at least, I have people who love me very deeply, and they aren't going anywhere.
