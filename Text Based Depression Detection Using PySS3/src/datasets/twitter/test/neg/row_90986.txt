i am only 15 years old and already tired**bad english warning** Alright. I know what you thinking right now. You are probably thinking that im just an attention whore, or that i feel like that because i hit puberty, the time where you meet your first problems. But i dont think thats the case. Here's my story. So i moved to another country a year and a half ago. I had to learn a new language, go to a new school and find new friends. i did not manage to do those things due to my social anxiety and being alone everyday made me depressed. Im wondering why im keep trying since everyday is the same. why am i even living? when i think about it im always thinking about suicide. But i dont really want to do it cause i dont have the balls to experience such a painful thing. But if i dont do it im gonna be depressed for life. i am going to school to get a job and earn money to feed myself but i dont feel thats worth doing when im already tired of waking up at 7 am everyday. What do you think? Is it just puberty? thanks for your time
