I have 5 people left who care about me. I'm wondering how I can lessen the blow when I do it.It sucks that there's no suicide subreddit for people who are set on committing suicide, rather than a peer support group, but I guess this is the closest thing (it's very lovely though). I've made up my mind. It's my older sister's birthday today and honestly, I'm waiting until after midnight so she can enjoy today. I only have around $2500, too.
