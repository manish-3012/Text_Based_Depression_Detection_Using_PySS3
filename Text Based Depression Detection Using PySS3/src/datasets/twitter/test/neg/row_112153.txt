I feel like typing this all out will make things better.I've had suicidal thoughts for about two long years now.  Only once have I came very close to doing it, but not having the appropriate materials stopped me.  I feel a thousand times worse looking at this subreddit and seeing people who fear cancer thinking about suicide, and having problems the universe times bigger than mine.  I've had this friend, James, we'll call him, for the course of me being depressed.  Sometimes he helped me through it, sometimes he made it worse.  Recently James and I have been very distant, he got a new group of friends, and I've been left with no one.  After finally breaking down and missing my best friend, I tried talking it out with him, telling him how much I really miss how close we were and how without him my depression only gets a thousand times larger.  All he said were that things change, we changed, and that we will never be as close as we were.  I pleaded him to just talk it out with me, he simply ignored my messages and gave the point clear across that he did not want to associate himself with me.  I hate sounding like this, but honestly Reddit, I'm finally at my breaking point.  I'm ready to finally stop living, and I feel like it will relieve everything.  All the pain in the world will simply fall.  And again, I cannot express how sorry I am for everyone who actually has something to be suicidal for, if I could stop these bad feelings I would, but my mental condition is so terrible.  Before I write notes to the few loved ones I have, all I wanna do is talk to you guys.
