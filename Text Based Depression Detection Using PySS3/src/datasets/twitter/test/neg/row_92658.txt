Advice Coping With a loss/inching towards suicidal thoughts myselfI won't go into much detail, but I'm coping with a sudden loss. This person was a huge part of my life and everything I see and do reminds me of them in some way. Everything I would normally use as a distraction is something I would spend time playing with them or something I've been wanting to do with them. I can't escape and it feels like I'm drowning, grasping for air where there's just more water. I'm slowly losing grasp on myself and inching closer to losing it all. I need some advice, something to keep my mind from fading. Suggestions from people who have been through similiar situations. If I don't end up committing suicide, the amount of stress my body is enduring might take me instead.
