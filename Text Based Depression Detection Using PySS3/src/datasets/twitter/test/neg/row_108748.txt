I think I sexually assaulted someone, I don't know if I can do this anymore.Hello. I want to keep this short, but I'm a F(just turned 20) I had my birthday party a few days ago, and got entirely drunk off my mind. I blacked out woke up the next day, recovered and all was well. I got a call from my ex (who was at the party) and they said my friend told him that I was in the bed inappropriately touching her, and that it made her uncomfortable by it and that I threw myself onto another guy after doing that, until I eventually wandered home(in my apt complex) and went to sleep. I don't want to say any excuses, but I feel so ashamed and I don't know if I can live, I don't know how my friend or the guy is feeling about it, but I can't breathe, or think, or do anything besides cry my eyes out. I feel like an absolute disgusting monster and I don't know what to do about it. I'm not asking for help, but just to vent. I called my friend to apologize and she won't answer me, I feel like I ruined their lives and I just can't believe I would do something like that. Do I turn myself in? I'm just spiraling into an abyss.
