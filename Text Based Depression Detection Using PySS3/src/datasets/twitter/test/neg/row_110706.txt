If you haven't a drive license, you can't get a jobIt's good to know that diplomas are useless to find work. Just wait, get a driver license and boom... you'll find a job easy. Fuck this world. I wasted my life going to school with very good classmates (ironyy). 5 years for a useless degree and now I finally understand that you can just wait, get your license and a car and you can finally live your life peacefully without people who look at you like a poor shit. Well I can't afford a driver license and I'm unemployed. If I can't find a job I'll kill myself. Sorry but I have to vent somewhere where people I know can't read. Good day to everyone
