I'm a toxic human being and I can't stop myself.I have hurt so many creatures in the past, creatures that couldn't defend themselves. Human and animals alike. I do not deserve love, I do not deserve forgiveness. I deserve to be punished in the most severe way a person can be punished.

I need to die. I need to die so that I stop fucking everything up for everyone else. I need to die so that innocent beings are no longer hurt. 

I destroy everything I touch.
