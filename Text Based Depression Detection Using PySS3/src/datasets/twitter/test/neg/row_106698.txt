Don't really feel like going on anymore.This is the first time on Reddit for me, somebody linked me to this place so I guess I could give it a try...

I'm 18 and basicly I've been depressed for about 4/5 years now.
I guess the depression started because my dad used to hit me, I got bullied at school, got a mild form of autism (Although it's barely noticable anymore).

I can handle those things and don't really mind them as much as before, but I dropped out of school like 3 years ago and never really got back into it. School is way too exhausting for me now. I also tried to do simple packaging work but even then I constantly get panic attacks for whatever reason...

Sometimes I feel like I don't even want to feel good, as if I just don't -want- to go to school, and just make it exhausting for myself. And at work force panic attacks...

So my main problem here is that I feel like I don't have a future at all, since I can't get an education or income.

That's what makes me feel like I should start cutting again, to destract myself from feeling hopeless. I mean I've been depressed for so long now. People keep telling it gets better, but I hope you can see how that feels like a broken promise after all those years.

I do toy with the thought of suicide, but I'm gonna be realistic here and just say I'll probably never do it. I don't have access to anything that makes it end quickly or without too much pain, so that's not gonna happen.

On a final note, I decided to write here at this hour because I keep getting panic attacks, even though I'm at home with no pressure at all except for knowing that I don't really have a future...

So there ya go, I don't really know what to expect from this but I hope I find out soon...
