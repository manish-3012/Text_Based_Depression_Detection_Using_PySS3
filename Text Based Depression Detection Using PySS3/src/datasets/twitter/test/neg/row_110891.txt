I am so tired of this world. Giving up sounds good.I started thinking about the meaning of life very seriously many years ago. The reason man struggles always comes out to the same rehashed answer: love. It's obvious why. Because there really is no other point. Trying to find a permanent happiness in this world is about the only reason most of us wake up in the morning. Love brings happiness to all. It brings happiness to me. But what if the person you are in love with is in love with someone else. What if no matter how badly they treat her she will never let them go. What if, more interestingly, you two love each other but he is the only thing standing in the way and she WILL NOT let him go. Love, at that moment, is ripped from our life and you not only think you wont find love like that again, but don't care to, if it's with anybody else. What then happens to the point of life? It vanishes, leaving you with an endless grind of day-in, day-out that has no purpose. What do you do then? Logically, I have come up with two options that would make things better. One, murder him, of course never letting anybody even know he was gone, letting her come back. Or kill yourself,  and let her be happy with him. It has come down to that , or staring into the abyss of nothingness that would forever be called my "life." What do I do here?
