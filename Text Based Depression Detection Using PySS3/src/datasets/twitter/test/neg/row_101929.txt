Down the rabbit holeHello everyone, 

Not sure why I'm writing here, maybe I want the attention or someone to tell me not to do it. I was not thinking about suicid until last year. Now everytime I look in the mirror I say it out loud "you should kill yourself".. everyhting begun after a session with my therpist in which I discovered some childhood drama. Since then I stopped seeking help and started redering chaos in my life. Today I found myself in the lowest situation that I had ever been. My parents are not talking with me after confrunting them about my childhood, I became alienated of all my friends, and my girlfriend asked me to move out. I'm in huge debt due to my havoc, with 0$ to my account, I'm broken hearted as she was the only one that managed to keep me floating. Last night I almost did it, i started cutting myself and stopped at the tought that I will never have the chance to get my girl back. She knows I'm going trhu a lot at the moment but still insists that I should move out as she needs space and to focus on herself. I ask now, how do I prevent myself from harming myself? I have this moments when everything seems so dark and without escape. At this moment I don't see any plausable scenario in which I will manage to live past this week.
