I'm too dumb for this world.I make stupid mistakes constantly. Just tonight my husband had to go to a different town because I ordered from a pizza place that had the same name as one down the street. Sure, it takes about as long to go there because it's so close, but hearing him call me up while he was outside the place I thought I ordered from and then waiting for my emails to load on my phone and him asking me if I had the receipt email while I was still waiting for it to load just sent me into a dark place. I know he thinks I'm stupid. How could he not? My husband is so damn intelligent and he has never made me feel stupid on purpose. I just feel like an unintelligent person compared to him.

So often I notice my mistakes that wouldn't have been made if I was just paying closer attention. My mind is usually on other things I deem more important like work. When I come home my brain is fried and I can't focus on much. I work as an administrative assistant (just started last week; I do love it, to be quite honest) and when I'm in the office I put all of my energy into my work. Now I'm just a shell at the end of the day. Sometimes it takes me a few moments to grasp what my husband is saying to me or asking me about. I just can't keep up some days. Those days, much like today, make me feel worthless and stupid. I feel like I can't even make sense of simple things.
