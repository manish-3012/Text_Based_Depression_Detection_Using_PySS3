SwimmingItâ€™s strange growing up in a home where youâ€™re fed, loved, and protected, yet still feel that the struggle is simply not worth it. I only had a mother growing up. Her job and my sister, who is severely handicapped, occupied most of her time. My brother and I did not receive much attention. He fell and continues to fall deeper into depression, allowing himself to put on weight (edging past obesity toward morbidity) and let his life a dreams float away. 
When we were young my mother worked hard to find a balance and would bring me or my brother to her work managing an adult day center. The inhabitants of which were all close to the end of life; torn down by decay and illness both physically and mentally. Many of them had lost their family, friends, and eventually their grip on reality. 

Another part of this balancing act involved putting my brother and I through sports to extend the amount of time we were under adult supervision without her. Seeing as most sports are a father son activity, and our father had died, and our mother never remarried or dated again, this too was a strange experience. Until we were put on the swim team, I was 6 yo when I first started. The pool became the only escape I had, and I dove in deep. By the time I was in high school I was breaking records as a freshman, and went on to become our schoolâ€™s first individual state champion in the sport. By my senior year I was training with a girl who went on to Olympic trials and became Katie Ledeckyâ€™s roommate at Stanford. My career was ending though, and I had spent so many hours and sacrificed a lot socially through the process. 

I went to college to study physical therapy, but was unable to shake my dream. I pushed myself harder, hoping that something would come if it. But my grades began to fall, and anxiety set in. I turned to pot, (alcoholism has recked my family, so Iâ€™ve avoided that). This decision was quite harmful though. I had already demonstrated some mood issues through high school, but these became more erratic. I had harbored suicidal thoughts for years. The first time I had tried to kill myself I was 4-6 yo (not entirely sure, I blocked it out for years). In an attempt to meet my diseased father, I locked the bathroom door and laid down on the floor attempting to hold my breath until it was over, but eventually gave up. I pushed these thoughts down for years, and eventually abandoned the notion of an afterlife. 

In college these thoughts once again burst to the surface. I found ways of coping on my own for about a year, but I became afraid of myself. My obsessions turned introspective, and I decided to seek out help. And so began the climb back up. First, it was learning about how to use therapy to find out more about myself. But I could not break free of my addiction, and my support system at home and in the pool fell apart. I returned to school after taking the better part of a year off, dealing with new tragedies close to home. I lost a childhood friend (heroin overdose), and swim coach (random stroke, she was young) at that time. 

I return to school, and once again tried to enter the pool, encouraged by those around me. Swimming was one of the only things the people in my life knew once made me happy. But my mood swings became worse, and my thoughts returned. I discovered that I in fact was struggling with bipolar disorder, worsened by my pot use. My gpa did not make the improvements need to stay in the schoolâ€™s physical therapy program. This Xmas break I lost my spot in the program, and left the swim team. I still thought I could try to make a trials cut going into the semester, but now see that I can become manic and have grandiose ideaâ€™s. There are two sides to the coin. Iâ€™m moving out of the swim teamâ€™s house to get away from the drugs and try to make new social connections outside of the water. Itâ€™s been hard tearing apart my identity and starting over. The pressure in my life has never felt so intense. I donâ€™t want to die right now, but I can see the paths before me now. Some of them end in suicide, and to be honest Iâ€™m scared. Perhaps of failure, or maybe itâ€™s that even if you work hard and make the best decisions life will still throw shit at you. If youâ€™re lucky itâ€™s enough to deal with, but sometimes it just doesnâ€™t stop, and thereâ€™s a fear that it wonâ€™t ever really get much better. 

I want to believe that Iâ€™ll figure out a path to a content existence, but know that it is not guaranteed. How many regrets can I take? How many dreams will I lose? How many compromises will leave me feeling cheated? Before all the self pity has me hating myself, and once again an early end feels unbearably welcome.

As for now I will keep taking my meds, and seeing my therapist. Iâ€™ll keep swimming forward... wherever that is. But Iâ€™ll never shake the fact that death is only a matter of time
