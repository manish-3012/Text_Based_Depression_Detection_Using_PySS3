Things will get betterThis is my third post so itâ€™s kinda like an update. Things have gotten so much better I donâ€™t even believe itâ€™s real. Iâ€™m going on a date with the most beautiful girl in the world, I got a job offer that pays me double the amount Iâ€™m getting payed now, and Iâ€™ve made a new group of friends that treat me well. When people used to say that things would get better I never believed them. Honestly I thought whenever people would say that it would just make it worse, but honestly it eventually will no matter how long it takes. For some people it may take weeks, months, or maybe even years but it will get better trust me.
