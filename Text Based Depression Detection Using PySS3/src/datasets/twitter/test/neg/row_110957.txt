Here we go.Only here because my brain says try this if it fails do it. 

Okay so I have nothing. I am recently single. The script break even song pretty much sums that story up. 

It's not because I am single that I want to die. Never would I give someone the satisfaction of dying on their behalf. I just I want to know if there is an after life. I hate my job, I want to start my own business but I have no clue how. I am a natural born leader (or so they say) and right now I am currently typing so fast that the sound of it is keeping me sane. 

So lets get into it. My name is we'll say Joe. I have always had these thoughts ever since I was little about just offing myself. I don't know if it is genetic because my grandfather killed himself. Growing up I heard my dad say he would just kill himself.  I recently had a Girlfriend. She is a physc major and asked me to go get a personality test done. I did I found out I am an ENTP.  It makes a lot of sense.  I have about 500 idea's an hour and my brain is always racing. However when you have all these idea's you have negative ones. The negitive ones are more frequent. 

My job sucks. I am way to over qualified to do this job. Boss says I am irreplaceable which means im unpromotable. Curse of being good at what I do.  So I decided to start making my own business from scratch.... wrote a business plan (17 pages)  was on the right track. Then my brain just stopped... 

I feel like and I know I am not the first to feel this way and not the last, but why should I continue... It's pointless If I just keep failing and dispointing not only myself but the people around me what's the point. WHAT DO I GET OUT OF THIS. (i get out what I put in obviously)  but why put it in if I am just going to feel this way. 

I don't know what to do ... this is literally my last chance I am giving myself. 

I am sorry in advance ... I have little hopes for reddit.
