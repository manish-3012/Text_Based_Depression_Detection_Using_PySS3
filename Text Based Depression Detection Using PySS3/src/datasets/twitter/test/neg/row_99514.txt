I cant tell anyoneIm trans, im going to therapy to get hormones and surgery cause my fucking country never even heard of informed consent. my therapist asked me if i had suicidal thoughts and i fucking lied in her face.

i dont know what im supposed to do. if i tell her shell probably send me to a hospital and then im gonna be gatekept for another year.

oh cause they think the suicidality is ever gonna get better if i fantasize about taking a fucking chainsaw to my breasts. dysphoria is hell, literal hell, and i dont expect cis people to understand.

but if i dont do anything i know im gonna hang myself soon. my entire life had pretty much gone down the drain already. 

thinking about my transition is the only thing that gives me any hope for the future, even if a disgusting freak like me will never find friends or love anyway.

damned if i do, damned if i dont, huh? 

and of course all the fucking hospitals and the fucking suicide hotline are all run by the fucking catholic church.
