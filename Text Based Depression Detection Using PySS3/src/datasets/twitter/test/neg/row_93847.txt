Help. I feel really down today and I don't know how to fix it or stop it.I am running really low on sleep, which is part of it. I'm in a thought loop about someone who was supposed to care about me but doesn't. I don't want to go out to to a party and drink, but I don't want to stay at home all day because I'm going stir crazy. I can't stop crying and I feel like shit. I think I lost an awesome job. I don't want to talk to anyone because a lot of them are tired of me or act like I'm too much.

I haven't been here in such a long time. Why am I spiraling...? Why can't I be stronger, happier?
