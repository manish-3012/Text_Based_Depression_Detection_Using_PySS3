A message to my familyThrowaway for obvious reasons but I'm leaving my username for my family. See, here's the thing. All I've ever wanted in my life is to be loved. To love and feel loved in return. And I don't mean family or friends. I mean a real love. I've had sex with so many guys. I've had relationships. I've come close. So close. But I'll never be quite enough. It's never enough. I'll never be enough. I love my family, as fucked up as they are. But they're just not enough. Nothing is enough. I'm not sad about this decision. I'm not angry or upset. This is best. I've changed names for discretion. They will know who they are.

Mom, I love you. But you should have chosen me over him, no matter what. No man would tell me I can't see my kids. I'm sorry you didn't feel the same.

Grandma, you owe me an apology. I admitted I was wrong, shame you couldn't do the same. I'll never forgive you for judging me. You're not perfect. Stop pretending to be.

Fancy, thank you for giving me a job and stability, but you were wrong to judge my mother. Until you walk a mile in her shoes, watch your mouth. Your money will buy you everything you want in this life...but you're not promised anything in the next life.

Daffy, you ruined my childhood. I was a kid. You were the adult. I lied to myself long enough - it was rape.

Dad, I'm sorry I didn't get to know you. You were the missing piece in my life. You're a good man.

Kid. I'm so sorry. I know you're going to feel like this is your fault. It's not. I know you're going to feel like you should have been there. You were. And I know your depression is going to get worse. Don't let it. You fight this. You show the world. Show your parents and your friends. Show yourself. You are so much stronger than I ever was. You are so much more than I was ever going to be. You are going to make it out of this alive. You are going to be everything I couldn't be and more. You're going to do it. You're going to make it. And I love you. I love you and nothing will ever, ever change that.

So put on your mask. Pretend your life is perfect. The elephant in the room can haunt you forever. But not me. Not anymore.
