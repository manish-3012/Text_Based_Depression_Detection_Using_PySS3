The only thing keeping me from ending it is that i don't want to die a virginI'm 23, never had a girlfriend, I have been on 2 dates in my life, one just last week. I thought it went great and that I might actually have a chance, she even gave me her number and her face book but recently she has just gone dead silent on me.

I'm just so tired of being so alone. I can't approach women, no woman would ever want me to be around her.

I'm just ready to be done with it. I have a friend who had a very close friend kill himself and it destroyed her and I would hate to do that to her too. not to mention the rest of my Friends and family.

But I just don't see a point anymore. I'm never going to have a girlfriend I don't see a point in life if I can never be in love.
