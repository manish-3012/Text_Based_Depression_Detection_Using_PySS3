The last summer of my lifeThe summer of 2018 will be the last summer of my life. I would already kill myself however im going to a different school next fall and I have a little bit of hope that things will change though I'm very well aware of the fact they wont. For every day of this summer I'm going to get wasted since that's the only thing that makes me feel good. It's going to be so easy to commit suicide knowing that no one will truly miss me. The world is so unfair and evil, why can't I be one of those people that are allowed to live a long, happy life? If I just had a normal childhood maybe I wouldn't have turned out to be such a fuck up. Or maybe it was written in my genes, I don't know. I will forever be bitter about it. I wish I could experience true happiness. I wish I didn't have to cry myself to sleep alone every single night. I wish I had real friends. I wish people treated me well. Actually just treating me like I'm an actual person would be enough. I wish I had someone to talk to about my problems. But I won't have any if these things. Ever. Because in ~4 months I'll be dead. And maybe I'll finally have peace.
