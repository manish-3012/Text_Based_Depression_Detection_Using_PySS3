Do you ever feel like no matter how much better you get, you canâ€™t move past suicide attemptsI get panic attacks sometimes at the thought of what I did to myself. My parents donâ€™t know because during that time period they didnâ€™t really want to see me. But even though my life has gotten better and Iâ€™m starting to recover, Iâ€™ll still always be that scared little girl passed out in her room from an overdose. Anytime the shit hits the fan my first thought is always suicide. Itâ€™s just such a weird experience to have come out the other side yet still resort to it sometimes. When I see the scars from cutting on my thighs I just always feel like I canâ€™t move past what I did to myself

And before you tell me to talk to my parents, when I told my mother I was considering suicide, she told me how stupid I was and that I wouldnâ€™t actually do it. So not really an option
