Just posted like 40 minutes ago, but that poem didnâ€™t keep me un-suicidal for longI absolutely hate Easter. We get a shit ton of candy and you know what I naturally do? Eat it. And tons of it, because thatâ€™s what happens when there is junk food and you have a binge disorder. 

Anyway, Iâ€™m 14f, and I have been skinny all my life, until this year. After dealing with horrible body dysmorphia, I started restricted my calories. That lasted about 5 months. Then began the binging, in addition to restricting. The next thing you know, binging is all I know how to do. And now itâ€™s not just my mind playing tricks on me. Iâ€™m chubby.

Right now, Iâ€™m 5â€™4â€ and about 115 lbs. Sounds like a healthy weight, but itâ€™s fat, not muscle. Even though I work out 4 days a week, walk a hell lot, and play sports, my binging problem just throws all of that out the door. And now that the Easter candy is here, Iâ€™ll be putting on the pounds ten times faster.
 
This isnâ€™t a simple â€œcount your caloriesâ€ or â€œwatch what you eatâ€ thing. I wish it was that easy. I try to be stronger than my cravings, but itâ€™s all mental. Iâ€™ve tried so many different apps and distraction methods. Nothing. And I canâ€™t even get the professional help I need. 

But now to get to the part that really makes me want to kill myself. During the last few days, Iâ€™ve noticed some marks on my thighs. I thought they were just imprints from clothes or something, but I just know they are stretch marks. Iâ€™m so delusional. I am such a failure. I canâ€™t stop myself from eating. 

And thatâ€™s the most pathetic thing Iâ€™ve heard myself say.
