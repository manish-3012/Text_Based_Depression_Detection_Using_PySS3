i cant fucking do thisiâ€™ve hurt my boyfriend so many times and i donâ€™t. want to keep doing this to him. ivs done unspeakable shit to him and traumatized him so much. he deserves the world and all i do is whine about my problems and make him feel like shit. i feel like an attention seeker who wants to guilt trip people into pitying me. iâ€™m so sorry bumble, iâ€™m so sorry i never protected you like i said i would, iâ€™m so sorry i broke my promise by always being by your side, im sofucking sorry
