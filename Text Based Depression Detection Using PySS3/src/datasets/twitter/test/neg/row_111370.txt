I fell through the cracksAbout 6 months ago, for the first time in my life I realized I couldn't hide my problems anymore and they were hurting the people around me. I decided to accept that I had a problem, and seek help. I told my doctor I was depressed and anxious but I didn't do a very good job of it, and he gave me an SSRI, and the number of a mental health charity and sent me on my way.

2 months passed before I could bring myself to call the number, and I'm glad I did, because someone listened for the first time, and made an appointment for me to talk in-person. I thought I'd finally be getting the help I need to save my life. Now, these charities do great work, but there's a time-limit after which you're on your own. They helped me self-refer to therapy, went to various mental health assessments with me, and kept me sane for a while.

Now my therapy has started, the charity closed my case as expected and wished me luck; My doctor, seeing that I now had a support system in place, upped my meds and sent me on my way too.

Every step of the way, I've been honest about having suicidal thoughts, and even described them in grisly detail - like the time I woke up to the thought of [removed], or the time I wanted to [removed] - and every step of the way I played it down as 'automatic impulsive thoughts without intent', because I was terrified that I'd be sectioned if anyone knew just how much I wanted to act on these thoughts, and how scared I am that I might do it.

My first real therapy session was today. 50 minutes of interrogation, where my answers were invalidated and dismissed until I changed my answers to something the therapist would accept. 50 minutes trying to explain why I can't rationalize a panic attack in a way that fits the CBT model. 50 minutes that felt like I was being assaulted, judged and dismissed.

I've now exhausted all my options. I told myself, that before I do anything permanent - I had to know I'd done everything I could to help myself, and there was nothing more I could have done.

My conscience is clear. I did everything I could.
