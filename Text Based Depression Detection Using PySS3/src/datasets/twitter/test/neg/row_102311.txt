This seemed like the most appropriate place to post.I guess I dont know where to start I haven't felt happy in a long time and I've been able to pretty much convince myself that there is a purpose a reason if you will. As of lately though I haven't been sleeping well i haven't really been able to convince myself, there's just this pressure I believe is the best way to put it a noise a feeling that things wont change. I really dont know why I'm so unhappy though I mean I have good friends and a good job a family who loves and cares about me but none of that seems to matter I just cant shake this feeling of, i dont know how to put it sadness, hatred towards my self, emptiness, I dont know but it wont go away. I have thought about how to do it so many times ran scenarios through my head over and over. But I've never been able to bring myself to do it everytime I always think about how I'll be affecting everyone else's life and it just makes me hate myself even more. I wish I could stop caring about others and just fucking do it already but I dont know why but I cant seem to; maybe someday.Like I said I cant sleep so I've been drinking myself to a comatose like state and hoping for the best. Hoping that maybe one day I wont wake up or maybe one day I'll wake up with the ability to just do it.
