I'm lost and going down fast....I haven't been on my antidepressants for....about 9 months. Not by choice, just one thing after another. Forgot to make a doctor's appointment,  new insurance won't cover the prescription.  I've been stressed from having to move, barely living paycheck to paycheck, and trying to go back to scool. Add to that work. Where my fellow managers can't talk to me about things. Like, I do something that upsets them and instead of telling me, they tell a fellow manager. This has gone on for a month before I was told. And not by the managers that are frustrated with me. This pisses me off because it puts the middleman in a terrible position and they feel they can't tell me. How am I suppose to change my behavior if you don't tell me it is wrong? I'm sitting at work, trying not to cry. And I'm going down the dark hole....
