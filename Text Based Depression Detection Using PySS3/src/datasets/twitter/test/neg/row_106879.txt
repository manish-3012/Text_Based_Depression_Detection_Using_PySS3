Is there actually a reason to stay?I don't have any dependents or anyone's life who'd change in any significant manner if I were gone; so there's not really any feeling of guilt.  Everyone I know can progress with or without me around

Is it really worth sticking around just for the sake of sticking around and nothing else?
