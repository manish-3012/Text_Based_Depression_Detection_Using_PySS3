Worthless life. Close to giving upI am so lonely. I wish I had a significant other or a friend to tell me everything is going to be ok, that I don't need to give up and kill myself. That I don't need to worry so much about my future.. I just crave attention. The lack of human contact is depressing. At least I have a family, but will I just live with my mom forever? without ever having my own house, my own money, my own life?

Everything seems so uninteresting and boring. I'm just so tired of having no motivation to chase my goals. I feel like I once I had the potencial to have a good life, but somewhere on the way I lost my purpose. I'm still young but I feel like I've missed out on so much already.

I hate myself. I hate my inability to live a normal life.

Guess I'll just listen to sad music, drink alcohol, and cry myself to sleep tonight like every other day. At least I get to feel something

My mind is so broken, I'm just a piece of trash, a sad excuse for a human being.

I'm a talentless loser. Even If I wanted, I couldn't be succesful in any career or job. I'm too slow, too dumb.

This sub is nice to chat with other teenagers, but it's also just an illusion. It's not like anyone here cares about me either. But I won't act like I can actually kill myself, I don't have the ''courage'' to do such thing. Even though I'm sad and empty I'm still clinging to life. In a way, I hate feeling that way but I don't see death as a better option. I want to stop existing but at the same time I don't. it's a love and hate relationship with life. Guess I'm just stuck here
