I'm sick of humanity, I just want to dieI'm done with humanity. I'm sick of people just giving 0 shits about other people. I'm sick of every fragment of my existence being solely for capitalism.

And I bet some smartass thinks "if capitalism is so bad what's your solution"? Suicide is my solution. I am sick of every problem just looping back to some greedy fucker's desire for more money. I'll be honest - I wouldn't mind being exploited for money if I enjoyed the work. But all the passion I had for everything has been completely drained.
