Why the fuck should I even bother?Throwaway account, obviously. I'm not sure exactly where to start, but I feel like I should preface everything I say with this: the only reason I'm not killing myself right now is because my family has spent tens of thousands of dollars sending me to college. I don't want their investment to go to waste, so I'm trying to find a way to resolve how fucking miserable I am all the time. I know that I should see a therapist to resolve this issue, but I've been sucked into a psychiatric hospital before and I DEFINITELY don't want to be there again. The only solutions I was offered there ran along the lines of "change your diet" and "take these pills", and neither of those suggestions alleviated my stress. I feel like I'm trapped in a corner right now, and I don't know what to do. I'm aware of my actions to the extent which I realize I'm relying on alcohol to dampen my anxiety, and I know this isn't healthy. I want to find a way in which I can rely on myself to find and sustain happiness without any substances. Any help would be greatly appreciated. :\
