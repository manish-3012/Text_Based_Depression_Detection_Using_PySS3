I canâ€™t go on anymoreItâ€™s the new year and the only thing I can think of is how much I want to die. Thoughts about suicide haunted me for a long time.
In August I met this girl that I fall in love with. I thought I would recover cause the time I spent with her was the best and most hopeful time of my entire life. I started making plans about my future, about my job, my education. She dumped me in November for almost no reason. She said she didnâ€™t want relationship. I tried to bring her back for two months. Yesterday I called her and she told me she likes another guy for two weeks. Itâ€™s not only her abandoning me that hurts me. Itâ€™s the feeling that the whole world doesnâ€™t matter. Iâ€™m not going anywhere. Itâ€™s the feeling that I wonâ€™t be happy anymore. I feel like now is the first time when I could actually end it. Itâ€™s the new yearâ€™s eve. I try to look happy but Iâ€™m dying on the inside. I canâ€™t handle this feeling anymore. The prospect of suicide just looks so easy. You can just end it all. I think I can do it, wish me luck.
