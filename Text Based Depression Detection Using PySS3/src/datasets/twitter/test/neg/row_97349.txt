Just another confusing post youâ€™ll scroll pastI feel imprisoned in my own mind. I have so much to say yet Iâ€™m not able to say a word; the words disappear before they can even leave my mouth. Im even having a hard time writing this because i donâ€™t know what to write. Maybe the pain Iâ€™m in isnâ€™t even real because, how can you know if it is? I just fucking hate myself so much. This post made ZERO sense but i had to vent somewhere even though i failed. Just like i fail at everything i remotely try to do.
