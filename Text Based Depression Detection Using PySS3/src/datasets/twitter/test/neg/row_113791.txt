I can beat this. I just need advice.Right. So. Don't really know how to do this but here goes. I apologise to the community and any readers if this looks like nonsense gibberish, but I am really really trying to communicate here. 

I'm 20. Male. Live in Auckland, New Zealand. Since I was maybe 15 I've had...bad spells. I've got a loving family, a small circle of very good friends (one of which I have spoken to about this). 

My bad spells started as pure procrastion. You must forgive me, my memory of the entire early days of it are very hazy. I honestly think I slept more than I was awake for that year or so. 

Then they got darker as time went on. I became highly frustrated with how I seemed unable to achieve anything. I was studying via correspondence at the time and I procrastinated, avoided, lied just so that I wouldn't do it. 

This frustration became anger, and despair and....jesus it sounds so stupid putting this in print about something as unimportant as correspondence school work! Makes me laugh almost.

I digress. Point is, I started day dreaming, escaping. These day dreams slowly started focusing on just ending it. What was the point? We all died anyway wouldn't it just be easier to skip all the hassle we call life and get our piece on the other end of the chessboard already.

I thought I was better. I'd gone from angry sobbing several times a week and walking kilometers around the neighbourhood at 5 a.m. to...relaxing. I'd get stressed sometimes, anxious, but then I'd let it flow away.

Theres been several incidents since then, almost echoes that jar me back into an anxious self hating depressed just END IT person but they didn't last long. A few days, tops.

I was dealing with it. Or so I thought. I don't whats changed exactly but its come back, with a vengence. I've spent the last 3 days drinking, smoking, blocking everything out around me because I couldn't handle it.

I'll admit there was a girl involved. We weren't seeing each other formally and we'd agreed (my idea primarily) to stop seeing each other physically so we could relish our friendship instead. I suggested this as I have a bad track record with relationships and did not, do not want to lose this person in my life.

Sunday, she tells me she's slept with someone else. Which is fine. We agreed we'd be seeing other people, we'd discussed the akwardness that might arise because of it, we'd talked about how we'd handle it and we'd promised to tell each other. So, she did nothing wrong. In fact I'd been expecting this weekend to be The One, the weekend that she'd sleep with someone other than me. We haven't been physical in several weeks.

She tells me, and I kind of....snap. Blue Screen of Death, HAL singing Daisy Daisy. I just start laughing, grinning from ear to ear and high fiving everyone. I was so...joyed I was right. Even though I didn't like what I was right about I was ecstatic I was right. 

I don't have much time to dwell on this. I'm trying to evalulate myself and it's the same pattern. I go south, I get bad and dark and hateful and vengeful and stupid and then...I get happy. SO happy. The world is the most beautiful creation EVER happy. I become confident and carefree. The high doesn't last long and then I even out for a bit and then sink again....

I'm in a small window at the moment in between that low and high where I'm motivated, optimistic, sober and DESPERATELY TRYING to end this infernal cycle. When I hit the high, I just start believing I've beaten it, it'll never come back, and I don't prepare.

Please. What can I do, take, or change to alter this cycle? I don't want to die. 

Also, for what it's worth I'm sober right now.
