What do I need to take care of before I go?Sorry if this isnâ€™t allowed here, please delete if so. I donâ€™t want to break rules or cause pain. Iâ€™m just a little scatterbrained, and am wondering if someone can help me figure out all the things I need to take care of in the weeks leading up? Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve got so far:

- Clean out apartment
- Clean out parentâ€™s house/childhood room
- Donate clothing, belongings
- Wipe or destroy computers
- Burn diaries
- Write note
- Empty bank account
- Book plane ticket
- Order and pick up supplies

Iâ€™m unemployed, so I wonâ€™t have to quit any job. Iâ€™m 28, no life insurance, no pets, no children. Is there anything Iâ€™m forgetting?

Thanks in advance. Love to you all.
