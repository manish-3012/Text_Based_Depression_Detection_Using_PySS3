Does anyone else have a â€œplanâ€?Iâ€™ve thought about suicide since I was 13. I turned 21 recently. Iâ€™ve never really thought about how Iâ€™m going to do it until recently however.  Itâ€™s late at night where Iâ€™m at right now, Iâ€™m feeling down and I donâ€™t want to bring this up with anybody because I dump enough of my problems on the ones I love. 
So just hear me out, okay?

My family has two firearms, one of which is a 12 gauge shotgun which would surely blow my brains out, but my parents are responsible gun owners and itâ€™s got a trigger lock. 

Hanging and drowning sound terrifying. I canâ€™t imagine going that way. 

I think drug overdosing would be scary 

Someone killed themselves jumping off a parking structure at a nearby college campus. It worked for them, but Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™d survive by some sort of horrible anti-miracle.

So hereâ€™s my plan.

I drive a white car. I worked years for it. When my familyâ€™s out, I plan on getting my car in the garage, shutting all the doors and running it. Iâ€™d grab a few thick-tipped black sharpies as my car runs, and Iâ€™d write all over it. Iâ€™d write how I felt. Iâ€™d write the names of those Iâ€™d loved during my life, the ones who helped me through the hardest of times. Iâ€™d write apology letters to them. Iâ€™d write the things I loved about them most, and the people I looked up to. Iâ€™d write to my parents and my siblings. Iâ€™d write to my remaining grandparents. 
Iâ€™d just write.

And when Iâ€™d feel tired and my â€œnoteâ€ would be complete, Iâ€™d just lay down and go to sleep. 

Iâ€™m *probably* not going to kill myself. But if I do, I know exactly how Iâ€™m gonna do it.

Well, Iâ€™m tired of existing, Iâ€™m gonna pass out now. Thanks for reading, if anyone reads this.
