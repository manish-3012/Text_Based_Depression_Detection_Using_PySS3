Contemplating but unsure rantI've recently had a good few months after coming out of a dark place but now I am starting to go back down. It is not nearly as bad as it was before but I just don't feel like going on. The longer I wait, the harder it becomes. I have a plan but I do not know if I will go through with it. It would be so simple and painless but I do not feel like I deserve the easy way out. So many people have invested time and effort into helping me and I do not want to let them down. However, I could save them from further disappointment if I just get it over with already. All I'd have to do is go to sleep and not wake up. But I can not imagine the shame that would come if I did wake up. I don't know anymore. The worst part is I am not even feeling that depressed or the darkness that usually came with these thoughts. I feel like I have decided I should flip a coin or choose to just finish this already. It has gone on far too long. I am setting up support networks right now and striving to keep going but I feel like if I falter then it could be the end of me. Counseling and therapy is not helping. No, I am not actively at risk. But it is weird knowing that I have the power to shut it all down at any moment of my choosing. I will see what the future holds and I will keep going for now. Until then all I can do is wait.
