Crying in bed on a christmas night, yay.Normally, I just browse this sub. From time to time. I don't believe in people spilling out their story on public sites like these.. but I've hit a dead end. Everything is going to hell. Most recent attempt was a few weeks back, overdosed on pills, anxiety kicked in, the usual bit of happiness creeping when you're trying to take your life that makes you regret it and feel ashamed. I think of my late, unborn daughter, panic attack goes on for 15 minutes. I'm soaked in tears and so is my pillow. I wake up the next morning feeling nothing. I go on with my usual horrid life, parents making me the center of how shit of a son I am, mom using me as a verbal punching bag, blames being pinned on me, being told how useless and lazy I am. Living every day wondering if I should try it again, yadda yadda. During all this, my escapes are video games, books, the love of my life, and my puppy. Everything takes a wrong turn at the start of December. Parents are out to stain my image and name for the entire family, entire family looks down on me, the woman in my life goes through some change and barely talks to me anymore, pushes me aside, I express my frustration to no effect, she's ignoring me now, video games are of no use, I go into some sort of mind numbing state where I'm out of it and my body is doing just it's thing, same thing with books. My pup has been helping but I've lost interest. Spend my days in my room, locked away, staring at the city wondering if God is real, cursing Him for doing this to me, cursing Him for allowing me a life with abusive parents, making me who I am, failing at everything. Tell the woman in my life I'm tired of it all, that I'm done fighting this battle, a battle going ever since elementary school, being hated by everyone, being a burden, a bother.. whatever. She ignores it all, doesn't even reply. Reads the message and goes about her day acting like I don't exist. And here I am now, writing a confusing and messy story that doesn't even reveal a fraction of what I'm going through. Laying in bed, crying, contemplating if I want to cut veins and overdose, or just overdose, because I'm a coward. A coward but I still go through with it. I probably will try tonight, and if anything happens, I want you to know that your father tried very much to be happy, Annie. I love you, hope you're having the time of your life, wherever you are, darling, I'm sorry. To you and my siblings.
