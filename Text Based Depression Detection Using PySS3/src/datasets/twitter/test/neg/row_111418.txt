i feel so fucking alonei just know this world would be better off without me. im so fucking sick of pretending to be happy because im not. i want to die. all i am is a burden and no one likes being around me. all i do is drag people down. i dont want to be here anymore. its not worth feeling this way anymore. no one likes me and i know this and it makes my days full of sadness and loneliness. everyone always says its going to get better and it never fucking does. it only gets worse and im tired
