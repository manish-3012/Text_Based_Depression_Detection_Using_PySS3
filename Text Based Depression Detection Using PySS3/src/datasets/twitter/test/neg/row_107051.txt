I need help.I have wrote, and deleted this post 2 times now, but fuck it, I'm just going to blunt as possible. In light of the events of this past month, I don't want to live anymore. I've experienced unrelenting anger, chrushing heartbreak, and the total turn around of my other wise positive personality. The past 3 things stated are starting to get to me, I hate the person I'm turning into and I need help, I don't care what it is. Pat on the shoulder, friendly advice on why I shouldn't blow my brains out, shoulder to cry on, anything. I need... Something. Something to tell me why I shouldn't end it all right now... Please Reddit. Help.
