i just don't know what to do anymoreI'm 25 and still live with my parents.  I went to college and couldnt graduate because i had incompletes and i just cant seem to go and finish them.  I fear by now that i'll have to take the classes over again. my dad keeps asking what the status is and i constantly lie to him telling him its getting taken care of.  Ive been overweight my whole life and can't seem to keep any weight off.  when people look at me they know im fat but what they don't see is im really morbidly obese. every night my dad thinks i leave to go to the gym but i really go to get food from somewhere and go to vacant parking lot and eat alone in my car and then cry afterwards.  i cant get a job.  i cant sleep.  my head hurts all the time. i have two sisters who want to be close with and i never talk to them and two nephews who i dont spend time with.  my father wants to be proud of me but i always let him down.  i tried. i really tried, but i dont think i was cut out for this life.  ive decided not to stay.  sorry for rambling on, and the grammar.
