These assholes need to stop feigning concern when they're the ones driving me to the edge.I've been at my workplace for 5 years. I've always done my best to do a good job, rarely miss, etc. Year after year I'm stuck with the most draining, difficult, and impossible tasks. The people who show up and do nothing else are given the "fun" tasks, the easy tasks. The tasks that end up in the newspaper while I'm grinding away with the worst of the worst. 

They obviously hate me. They obviously like seeing that I'm stressed out and upset ,that I'm at the end of my rope. 

So yeah, don't fucking ask if I'm ok, or if I'm "Feeling better". Stop dumping all the shit in this place at my goddamn door and sitting back as I fall apart under the pressure. Fuck. Them. 

I've never been this close to actually going through with it. I have to care for my mentally ill husband, but I'm afraid at some point it's gonna win out over even that.
