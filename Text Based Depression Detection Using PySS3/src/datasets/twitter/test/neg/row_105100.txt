I've come to the conclusion that my loneliness, just like my lack of meaning, is eternalThese two things are simply facts of life. We all are alone in the end, and everything is meaningless in the end. Who can I trust? No one. I know people "mean well" but I can never trust anyone more than a little bit, and I'm eternally alone, that's just a fact, it's even how it should be cause it's unhealthy for people to having to be with me.

And in the end, everyone will die, so why would anything we do before that matter, cause the end result is eternal death of everyone. Life isn't suppose to have a meaning, but many humans primatively believes it does, because it's beneficial for their survival.

I just want to die, what's up with my eternal willpower that somehow glows strong after my soul has been sucked up in a black hole then torn apart, ugh.
