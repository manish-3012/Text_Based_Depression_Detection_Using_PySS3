I just put a gun in my mouth for the third time this year. I wish I could pull the trigger.I'm 23.  Over the course of the last 15 years, I've been on a list of antidepressants/antipsychotics/anti-anxiety drugs longer than my dick, and none of them have worked for more than a handful of months at best.  I was with someone who made me feel like a whole person for a while, but she's gone now and she's not coming back.  I feel like I'll never meet another person who'll accept me in my totality, flaws and all, the way she did.  I just moved into the city and I'm living by myself for the first time, so I'm always alone, except for when I'm at school in my nursing program.  I thought the program was what I wanted, but I'm getting repeatedly hit over the head by the fact that I belong in treatment, not treating people.  My peers are nice enough but there's something inside me that prevents me from getting close enough to be friends with any of them.  My mom is the only person I speak to outside of school on a regular basis, and also the only reason I haven't shot myself yet.  But every time I get to the point where I put the pistol in my mouth, I care a little bit less about how she'll feel when I'm gone.  I spend my days addicted to porn and alcohol, thinking of days gone by and wishing I could drum up the courage to squeeze that fucking trigger.  Not sure what I'm hoping for by posting here. Maybe someone to save me from myself.  Do what you will.
