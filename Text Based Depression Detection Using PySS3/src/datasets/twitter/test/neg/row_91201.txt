Suicidal again after leaving psych ward... What nowHey everyone.
I'm a 17 year old girl who recently (December 3rd) attempted suicide and ended up in a mental hospital for a month. Just left (January 11th) but for the past few days I've been having very bad thoughts and feeling suicidal again. I'm trying to fight against it because I don't want to alarm my parents and friends but knowing myself I feel like I'm going to do it again.
Please help me, I'm at a loss, I don't know what to do with myself.
