Final strawFor weeks Iâ€™ve been withdrawing from the world and planning my suicide...meanwhile my roommate thought I was being passive-aggressive....lol she also said I have a vindictive soul. She just kicked me out. Sleeping in a hotel right now, looking up how to make a noose with a bedsheet. I planned to OD before but left pills at my former home. Silver lining...at least it wonâ€™t be her to find my body...sheâ€™d probably make my suicide all about her. 

Bye.
