Everyday is dreadfulLast month, my mother found out that I stopped doing all of the work my school has sent me and found out that I've been lying to her about to doing the said work for nearly a month. I can't blame her for yelling at me because why the fuck couldnt I just get up and do the damn work? I'm so lazy and it's evident. I always say that I'll do better next time BUT THAT NEVER HAPPENS DOES IT ?

"You're an idiot. I'd never thought I'd call one of my children an idiot. But you are one." Said my mother to me after I got beaten multiple times after I admitted of not doing the work 

At night I literally bawl myself to sleep because I know that tomorrow is just gonna be another day in hell. I just want the pain to end. That's all I want. 

My greatest fear is my mother looking through the journals I have where I talk about how I feel. That's scary. I mean she already knows that I'm depressed. She gave me a therapist that actually works a bit, just that I don't tell them my actual thoughts; I lie. But yeah, my mother hasn't found the journals because I make them seem like they're either school books or just a normal journal *nothing to see here*

Oh, if only she knew.
If only. . .

I've tried to self harm, can you believe that? Didn't have the balls to do it and I placed that knife right back down

Not everyday is bad though. Everyday at a certain time, me and my friends would hop onto among us and play a few good rounds. That's probably the only good parts in my days. Probably.
