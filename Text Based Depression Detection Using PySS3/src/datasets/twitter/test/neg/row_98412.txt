I found a way to kill bad thoughts.I think **FUCK FUCK FUCK** really loud in my head.
Kills all thoughts that i dont like. 
Fuck you bad thought FUCK YOU!

try it, it might help

This could be obsessive compulsive behaviour. The obsession is the bad thought and the compulsion is thinking "FUCK" to get rid of it. If you are OCD, all this is going to do is reinforce the initial obsession, rather than help.

This works for me, it might not work for you.


If you dont like the word fuck, maybe LOVE LOVE LOVE might work :)
