First and onlyMy first and only relationship died about a day ago. Even if I stayed, I wouldn't be in another, I couldn't be able to. Dramatic and pathetic, especially as I'm fucking 14, but you know what, she was the only thing stopping me. Nothing else us holding me back, so I guess we'll both get our freedom. 

It didn't even last a month, but it NEARLY did, and she never loved me. That's what I'm most upset about, to be honest. 

I was clean from self harm for 3 days. Now 4. I don't feel anything about any of it. It was going to  be a pleasant surprise for the first month since she said yes to me for whatever reason, by then if I kept it up i would be 6 days clean, 7 by that night. I've been eating properly, or at least as close as I can get, for her. Nearly all suicidal thoughts stopped because if her, too. 

But now it's over. Been over for what feels forever, but in reality hasn't even quite been a full 24 hours. I don't really have emotions anymore, I show it, smile and laugh at things, seem not too different at least in text, but I feel none of it. I'm gonna attempt again on the day that would've been a cause to celebrate, had it all been real and I not a monster. At least now, it'll still be a day to celebrate. 

But God is it so tempting to just do it now.
