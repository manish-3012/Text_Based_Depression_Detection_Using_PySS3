I donâ€™t want to reach 2021My plan was to end it by November. Unfortunately, it didnâ€™t happen. I didnâ€™t want to do it this time of the year because I donâ€™t want to ruin Christmas forever for my family. I thought this would be my last year. It sucks, would have been nice to end it by now and my family could just say I died from covid.
