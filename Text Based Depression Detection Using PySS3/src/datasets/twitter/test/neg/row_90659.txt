Abusive ex boyfriend..cry for help :'(1 year into the relationship with my ex boyfriend, he started getting abusive. I was forbidden from seeing my friends, he would tell me to wear baggy clothes so that i dont attract other guys, he'd call me a whore, hit me, pull my hair, threaten to ruin my life, tell my family that im a whore, etc.
the abuse went on for about a year and a half, and then i finally decided to tell him im done...i broke up with him but he never went away..he still stalks me, he drive around my neighborhood hoping to see me, he still sends me a number of msgs every single day, he still threatens to ruin my life if i dont go back to him.
i am scared of getting out of the house because i dont want to run into him. I have stopped checking my phone because everytime i do, there is a call or text from him. I dont see my friends anymore because..its just not easy anymore..

I didnt deserve this. Any of this. I never hurt him or anyone else in any way. Im so tired. I live in the Middle East and can not report him to the Police due to certain reasons which i wish to not disclose..
i feel like the only way out is suicide..and im so scared. I dont want to do it, but i feel like i have to. Its the only way i can get away from him..
