Came back here again. What a fucking joke.I thought everything has been resolved. Clearly not. Fuck my brain for dragging me around with horrible thoughtsâ€” in return push my friends away from me. I'm tired of seeking constant validation for the little things, and get upset over nothing. I'm just a fucking burden. I wish I can fucking die. I want to die. Fuck my life and the rest that ruins me. Fuck everything.
