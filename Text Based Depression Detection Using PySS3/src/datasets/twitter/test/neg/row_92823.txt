Does anyone else here wanna die, even though their circumstances really arenâ€™t that bad?Am I the only one who really wants to kick the bucket just because? Sure, the loneliness and isolation makes it harder, but honestly, I donâ€™t believe any utopian future will solve my problems. I often think of some unrealistic future that might not even help the depression.

Am I alone in this?
