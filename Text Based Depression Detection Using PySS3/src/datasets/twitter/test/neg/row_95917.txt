Im doneI've been on autopilot every single day for the last two years or so, And all I know is I've gone through the motions, I've done the things that I'm supposed to do and I've talked to the people I'm supposed to talk to. In all honesty I just can't do it anymore, I'm so exhausted and apathetic and empty that I don't feel like a person anymore. I already have the gun ready so It should be over tonight.

Edit: I do want to say though to anyone who reads this and is considering suicide please get the help you need. I wish you all the luck in the world in pursuing that course of action.
