I want to live, but I don't want to live. Can I be depressed even if I don't want to commit suicide? I just feel hopeless. I haven't been able to eat or sleep recently, my body is numb, I can't think properly, I feel nauseous, I've got a bad headache and my heart keeps beating rapidly. I never thought I'd be emotional or cry, but I actually cried yesterday. I have lost my appetite and sexual desire and I don't feel like playing video games, watching movies or having fun anymore. Yet, I don't feel too suicidal though. I want to live, I want to survive, I want to enjoy things, but life isn't easy. All that matters to me now is money, survival, my family and the future. I used to think I was depressed in high school, but I've never experienced these symptoms before. Even if you don't want to commit suicide, can you still be depressed?

The only time I feel good is whenever I hug my family or see a ray of hope. A promise of a decent future where I could settle down. Hope is keeping me alive. 

I'm 18 and I study at a prestigious public university in my country for free, and my parents are happy about that, but I'm studying geography and environment science and I can't change my major there. I like the classes, campus, peers and teachers, but there are no jobs nor internships in this sector, even from my university. I've been really concerned about money and I don't want to end up being broke my entire life.

Some of my classmates have decided to pay about $15,000 for a 4-year degree in Computer Science at a lesser-known private university but I can't afford it. I can't afford to go abroad either.

I don't know what to do now. Should I stick to this degree? Should I do some work on the side? Should I somehow save up money and study CS? Should I give up on higher education? Should I just kill myself?
