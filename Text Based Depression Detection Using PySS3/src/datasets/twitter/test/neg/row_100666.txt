I told him he could have the kids.I'm young, I live in beautiful sunny South Florida, am the mother to two amazingly cute little boys, the daughter of a hardworking man, and everyday I wake up wanting to die.

The father of my kids and I had a falling out several years ago but always remained good teammates in raising our kids and the best of friends beyond anything I could of imagined. Last year he got married, and while I was happy for him I couldn't help but feel jealous. I hadnt dated anyone serious and marriage wasn't even a thought for me. I guess I blocked this new girl out even though I came in contact with her weekly. She never really was a fan of me so I guess I see how she was blocked out. 

I had done a favor for him that resulted in me being incarcerated over night, he bailed me as soon as he was able to, and since then it seems like my life has been nonstop turmoil. 

He had papers drawn up for custody and child support. I lost my job. My kids had to go move in with them. I lost my car which made it impossible to find a new job. I became extremely ill and was admitted to the hospital late last year. And now I'm on the verge of loosing my apartment because I gave my last $300 to him for a Disney trip they went on this weekend. 

Since my downfall its been extremely hard for me to see or do anything nice for my kids. I can see and feel the disconnection that's happened over the past couple of years. I know they enjoy being at their dads and having this other lady around more than they do when they're with me. I have so little to offer them and haven't been able to offer them in so long that I told their dad to just keep them. I won't go to court and fight it, draw up the paper work and I'll sign it. 

My being depressed hasn't been going over well with my father either. He either doesn't see it or doesn't care to see it. He's asked me not to come over again until I've "got my shit straight".

I'm ready to just pull the trigger. All weekend I've been crying and upset. I've just been staring back and forth between the clock and my gun just wondering what I'm waiting for. I'm not waiting for anything anymore. I dropped the dog and cat off at the humane society. Everyone is away. I'm ready to go.
