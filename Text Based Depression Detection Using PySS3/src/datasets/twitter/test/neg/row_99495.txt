I just don't get it anymoreI'll be living the rest of my life like this. This struggle of feeling empty and not being able to find meaning in anything is going to follow me for the rest of my life. It's never, ever going to be easy. I can find ways to cope and go on in life, but I just don't see how it's worth it. I can't see the payoff being worth the expense anymore. 

I know that I have so much life ahead of me. But it's taking way too much to push on right now. There's no end in sight to any of this. I might feel better eventually, but it'll never really go away. I'm always living in fear with this looming threat of feeling empty again. Every moment of joy is overshadowed by the gravity of everything. 

I don't know how to do this anymore.
