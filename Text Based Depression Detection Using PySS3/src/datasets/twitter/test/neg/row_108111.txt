online classes are fucking killing mei'm failing math and i'm starting to get behind some subjects because of the amount of asynchronous sessions and modules we have. i'm so fucking tired and it's been affecting my relationships with other people as well. i honestly want to end all of this already. i'm so fucking done. it's been hard for me to even get up anf attend thrm lately and i've been absent for at least once or twice a week now. i'm so frustrated and tired, i'm fucking drained. i can't take it anymore
