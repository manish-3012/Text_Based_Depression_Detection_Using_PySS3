I'm tired of everything.I'm sick of awful people. Mocking, berating and just cruel. I'm tired of putting up with my own idiocy and inadequacies. I am ashamed of my past and who I've become. I am lonely, but fear reaching out. I'm a coward. Worthless. No one to talk to about this so I'm posting this here to be pased over. I'm not afraid of the void, I'm tired of everything.
Sorry to waste your time.
