I'm afraidI dont think I care about myself at all anymore. I'm treating myself like shit. I do things that are terrible for myself but I don't mind anymore. I feel like I deserve it. I feel like it's okay to hurt myself. I'm afraid to die but I care less about what I'm afraid of nowadays. It doesnt matter. I dont matter. It's alright in the end, because it's me. Me.
