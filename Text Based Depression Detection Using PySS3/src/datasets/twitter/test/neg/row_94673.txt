Canâ€™t deal with this life anymore.Iâ€™m 24 and Iâ€™ve been suffering for severe depression and anxiety since I was 13. There were ups and many downs along the way, especially when I unexpectedly lost my boyfriend. I was there when he died, but I couldnâ€™t do anything to save him unfortunately. We were swimming by the way, but the waves were stronger than him and I tried everything I could to make him stay, but I couldnâ€™t. The memory of him still haunts me every single day, and I wish I couldâ€™ve swapped places with him.

Since then, Iâ€™ve dropped out of 2 different colleges because I couldnâ€™t cope with my anxiety and it killed me inside. I felt like a complete loser and a failure. 

Last year, I attempted suicide for real. Like I already tried to leave this pathetic world before without really going that far, but this time it was different. I took over all pills I could find around me because I couldnâ€™t handle the pain of being here anymore. My anxiety made it impossible for me to have a normal life. I ended up in hospital and went through the cleaning up process which uses the tube, etc. It was an horrible experience. My attempt didnâ€™t work and I had to go through that. I felt pathetic. 

I have to admit though, that I was doing better after my suicide attempt. I started to work and I went out more. My anxiety wasnâ€™t stopping me from doing anything anymore, even though it was still there. That was last year. 

My depression made a comeback earlier this year when things were looking better for me. This year started badly and then it went up and now itâ€™s worst than ever. Iâ€™ve rarely felt so bad about everything (apart from when my bf died). The day before yesterday, I tried strangling myself because I honestly felt like death was calling me again. One of my â€œfriendâ€ betrayed me and it was just one of those things which made everything worse. 

I donâ€™t know when those suicidal thoughts will leave me for good. I have no hope left it me, and I just want to leave this place where I feel so pathetic about everything. I feel lost and I want to leave so bad, but Iâ€™m trying to survive for my family. Because I know they love me. Iâ€™m holding on, but really all I want to give up.
