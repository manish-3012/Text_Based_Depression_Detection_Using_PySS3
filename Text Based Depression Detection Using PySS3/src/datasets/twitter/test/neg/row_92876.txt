I'm back again...My girlfriend left me today. My minds on suicide again. I need help... again. I'd rather not bother anyone anymore so if someone isn't busy I think I'd like to attempt to talk about it. I'm contemplating just taking some pills to sleep soon so sorry if there's no response...ever. Sorry if I wasted anyone's time
