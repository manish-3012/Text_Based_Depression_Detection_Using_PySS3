I feel like my life is a PokÃ©mon game...Sorry for the bad simile but it is actually a perfect comparison for what I'm going through right now. 


From the beginning you understand that no matter what happens within the game it really won't affect you much in real life. Even with this understanding you still play, most likely for fun or some other drive. Once you reach all of your goals (Elite Four, getting all of the PokÃ©mon, or even creating the perfect team to battle with). Once you reach your goal you stop playing.


Recently I was playing PokÃ©mon and I was deeply engaged in the game. While training, I realized that it was a ridiculous and pointless game. I stopped playing and likely wont start up again.


I think this applies to my life. The goals I have are pointless in the long run. The experiences I gain in life will be lost as soon as I pass. I feel that this is universal for all people. 


So without a point or a drive to live anymore, I don't know what to do.
