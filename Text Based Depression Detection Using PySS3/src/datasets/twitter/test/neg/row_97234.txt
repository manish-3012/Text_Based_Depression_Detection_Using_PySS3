Always felt like I would end up going by suicide, but I think the time is almost here.The past few years of my life have been a nonstop nightmare. I am nothing more than a punching bag for the world and those around me. I think I squeezed out a few extra years by numbing myself with drugs. I dont want to keep doing that though, its become just as exhausting. Today I figured out someone I used to know pressed charges from an offhand comment when angry nearly a year ago. I know whats gonna happen. Its going to stain my life and ruin a part of me, just like everything else does. 

I find myself almost perpetually in envy of others. Nothing ever seems to come to me in moderation. Im a cripple, depressed, personality disorder, covered in scars from accidents and surgeries....I just cant take it anymore. It makes it worse having to go be a part of the world, watching everyone go along with ease. Listening to people talk about their struggles makes me jealous. Im not trying to invalidate peoples struggles, I know there are people who are having a much more difficult time than I am. What I also know however, is that the great majority of people my age dont have these struggles. Bad things come, and then they just....go. Just like that for them. They tackle it and its gone...I would give anything for that. Problems arise in my life and they seem to ALWAYS take a part of me I will never get back. 

I am broken. The world has beaten me completely. I never stood a chance. I always sort of expected I would go by suicide, but now I am certain of it. I am truly, finally at the end of my rope. I simply cannot keep this up. Every waking second has been spent slowly coming to terms with the nothingness waiting for me. Im beginning to want to embrace it. I dont feel scared of it anymore. I long so much to not be tired.
