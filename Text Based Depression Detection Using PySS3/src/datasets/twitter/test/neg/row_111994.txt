I have been having suicidal thoughts lately and I want the pain to go away.I feel like I have no control of my life. I am a first year medical student and I am a month into the curriculum and my depression is at an all time low. We are officially in the full swing of things and I started off on the wrong foot. I barely passed my first exam because I couldn't figure out how to study and all tests are cumulative so I need to master this old material if I want to recover. But at the same time I can't keep up with the work they're unleashing onto me. I am not prepared for the next one. I knew coming into school that I probably won't be top of the class anymore because everyone in medical school is smart, but I didn't expect being so low on the class ranking. It's been wrecking my morale.

My support system has also been really weak. My friends never reach out to me and my family never understands the intensity of school. They keep asking me to come home to visit them, but I can't because of my workload. I try to explain to them the issue, but they just get mad and think I'm purposely avoiding them. They're not paying for anything, it's all loans for me. I've tried reaching out to my friends that I'm stressed, lonely, anxious, etc but they half ass their support and it's making me feel worse. It makes me feel like I am all on my own. I kind of have new friends here, but I don't feel entirely comfortable with them. My classmates are already hooking up with each other and drama is starting. It's all too fast for me right now. I hate drama. I take relationships slow, but it's to my expense because people form strong friend circles without me because I don't participate in the gossip. Plus I have to study alone because if I'm in a group setting I get distracted and can't retain anything, but that's also to my expense because I miss out on forming friendships if I am alone all the time.

I also ruined one of my most meaningful friendships this past summer before starting school. She was my best friend, someone I used to share everything with and she shared with me everything in her life. I don't feel like telling the story because it upsets and frustrates me each time I tell it, but basically we both liked each other, but at different times (she was first, I was second), and we ended up hurting each other. It was easily the worst heartbreak I've experienced. Probably the first girl to genuinely make me cry. We tried reforming the friendship but it doesn't feel the same. I feel so secondary to her now. She doesn't reach out to me anymore, she doesn't check up on me, and she keeps doing these extremely kind gestures to everyone else in her life but me. I can't even get a "how have you been?" text. No hint that I still matter to her or mean something to her anymore and it breaks my heart.

So basically, I feel overwhelmed about school, I feel like I have no support system or just an extremely unstable one, and I can't get over the worst heartbreak I have experienced in my entire thus far in my life. And it's only going to get worse because medical school isn't easy. I am not happy, I worked so hard to get here with hardly any help, but now that I am here I still am not happy. I try reaching out to people about my stress, anxiety, depression, etc, but they half ass their support and sometimes will just stop replying to me or checking up on me if I vent to them. I don't even ask for advice, I tell them straight up I just want someone to cheer me on, but they still don't do that. I feel so alone, unwanted, unsupported at one of the most difficult stages in my life so far.

I've been having suicidal thoughts because I've had depression/melancholy since high school and I have never been truly happy. It feels like an all time low right now because of my lack of support and loneliness. Even if friends and family were there for me, they're 300 miles away. I don't know if these suicidal thoughts are real or are fantasies that if I ever off'd myself, people would realize how much they neglected me and that I did matter to them or something. But I don't know if it's real or un-relievable stress.
