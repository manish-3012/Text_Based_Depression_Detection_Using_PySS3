I couldn't do it tonightA couple of days ago I had decided that I'd jump down from a 12 story building, in which i reside. I had planned everything, left 2 notes (one for my family and another one for whoever finds me), washed myself. 09.02, it's 3am. I went up top. I look down on the road where I've got to land. I sent a spit down there to estimate for how long I'll be miserably flying down (idc that the mass of my saliva and my body differs). 
I couldn't do it. I went back, smoked a cig and then headed back home and transferred the contents of my fridge in my hungry belly. I am disappointed.

I wonder when will I do it again.
