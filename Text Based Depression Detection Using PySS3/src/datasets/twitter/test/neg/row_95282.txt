Coming down from a panic attack and I want to die.Iâ€™m recovering (through the use of â€œas neededâ€ medication) from a severe panic attack and now I have an overwhelming feeling of wanting to take my life.

In recent weeks Iâ€™ve been feeling increased pressure at home, work, and extracurricular activities to do better. Of the three, work has caused me the greatest stress. Iâ€™m doing my best and it never feels good enough. I canâ€™t quit because my family needs the stellar health insurance. So, Iâ€™m stuck. Iâ€™m doing my best and I canâ€™t stop feeling inadequate.

I have this urge of wanting to stop breathing. To go to sleep and never wake up. Every day feels like a losing battle, and Iâ€™m ready to give up. I feel like that day is coming very soon.
