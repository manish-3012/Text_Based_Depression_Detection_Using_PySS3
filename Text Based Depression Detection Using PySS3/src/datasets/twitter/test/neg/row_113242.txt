Another attempt, another disappointmentI've posted quite a few times already regarding my suicide attempts that should have killed me but it doesn't and it defies any scientific reason. 

Well, I tried again by injesting quite a lot of a deadly, poisonous plant (won't say which one, but it is fatal) and wouldn't you know, I fell asleep and woke up fine. Tried again the next night by upping the dosage to the beyond extreme and yet again, nothing....
