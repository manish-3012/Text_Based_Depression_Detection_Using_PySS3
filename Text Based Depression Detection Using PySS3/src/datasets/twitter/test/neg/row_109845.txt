I care, hereâ€™s why... and how I overcame my depression and anxietyI care because you are me and I am you. Without our mind perceiving the universe around us nothing would exist to perceive the existence of the universe. That means we are living in our heads. One consciousness binds us all and some people have learned it to be God, where all knowledge resides and the inner peace comes to be. I came to grips with my reality

Think really hard about this â€œno problem can be solved with the same level of consciousness that created itâ€ the cure to depression and anxiety doesnâ€™t live in a pill you have to take daily... they live already inside you. Itâ€™s up to you to bring back your happiness and joy and not let the struggles of daily life get you down no matter how bad it gets just remember we are all connected and positivity is what changes our lives and others. Why be concerned of the daily struggles of life when your mind was created for something else all together? See why there are so many problems in humanity nowadays? 


People arenâ€™t focused on themselves and on elevating themselves above the things around them but rather focused on elevating the things around them. Nice car, good job, nice home, everything thatâ€™s external to try and achieve happiness... it doesnâ€™t work and rich people who commit suicide tell us all we need to know.. our happiness lives inside waiting for us to realize it and pick it up for all to see and follow by example. If youâ€™re reading this now you most likely have struggled with depression and anxiety and know the grip of both these things so why not help another person dealing with it by conquering it and sharing your experience? You are a walking life changer when you conquer these things around you
