Trying to hold out until ChristmasI live my life from one event to another. I feel if I donâ€™t have something to look forward to then I end spiraling and wanting to end it all. Christmas is that event for me right now. Iâ€™ve been waiting for 2 years for Star Wars and i watched it but i didnâ€™t feel any emotion. Iâ€™m so fucking tired of being in Black and white . Iâ€™m so lonely.
