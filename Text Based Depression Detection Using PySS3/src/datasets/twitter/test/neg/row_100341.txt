I might not see another dayI just can't handle it anymore. I'm 21, no education because I had to drop out due to illness, no work and no work experience. Extended family hates me because of how much of a parasite on society I am and at family dinners they just trash talk me as soon as I leave the room.

I barely feel human, the thought of another human being wanting anything to do with me or not feeling disgusted by me is unthinkable. Even if I am aware it's in my head I can't really drop that feeling. I have nothing in this world, everyone hates me or judges me, and even when people are nice to me I become extremely skeptical or paranoid of their intentions and obsess about what's happened for days. You can imagine how I feel when someone is saying something actually negative to me, it's like they've torn a part of my soul out and pissed on it. Honestly I fucked up my life from an early age by dropping out of the football team, I lost all my friends and everyone saw me as a weirdo.

I just can't deal with it anymore, I really really really want to kill myself. I have a rifle ready to go and I'm trying to find a reason to live that might actually be relevant to me.
