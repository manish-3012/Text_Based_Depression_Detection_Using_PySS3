why didnt i kill myselfafter fucking another man who was a bit more than twice my age i walked home hating myself for doing any of this. that this isnt the life i wanted. that i was going to stop and work on my life. but this was my biggest distraction from everything. and not having it made my feel like shit. i tried not to cry on the bus an walking home the only thing i could ask of myself is "please kill yourself when you get home". i wanted to get drink and sit in a bath tube to wash away the filth. i could still smell the 2 guys i had seen that day on me, even this morning i can still smell/taste them. I woke up thinking i wasnt going to do this anymore. and after treating/sleeping off my hangover im back to hitting up more guys for sex. im a guy myself. i dont even consider myself gay or really enjoy having sex with other guys. what first started out as a thing i did in a really bad depressive episode is just starting to be my life now. i feel so sub-human and unsatisfied. the plan was to just be an acholhlic. and i hate drinking. i cant enjoy it anymore. not sure if sleeping around is much better but its what i do all day, trying to find someone to sleep with. i just need one more bad depressive episodes to end it all. i can never get them when i want them.
