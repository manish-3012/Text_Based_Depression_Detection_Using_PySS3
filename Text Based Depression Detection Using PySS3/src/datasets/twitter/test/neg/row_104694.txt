I lack responsibility. I am a useless citizen of the planet. I am not helping humanity move forward.*I want to forward this by saying that I am not actively suicidal. I have no plan to commit suicide tonight. If you can help a different OP, please do. I do not mean to get in the way of another person's help. I was not sure if this belonged here or on a different subreddit. My thoughts are suicidal, but the urge is usually unexpected and not at the front of my mind. Suicidal thoughts in the moment...I guess. Also, I did not proof-read my post for spelling or grammar as I am afraid I will edit out something, or that it will make me more depressed.*

Lack of purpose is killing me. I am 26 and I still do not know what I "want to do" with my life. Once in a while I'll get obsessed with something, feeling like I finally figured it out, but then it falls apart. Usually something stresses me out, like an increased work load, or a very awkward social interaction, and I will lose interest in my obsession.

Days are blending and I cannot trace time. When people ask my age, I usually hesitate as I honestly forget. The only significant memories from the past 3 years have been purchases. New chair, new desk, new car, new house. When I buy something I somehow convince myself that this is the beginning of change. Things will not be the same, everything will work out...but then the dopamine from sliding the card fades. My available credit decreases. I spiral out of control, just buying shit food and getting shit sleep.

The loneliness, too. I usually ignore it, happily sitting at my desk, cooking my meals, mowing my yard...but then I realize I do not have any friends. The first time I realized that I was in absolute shock. I go months without seeing anyone, outside of work. When I do see people, it's usually my mother, or one of my sisters. I try to text one of my old friends, but she has distanced herself from me a lot in the past five years. I think I am a burden, as I would always call her when things went spiraling out of control...but she was the only person I could turn to at that time. There were times I was certain I would have ended up killing myself if she was not there...but now she is barely there at all. When she does respond, she usually writes something sarcastic or questions my grammar.

I do not have a lot in common with the people at work. They are all married with lives outside of work. They all vent their problems at work, or lash out at other employees. They all apologize later, but I cannot handle that. I do not bring up my issues with them, just  in case one of them feels the same way I do. My boss is the worst, though. She is always in a petty fight with her husband and brings the moodiness into work. She is always sarcastic about everything and mocks me when I ask her questions...questions I do not have answers to. I always feel like I am walking on ice, even when she is in a good mood. I think she senses how timid I am around her and pounces on it when she is upset.

All of this is starting to bleed into my work life, anyways. In the past year, I have raised my voice to one of my co-workers (I should have just walked out when I got annoyed), I've walked out on my boss when she made me upset (I should have just taken it), and I have closed myself off more, just so I don't break down in the middle of the workplace, which would likely get me fired. I am also displaying poor judgement, throwing away my phone, selling almost all of my things, changing my phone number multiple times, changing account names...just no stability. I am an adult. An adult should be reliable. I do not even have control over it...I feel like I am always reviewing the stupid decisions I make, almost as though I am not present before I make the dumb decisions. I get caught up on something, but when people bring it up I have to pretend that I am still interested in it. This is making more sense in my mind than on "paper".

In the end I will be dead. All of us will be dead. The universe does not care. The universe will continue to...do whatever it is that it does...be beautiful? A well of consciousness and death? I feel like nothing matters, it's just too grand. My problems are not even real, they are all in my mind. I just wish I had some kind of control...but I don't. You know, if I lost my job right now, I would probably kill myself tomorrow...or the next day. I already know how I'll do it...just swim in the ocean and keep swimming until either I can not or until a riptide carries me away.

It scares me that suicide no longer scares me so much. I mean, it does make me nervous, but I am not so afraid anymore. I do not think I could cut myself, no self-harm...but I sometimes get the urge to drive into on-coming traffic. I become very aware of my steering wheel's power. Just a turn into a tractor trailer's path and I am done for. I just do not know what to do. I mean, is this the kind of thing I can call a line for? I never feel like the threat is immediate, but the frequency of the thoughts is alarming to me.
