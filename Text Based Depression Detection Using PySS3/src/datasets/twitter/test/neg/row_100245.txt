I donâ€™t know anymoreI donâ€™t want to sound like a pssy or pathetic for saying this but in March I quit year round swim team for the first time in four years I hated it for the last two years I was on it I showed up to practice so many times sobbing because of it. In February I was struggling a lot with disordered eating and was at my worst and being in a swim suit didnâ€™t make it any better. Anyways my mom is forcing me back into it and Iâ€™m honestly going to slit my wrists if I get put in it. The only reason I got to quit in March was because I had self harmed all up my arm and wrist and had to beg my mom to not let me go to advoid the humiliation from people who hate me. My mom only wants me to do it because she thinks Iâ€™m disgustingly obese and constantly bullies me about it. Iâ€™m not going to get into every single abusive thing my parents have done to me but after this I quit Iâ€™ve had enough of their shit.
