Maybe This is My YearI think it is. I think this is the year I kill myself. Attempted once a little over a year ago, and damn if I didn't fuck that up. Was a shame too, now I'm in tens of thousands of dollars in debt. 

I can feel it. I mean throughout *every* day there is this vague, physical feeling, and I'm probably ten feet from the edge of this hypothetical, metaphorical cliff. I want to be closer, I want to pass that finish line and die. Drop dead. I just fucking hate everything about this pathetic life of mine. 

I don't even need to type it out. My life sucks. No details needed. I'm the model image of the pathetic life story. Broke. Unemployed. Severely mentally fucked up. I mean, *really*? Do you really need the details on my pathetic parasitic shit stain of a life? Didn't think so.

Here's to hoping I get the fucking balls to off myself and finally get to sleep that cozy little dirt nap.
