I want to die because I feel like a burden to everyone.I don't know if I have depression, but it seems likely and I'm seeing someone to maybe get some anti-depressants. 

The thing is, I don't think I even feel that depressed. I feel quite calm, I haven't cried in a few days, and the thought of death doesn't really scare me anymore. 

I've been thinking of killing myself for a few weeks now, and it's not so much that I want to escape the pain I'm feeling (although that's part of it), but because I feel like there's nothing left for me to do in life, and mostly because I feel like everyone would be better off without me. 

My family's pretty short on money, and I know our finances would be better if I wasn't living at home and sucking up our resources with food, energy and water bills, etc. none of which I can afford to pay. 

I argue with my family more often than I don't. I could never live up to my mum's perfectionist expectations and this has resulted in her - and me - being disappointed by basically every aspect of my life. 

I don't know if it's depression that causes me to do this, but I feel utterly worthless because I can't seem to behave like a normal human. Everyone else goes off to work early and I roll out of bed at 2pm and force myself to have a shower. I don't even have the effort to revise for my upcoming exams, and while everyone else is contributing to society, I'm just sitting on the couch cutting and debating whether or not to walk down to the train station and kill myself, and that makes me feel even more pathetic and useless. I mean, I'm barely a functioning human anymore, so why the fuck do I still deserve to be alive?
