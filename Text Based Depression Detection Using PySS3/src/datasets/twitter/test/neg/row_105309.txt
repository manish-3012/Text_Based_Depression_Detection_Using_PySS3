In the hospital under certification, feeling hopeless.I am writing this from the hospital. Thank god I have wi-fi, or I would go insane all together. I was certified last Friday, because the doctor believes I am suffering from Anorexia Nervosa. I am 85 Lbs at 5 foot 2, a reasonable weight for my height. On Friday, I was told that they were going to certify me and give me an IV (TPN, no lipids). The doctor told me right away that I had no say in this. I got really upset, so they knocked me out and I woke up connected to IV. 72 hours later, they signed the second certificate. They are not letting me out until I put on weight, which I am not going to agree to. I don't feel like getting into it to much, but being skinny is the only option for me. I am female to male and if I gain weight, I will look like a woman. This is killing me inside, and I don't know how much more I can take. I hope I die soon.
