feel so alone and like my life will never be as good as things used to beever since quarantine and since my ex partner and also friend cut me off completely out of nowhere, ive closed myself off out of fear that hes spreading shit about me. 

my fears have been partially confirmed; one of my friends said she almost dropped me as her friend bc of the shit he told her...but she changed her mind after listening to me and realizing that ive been going thru therapy and medicine meanwhile hes just doing nothing and getting high/drunk all the time

a few friends have been ghosting me and blowing me off when we've set up plans to call and game

i feel like ive completely forgotten how to make friends. my trust has been broken so much with how my ex would tell me how glad he was to have me as a friend and how much he cared about me, only to ignore me and completely cut me off out of nowhere

i have crippling anxiety talking to new people and trying to get closer to them. ive matched with a few people as friends on bumble but im mortified to talk to them

im only 20 but i feel like im never gonna find a love as intense as things were with him. we were really serious, gonna move in together and talked about marrying. then he just. threw me out. and is talking about me as if im some crazy ex girlfriend, when he was the one treating me terribly towards the end.

i feel like my friend group is shsttered. im scared to reach out to mutual friends out of fear that they hate me bc of what hes telling people. im scared i cant make friends anymore because of that and my extreme anxiety.

im so tired all the time. i wanted to at least live til i turn 21 this year but everything is so fucking hard and things just keep getting worse, my local arcade is closing...i just. can't see how things are going to get better bc they just keep getting worse and i just want to disappear
