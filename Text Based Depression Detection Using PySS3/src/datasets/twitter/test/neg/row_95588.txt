I HATE HUMANITYI HATE BEING A MEMBER OF HUMANITY. I HATE ALL THE TERRIBLE WORST ASPECTS OF THIS BARBARIC SPECIES. I HATE ALL THE INJUSTICES THAT HUMANS COMMIT AGAINST EACH OTHER. BEING ALIVE ON THIS EARTH IS PURE ABJECT TERROR AND I CAN FEEL FIRES RAGING BENEATH MY SKIN I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE I NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.
