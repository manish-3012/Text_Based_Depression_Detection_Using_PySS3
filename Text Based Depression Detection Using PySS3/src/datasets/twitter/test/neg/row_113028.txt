Feeling like shit even though my life is pretty sucessfulI am just a horrible person if you look at it from my view.   
What's even worse (or better) is that nobody notices how I evil I can be.   
And because I realised this I just want to end it all. Yes I shouldn't say that but I just do more harm than good.
