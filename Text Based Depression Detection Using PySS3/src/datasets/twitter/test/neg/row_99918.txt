The problem is just me.Iâ€™m 19 and Iâ€™m from a low income family in a low income neighborhood. The only thing I do all day is work on my hobbies (photography and coding) because nobody ever wants to hang out with me. All my old friend groups from high school still hang out without me and show it all over social media. I still talk and share memes with them sometimes but I never get an invite. The problem has to be me, I must be the problem.

But thereâ€™s college, right? College is where everybody meets their lifelong friends! 
Nope. The few people I managed to talk to still treat me the same way. No real relationships outside of meme exchanges and the odd anime debate.

It feels like Iâ€™m back where I started before high school: no friends and quiet summers spent in my room learning web development from youtube tutorials because my anxiety over my future wonâ€™t let me play video games (not that I know anybody who plays the same games as me).

One thing Iâ€™ve heard over the years is â€œwow youâ€™re good at so many things!â€ or â€œyouâ€™re so talented!â€ but little do they know itâ€™s because I have no friends or opportunities waiting to occupy my time. Iâ€™m sitting in my room all day constantly hoping that all my knowledge and skill will be worth it somehow.

But the only word people throw at me is â€œnetworkâ€. Iâ€™m already super introverted as it is. Itâ€™s hard for me to get interested in other people.

I just donâ€™t see a way out for me in my situation. I have all this knowledge but my gpa sucks. In a great time in human history when anyone can become anything by putting something out on the internet, itâ€™s like the world chooses not to see me.

The world doesnâ€™t want to see me.
Nobody wants me in their friend circles.
I donâ€™t belong on this planet at all.
