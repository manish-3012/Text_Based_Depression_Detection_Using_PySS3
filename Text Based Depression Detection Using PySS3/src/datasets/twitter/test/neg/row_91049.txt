Serious questionIs there something after death? Is life just worthless suffering? There has to be something on the other side that makes this all worth it, there has to be. Iâ€™m just thinking, if im going to suffer for the rest of my life, why not end it sooner. Im having a crisis about no/any afterlife. If there is, what the fuck would it be? I came into this world as a form of a â€œhumanâ€ with billions of others wondering the same thing. How and why is any of this real? What is reality anyways? Is all this an illusion?

Fucking kill me
