Failed at my first suicide attempt, and now contemplating trying again.But I have my doubts. I've been diagnosed with depression for about a year now, altough I suspect that I've had it for longer. I've gotten to a point where every little problem feels huge. I just got into a small fight with my mother and that made me get my antidepressants, along with quite a lof of caffeine pills. The reason why I am doubting myself is because I should be more happy than I have ever been. I'm no longer a social outcast, I feel like myself when I interact with other people. Might be a stupid question, but does any of you feel like killing yourself makes no sense, but it still feels like best solution?
