Going nowhereHi...

I'm a male. I'm 21. I live with my parents. I'm unemployed. I'm a virgin. I'm a stereotype.

I'm deeply unsatisfied with life. I have nowhere to go. I have nothing to push me, and nothing to reach for. I just want to go... I'm so tired.

This world demands so much. I can't do it. I feel like I need to scrape together every ounce of my energy just to reach the minimum.

I'm fortunate to have good parents who are accepting of my situation, but therein lies the problem as well. I've had such a comfortable, accommodated life. I've never been pushed or challenged. Not really.

I keep looking back at my life. Examining it. Feeling it. All the textures and flavors of the many seasons I've experienced. Experience is such a rich thing. My life is my own, no one has had a life the same as mine. And yet the end result doesn't change. I'm still here. Still blind and hopeless...

My mind is sick... I'm not whole... And... I have no one in my life that really sees me. I'm so alone. I don't think I can ever be well...

I just want to die... I mean... I don't, but I can't look into my future without sinking into hopelessness... Not because of my situation, but because of who I am... This person I've become can't handle what the real world is made of... I can't do it

I can't do it  
I'm sorry for everything... For all of this. Nobody sees me
