I am at the seaside and I just want to drownI am at the seaside right now with my parents and I just want to fucking drown. I feel so unconfortable in my own skin. There are tons of people here and I can't stand seeing another human being looking at me. I just want to stay in my hotel room all day, I can't go outside but I need to because my fucking parents get upset when they see me depressed. I would like to drown so they can think it was an accident. Help
