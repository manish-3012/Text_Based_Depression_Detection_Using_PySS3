I have been trying for 3 years now to give life another chance but i think today is my last day.Time after time I have been dealing with money problem , death in my family , being homeless and much more... but now im done , my fucking car broke AGAIN and i just dont have the money, even today i was considering : food or not eating . Just to save money . Fuck money , fuck whatever made me come on this fucking planet , fuck whoever is the " god " that decided we need to feel pain. Idk what to expect from here but i wish you all happiness and some good luck.
