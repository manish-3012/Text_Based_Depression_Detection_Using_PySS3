dont know what the fuck im doing with my lifeIm 17,   never had any friends really. Feel ugly as shit, like, unusually ugly. Dont do any work in school and honestly cant imagine ever getting a job,  even an easy one. Feel like humans shouldnt have to work for the right to live humanely. Im extremely scared about whats to come once im 20 or so because im not going to let myself stay at my parents' house, and i cant imagine doing anything besides killing myself or being homeless,  or some crazy delusional shit that will never happen like getting big livestreaming (I know, it sounds stupid. I watch alot of ice poseidon and it seems like a dope ass life). I got put in a mental ward back in october for a night (was supposed to be a week but my mom got me out)for telling a therapist If i were to kill myself itd be by hanging and that id been on the brink before. Im now in an outpatient program and it just started but it seems like it wont do anything. Im on Prozac now after Zoloft, Lexapro, and cymbalta and its not gonna do anything just like the other ones. I legit just sit here all day playing video games and am doing nothing with my life, but i dont know what to do because I couldnt even handle a job so fuckit.
