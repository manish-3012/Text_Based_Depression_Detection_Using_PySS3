Been very depressed lately.Yes, this is a throwaway. Ignore the account name.

Straight down to business: I've been depressed for almost a year now. I am 17, and I have a growth hormone deficiency. The deficiency has made it hard on me for a while now. I am much shorter and less matured than many of my classmates, which hurts my social life. I've had people ask me if I was a little brother to my classmates. No girls like me either, worsening the issue. 2 good friends of mine have passed away in the past year, adding to my depression.. I'm having trouble keeping my grades and exam scores up in school, and my parents are very disappointed and won't let me hear the end of it. As of now, life isn't going so good, and I am concerned with whether I am going to be able to make anything out of my life or not. Things are happening too fast, grades are dropping, and I can't keep up with all the work I have to do.

Tl;dr: Having trouble in school, 2 close friends died, growth hormone deficiency, parents not making it easy. I'm very lonely and have very little friends.

Edit: Details.

I just need a reason to put up with all of this. I certainly can't find one myself.
