I fucking hate myselfItâ€™s like everything is always wrong with me. Iâ€™m a fucking broken, horrible person. Iâ€™m boring, mean, ugly, I held out hope that it would get better for so, so fucking long and I wish I hadnâ€™t. Even my dad says Iâ€™m a worthless ugly bitch. Iâ€™m so fucking tired of this. I know everyone wants me dead. Itâ€™s like the only way I can be happy is by being a self centered dick but I donâ€™t wanna hurt those around me I just wanna be happy. This is all so fucking stupid and I want it to end. Iâ€™m just hoping I make it to when school starts again, maybe then Iâ€™ll have something to fill my time (and, thank any god I can, more drugs). But probably not.
