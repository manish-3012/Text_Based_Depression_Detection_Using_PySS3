giving up.I think it's all I have left to do? 

I'm unattractive, to the point that I don't even have friends. No one wants anything to do with me despite trying all the time. 

I feel like a hassle for my boyfriend, who I barely feel attracted to. Every girl I try to talk to shoots me down in record time. My family hates me.

I have no job, nothing positive comes from my existence.
