I wanted to commit suicide today at nightI was in woods and I really hard a gun in my hands I wanted to murder myself literally murder. Yesterday I found out the girl I'm crazy in love with got a boyfriend and she didn't even care about me. She knew I'm so in love with but she kept saying"I can't control my feelings" when I talked with her that day she said " okay I'll text you later I'm with daddy r n " and believe me or no I was crying 4 hours after I read that I still wanna kill myself but someone saved me yesterday. I just want someone to sleep with me and help me deal with pain. I know I'm ugly stupid useless creature but is it too much to ask for? Why don't people help the ones who need help? Why they keep saying we do it for attention? Why?
