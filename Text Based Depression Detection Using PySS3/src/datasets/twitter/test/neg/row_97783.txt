i've lost controli'm here because i didn't know what else to do. i don't really use reddit much but i literally have no idea where else to turn. i've tried everything. doctors don't care. a+e leave me sitting in triage vomiting up my stomach lining for hours on 'suicide watch' and then send me home. my friends know, and they care, but there's nothing they can do to make me do anything. i can't make myself get better. i don't know how. i don't know what's wrong. i want to kill myself, all the time. i don't because i have a 14 year old sister. she has anxiety already and i think it would destroy her. 

so i hurt myself instead. it's gotten bad, worse than it's ever been, and the last year has been a journey through addiction that is never-ending. i can't go a day without getting stoned and taking xanax; i'm terrified for christmas because i'll have to lay off the weed for at least a few days. i don't know if i'll cope. 

i know that if i take all the xanax i have i will be so calm, so uninhibited, that i will not mind pressing the blade deeper than i ever have before, testing the limits, finding somewhere that satisfies me. i would be able to die calmly. it wouldn't stop the people around me getting hurt, but i've been selfless my whole god damn life, i can't think about anything without guilt and fear for how other people will feel, so if am going to do ONE selfish fucking thing then i'm going to kill myself. 

i don't know. i don't know what to do. either i kill myself or... i keep getting further and further removed from reality, my paranoia growing and my thoughts becoming more incoherent and my actions less and less my own until i'm a husk

something is very wrong with me but nobody will fix it because i can't explain what is wrong with me so i think i have to fucking die. i literally don't know what else to fucking do. i don't know.
