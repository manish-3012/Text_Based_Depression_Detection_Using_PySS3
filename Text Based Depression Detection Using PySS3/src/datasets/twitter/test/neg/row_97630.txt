20 years old. Getting closer to killing myself everyday.I donâ€™t see any point in my existence. Iâ€™ve been trying so hard to work on myself these past few years. Going to the gym. Focusing on school. Reading self help books. Sure, all of these things have improved my health and career, but Iâ€™m so alone. Everyone overlooks me. Every girl sees me as the â€œnice guy friendâ€ that they could never see dating. Iâ€™m the third wheel friend in every group that gets picked on. Bullied and irrelevant all my life. My parents are busy with their own shit to help me; they canâ€™t even begin to understand half my problems as a young adult facing loneliness everyday.

I donâ€™t want to live anymore. Whatâ€™s the point of working so hard to be successful after school if Iâ€™m alone? I will be spending money...alone. I will be traveling...alone. I will be doing everything...alone, and ultimately, I will die alone. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll live a day past 25. I really hope there is an afterlife and I hope Allah will understand if it happens. I donâ€™t know if I can handle this petty existence anymore.
