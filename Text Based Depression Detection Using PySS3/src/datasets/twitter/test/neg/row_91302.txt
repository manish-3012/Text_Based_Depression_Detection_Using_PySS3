I Can't Cope With This BreakupI have been in a toxic/abusive relationship for 8 years. The last 3 years of this relationship has been an open relationship against my wishes. My situation is confusing to explain but I ended up falling in love with the secondary boyfriend. I broke up with my abusive boyfriend for the second boyfriend. 

I felt like everything was coming together in my life. I met someone that treats me well that I connect with so deeply. They repeatedly told me that they will always be here for me and that we are a serious relationship. We were together for 2.5 years. They broke up with me a month ago due to their own issues that they're dealing with and also saying that they just fell out of love with me. 

These are the only two relationships I've ever been in. Both of them I gave my all. I would always be there for them. I always stood by them even when it was abusive to me. 

I live with my ex-boyfriend and can't afford to break the mortgage. I will have to live with him for 3 years. 

I don't have any friends. 

I've worked at the same workplace for 7 years. Multiple coworkers call me by the wrong name. I'm taken advantage of there. 

I'm very shy and have horrible self esteem. I have no hobbies or talents. I try to do things but I don't see a point when there's someone else better than me. 

I do yoga every day. I go running 3 times a week. 

I cry every single day every few hours. I feel empty. It's so hard to get out of bed to go to work. It's so hard to keep it together at work and I've been crying at my desk. 

I have nothing to look forward to. I have no one to connect with. 

I know I am relatively healthy, I have two loving parents, I have an OK paying job, I own a home, I have a car but the emptiness I feel from losing someone that meant so much to me is devastating. I feel like I can't make it much longer. 

I don't even know I could kill myself. I know that I can't but right now it's just really painful to be living.
