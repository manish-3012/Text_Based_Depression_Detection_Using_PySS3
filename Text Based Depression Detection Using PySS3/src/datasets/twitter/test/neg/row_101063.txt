It's about time it all stoppedI've spent 3 days writing a goodbye note. It's finally finished. I've outlined everything that has been wrong, everything I've been struggling with. I'm hoping it will leave my family with some sort of closure. It's got to happen tonight. I was going to do it today, I called in sick to work so I could do it whilst my family is out. I ended up spending the day with my ex, the mother of my child. I wanted her to have a good day so she's going something nice to remember me by. 

My little boy is 3. He deserves a better life than I could give him.

I've spent weeks planning this, this isn't something I've thought lightly about. It's going to happen and it's going to happen tonight. 

I've been struggling for so long now, too long and I cannot deal with it anymore. 

I hope everyone on here can find some peace in their life. It shouldn't have to be like this. Life is really hard but this shouldn't be a resolution to our problem's. Unfortunately I just don't see any way of things ever getting better. The debt alone is more than I can cope with. It has to stop, today.
