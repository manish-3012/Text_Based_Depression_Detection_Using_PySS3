Assessing the oddsHi guys, I'm a 25 y/o American woman. I was abused as a kid and I've cut off my family, so a lot of the times living feels pretty lonely. There's a strong chance my (abusive) mom had BPD or bipolar disorder, and I think there's a strong possibility that I have BPD now. I'm erratic, dramatic, needy, clingy-- I scare off potential partners before they're with me for even a year, I dump my emotions on people only to apologize and grovel afterwards for them not to leave me alone.

The last guy, he knew about all my trauma and all my past and he said we would stick together, no problem. He left me over the weekend. Every part of me that could have started to trust a person is dead, I have no more left in me

I hate myself. I know I am a piece of shit because I put all of my feelings on people. There is nowhere else for me to put these feelings; nothing works and when I try to explain my situation to people I get no sympathy and no love, just a cocked eyebrow or a "Jesus christ this bitch is crazy." People with BPD have a 1 in 10 rate of suicide, and I can see why. I am alone and everything hurts. I want to speed up the inevitable, I don't see a reason to mull around in this pain and this loneliness for a few more years before I bring even more heartbreak on myself and kill myself anyway
