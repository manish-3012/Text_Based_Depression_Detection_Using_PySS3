Perfect life and a fucked up mindLoving family, only child but lots of cousins, moved around a lot but got to see different sides of society. Except, I cant get out of my head, the voices rarely leave me alone. I want to get through a day without feeling like loading up the 22. is my only hope. Feeling like a monster eating joy out of peoples lives, but I almost don't care if they're sad that I want to die.
