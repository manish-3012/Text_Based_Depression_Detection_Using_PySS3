safe to talk when this anonymousEver think about killing yourself? I do. I think about killing myself a lot it seems. It's at the unfortunate place of seeming more like an inevitability than a distant prodding potential future. I talked to a good friend about it a few weeks ago, all he said to me was how selfish it would be if I did; I only felt worse about myself and thereby closer to the inevitable. I didn't go to a funeral of a family friend on sunday because I was scared of where my mind would take me and what I might decide to do about it. I have no idea why I'm posting this. All I know is that I am broken and I need someone to know, anyone it seems. 23m.
