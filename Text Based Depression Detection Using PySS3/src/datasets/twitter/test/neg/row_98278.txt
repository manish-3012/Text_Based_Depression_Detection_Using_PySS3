I've gone and done it... the Holy Grail of Suicide.I finally snapped. What have I done? I planned this... went to Mexico City, went to a vet shop, and asked for it... Pentobarbital. 

The girl was extremely hesitant, but proceeded to sell it to me after some talking. 2 bottles of the damn thing, 100ml each one. The cost? 34 bucks. 

I'm lost... I am now in possession of one of the deadliest and most effective and painless way to end one's existence. 

The expiration date on both of them are for March 2020, which means I have roughly two years to decide if I want to go through with this. But for now... God, I'm really far gone now.
