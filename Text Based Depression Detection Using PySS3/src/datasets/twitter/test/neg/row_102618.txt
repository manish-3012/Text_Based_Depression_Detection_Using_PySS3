Feeling low at a partyWouldn't say I'm at risk of being any harm to myself right now, but feeling fairly helpless... I don't know what to do, this feeling happens all the time and it's scary to me... I'll be surrounded by people I love and care about and immediately feel so helpless... I'd never go so far as to take my own life but I'm afraid of this feeling of desperation... What do I do? Someone help me... I feel so alone and don't know what to do
