"Acting your age" and I am tiredHi. Using my "depressed bitch throwaway" for this cause why not.

I don't act my age. By that I mean I act way older than I am. I don't do this intentionally. Nor do I do that to garner attention or be "cool" (I have always hated this word) I literally just exist and do what I like. With this recent trend of hating on teens acting a lot older makes me insecure of who I am. I curse a lot, smoke (thanks to family but I am very close to giving it up!) make sexual jokes, mess around with guys etc. Might I add I am a well behaved kid, have good grades, I don't do stupid shit like wearing provocative clothes/posting provocative pics online cause I think it is cheap and degrading. Haven't been with anyone older (am the age of consent in my country) although have playfully flirted with some older friends but absolutely nothing serious. Nor have I ever entered a situation where there's any danger because well, I know all too well.

Where is the problem?

Well. I just fucking want to fit in! I just want to be whatever society wants me. I want to fit in and want every one to like me. My stupid age or my terrible personality is not something I can fucking change. Tried to change my personality a lot got more suicidal instead. I just want people to like me, see me as a person despite my age.  I am not immature as a person either, I take full responsibility for anything I do. The reason I am like this is a whole another shit show in itself. Hit puberty wayyy too early, got sexually abused by mom, and still getting verbally, physically, emotionally abused by parents lmao. I cannot act like act like a child as my parents expect me to (they still cannot expect I am not 12 and keeps calling me 12 in a condescending way even though I am well past that age. I don't knoww I just want to be accepted. Gladly I have a circle of friends who does that but my depression keeps telling me I need to be "normal" and need everyone to like me otherwise I am worthless.

I wish for once I could go through with a sui attempt.
