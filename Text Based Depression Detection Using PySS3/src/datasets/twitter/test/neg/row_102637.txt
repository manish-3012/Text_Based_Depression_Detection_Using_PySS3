i've been sexually assaulted, i'm bipolar and suicidal and all i want is some acknowledgementtldr's the title/last paragraph i guess, below's just been my life and why i'm here now... itd mean much if you read through it all (its probably going be long but whatever) but even if not, honestly, its okay, the title is kind of enough, i guess

"I've never felt normal." It's the David Copperfield opener of mental health accounts, and honestly, this whole account is probably the David Copperfield of a bipolar loser (Dickens can bite me, this is about as boring, too...)

However, I'd like to clarify that. Not normal, as in, *fitting in*; when I say "I've never felt normal", I mean it's just, I've never felt what I think I'm *supposed to have felt*. I know that because I have a hard time reacting  to things the way that people around me react to them, like laughing too hard rather than just enough. 

Granted, I don't feel *normal*, the other way, *the fitting in* way, either. But that was a development in early school, when a few kids relentlessly bullied me for having shoes with holes in them and for being the real life equivalent of a Pokemon bug catcher (and, to their credit, I was pretty fucking weird). 

In middle school, I spent so long looking for ways to explain it. I didn't know any better, so I just told people who I wanted to like me (lied?) that I had depression. My parents really loved me but... I don't know, it was sort of scary raising the point with them. So I never told them, either. And I continued to be bullied, too. I'm half-Korean, half-white (don't worry, I'm not one of those weird half-asian incels or something, haha) and in school I was never given much room to be with the white kids, and a lot of my asian-american friends gave me shit for being pretty bad academically. There's a large misconception that bullying has all moved to social media. Granted, I'm sure people have talked mad shit behind my back, too. However, there's nothing quite like having a chair thrown in your face. Or being straight up told you act like a school shooter. Or "accidentally" mishearing that you've never seen someone quite as weird and ugly as you. That's the sort of normalized hell, the *regular* feelings of just utter hate and utter helplessness that is bullying. You might just be a nerd who likes minecraft too much. You might post cringey things on facebook. You might even just have a laugh that a kid at church thinks sounds like a serial killer's. Whatever it is, you suddenly can only feel hatred for everyone and helplessness at your own *weirdness*. That got to me, and so by high school I was determined to fit in. And hey, by tenth grade, I kind-of-sort-of did. I even got decent grades. I was *even* talking to a girl I mostly knew online who said she liked me (god, I was solid niceguys material back then). But nothing ever really improved. That girl mentally abused me before one day just ignoring me. I still got made fun of here and there. In 11th grade I was sexually assaulted by someone I refuse to name even on reddit because I'm honestly pretty scared of them. In turn I was pretty fucked up, if not slightly abusive, to the few friends and interests I had. It goes on, and though I guess I stumbled into some pretense of normalcy and academic achievement by senior year I was also regularly having suicidal thoughts and psychotic breakdowns whenever I was alone in my room. I got into a good NYC college and ran across the finish line.

Freshman year (last year) was possibly the most hellish experiences of my life. My school is a commuter school more or less. There's no campus, no student life, no nothing social. I ran from girl/boyfriend to girl/boyfriend (I guess I'm coming out on that, and wow that was syntactically sort of awkward to type) either being slightly psychotic/abusive or being abused in turn, and during finals week was abused and (somewhat accidentally) sexually assaulted by a girl I was seeing. I stayed in my dorm the entire winter and then had a complete and utter mental breakdown come february after another relationship in which I was abusive. At that point, wee-woo, wee-woo, I made a trip to a hospital over suicide at which point I got sent home for a week to get diagnosed with bipolar disorder and be given some antipsychotics to take every night.

Things got better as I improved as a human and tried to make amends and/or be the better person for people around me. And I guess nowadays, I'm at the most materialistic level doing pretty well. 

The feelings never change, though. And even with the medicines, they poke through every few hours in a manic-depressive episode that has me in my room either crying, cutting at the air with a pocket knife my dad got me for my 8th birthday, or just in a ball feeling totally and utterly suicidal. I have rape fantasies at least once a week where I can't keep intrusive thoughts about me being assaulted or raped again out of my head. I have moments of helplessness where I relive little things like when my mom accidentally laughed because she couldn't imagine how a guy could be sexually assaulted by a girl and thought I was playing a cruel joke. I regularly have anxiety attacks about all the people I know have said things about me ("School shooter", "fucking weirdo", "sensitive loser" anyone?) and depressive episodes about all the friendships I, my mental illness, or some combination of both, have managed to just completely fuck up. I'm tired of everything and I'm completely without a clue about what to do, and the only thing I can say with certainty about my future is that I'm probably going to kill myself before I hit 30. I don't know, this is all I've got left in me. Thank for reading. I just get so tired.
