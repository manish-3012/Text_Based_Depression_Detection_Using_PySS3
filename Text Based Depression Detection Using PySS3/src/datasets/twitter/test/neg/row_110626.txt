On the verge of ending it. So apathetic about it. Please help me.This is a throwaway. 

I'm a 19 year old girl and I can't do it anymore. I feel bad just writing this and venting because I hate putting my problems onto other people. I just don't know what else to do. 

I feel hopeless and I feel like no one really appreciates me. I know that's not true and that many people would be sad if I was gone but it doesn't feel that way. I do a lot for other people, a lot, not trying to sound high and mighty but I do and while I don't expect anything in return, there is no one helping me make my life easier/more fun/happier. 

The crux of it all is I just don't want to DO anything. I have a therapist but I know I need medication and maybe taking some time off school for residential/inpatient but I don't want to. I've been to inpatient three times already before I was 16 and I don't want to go back. I just don't feel worth saving anymore. 

Every day is fucking exhausting because even if I wake up feeling good, something will drag me down once again. 

This is probably a super minor problem compared to others so I'm sorry if you took the time to read this. That's my main problem- there's nothing inherently bad going on in my life- I just feel like dying and don't feel like getting myself help. I'm not worth it. 

I just need someone to listen to me and hear my pain. Everyone in my life always talks about treatment methods which is great and helpful and important, but I can't do that right now. I just need someone who understands.

I can't do this anymore. Again, I'm sorry if I wasted your time with this incoherent mess.
