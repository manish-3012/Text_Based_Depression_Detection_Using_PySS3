I regret not killing myself earlier.I am 26 years old, having suicidal thoughts since childhood. I tried killing myself many time in my teens but could not succeed. People around me saved me most of the time. Now I don't have the courage or energy for suicide. I wish someone kill me. I wish to erase myself from everyone's memory and from this world.
