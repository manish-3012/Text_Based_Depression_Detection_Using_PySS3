I'm tiredTo everyone who tried, 

I'm sorry I don't have the energy to stay. Just can't bear to fight myself much longer. My brain is too broken and my body is giving up on me.

Please understand that I tried my best. It wasn't anything someone did or didn't do. I'm simply tired. I feel like a ghost.

Thanks for the happy times.
