Losing my girlfriend and its all my faultWe have had an argument over an instagram photo i liked i know i fucked up big and ive hurt her so badly she has very little trust in me and ive made her think i dont want her even tho she is amazing and ive complimented her everyday on her amazing body, its like when she talks everything is silent but she cant seem to trust me anymore and its killing me because i have never intended to hurt her like that im now known to her as the boyfriend who made her insecure about her body even tho i love it, i feel like whats the point now im over my job and this same shit different day bullshit routine life seems so pointless i feel what ever i touch i break and i cant seem to please her and i dont think i can get her to be trusting in me
