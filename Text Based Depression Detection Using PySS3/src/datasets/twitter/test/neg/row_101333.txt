Iâ€™ve ruined yet another friendship and Iâ€™m ready to give upI think Iâ€™m ready to just give up 

Iâ€™ve always been a mess of a person and this week Iâ€™ve once again fucked everything up 

Iâ€™ve never had any meaningful relationship (only ever had one girlfriend and that didnâ€™t last long) and never been able to keep friends. I do the same thing every time I meet someone and become close to them 

I become far to clingy, overly attached and become overbearing and try to hard, and eventually I push them away. It has happened before and now itâ€™s happened again

I never mean any harm. Iâ€™m just a sad lonely person who wants a friend but then I always take things to far. Iâ€™m insecure and worry about every little thing and get paranoid about everything and overthink everything and itâ€™s killing me. It causes problems with everyone I love and eventually I take things too far 

For the last year or so Iâ€™ve only had one friend, a girl I work with. I think the world of her and, like I said, became very attached to her. I put a lot of pressure on her and depended on her a lot. She has a boyfriend but Iâ€™ve honestly never wanted anything more than to be friends, but obviously Iâ€™ve become too much. Iâ€™ve never ever meant any harm or to cause any trouble. I never meant to upset or worry anyone

The two of use worked together as a team of two for months and I loved it. However a couple of months ago she was swapped with someone else in work and I basically lost the plot. Iâ€™m never going to defend myself or the way Iâ€™ve acted but thatâ€™s the point. I threw tantrums, did things for attention, didnâ€™t want to work with anyone else, all because I was too attached to her. Iâ€™ve acted up a lot and Iâ€™ve upset my friend and caused her stress. She knows about me self harming and having suicidal thoughts and broke down in front of me saying sheâ€™s terrified and that sheâ€™d blame herself if anything happened

Last week my supervisor spoke to our manager about it and now Iâ€™m being told that Iâ€™m not good for my friend  and that her boyfriend isnâ€™t happy (I completely understand) and Iâ€™ve been told that outside communication needs to stop and there needs to be boundaries, so not sounds like they are telling me I canâ€™t be mates with the only friend Iâ€™ve got 

She text me herself saying that she just wants my tantrums to stop and wants us to go back to being mates and having a laugh. She said her boyfriend wants her to block me but she doesnâ€™t want that and just wants to be happy and joke around like we used to. She said she doesnâ€™t want to stop texting outside work or working together because doesnâ€™t want to lose me as a friend (which obviously I donâ€™t want either). But how can we do that it the others we work with are telling me there needs to be boundaries? Iâ€™ve ducked up like no always do and now nothing is going to be the same. Even if she is ok and wants to be friends, Iâ€™m now worried that the others are going to try to separate us and keep me away from her 

I completely understand that this is all my fault and thatâ€™s the problem. Iâ€™ve done this before and I know Iâ€™ll do it again. I meet someone, get far too attached to that person and then eventually fuck it up. I ruin every friendship I have just because I go to far and I canâ€™t keep doing it 

Iâ€™m ready to just give up. I canâ€™t keep living like this. But now Iâ€™m worried that my friend will blame herself if I kill myself and thatâ€™s always been the reason why I havenâ€™t. Because I donâ€™t want to upset my family and I donâ€™t want them blaming themselves and now Iâ€™ve got to worry about her blaming herself 

But the selfish side of me just wants this to end
