I need a solid opinion.Donâ€™t question why Iâ€™m asking, or anything about this, I just want some serious answers honestly. Iâ€™ve been depressed and suicidal for about 6 years now, but just have never had the balls the actually kill myself. Iâ€™m 19, going on 20 in February and I just honestly cannot handle life anymore. Depression and anxiety run in my family but having a solid 15 concussions definitely doesnâ€™t help. Anyways I think Iâ€™m going to actually follow through with my thoughts and hang myself later this evening or tomorrow. I just really want to know how my mom would react... we havenâ€™t been close in a few years as her boyfriend has totally taken her away from me (we still live together and such itâ€™s just a long story) and I just donâ€™t know. My moms my everything and the last thing I want to do is hurt her. But I just canâ€™t do it anymore. Iâ€™m mentally and physically done. I just donâ€™t know.... I donâ€™t want or need any of the comments saying how good life is and blah blah blah. Seriously because that will never change a suicidal persons thoughts, if not only encourage them as it just goes to show them how fucking shitty their life really, and yeah maybe one day it will get better but nobody should have to live with these thoughts a day longer than they already have.
