It doesn't seem worth itNothing goes right. Nothing. I was in a hospital a few months ago and it felt like prison. I hope that I die before I ever go back. The people there are fucked. They aren't people. I can never go back to that shit. Yet if I feel so depressed that's where I have to be. I'm done. I don't want to wake up when I sleep. I really don't.
