It finally was too much for me to takeI want to write something here, but I just feel empty, all the time I have so much bottled up and now there is just ... Nothing.

Today everything caught up to me. I never wanted to hurt those that love me, never wanted to hurt my family. But at least it wont be them who find me.

Took every pill I got with me and now sitting in a forest far away from home alone like I always am. Just with my phone and some bottles and packages of pills.

I just hope it works. And that it doesnt hurt too much.
