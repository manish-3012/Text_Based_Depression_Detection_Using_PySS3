I'm too old for this shitTell a kid "it get's better" enough times and they start to believe you. Tell them it's their age enough times and they start to believe you. 

I'm 30 now. The dog helps most days, best thing that ever happened to me, but someonme gave me the advice to try and make friends on FB because I'm a genderqueer pansexual athiest socialist in rural Texas -- tell you what, the feel of facebook is significantly worse than my town. 

But the big think is that the world is getting more fascist, we're killing more people, poverty is increasing, and people think the solution is either a white ethnostate or using different words and being more liberal. 

The world is not getting better, the worse is getting easier and easier to find, and I haven't even held someone else's hand since my divorce 10 years ago. Ah, and I live on about 150 bucks a month after rent, because, you know, 11 bucks an hour with student debt for 2 degrees and a house that should be condemned is just fracking fine. 

I'm tired. So damn tired. I'm also a coward and "better the devil you know" and all that - but I'm tired, and I hate myself, and my country, and the world, and I just want to sleep. It doesn't get better. It get's easier, but that's just tolerance. 

Deleted the FB account, I'll probably have all this, all of me, locked back in the box after a few days of listening to Discworld books at work. But - is that all there is to life? Do everything you can not to think? No past, no future, and live not in the present, but in audiobooks every waking hour to drown out your own voice in your mind?
