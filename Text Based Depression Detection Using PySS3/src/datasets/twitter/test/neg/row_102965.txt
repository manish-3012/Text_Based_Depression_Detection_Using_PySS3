suicide note ready. i've been hanging on for a while, i try really hard each day to make it to the next, but i'm so exhausted.finished writing it, its sucks that it was so easy to write. i wonder if the people i care about will ever read it. 

i do really believe that things get better for some, i hope it gets better for everyone here that is having a hard time like me, but unfortunately i don't seem to be one of those people that things get better for... 

i've found myself praying to a god i don't believe in, over and over, for things to get better, they never do, they just get worse. this has to be like the 4th time i've posted in this subreddit in the last couple of months, i've been struggling for a while. i never posted in here hoping that people would tell me that i matter or anything like that, i don't even know why i;m writing this, i'll probably just delete it soon after posting... i guess i just need to somehow express what i'm feeling, i needed to vent since the people i care about don't give a shit and don't care to listen. 

to all those people that never cared about me... mom, dad, sister, friend... i never hated you even though i should have... still love you, i always will.
