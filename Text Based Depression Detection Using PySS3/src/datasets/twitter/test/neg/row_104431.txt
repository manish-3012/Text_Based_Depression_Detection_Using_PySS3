Don't even feel human anymoreSlowly but surely everyone in my life has left me all alone. I can't remember the last time I even felt anything besides sadness. I don't care about my own life, what's the point of living if you can't share the experience with other people. The sad part is I've lost all hope of ever having any more friends. Everyone that I hang out with never talks to me or even cares about me. It's the shittiest feeling not knowing if the people you have called your friends for six years even like having you around. I don't even trust anyone anymore and I'm terrified that I'm just going to scare everyone away because whenever someone shows me even a little bit of attention I don't know what to do. I'm so scared that the next person to show me attention will become the sole reason I want to continue living and when they inevitably leave I will be left with no other options. These days just feel meaningless, I don't sleep much, I literally don't enjoy anything anymore and just can't bring myself to make any sort of effort towards anything meaningful. I just can't see the point in living like this, I don't think anything could possibly worse.
