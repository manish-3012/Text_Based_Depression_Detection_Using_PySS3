Wondering if I would really kill myself, rehab seems like such a hassleI have been having recurring fantasies of suicide for the past few years. While I want to die, I am not sure if I have the will power to kill myself. I have however been cutting for about a year now, something I couldn't have imagined myself doing earlier. I have no idea if I'm suicidal enough to justify turning my life upside by coming out as suicidal and going to rehab. That seems like such a big mess and I don't see how it would make things easier. I'm too afraid to seek help because I'm afraid people will not be able to help and I will make them feel ashamed or angry. I'm afraid they will think I just want attention. My mom has a 38 spl that I've really scared myself with lately. I don't have a date or plan. I worry I might do it on impulse
