Intrusive thoughtsSo Iâ€™m 15, Iâ€™ve tried killing myself a few times, but Iâ€™ve always chickened our before I could properly bleed out. Iâ€™ve probably got depression but who can say since my family is too fucking judge mental for me to actually ask for help, but Iâ€™m used to all that enough by now that itâ€™s not really the top of my priorities. Whatâ€™s really fucking me up right now is constantly coming up with fucking horrifying ideas like stabbing people or just attacking people I know and itâ€™s both disturbing and obnoxious but Iâ€™m wondering if thereâ€™s any drugs I could get relatively easily without alerting my family so I can just die or at least fuck my brain over enough that itâ€™ll shut the actual fuck up.
