Tired of being a human doormat. No one left to talk to, nothing left to do.Well, I got my job back after being let go when we changed locations. My only conditions for coming back were having one weekend day off or at least four days of work per week. So of course, I got neither. I work Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, 2 PM to 10 PM. I guess I won't be seeing my friends for a while. 

I'm just so tired of being a human doormat. I need the work, so I have to put up with getting jerked around by boss. I don't have the money to not live at home, so I have to put up with getting jerked around by my family. I apparently can't communicate the severity of my depression with my therapist, so I have to put up with pointless exercises to try and improve my non-existent self-esteem.

I've talked to everyone I can about this. Last night I went to go talk to my dad about it, and all I got was an earful about how bad his life was, and how lucky I am. Lucky? I have a worthless degree, a ton of debt, very few friends, no girlfriend, and about ninety pounds of extra weight. Add to this no self-control, self-esteem, and guidance or goal in life and I'm just treading water.

Hell, I'm not even treading water. I'm just sort of trying to float, and not trying very hard.

The only thing that makes me happy is preparing for my eventual suicide. I've been cleaning out my things, getting rid of anything embarrassing, and cleaning and boxing up my things so my family won't have to do anything after my death except throw out or donate some cardboard boxes that contain what's left of my life. My mom is glad because she thinks I'm preparing to move out.

Honestly, the only thing I'm waiting on right now is getting my suicide note in working order, and we're about 75% done there. I just have some editing to do, a little more to fill out in the "why I offed myself" portion, and a last few apologies to write, and I'm done.

Once that's done, I'm just going to lock myself in the bathroom, tape myself into a chair, tip it back over the bathtub to help contain the mess, light up a cigarette and then blow my brains out. Thinking about that is literally the only thing that gets me through my days.

Honestly, I don't even know what I could do or where I could go to get help. I did the usual reddit self-help stuff of "talk to parents/friends/doctors" and I'm on the heaviest dose of the heaviest anti-depressant my doctor could cook up. I've got nowhere else to go, nothing else to do, and no one else to talk to.
