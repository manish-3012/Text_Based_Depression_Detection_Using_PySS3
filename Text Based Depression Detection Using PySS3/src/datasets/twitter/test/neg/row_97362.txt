Self DestructingYou ever purposely do things that you know will make your life worse?  You stay up late posting on suicide forums knowing that it will make work awful tomorrow?  You ever sit at work, doing nothing, knowing that it will get you closer and closer to being fired?  You ever lie in bed all morning, instead of driving to work, so that you'll be late and everyone will look down on you?  You ever avoid paying your bills, day after day, even though you never really forget... you just avoid doing it.

Ever since my father died, I have felt like I'm playing a game of Marco Polo.  But, no one calls out Polo in return.  I'm just blind, wandering around with no purpose.  Is there anyone out there at all?  I know there might be, but I'm too afraid to open my eyes.

I just want to make it to the weekend.  Please, God, let me make it to the weekend.
