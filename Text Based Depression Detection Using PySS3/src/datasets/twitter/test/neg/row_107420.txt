I feel like shitSince you don't know me and I don't know anyone of you guys, I think it would be best if I share it here. It's been a week and I feel like shit, I feel so fucked up I don't know what happened to me. One day I'm ok I'm smiling hanging up with my friends then the next day everything went downhill to hell suddenly I have this feeling of being tired of living anymore. I need to go to somewhere that is quiet a place where I can empty my mind to calm down.
