When everyone expects you to get better but they wonâ€™t support you at allEveryone tells me to just shut up and get over it.  They accuse me of making excuses but they arenâ€™t all wrong.  Yet they wonâ€™t give an ounce of help, only just the general bs â€œitâ€™ll get better.â€  Like how the hell is it supposed to get better?  I know Iâ€™m supposed to figure that out, but what do people see in my situation that screams, â€œoh donâ€™t worry, itâ€™ll get better.â€  My parents are literally holding me hostage and if I do anything to disobey them, Iâ€™m homeless and Iâ€™m probably gonna get abused by my ex again or raped by my other ex.  Iâ€™d rather stay here with my abusive parents than have that happen again.  â€œJust leave.â€  Thatâ€™ll make it worse.  â€œJust call the police.â€  I live where?  â€œFOR FUCKSAKE GET UP OFF YOUR ASS AND DO SOMETHING INSTEAD OF WALLOWING IN SELF PITTY YOU ANNOYING IDIOT.â€  Iâ€™m TRYING to not kill myself, mostly because Iâ€™m scared of surviving again.  And plus Iâ€™ve been really paranoid over what will actually happen when I die.  Will it be worse than this hell?  I donâ€™t know.  And because my parents donâ€™t believe in mental illnesses like my BPD, I donâ€™t have anyone I can talk to or like up to.  The only person I have rn is myself and as hard as I try to be positive, the fact that I canâ€™t go downstairs without getting shit on is just too much.  Itâ€™s really hard to be positive when your whole life is negative.  Iâ€™m taking my whole life.  No I ainâ€™t got cancer and I ainâ€™t starving, but I do feel like Iâ€™m dying and I do wanna starve myself, since my parents wonâ€™t shut the fuck up about my weight gain (yet buy fast food all the time and scream at me when I wonâ€™t eat it).  Iâ€™ve reached out to people and they donâ€™t help.  In fact, they tell me that people donâ€™t need to help me and that I need to deal with it myself.  Yet there they sit with a crowd of people for support.  How come I canâ€™t get support.  â€œStop looking for other people and just see a therapist.â€  I have seen a therapist, a psychiatrist, and had inpatient treatment two times, the last time being late 2018.  But like I said, my parents donâ€™t believe in mental illnesses, and will kick me out on the fucking streets if I even dare try to get any sort of professional help.  â€œCall the help line.â€  Yeah Iâ€™ve tried, one of them told me to think about other people and how theyâ€™ll be hurt, then bitched at me when I said that my parents hate me and that I literally have NO ONE that cares.  I donâ€™t have friends because Iâ€™m clingy and when I vent to them about my BPD, they go ape shit and claim Iâ€™m abusing them and tell everyone Iâ€™m a master manipulator.  Says the person that actually manipulated me into being a slave for them.  Thatâ€™s the thing about BPD, everyone thinks your a sociopath and a liar.  I canâ€™t get any help outside of therapy because there arenâ€™t a lot of places to go without someone calling you a cunt.  All everyone talks about is â€œwell my borderline mom killed my dadâ€ â€œwell my borderline sister stool my money.â€  Iâ€™m not your stupid family member, Iâ€™ve never hurt anyone and I donâ€™t plan on it either.  Stop treating me like Iâ€™m a terrible person, and then expect me to get better while you yell insult after insult after insult.  I tried so hard in 2018 to get my life back on track, and then I get raped, PTSD, lose my job, lose all my money after leaving an abusive relationship, and then get thrown back with my abusive mother because I tried to kill myself.  And I get shit on when I show an ounce of annoyance with.  â€œWell, you choose to get worse.â€  No, I didnâ€™t choose to get raped and get PTSD.  Sorry, I didnâ€™t exactly plan on that.  I get told that I should die and I did.  Sorry, maybe thatâ€™s my fault.  But still, sorry my life sucks so badly that Iâ€™m basically stuck and telling me to shut up about it isnâ€™t helping.  Maybe help me idk.  I tried reaching out to my college when my rapist enrolled.  They were gonna tell my parents, I had to drop out.  Now Iâ€™m actually stuck.  I just wanna die, even if I donâ€™t want to rn.  But of course, nobody cares until youâ€™re dead.  Or in my case, nobody cares regardless.  What should I do?  Rot to death?  Or get myself kicked out in the middle of a pandemic?  Maybe I am selfish and just a whiny little cunt.  Sorry Iâ€™m not a miracle.  Sorry I canâ€™t get better in two months and play about it on social media, telling people that if they walk a mile, all their trauma and mental disorders will automatically heal.
