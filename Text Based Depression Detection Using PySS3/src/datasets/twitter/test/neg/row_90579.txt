Not sure where to start...I guess I'll start here... f(23) my fiance m(35) left me on Halloween, and we've been together for two years up until that point. I have a 2 year old son from another relationship... and him and I started dating when my little one was a couple of months old. My son looked up to him, my son got attached, and was the only father figure he had, since his biological father walked out on us upon finding out about the pregnancy. 

My fiance whom just left the relationship wanted a child with me. I wanted one with him. Now I'm 6 weeks pregnant, and he's gone, over something trivial. My ex came back in the picture a month ago to try to start up a relationship with his son. My fiance was not cool with that, and I was going to take my son out with my ex trick-or-treating, since Halloween is a holiday you can't exactly split between two days, and being two years old, he would get tired after a half hour. So, upon hearing this, he silently packed his things, and took off. He told me that he really wasn't sure that I'm committed enough (he's probably insecure) and said he found someone else anyways. I feel like used up trash. I have sacrificed so much for him, I would have given him the world. I quit smoking because he was allergic, I gave up time with my friends just to be with him, and I gave up even aspects of my personality. 

Now he's gone, and Halloween night I took my son out, I found his number on my call display 7 times within an hour. I guess I missed my chance of reconciliation. I have been trying to call him back, but to no avail. Am I that worthless to him? I don't even know if he even loved me. I have mixed feelings, because he would always buy expensive jewellery for me, despite my numerous protests, and I don't think someone would do that if they weren't totally committed. Throughout the relationship, I have noticed slight traits of narcissism in him, but sloughed it off as normal ego. He never once hit me, never even raised a hand to me. 

He treated me the best out of every relationship I've ever had, then suddenly left me at a moment's notice, with little to no foreshadowing . He wasn't dissociating, wasn't distancing himself, never even had any arguments or serious talks. This is all surreal to me, and I have been dumped off into an unknown world with questions which need answering, which he refuses to answer due to his non-communication. 

I have suffered depression in waves since a child, being a child of abuse and drug-using parents, turning into a drug-using adolescent, then into a severely depressed adult, until I met him. I was even okay not taking my meds because he brought me to life, and haven't had even one wave of depression since we've been together. He brought out a youthfulness and I was vibrant and alive. Now that he's gone, I feel empty, lost, and alone. I feel like a stone stuck on the edge of a rough river, wondering which wave will be the one to suck me under.  

Every time I know I will go home to an empty bed, an emotionally empty, cold place in which I used to feel comfort in his arms. I feel I can't give my son the affection he needs, and my son feels that. He has been irritable and restless, and he misses my fiance, his father figure. I have even considered that night getting back into heavy duty drugs, but my son was in his bed and I couldn't follow through. Now that my son's father is back in his life, I feel I have nothing to lose anymore. My fiance is clearly not coming back, I just want to talk to him one last time if it's not reconcilable, just to get the answers. My heart literally feels broken, I can cry over this anymore before I start bleeding from the tear ducts, I can't sleep, I can't eat. I just stare blankly off into the distance. What is the use of existence after this? Everyone will say "what about your son?", but it's easier said than done. My head is in the fog right now, and I see no light in the distance. Going back on my meds is not an option, since it can affect the pregnancy, but even that is trivial at this point. 

It feels like it may have meant nothing to him, but it meant everything to me. I have never been codependent on anyone before, I may have entered depression after the end of a relationship, but no one has ever driven me to this point like he did. It's more a question of if he ever loved me, or was it based on lies? Did he lie to me all along? Is he even capable of it? Because I thought he loved me through his affection, actions, and being there for me, not to mention wanting to start a biological family with me. I am up in the air right now, suspended. I am waiting until the weekend, and if nothing clears up, I'm gone. I can't take this feeling any longer, I just want to waste myself. 

Any help with this feeling would be much appreciated, because I can't help myself. I need to be here with my son, but the feelings are overwhelming. Yesterday I almost, on impulse, jumped into traffic a few times, but restrained myself with every fiber of my being.
