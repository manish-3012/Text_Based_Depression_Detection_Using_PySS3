Can't stop thinking about laying my head on train tracksI've been depressed as long as I can remember. I turn 28 next month and I've made nothing of my life. From the minute I wake up to when I go to sleep.. Constant pain. What the hell did I DO to deserve this?? Honestly?? Why do some get to be happy and others don't? i scare myself when I think of how comfortable I am with dying. I don't feel anything. If someone offered me a million dollars I wouldn't feel anything about it. I'm so scared of what's to come but it's time to go. Lay my head on some train tracks and it'll all be over in seconds. I CANNOT imagine living the rest of my life like this. I'm so done
