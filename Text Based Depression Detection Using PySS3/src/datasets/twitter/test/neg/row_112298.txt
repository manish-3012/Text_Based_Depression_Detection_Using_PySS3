Im tired of feeling like thisI havent had the best life, could have been worse, but could have been a lot more normal. The last few years of my life have been setback after setback. Ive completely stopped caring about myself. I have a massive amount of debt. Lately the depression has gotten worse and worse. I think about suicide multiple times a day. I did a no call no show to work today because I just couldnt bring my self to go, let alone call them and ask for a day off. I turned my phone on airplane mode and have no idea how I can explain it tomorrow to keep my job. But a big part of me just wants to go to the atm in the morning, take out as much as I can, get some good food, find something fun to do, probably find some drugs, maybe some company, a lot of booze and a hotel room. 

im tired of feeling like this. its no way to live
