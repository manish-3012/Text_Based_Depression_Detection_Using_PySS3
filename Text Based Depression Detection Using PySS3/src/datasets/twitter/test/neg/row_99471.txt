Idek why Iâ€™m posting here but I donâ€™t care anymoreSo Iâ€™ve been talking to this girl for a while and I honestly think Iâ€™m in love with her. Hereâ€™s the catch. She has a boyfriend who lives in California (we live in Alabama) this guy treats her like absolute shit and has fucked another girl 7 times since Iâ€™ve been talking to her. Iâ€™ve been counting. She will not break up with him. And now about 20 minutes ago I came out and told her how I felt about the situation and she said she didnâ€™t want to hurt me and will stop talking to me. I moved to Alabama a year ago and havenâ€™t made a single friend. Not one except her. I was able to distract myself with swimming but swim season is over now so I have nothing but my thoughts. I used to cry myself to sleep because I was so alone then I met this girl and it stopped. Now sheâ€™s leaving me and I really do not think I can continue living alone like I have been. There is a little more to this but I donâ€™t want to share that stuff
