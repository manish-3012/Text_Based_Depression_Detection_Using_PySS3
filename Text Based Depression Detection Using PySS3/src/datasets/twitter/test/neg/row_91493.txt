Suicidal ideationHey all. Iâ€™m on the edge over here. Too much to put here, but itâ€™s been rough since June of this year. Iâ€™ve sought help, yet here I am. My SIs are non stop. My core belief is shit. I isolate. I try to not, put a smile on, do what I do. Iâ€™m dying inside. I tried to finish off my life last Tuesday, a friend stepped in. I came home, tried again and the police here showed up. Iâ€™m now working with our local crisis team with the police department, just spoke with em. Iâ€™m on the verge of a straight break down and I canâ€™t let myself let those emotions flow. Maybe some will understand that. The back and forth. The want to sit with the pain and not allowed to sit with the pain. I think of my family, my dog, my friends, it keeps me here. Sadly, each day it means shit to me. Like I said at the top of the post, Iâ€™m the edge and even the verge to sleep and not wake up. I have no idea what tomorrow means anymore.
