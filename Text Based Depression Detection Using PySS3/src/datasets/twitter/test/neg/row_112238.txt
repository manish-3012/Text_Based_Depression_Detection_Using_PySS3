A pact I made with myself.So I'm not depressed, or I atleast don't think I am but I've been having thoughts of killing myself a lot recently. I've had these thoughts for years. 

I tried killing myself when I was 11 and vowed to myself I would never try that again. But 4-5 years ago I made a pact a with myself that if my mum were to ever die I would kill myself. The scary thing is that I'm 100% serious about this. This pact is very important to me and I consider it one of few things I'm serious/care about which says volumes about me. 

Anyway I've never really written about myself like this on the internet before so if it comes across as weird or all over the place I'm sorry. 

I suppose I just need some guidance on this because I've been thinking about it a lot recently.
