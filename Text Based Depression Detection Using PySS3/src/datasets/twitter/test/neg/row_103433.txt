What percentage of suicidal people are just impulsive and don't actually want to end it?Where its in the heat of the moment and maybe they don't realize they aren't coming back. I can understand if theres a mental illness involved or if the person truly wants it to end it but if you made a rash decision in the heat of the moment I'd feel so bad for that person.
