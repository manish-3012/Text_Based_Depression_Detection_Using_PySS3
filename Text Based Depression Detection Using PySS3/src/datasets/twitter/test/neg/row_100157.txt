Tell me why people don't want others to commit suicide, I want too and why should they stop me from doing something that I want to do?I'm 22 years old and I've been suicidal for over a year now and I've been wanting to do this for such a long time. I've been trying my best to talk about it with people ranging from my family, friends and even people on this website. 

But I've come to a realisation, why do people take the time to tell others not to commit suicide? If it's something that they want, you know, I want to commit suicide, I want to kill myself and leave this shit life that has been given to me and I don't think my future holds anything good for me. 

I have a plan and I've just brought a good piece of rope that will hopefully end it all for me before my cousins wedding. I've thought about this for so long and I don't think anyone can help me anymore!

Don't waste your time telling me to not do it, it's something that I want to do! You wouldn't tell someone to stop following a goal do you? So, I'm committed to killing myself and ending this crap life that I live!
