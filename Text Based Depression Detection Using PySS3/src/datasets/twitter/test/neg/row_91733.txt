I keep making a noose and tying it around my neck it stays there until I'm about to pass outI'm currently in a mental health unit I have lost my wife and my two boys and I feel empty. I wrote out some suicide notes and left them for my two boys and the rest of my family . Then I put it around my neck bore the weight and teightened I instantly felt the blood stop in my head, i held for about 1 minute then it auto released ... it's like someone took it from around my neck . I'm in such a dark place I just dont want feel anymore I miss my kids and wife so much.
My family are trying to support me by forcing me to stay here but being alone in my head is worse as the darkness consumes everything. Even as I type this I'm contemplating trying again ... it has to work eventually
