Itâ€™s all too much, and I donâ€™t see it getting better. Every time I get overwhelmed, I say it canâ€™t get worse, and it feels like a lie because it always does.So Iâ€™m at work. Thinking about death. Because life is an endless stream of overwhelming unhappiness. Even if it gets better temporarily, it always gets bad again. Why would I want to subject myself to this?

I donâ€™t know how much more I can handle, and Iâ€™m so scared.
