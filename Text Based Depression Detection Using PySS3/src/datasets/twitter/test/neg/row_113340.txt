I talked to my exI messaged her about meeting somewhere so we can give each other some of our stuff back, but honestly I messaged because I miss her. It's almost been a year since we broke up and there hasn't been a day that I haven't thought about her. I would give anything to go back in time to do things differently, I was so selfish and unwilling to change. I wish I could tell her this, but it wouldn't do any good. It's not like we'll ever be together again, she's already found someone else, and I'm sure she's happier with him then she ever was with me. For once in my life I felt like my life was going somewhere and I had someone I loved very much that got to be there with me. I've tried so hard to move on, I've spent time with close friends, family, but nothing is working.  I don't have a job anymore because dealing with this and trying to work was just too overwhelming, so now I'm mooching off my parents while my 60 year old dad busts his ass to support me. I feel so useless. I keep telling myself I'm going to schedule an appointment with a therapist but I never do. I get too anxious and nervous so it never happens. I'm starting to doubt it would even be worth it. Everyday for me consists of trying to ignore the constant thoughts of suicide and making empty promises to myself. I don't even know where I'm going with this anymore. I just needed to let this all out I guess.
