Don't want to live, don't feel like I have a future, full of regrets.I'm depressed because of a variety of things. I'm 17, a High School Senior, I don't have a driver's license, don't have a job and I haven't been accepted to a college yet (I only have one in mind so it's all or nothing).

tl;dr: I don't have many friends, I don't see myself having a future or a happy life and I fucked up my only shot at love.

I guess it would help to start from the beginning...

 I'm an only child, I grew up in an out-of-the-way place, never had any neighbors. I never developed good social skills because I was never surrounded by people I liked on a daily basis.

I was always a shy, quiet person, it took me awhile to grow out of the "Crying uncontrollably over nothing" phase, I noticed myself crying over getting in trouble a lot more than other people. I had about 3 close friends in elementary school (Which isn't a bad thing, but bringing it up is necessary for later in the story). I didn't do poorly in school, I never failed a class in any grade except for one elective course, but that was a special circumstance.

These three close friends that I had I'm not very close with now. Two of them turned into degenerate assholes and the third and most important to me just thinks I'm annoying now, I'll provide more details on her later.

So Middle School wasn't that bad, if I was depressed it was just puberty stuff, nothing major. Feeling like an outcast because I was going through that "OMG TEEN POPULARITY" phase. Basically irrelevant.

High School early years was pretty much the same thing, just kind of distant from everyone like I usually am. I was closer to my friends back then.

So you have a backstory on how I was always shy, distant and sensitive. Recently I've drifted apart from a lot of my friends, I only hang out with one of them on a semi-regular basis.

___________________________________________________________

tl;dr of the following story: Girl trouble, friendship with her is dying.

The main problem I've been facing in recent months has everything to do with the third of my close friends (I shouldn't say third, she's the most important one). Basically we were crushing on each other 1st grade through 5th but we were both too shy (Mostly because of our young age) to even share our feelings with one another. We drifted apart after Middle School started up because we simply never saw each other because we never had classes together. I can't remember if it hurt or not, drifting apart from her, but I must've gotten over it because I don't ever remember grieving over it.

So 11th grade comes along and I finally have a class with her. She had been dating someone for about 2 or so years at the time. We got reacquainted, caught up and we became best friends again. I realized that I still had feelings for her at the time, and I texted her "This sucks" she replied "What?" I said "I think I'm starting to become attracted to you" or something like that and she replied "Oh, well I'm glad you told me". It didn't change anything, it's just kind of a monumental point in our friendship because I basically confessed my feelings.

12th grade rolls around and, because she tells me everything that bothers her, she'd complain about how her boyfriend would verbally abuse her (By verbally I mean through texts) by overreacting in situations that just doesn't call for it and by just being so quick to snap at her. Because I had known this girl for 10 years and NEVER had the SLIGHTEST problem with her, not even bickering, I was absolutely infuriated by it. The situation that she described to me I considered to be similar to someone kicking a puppy.

(Only last week or so I found out that it was a two-sided thing, she was giving him some trouble too, I just assumed he was a dick to her. As it turns out, the abuse was mutual).

So I was there to give her moral support, but eventually told her that it's the cycle of abuse and it probably won't get better. I told her that I did want to have a relationship with her, but I made in clear that I did NOT want a relationship built on a foundation of cheating and/or ending another relationship to start it up. I wanted her to make her own decision on it.

So they break up, me and her eventually have a thing. She gave me my first kiss and we went on 2 dates for the duration of our thing, both of which she didn't really consider to be dates later on because we didn't really talk much or something. I didn't see anything wrong with them, I think she was just trying to cover up the fact that she enjoyed them. She even used the phrase "Then it's a date!" after we got done planning one of them. The one that she used that phrase with was a school dance and her ex showed up and just kind of sat there on the outer rim of the dance floor (Which was the school cafeteria), clearly not enjoying himself. Because of that she didn't want to dance so I spent the first half standing there all pissed off because he showed up. I don't have anything against him for showing up, he had the right to, it's just that he made things a little complicated. Half way through he left and things went back to normal. Me and her danced  ya-da ya-da ya-da it was a fun night.

Basically, I could tell she was enjoying our time together, there's no doubt about that. The blame can be placed on both of us for our thing ending, but I mainly blame myself for it. She periodically told me what the problems were. The big problem was the fact that I'd give her a hug and a kiss on the cheek at her locker every morning (I started doing it because we had gone a couple weeks without hanging out and I wanted her to know I still cared). I was aware she didn't like Public Displays of Affection (PDA) but I figured it was okay because her locker's very out-of-the-way and I made sure nobody was around when I did it. I could tell she liked it, she'd give me positive feedback in the form of smiles and just things a shy girl would do when you do something she likes. She would seldom appear to not enjoy it but it was very possible that she was either having a rough day or she was having a rough time getting over her ex (And she was). So she eventually flips out on me over texts because of this PDA (It was the first time I had ever witnessed her drop the F-Bomb in any scenario, she said "Just leave me the fuck alone"). There were assorted sub-reasons like not always having anything to talk about and me being too clingy (When she said I was being clingy, she mentioned how I'd always like to hold her and cuddle, but that's not being clingy, that's just how I express myself).

I was really torn up about this whole break-up and I got more depressed than I ever had been. I felt like she was my easiest and best shot at a happy relationship and I fucked it up. I felt worthless because if I fucked up something like that, I felt like I couldn't do anything right. The worst part was the fact that I hurt her. When I found out that I hurt her the guilt tore me apart and the only thing keeping me from killing myself was the fact that I'd hurt people if I did. I always thought that I'd never be able to forgive someone if they hurt her just because she was so cute, sweet and innocent. Now that I had become one of those people my mind just tore itself apart. For the next few nights I just laid there in bed crying constantly because I just hated myself. Basically my guilt caused me to make things worse for my friendship with her over the next few months (Up until recently, that is). Right now she basically thinks I'm annoying and it's pretty obvious she's never motivated to text me. In person she doesn't even talk to me even though she'll have normal interactions with other people. I just sit there and try to deal with the pain of not being able to talk to her anymore. Me and her had such lively text conversations back in 11th grade and now she won't even use smiley faces. She used to tell me she didn't like when I used one-word-replies during texting and now she does it to me almost all the time.

He asked her to prom and she went with him, they got back together unofficially a little bit before then. I didn't go because it would've been the most painful experience of my life.

My Senior Class Trip was last night and it involved a trip to an amusement park and a dinner cruise that involved music and a DJ. Her and him went on the trip. they spent their time together, which didn't really bother me at the amusement park but it did on the cruise. she was basically his date and she looked stunning. I had to see them hug, walk together, dance together. She'd laugh quite frequently and it would kill me because it would remind me that I haven't even been able to make her smile in months. So the night ends and the following day (This morning) I told her that if she really loves him to not give up on him just because he's going to the Navy (He's going to the Navy sometime in July). She told me she's not one to give up but they wouldn't be able to me more than very good friends while he's away.

I told her to not give up because my chances with her are pretty much blown and my priority is making sure our friendship doesn't die because it's been in shambles lately. We're more distant than we ever have been (Excluding 6th-10th grade).
___________________________________________________________

So my main problem right now is getting our friendship back to normal. The trouble is Senior Year ends in approximately one month and everybody in my grade goes their separate ways, including me and her. I want to make it so she's at least willing to keep in touch with me. My biggest fear (Besides her having an untimely death, of course) is her getting married to her ex (Who she's currently with) which, at this rate, is probably going to happen.

Reasons I don't want to live (That I can think of):

â€¢ Losing my most important friend.

â€¢ No driver's license.

â€¢ No job.

â€¢ Haven't been accepted to college yet (If I ever will).

â€¢ Didn't make that many fun memories with friends, feel like it's too late.

â€¢ Feel worthless, hate myself, full of regrets, I feel like my life is pretty much over.

Thanks goes out to anyone who can help me get through this.

P.S. I got a chuckle out of the fact that reddit asks "are you human? (sorry)"
