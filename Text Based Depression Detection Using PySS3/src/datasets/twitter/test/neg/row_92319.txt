Thank youHi,

I'm new to this subreddit, it was given to me a long time ago but only now have I decided to give it a look.

A little background about me: I lost my best friend to suicide almost 3 years ago. I kept him alive for a long time and when I moved away he couldn't cope himself. I've always blamed myself for that. 
My ex girlfriend (first and only) was anorexic and suicidal. I loved her, I still do. We're not together anymore but I can't stop. It was certainly an experience to date someone who truly needed help in their life. It gave me a sense of accomplishment (apologies for the selfishness) and overall it helped her mental health.
I currently suicide watch 6 people, I believe in giving back to the community that I came from, and I wouldn't hesitate to take on more. 

A while ago, my own mental health started to deteriorate. I have attempted suicide once (OD) and almost did a second time a few months ago (bleach).

Today I'm alive because of the people who listened to me and supported me all the way. I noticed this subreddit has a lot of posts about people, but not enough about the ones who make a difference here.

I sincerely thank you.
