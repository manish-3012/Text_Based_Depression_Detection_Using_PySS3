I've realized I'm not okay.I've attempted suicide in the past. Thankfully my life has gotten better since then. But you know your not okay when life is going good but deep down you know that if shit where to hit the fan again then you would kill yourself. You hold on to everything like your life depends on it. I hold on to my relationships because I never want to feel alone. I'm so afraid of rejection. I'm afraid that if people leave then I'll want to die again. I afraid of the inevitable.
