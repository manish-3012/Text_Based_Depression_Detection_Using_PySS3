I'm done, My life depends on these test results.I wanted to join the Army more than anything 4 months ago. I gave them my list of MOSs that i was interested in. It was a list of 8 or 9. I got my last choice MOS that I didn't even want that much, but I signed for it because it had a big bonus and Option40. After 2 months I wanna switch jobs I ask several times to Renegotiate my contract before I ship in Late october. They convince me and tell me to stick with what I got everytime. My dad convinced me to tie up anything early so i won't have to deal with anything last minute before I ship to basic. He was heavily hinting that I get rid of my dog now rather than later. She was my best friend of 6 years. She got me through High school and any rough days ever when I was feeling lonely about having only 3 friends. I gave her away (granted I screened all the 59 applicants extremely closely). I gave away my bestfriend and now I have nobody. I work nights and haven't seen any of my friends in months. I was cleared at MEPS and all I had to do now was a lousy flight physical. I had to go back 4 times so far to redo test for the flight physical because somethings always wrong (ketones is the only word i heard when they were talking to eachother about it). I looked it up and figured I probably have type 2 Diabetes from my poor diet/exercise/stress/irregular sleep I had during Highschool. I'm now in the best physical shape ive ever been in with a regular sleep schedule and a healthy diet. Everytime I ask my recruiter if he got my flight physcal results he says "oh youll be fine their just taking extra time". I know he's bullshitting and dodging the question. EVERYONE IN THAT DAMN RECRUITING OFFICE KNOWS SOMETHINGS WRONG WITH ME BUT WONT SAY!  This shit has been stressing me out for the past month (yea its SUPPOSEDLY taken them a whole month analyze my piss and blood). I've been thinking about what I'm going to do if I am Diabetic. I gave up my dog, I think I'm fading from my friends minds everyday, my dad is cold and distant and hard to talk to, my mom is on the road somewhere as a trucker( she calls every 2 weeks or so) my brother is with her figuring out his life, my sister is trying to get emancipated and adopted by another family. I have nobody and nothing except this shitty constuction job where the only upside is that I've gotten to travel the US. I don't want to live a life like this anymore. If I end up being diabetic I'm fucking done. I'm going to go to another country far away where they won't care to identify the body and end it all.
