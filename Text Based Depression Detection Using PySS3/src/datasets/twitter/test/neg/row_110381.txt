I just took 720 MG of Fluoxetine.Truthfully, I'm not expecting much - I've overdosed on this medication in the past, and experienced no ill effects. However, I've never taken the amount that I just took, so... I'm a bit frightened. I'm not expecting to die, but I'm also not expecting to come out of this completely unscathed.
