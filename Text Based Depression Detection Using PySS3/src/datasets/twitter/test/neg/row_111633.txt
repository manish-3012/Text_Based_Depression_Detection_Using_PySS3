SolumNotes for those who care,

No one? I depart, My pain unshared.

Sentient beings shatter light,

Glass marines reign supreme.

Insignificant, I seem - No soul to share;

just another human being.

An empty shell, Once full of life;

Mediocre hellish strife.

Parasitic, nothing more.

Times eradication, yesterday, tomorrows war.
