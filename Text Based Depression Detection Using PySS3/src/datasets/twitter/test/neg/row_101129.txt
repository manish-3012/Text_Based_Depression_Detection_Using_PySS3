This is it, I need one reason to live.I sold the last bit of drugs I had so I could buy food..



I'm not an addict. I used to take lsd, MDMA. A bit of cocaine from time to time. Just for fun. 
Mostly because I used to sell LSD, so I just could trade if I wanted another drug. A tab for a pill or a gram of coke/weed. 


Then I moved with my father after a depressive episode, I stopped doing that, deleted phone numbers and stuff. Tried to start from zero. 
A few months pass and then he asked me to leave and when asked why he mentioned that I dealt. Idk how he found out about that. 

I was on psych meds, I had to stop taking them, I got way more depressed after quitting. I took a few loans to survive. 

This month the money ran out. I have to pay rent in three days and I dont have anything. (About 0,20usd). 

Now I have a 1500usd debt. 

Will be on the streets. 

Literally no money, I cannot even afford a ramen pack. 
No friends, they started talking to me less and less (and because I couldn't afford going out, they didn't invite) 

My family hates me because they think I "destroy kids lives" 

I have no education, I didn't finish high school.

No skills, Im good at absolutely nothing. 



I just want a reason not to do it, I cannot find any.
