Sounds Narcissistic but I'm not a narcissist lolI feel like a side character in someone else's story. Arent we supposed to feel like the main character? So why do I feel like a side character that does nothing of value and eventually either disappears or kills themselves. Fuck this life is so burning maybe if I do kill myself something fucking interesting might happen. Sorry for bothering you.
