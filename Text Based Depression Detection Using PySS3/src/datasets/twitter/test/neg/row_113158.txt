Do you feel the same?Okay, to start off, I want to keep this as anonymous as possible. I suppose my first problem I have is well, not sharing my problems. Attention is the complete opposite of what I seek. I never share my problems or thoughts with anyone. More specifically my family or friends. I feel like I would worry them too much or they would patronize me and make me feel belittled. This is why I generally keep my thoughts to my self and hide my feelings. Well, with that being said I've spent a tremendous amount of time on the internet attempting to see if anyone else shares the same problem as me. I feel like if I was to seek medical attention or help from a therapist I would worry my family too much and would make them disappointed in me. The problem I've noticed I suffer from is periods of time where I am in a severely deep depression, when I hit these periods I plan ways to end my life, as many ways as possible, most efficient, less painful, most clean, etc. I spend time thinking these thoughts throughout the whole day and decide what time in that day would be more appropriate. On the other hand there is time periods where I suffer from severe amounts of aggression or lack of patience. I seem to be easily annoyed or frustrated and explode with furious outrages. I tend to say  and/or do things I regret. Then there is periods of time, like the one I am currently in, where I am elated, filled with joy, and enjoy life and am happy. I apologize if my entire spiel is confusing or poorly written, the reasoning behind that would be I am actually happy now and it's hard writing from the perspective of the time when I am in my depressed or angry period.  So to wrap this all up, my question is, does any one else suffer from something like this? If so, what is it? Also, if you could offer any advice please do.
