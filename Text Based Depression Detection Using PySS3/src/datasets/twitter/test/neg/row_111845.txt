What stopped you today? Even if just for another day?So I had written here before about how I was planning on ending my own life and how the only thing keeping me around was my cats seeing as they're the last thing I actually care about in this world.  Well I was sure today was the day. I was sitting on the edge of the roof I was planning to jump from with my legs dangling off the edge, taking in the view as I actually enjoy heights. 

As I was sitting there running the last few thoughts in my head (hoping the goodbye and sorry note for family was easy to find, wondering if I'll feel the impact, etc.), it dawned on me that I forgotten a part. I had not given the cats ample food before leaving for the day. In fact, I had forgotten to leave them food out entirely before leaving for work as I normally do. While I stared down at the ground thinking " they'll be fine, they'll be fine.." I couldn't get the image out of two cats getting hungrier and hungrier with each day that passes as I still have no clue " Who and when would they check on the cats?".

While I'm pretty past the idea of living in this mad world, I'm not such a monster I'll leave behind two cats to wonder where the food giving human of theirs went. 

This lead to me an interesting question to ask here as others are in a similar boat.

What thing, person or thought crossed your mind that made you stick around for a bit longer?
