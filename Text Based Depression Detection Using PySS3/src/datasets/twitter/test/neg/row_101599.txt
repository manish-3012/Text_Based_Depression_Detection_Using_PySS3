Can I changeI don't know. My problems can be traced back to my upbringing. I missed out on a lot, didn't develop properly. This stunted growth caused many problems in my teen years and into my adult life. Didn't develop the skills needed to build any career or social life. Even worse is the self destructive behaviors and disorders I picked up along the way. This is my situation, looks similar to many others on here I'd imagine. I don't know what to do.
