what if i donâ€™t want to try?iâ€™m so sick of being seen as a problem that needs to be fixed, no one cares that you actually feel suicidal they just put safety precautions to ease their own worries. i donâ€™t want to be â€œsafeâ€ i just want someone to honestly care or if not just let me go. I donâ€™t want to tell everyone â€œiâ€™m going to get betterâ€ or â€œi just need to start trying harderâ€. maybe i canâ€™t do any better right now? maybe iâ€™m sick of picking myself up every single fucking time, i donâ€™t want help... i want genuine emotion. i just want raw emotion but all i get is â€œthis is what you need to doâ€ maybe i just donâ€™t want to anymore. i keep picking myself up for the people that â€œloveâ€ me but i never actually get rewarded with feeling loved. i want to disappear.
