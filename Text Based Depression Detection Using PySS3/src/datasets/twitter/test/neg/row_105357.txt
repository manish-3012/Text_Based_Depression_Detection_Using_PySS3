I want to end my lifeI've been struggling with depression since I was a kid, I remember my first suicidal thought was when I was 12, now i am 26 and things are not different, they are worse.
I have recently lost my job and can't seem to find another one, I have no money and Im afraid to wake up.
I miss human touch, I miss feeling loved and having someone who cares about me. I'm basically alone and even my passions are fading away.
I've been crying for one week, unable to feel relaxed I just think about killing myself all the time, and I'm afraid this will be my only solution.

I am so poor I can't even buy pills to swallow or ropes to hang myself
