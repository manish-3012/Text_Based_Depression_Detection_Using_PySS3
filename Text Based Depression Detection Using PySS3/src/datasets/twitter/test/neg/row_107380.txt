I always feel hopeless and suicidalThe smallest of things make me upset, I feel my life has no meaning. I always want to cut myself as well. I have no friends, horrible social skills, did poorly in school, etc. I missed out so much in my life already, why bother to continue at this point. Things won't get better.
