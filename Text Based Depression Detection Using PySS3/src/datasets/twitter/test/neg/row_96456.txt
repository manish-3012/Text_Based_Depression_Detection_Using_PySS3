Sunken FriendshipsSo, I lost pretty much my entire support group- minus my mother who already has so much on her own plate as things are.

 Although there's no suicidal ideation currently- this is the same time as last year that I attempted suicide, intentionally crashed my car, and was found in the woods by a bloodhound team after stripping naked and trying to "get lost" and poison myself.

Well. I'm thinking about that time a lot and how  this year started out with signing a Baker act but is very different because I'm living with family but I totally wrecked my friendships because I would start nosediving, abuse drugs, and take it out on them verbally; always unprovoked.

 It is totally my fault that I lost them, I accept that we'll never be as close as we were because I made the sick choice of gambling away  respect with people who cared, and I believe irreparably burned the bridges by breaking promises, disrespecting rules, and hurling insults while intoxicated. 

I don't even have a brother anymore but that is the one irreparable relationship that isn't my fault-- but I'm not getting into that.


Depression and my other mental ailments will be a part of life forever now, so how do I go about avoiding another dangerous spiral without the support? How can I make relations healthy and keep them that way?  I won't be able to live a life of quality if I'm so negative and self loathing that I convince myself not to give things a shot.
