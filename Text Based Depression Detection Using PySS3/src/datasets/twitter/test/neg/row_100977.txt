anyone want to talk?every night i cry myself to sleep and every day i paint a smile on my face and pretend that everything is okay. im done hiding, so here is my story

when i was in elementary school i always got made fun of. i was always the awkward kid with not very many friends.. everyone would call me names and i even got beat up a few times. i was scared to go to school because i wasnt sure what was going to happen. i have always had a nervous stutter when i read because i am dyslexic and im scared of messing up and looking as if i cant read. i have trouble concentrating in school because of my ADD and i fail at almost everything in school. its not easy. when high school started things got worse.. i had my old bullies and some new ones. now im in my final year of high school and things are still terrible. i dont have many friends and im still getting picked on. im still scared to read out loud because i dont want everyone to have another reason to pick on me, im scared to go anywhere alone because i have been made fun of in the halls. i dont feel like i can tell any of this to my mom because shell think i just want attention, i dont. i cant sit still in class for 5 minutes and i have been called out many times by my teachers to sit still.
