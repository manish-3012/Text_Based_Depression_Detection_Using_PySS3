For a week, a kid I know has been running around his house screaming that he wants to commit suicide and he wishes he had a gun.Dad is pushover type.  

Mom has babied and enabled the suicidal kid.

I told the dad to listen to the kid when he says he wants to commit suicide.  Take him to the emergency psych unit locally and get him help.

The dumbass mom blocks that plan and says, "We just need to talk to him more, and he will get better."  She is a failure as a mom.  

I told the dad that the mom is an idiot and she caused the problem to grow to its current extent by refusing to get the kid help.  And she still refuses.  I told the dad to expect a suicide.

The dad has a sister who committed suicide and the mom has a sister who committed suicide.  Not they have a son together who will commit suicide.

I have done what I can.  I am not going to the funeral.
