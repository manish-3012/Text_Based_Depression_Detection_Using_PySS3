I have accepted/realized that I will (probably) have suicidal thoughts the rest of my life.I went out dancing with my boyfriend and a few friends last night. We were all having a great time, and I felt really good getting out and dancing/moving around. Better than I had felt in a while. I was DD, so I only had one drink. I have always been a social drinker, and have never really been a heavy drinker. I have been trying to cut back on alcohol recently though since I started Weight Watchers. Typically one or two beers will give me a nice happy buzz and make me feel more social. I usually get sleepy before I even get to the point of getting drunk. After having one beer at the club my mood changed pretty rapidly and I began crying and had to run to the bathroom and cry in the stall without my boyfriend or my friend noticing. Prior to this both my boyfriend and my friend asked if I was okay. I guess I don't have a very good poker face. I started having suicidal thoughts, which seemingly came out of nowhere. I normally don't get this way when I'm drinking, but there didn't seem to be any environmental factors that played into this, so I'm guessing it was the alcohol? I just had an appointment with my psychiatrist a few days ago, and didn't have any of those thoughts at that time, so I told her everything was cool, and we decided to stick with my current meds and not switch anything up. 

I should note that I do work in the mental health field and have to work one on one with people are suicidal pretty much every day that I am at work, so I can't really escape talk of suicide too easily. I'm wondering if this could also be playing into my thoughts? I don't feel particularly stressed out or emotionally burdened from work, but maybe it is having more of an impact that I thought it was? Maybe I should take a couple days off work for self care?

Anyways..... I pretty much came to the realization last night that I will probably have random pop-up suicidal thoughts the rest of my life. And that's okay. I am safe right now and not having any thoughts to harm myself or anything, and haven't self-harmed since high school. I think it is just part of my Major Depressive Disorder that I will always have to deal with, even if I am on meds that help me 90&amp;#37; of the time. Anyone else feel this way? 

Thanks for listening. Love to everyone on this page. So much love. &lt;3
