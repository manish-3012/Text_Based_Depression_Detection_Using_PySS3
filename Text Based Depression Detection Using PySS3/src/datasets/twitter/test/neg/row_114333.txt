Someone help me pleaseI am in a confused state right now. I badly want to end my life. I've gone out the past 2 days to attempt it but keep finding myself not being able to do it. 

I made an account for this website cos I know there are decent people on here with good adivce that's probably better than the advice people are trying to give me in real life.

Here's how I'm feeling:
I feel empty inside with no emotion towards anything. I badly want to cry but I can't manage to do it. And I simply don't enjoy being around others anymore.

Today I went out to kill myself. I had a razor for my wrists and all my medication in case I wanted to go with that option but yet I still just couldn't do it and it made me so angry that I couldn't force myself to do it because I'm just scared.

The thing is though is that my life isn't as bad as others who attempt suicide. I have no proper reason behind it apart from the fact that I just don't want to live anymore. I don't want to go on with the rest of my life anymore and that's pretty much it. It makes me feel bad because I know people go through so much worse than me every day but I'm there with a razor against my wrist ready to attempt suicide.

My mind is set on what I want to do (which is end my life) And I don't think that will change as I've been thinking about it for a few years now and I have finally decided I definitely want to end it. So I'm not asking someone to convince me to not do it but I'm asking someone to talk me through it so I can die peacefully with the least amount of pain involved as possible. I know how selfish or bad I sound right now and i apologise deerly if I sound like a selfish prick but my mind is messed up right now and I don't want to live so if someone could help me that would be amazing. Sorry.

Thanks
