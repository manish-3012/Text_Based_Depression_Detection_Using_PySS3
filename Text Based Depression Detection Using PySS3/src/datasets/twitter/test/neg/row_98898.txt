I just want to stop existingI live with a parent that abuses substances and it fucks with my head so much. I feel guilty because I know I should be grateful for the things they have done for me but itâ€™s so conflicting and hard to care about them when theyâ€™ve done very disturbing things to me in the past when on substances. I cried about it yesterday to my other parent and I was told I was being crazy and over reacting about it. Itâ€™s hard though feeling like I donâ€™t have proper guidance and like I will never be able to live a normal life. I have no social life at this point and no social skills so at this point it just feels like I donâ€™t have anything to be alive for. I know it could be worse and I at least have a roof over my head, enough money to survive, and a phone to type this out with but the suicidal thoughts still linger. Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression and self destructive tendencies since 13 and at this point I just want peace. I havenâ€™t eaten anything today and Iâ€™m thinking about just starving myself until I die or drowning myself before the lockdown ends.
