I think I'm doneIt's been a week and I just can't do it anymore. I'm tired of the pain, the betrayal, how people look at me now, the panic attacks, being a burden on people, and being shuffled around. I'm just not strong enough. I've been to therapists all week and they seemed so hopeful for us. I believed them. And it hurt because every decision this week hurt me. I can't handle the compounding despair. There is a path to getting better but I don't want it. I'm not strong enough to go through everything again. I was so much happier a week ago. I forgave the ultimate betrayal but they weren't even willing to give me some time to heal and a chance to be a better person. Thank you for listening.
