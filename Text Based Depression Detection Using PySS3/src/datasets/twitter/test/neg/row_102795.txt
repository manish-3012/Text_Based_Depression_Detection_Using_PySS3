I can't move on or let go of someoneNo matter what I just can't let this person go. Even if I could I wouldn't. I don't want to let them go. No matter what.

So I'm left either being with them somehow again, or suicide or living a life constantly missing them, filled with regret.

What is the answer in this case? Letting go isn't an option.
