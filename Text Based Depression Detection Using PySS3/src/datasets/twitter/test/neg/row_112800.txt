I feel like I should kill myselfEver since I was young, I've always had this feeling that I was going to die at a young age. Depression has been something that has haunted me before I even knew what it meant, I've always wished that I was dead or that I was never even born as I am too afraid to actually commit suicide because of the possibility of failure and how it will affect my family. I'm barely 20 and I'm in college but I really don't see my life as worth living. I'm smart and getting through it but nothing makes me happy, I have no passions, hobbies, or friends. I'm drifting through life and the thought of living like this forever terrifies me I feel like I should just end it. There is no scenario in my mind for a future where I will be comfortable with existing. I sincerely feel like there is no solution to my mindset, I am extremely self aware and think about how much I hate my life every single day. Even in moments where things should be "happy" I can feel how fake it is and am aware of the depression lingering inside, no one in my life knows I feel this way and I'm just tired of it all. Maybe this is what I'm destined to do. Maybe things keep happening to push my suicide forward and I should just submit to what the world wants for me.
