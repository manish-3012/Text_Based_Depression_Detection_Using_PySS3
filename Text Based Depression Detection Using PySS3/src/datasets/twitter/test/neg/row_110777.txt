I'm doneI'm currently in the process of killing myself. I have chosen hypothermia as my method. It will drop to -20 as the night goes by. It is a shit awful way to go, but what method isn't?

I'm feeling sad right now. I decided to spend my last day on earth at one of my most  favorite places, the local university library. School was in and so there were a lot of people there. I was surprised at the number of good looking women there. Normally the populations I see are pretty homely.

I discovered a bunch of cool books there. One's Grammatical Man, which is a popular account of how information theory applies in describing people. I found Proofs and Types. I found a whole bunch of programming (as in math, optimization, not programming a computer). I read the introductory parts of a dynamic programming book and a geometric programming book. They were cool. I also read one on gravitational waves but it was kind of boring because it was one of those popular books that have too much history and not enough introducing me to the math.

So now I'm feeling sad because even though I'm not bright I am tenacious. I could have spent my life working at the metfab shop and spending my free time at the library.

But it is not to be. I can't cope anymore. I quit a job because they were going  to fire me for being late all the time. I can't get up in the mornings. I barely eat. Drugs and wanking  have lost their appeal. Life is just so tiresome.

Even though I feel sad, I feel that I am making the right decision. I can't get through life without  the support and forgiveness of all the people around me and that is in short supply.

I'm not asking for help. I'm just saying goodbye to the closest I have to  friends. I wish I were stronger.
