&lt;stream of consciousness&gt;I need to vent, and with how I've been feeling and my prior feelings on my life I feel like I'm just one trigger away from recklessly trying to end my life in any way.

Where to start... In 2011 I attempted suicide by driving my car off the road and into two trees. I don't remember much besides the feelings while driving and my friends withdrawing support after finding out I was atheist and LGBTQ*. I totaled my car, broke my left clavicle, and earned short term memory loss. I haven't told many people what happened that day, minus anonymous peeps online and my "inner circle" of friends (those who were left). Since then, I've known that I'm a pin prick away from attempting again. 

I jumped from so many dead-end jobs... My girlfriend has been so supportive but she's at least stable without what I've been bringing to the table... And the depression has always been there. But, I found out why one reason why I have been stupid: I used to think I was bi, and possibly queer, but I'm actually Trans! Knowing that had helped a bit... But it eventually became a deeper crack...

"Will I ever feel comfortable? Will my parents accept me? I can live without them, but what about &lt;girlfriend's&gt; family? She's bi (now), but will they accept that along with her choice of partner? Will I pass? Will my transition hurt my chances of moving up in a job? Did it hurt my current job? Am I okay with taking hormones like this for the rest of my life? What about my body... Transition can't fix the effects of testosterone, and since I'm transitioning after age 24, will I be okay with my shoulders? Neck? Voice? Face? I could get surgeries for most of it... But it's expensive... Could I live without them?" I could go on... But.. 

So, I'm now working at Amazon. After being there for a month and dealing with insurance BS (bc/bs was gatekeeping me, and Premera took forever) my body had no hormones to run off of and I spiraled downward. My work was shoddy, and I got 4 write-ups for quality and productivity. This... Means that I'm inches away from being fired. And I'm not sure you know, but Amazon is usually a great place. I love my job... for once.

Transition. Work. Our bills we can barely pay. I'm not sure I can do this life anymore. I feel like I am broken... And can't be fixed. 

I seriously have been thinking about how I'd kill myself. Maybe a drug overdose? Drowning? I'm afraid of sharp objects, but slicing my arms would be probably cathartic as I die...

Idk... This is probably just a phase, but last time I attempted something I felt just like this...

Thank you...
