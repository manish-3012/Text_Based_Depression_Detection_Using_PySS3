My friend might kill herself tonight please helpI've known my best friend ever since my freshman year of high school and we've always been close. Ever since she opened up to me about her depression and her suicidal thoughts, everything's just gotten steadily worse. Tonight her bf just broke up with her from what she said was the best relationship she's ever had. She just sent me a humungous paragraph that very well could be her suicide note if she's successful. I'm about to break down right now how can I fix this?
