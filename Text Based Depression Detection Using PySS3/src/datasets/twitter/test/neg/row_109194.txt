I don't believe that i deserve do be loved....My life was always trash , shit family , loved ones died when I was a little kid , financially bad , anxiety , depression , and I am only 18...

This month I met a girl , we are doing well and we have a lot in common , she has also a ruined life at the age of 18 , I think we really get along and my friends also told me that she was asking about me sometimes when I wasn't there and that they all think that she has a crush on me

I think I also like her , despite that I was never in a relationship and I am very pessimistic about how this is going to end , I am positive and good when she is around and I don't think I do anything wrong until now , but I am so used to shit that I bet the this will somehow go wrong , she shouldn't like me , I am fucked and will stay alone
