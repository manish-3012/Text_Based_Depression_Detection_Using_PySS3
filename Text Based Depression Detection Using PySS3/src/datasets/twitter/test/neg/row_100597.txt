I can't stop thinking about it.I don't want to kill my self, but then I find myself researching the various ways to kill my self. Even Have the stuff to do it. I have two young daughters and I know the need me. But I think they'll be better off with out me. The divorce hurts so bad. I'm not strong enough.
