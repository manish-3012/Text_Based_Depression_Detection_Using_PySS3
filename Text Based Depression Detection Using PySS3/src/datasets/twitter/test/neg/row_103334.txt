I don't want to be here.Fuck living. I'm so sick and tired of it.

I can't enjoy anything, and I haven't since I was a goddamn child. Nothing interests me, nothing is enjoyable, I haven't felt happy in more years than I can count.

I'm sick and fucking tired of seeing the world continue turning towards its inevitable climate fuelled apocalypse. I'm sick and fucking tired of being payed pennies of what I should earn because corporations will always do their best to skull-fuck you out of every penny and dime they possibly can.

I'll never be able to afford a home, I'll never be able to work out of debt, I'll never be able to find a point in my life where it feels like things aren't about to collapse at any second.

I plan on hanging myself in a week. I'll see you on the other side.
