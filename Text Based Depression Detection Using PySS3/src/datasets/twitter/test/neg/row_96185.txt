Is it really worth it?Logically speaking if my life have nothing positive in it 
And probably well never be in the future  

Most likely i won't do something remarkable and i won't be happy 
I know I'll struggle alot and I'm struggling right now 

I know for sure that my life well keep getting harder 

And I had a bad start in life 

Is it really worth living it 

I'm not depressed or anything  i love myself  i don't have mental problems  

I believe there's some people are not suited for life, like me I'm just not meant for this life 


I'm seriously logically speaking that maybe death is a relief 


What's your thoughts?
