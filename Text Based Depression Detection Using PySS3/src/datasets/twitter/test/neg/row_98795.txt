Why not end it soon if Im going to die anyway?Theres always something terrible going on in my life. Ever since I was a child getting bullied, I always thought life would get better and it hasnâ€™t. I have no friends, no girlfriend, my family is doing their own thing, i try to come up but it never works out. im tired of crying in my car in traffic. Im tired of crying myself to sleep. im tired of waking up dreading another day at work and getting alienated and picked on by my coworkers. I tried support groups, they pay no attention with me. i feel like im just annoying and nobody really wants me around until they need me. i dont want this anymore. i plan to jump into a river about 15 minutes away from where i live. my family will be upset at first but theyâ€™ll get over it. im tired of this bullshit.
