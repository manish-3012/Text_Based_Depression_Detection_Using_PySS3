Why do I feel like this?I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting here. I just feel so empty and alone and I just need some support, I guess. Iâ€™m still in school and Iâ€™ve managed to fuck up my grades and drive away the only friends Iâ€™ve ever had. I absolutely hate everything about myself. Waking up in the morning is just getting harder and harder every day. I canâ€™t imagine myself having a future, I donâ€™t have any hobbies or interests or things Iâ€™m good at. I have no motivation to do anything. I just take up space with my constant negativity. The last week or so Iâ€™ve started seriously considering suicide but Iâ€™d never be able to do it because Iâ€™m terrified of being a bigger burden on the people around me than I already am. I just wish I wasnâ€™t alive and I donâ€™t know how to stop feeling like this.
