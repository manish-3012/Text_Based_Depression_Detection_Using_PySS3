Really fighting whether or not I should do this...So here's the deal since Grade 1-7 I've been bullied nonstop.
Right now so far nothing but it really hurts when your parents are the one to say multiple negative things about you.
I actually almost commited suicide when I was 8 and luckily I was convinced but by the end of the day my parent's were actually more mad on me. So I've been raised strictly and now I have the trouble of being called strict in our class and as well selfish since my classmates always wants me to do our group project alone and when I reject they call me that. So far feeling better but then my guitar got damaged by the CAT student in our school and my father wanted the CAT student to buy me a new one since my guitar got damaged by the CAT student and I got scolded by my parents as well eventhough my things was actually just perfectly innocent in our line.I want to help the CAT student but I wanna do it secretly which is a bit hard. Now I am very confused whether or not I should commit suicide since I've gotten nothing but negative comments and stress. So far looking for tips to get over this problem.
