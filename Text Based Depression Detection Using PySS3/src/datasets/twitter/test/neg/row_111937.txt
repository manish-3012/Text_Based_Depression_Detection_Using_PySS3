Suicidal exSo I dated this guy i met on internet. We were dating for like a month but we never met. I know he has a lot of isuess in his life and he has been thru alot. He is transgender, his family is very hard on him for it, and yeah lots of other bad things that happend to him. He is also bipolar who stopped taking his medication. I broke with him one day ago and since yesterday ive been on the phone with him trying to make him to go to hospital and get help. But he wont do that, he lives in anothet country so i cant force him to go, i dont even know his exact adress to call an ambulance. If i cant talk to him he gets mad and says he dont know what will happen if im not on the phone even tho im still texting him non stop. I dont know what else i could do and i dont know how i will survive if he commits suicide.
