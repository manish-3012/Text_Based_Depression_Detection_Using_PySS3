I've drank more this week than I have in the last two years combinedNot sure why I'm posting this but I'd appreciate any perspective, advice, or encouragement you can give. (26 M, for context.)

I've struggled with loneliness and low self-esteem for years and actually managed to make noticeable improvements in how I treat myself recently. It felt like a major turning point in my life, but that hasn't born out at all and everything just keeps getting worse. I used my newfound confidence to finally try dating apps but I haven't had any success. My only two friends just broke up with each other a few weeks ago and now neither of them talk to me anymore. I have no idea how to meet new people and make friends, especially during a pandemic. I'm bored and lonely every night and have started to drink by myself just to pass the time; something I have done maybe once or twice ever before this week. My job is frustrating and stressful and I only stay because it pays well but now I wonder what the point even is if I'll never have a mortgage or a family to take care of anyway.

I don't think I have a chemical imbalance and I'm not determined to wallow in how bad I feel. I know most of the people on here have it way worse than I do and I know I can be happy when there are people in my life who care about me and like spending time with me. I just legitimately cannot think of ways to solve these problems and it scares me to think that I'll have to face life alone for decades on end. I'm not sure how long I can last.
