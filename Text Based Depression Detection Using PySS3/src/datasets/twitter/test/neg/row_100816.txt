I couldn't go through with it.(Trying to post again,got removed before with the NSFB tag) My most valued person told me they have no reason to stay in my life yesterday night. I prepared to take my life. I sent my message to them, prepared all my materials. But I just couldn't do it. I don't know why. I have nothing left. I lost my last piece of hope yesterday night. Why did I hesitate? Why couldn't I do it? I spent the entire night just staring, wanting to just get over with it but I couldn't. Why?  I don't know what to do now. I was grasping for any thing that could help me hold on but now I have nothing. I still really want to kill myself.
