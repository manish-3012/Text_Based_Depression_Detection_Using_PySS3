Thinking about taking a driveI'm writing this because I think I'm going crazy. I've always said to myself that I've had so much to live for. I have a brand new baby girl, she's almost a year old now. My girlfriend and I split up a few months ago and we're in the midst of a court battle for custody of my baby girl. She's saying I've abused both her and my little girl. "abuse" was always a point of contention for us. Not toward my baby girl, but toward my ex. She would say I'm abusive and tell me how little I care about her and I would apologize even though I didn't even know how I was supposed to have abused her. I would tell her I've lived through abuse, seen my first step father hit my mother. Fought him to make him stop hurting her. And then I'd tell my ex that I never wanted to be that and that if I was she should leave. She would later say that I'm not abusive. But now that we're in court she swears that I've been emotionally, physically and financially abusive. Truth is, though I know the last two are lies, I don't know if the first is or not.
I'm very, very solitary. I don't have many friends for a lot of reasons. I've always been ahead of my peers intellectually, but very far behind emotionally and socially. I guess dealing with my first step dad for a so long made me stop feeling things. All I had was my library card and it was the only way I could get away. I read everything I could get my hands on.
I also can't trust people. I learned not to, I guess. I'm told that I put up walls around myself that people have to vault over to get to know me. My ex was someone who didn't make the jump.

What I'm trying to say is... I'm not sure if simply not being there for my ex emotionally, not trusting her with anything qualifies as abuse.

But that's not really the whole thing. I've been having these dreams for a while now where I would take my mom's car for a drive. And every time I dream it I get a little farther. But one night I got out of the car. The next night I wrote a note, begging my mother not to try to find me. The next night I left her a message on her answering machine, telling her where to get her car. Then I picked up a bag and went into the woods. For a few nights I'd just get farther into the woods. But last night I pulled a pistol put of the bag and put the barrel in my mouth and I'm afraid to go to sleep again because I don't know what's going to happen.

I know I can't kill my real self in a dream. I can't kill my real self because somebody has to pay child support for my baby girl. My ex doesn't take care of her and on the weekends i get to see her my baby girl has scratches on her legs and she has feces on her bottom, but she has a clean diaper. I tried calling CAS, but they say I don't have enough evidence to open a file with them. I feel so helpless and I'm scared that if I pull the trigger in my dream I'll lose what's left of my soul. I don't want to wake up and just be a shell.

But then I think that maybe that's all I deserve. If I deserved to be a dad I would be one. If I deserved to be loved I wouldn't be alone anymore. Maybe all I deserve is work. 

I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense. I'm not sleeping much anymore. I overload on caffeine and nicotine trying not to go to sleep.
