Can you guys sacrifice 5 minutes of your time to make me feel better? (X post from /r/offmychest)This is going to sound pathetic but can you guys upload a sound recording anywhere that says "Stay strong Razi" "It'll pass Razi" or anything that would make me feel better. I feel suicidal and I am scared because I almost jumped five minutes ago
