I'm at a dead endI'm 17 and I don't know what to do, I absolutely hate myself and everyone else does too.
I don't have any friends anymore, the only few people I actually hang around with bully, manipulate, and take advantage of me mercilessly all the time.

I just really want to turn back time by just over 1 year and lock time there, back when life was good.
In the past year it's all been hell and I've been hurt beyond my own imagination.

I'm gonna fail education, and right now I just want to live alone and not have to do anything or die.
I'm a failure at life and my mind is telling me that I don't belong anymore.
