I just don't know what to doWell I come home from school (I am a 15 year old boy with foreign parents) and my parents are really strict about me playing games during the week. It is Friday and after another week of listening to them, I come home and turn on my pc to play something. In the background I hear my father screaming at my little brother for doing something bad at school (he is 13, and it is the usual for him). I calmly ignore it. My mother is still at work at this point, and won't be home for several hours. My father approaches me, screaming at me to turn it off claiming I needed to study for a non-existent test that I have next week. I comply gettting off the computer and procede to my room, explaining how I don't have anything to study. [okay I know this is a long story but my father is everything about grades. I try to keep mine up but I'm slipping in my french class, but it is only down to a 85. Here is something about my family. I have an older brother, who is my father's favorite. He just finished his first year of college, and my father believes he is the greatest thing to ever walk the Earth. I have a younger brother that my mother absolutely loves, and defends him over everything. Then there is me. I am a 15 year old boy, and it is very clear that I am the middle child, and that I am the least liked among my family. I don't understand why I am because I seem to be the only one that obeys my parents of the three of us. My younger brother is rampant and out of control at school, and my older brother smokes marijuana secretly.] So I continue to my room telling my dad that I'm doing fine in school, and he religiously checks my grade and tells me how its low due to a test. I tell him that its fine and I continue to my room, and start watching a movie on my laptop. In the background I can hear him taking the desktop I was playing with and he screams that I won't be getting it back. I tell him that I don't mind, and I don't care really, it is just a game. He doesn't like this. He runs into my room and takes my laptop. I tell him that isn't going to take my french grade up. He tells me to stay in my room, and a minute after I sit down in there, he runs in and tells me to empty my pockets. He takes my phone (one he payed for) and throws it against the wall in anger. I tell him that won't do anything to my grade, and that he is acting childish. He commands me to stay in my room.

Five minutes pass, and I walk downstairs to watch tv. He follows me to the room I'm watching tv and is lecturing me on the importance of grades. He continues to compare me to my older brother, which he knows I don't like. As I'm on the couch he pulls me up violently and begins to hit me. I am not a violent person at all, but I am infact much bigger than he is. I snatch my arm away and he tries to push me and I warn him not to touch me. I believe this scared him, and he could only fight me with his words.

Things like this happen all the time but he has never showed the act of throwing things against the wall, excessive screaming or physical violence. I don't want to live in the same house as he does, as he pushes me to the limit. I come home and I'm greeted with many insults, such as 'pig' 'animal' 'horse' 'retard' and many more, coming from my own father. 

I am now thinking about just killing myself, but I think that it would have too much of a devastating effect on him, other family, friends, teachers, etc.

Please, I need some help. Abuse is constant like this, I don't want to report him to child services or anything, and my mother will side with whatever my father is doing to me, no matter what.

I appreciate any and all responses, positive or negative, I just desperately need someone to talk to. I'm scared.
