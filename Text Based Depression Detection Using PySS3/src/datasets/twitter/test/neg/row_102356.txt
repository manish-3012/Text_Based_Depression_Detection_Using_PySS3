Tuesday.Woke up like 47 minutes ago. it's 4 pm soon. still trying making it until tomorrow morning. (9 am) my nurse is back from her vacation.

The last 1-2 weeks has been rough and I've been close to doing it a few times or wanting to die 24/7. which I still do. not sure what she'll say but we'll see.

Life still sucks and waking up is pointless.
