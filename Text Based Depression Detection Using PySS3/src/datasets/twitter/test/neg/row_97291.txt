Iâ€™m so stuck.Iâ€™m horrible at my job. And I just canâ€™t focus enough to be better? Or maybe I donâ€™t care? But I really fucking care so I donâ€™t know what level of apathy is eating at me that I canâ€™t just function. Everyone else does it? People are just out there...living like this. And doing just fucking fine. Why canâ€™t I be like that? Why canâ€™t I just fucking do anything? I donâ€™t understand.

I just want to head on out and not think about anything again. Not feel this gutting shame. 
But I have built a bit of a life. And it could be so good. But Iâ€™m ruining it all.
