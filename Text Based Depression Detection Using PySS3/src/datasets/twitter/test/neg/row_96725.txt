Do I hug them?I love my friends. I love my family. I just do.  
I would do anything to prevent myself from inflicting unnecessary pain on them. 

I also can't control my thoughts and impulses, and for that, I'm sorry.

I just want to know.... do I hug them all (some for the first time) before I go? Would that alarm them? 

I don't know if that's selfish. I want to feel them... their warmth. I want to squeeze the life out of them. I want them to know that I care so much about them, despite the stupid shit that I'm about to go do.
