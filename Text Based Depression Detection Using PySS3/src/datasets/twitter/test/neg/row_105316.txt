Fucking Horrible Person that I amI feel like a terrible person, I have a friend that I tell everything to.  And I know he no longer cares at all, about what's going on in my life.  I know I have other people, but he's it.  He knows everything, I'm so suicidal and yet I seem to have everything going for me.  I'm just at a loss, I want to be able to help him but he now has a girlfriend that hates me.  I found out something that happened tonight through reddit, I'm complaining about things that are so pointless at least in my opinion and something like this happened.  I'm horrible.  There's also the times he's taken frustration out on me and told me he can't deal with my depression.  That it's too much for him and I don't know what to say.  I still want to be his friend, but what I want the most is to die.
