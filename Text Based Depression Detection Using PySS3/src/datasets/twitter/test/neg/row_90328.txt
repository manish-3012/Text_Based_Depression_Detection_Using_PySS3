I refuseI used to think that suicide is the only way out. I had thought that at a very young age because i didnt have a purpose. My life started off great as a baby but always knew something wasnt right. I wasnt right. Something was wrong with me, but I didnt really know what. I had imaginary friends who didnt go away and slowly became more demanding. I've dealt with it alone for years but I dont want to quite speak about that yet.

When I was 13, I had my first boyfriend. He was my first everything, first kiss, first valentine, but he was the first for things i was not ready for. He took my virginity without my consent. I stayed quiet. Because I stayed quiet, it kept happening over and over again until finally I lost count of how many times it happened and I was ready for my life was over. Luckily, I had overprotective parents who didnt know what was going on but did put an end to him. However, I had this mentality that I needed to stay quiet because it was my fault. It was MY OWN fault was a 13 year old girl that I was the reason being raped, because I DESERVED it. My imaginary friends got worse. 

When I was 17, I had my first real suicide attempt. You know, the one that was truly was going to end it all. All the people inside my head and the memories were no longer going to haunt me. So, I warned the cops because my body would be eventually found. Thank whoever is watching out for me because they came as soon as they heard. I was admitted to a medical hospital for three days, then eventually psychiatric hospital for right. Depression and psychosis doesnt get cured in eight days. But i didnt know this. I felt guilty when i left because I let everyone I know down because I did not feel like me. I felt worse. Everyday I felt worse because now I was actually faced with the problems and the pressure I was trying to ignore for years. 

Recently, I tried to commit suicide again. I really thought hard because I am truly worthless. But then I remember the people I met. I've truly amazing people because I tutor languages and get to speak from people all over the world. Different walks of life are what builds us not only as a community, but as humanity. So in recent events, I refuse to stay silent. I refuse to let my past and problems get the best of me. Rape is not taboo. Rape is here and its very real, just like any mental illness or just like any other challenge and we should not stay silent. WE ARE IMPORTANT.

I say this because one day I will be a wife and a mother. I will teach my daughter to speak up and to not be afraid of speaking whats on her mind. I will teach my sons that anything that can happen to a girl, can happen to man too, so he needs to speak up and speak his mind. Teach the both of them at they are human, they matter, and no matter what wrongs they have done or what they think they have done, that challenges and mental, psychical, any illness is not their fault. Stop trying to be okay for others, and start trying for yourself because in the end, its no one else but you who will see the rewards.
