I'm so brokenI'm losing what i thought was going to be my future wife,  she is kicking me out,  and i can't find ANYWHERE to live.  She was my best friend, and now when i walk by her to close myself off into a different room,  she always seems so happy,  and it fucking destroys me!    


I don't even know what i did.  I have the feeling she is talking to another guy,  and the thought of her being happy with someone else hurts so bad,  and the thought of her being physical with someone like she was with me, makes me completely sick to my stomach.   


I'm so fucking lonely and the closer i get to having to move,  the more hurt and scared i get,  because i know that i have to face the truth,  and i will never be comfortable and happy with her again.   


I can't do this again.  I really thought she was the one,  and ive never felt that before,  and once i have to walk out the door,  i know it will close behind me to never open again,  but for someone else,  someone that she has deemed as better than me,  and more worth while than I am,  even after this life we've built together.    


The only real option is to move back to my parents,  and that is so fucking painful,  it feels like I've lost at everything.  I don't want to be alive anymore
