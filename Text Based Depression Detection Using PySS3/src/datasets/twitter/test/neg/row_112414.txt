"Not bad enough"I feel like if I don't need to go to the hospital for my mental health, then it's not really that bad? I feel bad even posting this, but I think a part of me almost seems to want to go because then it will show everyone how much I am struggling. Even just writing that makes me feel guilty ugh. 

I can't stop thinking about killing myself and I feel like Im on the edge but also I've never done anything so I feel like they wouldn't take me seriously? I think I need help but I'm afraid that somehow I'm just making this up. I'm just so used to hiding everything and I'm so fucking exhausted, and idk what to do anymore.
