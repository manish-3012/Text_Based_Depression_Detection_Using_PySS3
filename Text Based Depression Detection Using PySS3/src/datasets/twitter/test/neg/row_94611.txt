What happens if I tell my therapist?Hey, I hope this is an okay place to post this question. Iâ€™m wondering what would happen if I told my therapist about my suicidal thoughts. Iâ€™ve always had a deep fear of telling people about my suicidal thoughts but lately theyâ€™ve gotten worse. Iâ€™ve figured out a couple specific plans that would be relatively easy to carry out. And Iâ€™ve gotten to a place twice in the past week where Iâ€™ve felt the need to contact a crisis line. 
Iâ€™ve been suicidal in the past, and Iâ€™ve attempted twice. Iâ€™m scared this time because my problems have multiplied and theyâ€™re bigger. I feel like Iâ€™m collapsing under the weight of my life and I donâ€™t care enough to stop it. Thatâ€™s what scares me the most. In the past Iâ€™ve cared at least a bit. This time around Iâ€™m asking my friends and family for support but Iâ€™m unable to verbalize how bad off I am. 
Thank you for any help.
