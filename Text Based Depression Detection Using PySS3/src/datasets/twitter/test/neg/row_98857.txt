Suicide sub?Didn't there used to be a sub with people who were considering suicide? Not for people seeking help? I'm not looking for someone to talk to me, tell me anything they think will help etc. Im just looking for the quickest most painless way. I've considered the nitrogen based pod but it's expensive. Maybe if there is a similar method that is less expensive. I can afford a couple grand but would not have enough for post expenses if I bought the pod. Considering waiting to be able to afford the pod plus expenses but would prefer to not wait that long.
