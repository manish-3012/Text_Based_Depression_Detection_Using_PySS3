I've got 2 months until my job ends. That's when I can finally leave this worldAfter a review today, my work has decided to let me go early. I will be gone late January rather than May. It's a scary thought. I've been planning for a while to end it all afterwards.

For the first time in my life I was given a lot of money, and I have blown most of it on other people. Ignoring please to control my spending because I'm not going to have any use for it soon.

My friends slowly isolated me and now I'm completely alone. Have been for the past couple of weeks.


Now, I'm okay with what happens. I already wrote my will giving my money to my niece once she turns of age. She's the one person I'm going to miss. I just hope she'll remember me for the good things instead of watching me lose myself.

There are a couple friends that I hate to leave but my time is over. This year has been the worst year of my life and I'm just ready to leave it all behind. And I've never felt more comfortable and unafraid since I've been thinking this way.

I tried counseling three times and it three times it just made me worse. I just have to accept I was norn this way and there's no hope for something like me
