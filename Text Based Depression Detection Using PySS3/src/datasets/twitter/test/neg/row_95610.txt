I just want this to end. I don't want to struggle anymore.I've been fighting for 3 years just to stay alive and I don't think this life is worth it anymore. Constantly trying to fill a void which I don't know will ever be filled. I barely feel alive anymore just feels like I exsist in this god awful life. The feeling of being alone consumes me every waking moment. Can't keep on like this it always hurts. Loved ones plead for me to stay but is it so wrong just to end the misery? I'll never be the person I want to be. I never thought this is how things would end. I just wish things could have been different but alas not everyone gets what they want. Twenty one years for nothing.
