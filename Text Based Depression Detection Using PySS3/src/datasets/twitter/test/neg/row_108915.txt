I wish...I wish the stomach blockage I had killed me in my infancy.

I wish my mom didn't call poison control in time when 1-year-old me drank bleach.

I wish the piece of bark that landed in my 5-year-old eye was a whole fucking tree.

I wish that my first surgery was a catastrophic failure.

I wish I had hit my head instead of my foot while zip lining. 

I wish that my first battle with depression had resulted in a loss.

I wish my cousin held me under too long when we swam in grandma's pool.

I wish my heart palpitations on the first day of college were a heart attack.

I wish that on graduation day no one was there to make me feel like I have to stay here.

I wish that car accident that's fucking up my family's bank account had fucked me up instead.

I wish that my family wouldn't try to comfort me over it and then later snap at me.

I wish I had the guts to blow my God damn brains out.
