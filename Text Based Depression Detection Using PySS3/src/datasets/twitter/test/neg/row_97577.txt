Bad luck? Pls helpWithin the last 24 hours all this happened:

- I had a massive spider on me, screamed, smashed my phone screen I have no money to repair 
- Got paid! Only Â£400, not enough to pay my rent which is Â£500, no money for food, dog food. I had to self-isolate for a week after showing Covid symptoms. 
- My neighbour told me off for something I didn't do 
- A fault came up on my car which I have no money to fix 
- My dog knocked over the hoover and it put a massive hole in the wall 

I feel so overwhelmed. What can I do to calm down? What can I tell myself that'll make me stop wanting to end it all so I don't have any of troubles?
