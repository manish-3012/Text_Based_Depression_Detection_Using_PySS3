Itâ€™s not easy to commit suicide, i triedi have been thinking about committing suicide for months my life has been super shit and i have been depressed since like 2008,so i stop going to college and try to enjoy as much as i can until my time. My parents they found out that am a suicidal, i donâ€™t live with them, but i think my father is coming to stop me etc.i turned off my phone, so nobody would be able to contact me

so this was supposed to be the week that i would be gone.

day 1: i prepared myself, i went out bought a nylon belt, rope to attach to the belt, i have been reading how to, and the consequences of failing, i thought this it, i went to drink (1st time in years) i was super tired and i decided to do on the next day:

DAY 2; went out in the morning (rope and the belt on my bag ready) i thought it would easy, 10pm i went to drink again, idk i just felt soo tired, and i still didnâ€™t know where i would do it, i wanted to find some tree in the dark and that would be it. i was with my ipad and my laptop and i decided to do in the next day, because i want my laptop and ipad to be with my sister or brother.i felt like they would steal it if my laptop/ipad was with me.

DAY 3;i was reading all night just to go as painless as possible, and i decided to write a note, i did write a note, i left my ipad with the note as screensaver, deleted everything on ipad, passwords i wrote them on the note, idk what happened i think i was super scared, and i wasnâ€™t feeling good, maybe i was with hangover, i just went to my room.

DAY 4: (yersterday), i didnâ€™t drink, because i think the beer was interfering, 11pm, super cold night, i tried to find some empty place with a tree, i did find a OKAY place,was super dark, i was scared, i was scared of dying, and the pain of hanging myself, fuck am a coward i thought this would be easy.

DAY 5; today, itâ€™s 10pm, still donâ€™t know what to do, idk but am feeling like my father is in my room, i feel like if i go to my room i will find him there. i just donâ€™t want to see him, i donâ€™t want to live but am a coward, i thought i could do it easily. and because of how unlucky am and how shitty my life is, i think i will fail (permanent brain damage) or something will go wrong and feel too much pain.

Jumping would be very easy, but i donâ€™t want my body to be messed up, and again, i donâ€™t know where to do it, my building has only 4 floors so i think i will fail.
i donâ€™t trust pills, many people have failed.
hanging is the only method right now but fuck didnâ€™t know it would be this scary

if anyone have tried and fail please dm me, and explain to me a little bit about it
