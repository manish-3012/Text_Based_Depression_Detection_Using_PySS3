I guess we all feel some way huh?Tired of living just to be let down again, I used to love sleep as it was my only escape but now I dread sleep it was my only escape, I look forward to nothing, everything I used to enjoy and bring me happiness has stopped doing just that and idk why I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s left. I hate sleep now cuz I know all I have to do is wake up and repeat the cycle. Sleep just to wake up and clock in to a job I dislike, work for money I donâ€™t care about to pay bills for a life I donâ€™t want. I go home to a house I donâ€™t wanna live in, working I just wanna be home but when Iâ€™m home I just wish I woulda died sooner I used to jokingly say I wanted to die before I hit 20, figured it would change by the time I hit 20. Now Iâ€™m 20, Nd I just cry Nd write to myself to make the pain of living go away, itâ€™s not working anymore, even though I have people I donâ€™t mind being with they canâ€™t help much anymore. Telling somebody I love them even as I write this but I donâ€™t love myself so I feel like they deserve more then I can provide, I just wanna die before I let myself or others down again, itâ€™s weird when I think of writing my mind starts to run through all my feelings at once but I canâ€™t let it all out for some reason I canâ€™t even do this right.I hope anyone else who reads this can find happiness Nd I hope you can love enough to forget all your pain even if it takes someoneâ€™s help I want you to smile stranger, just be happy cuz I think my time is running out but you might still have time to be happy just know a random on Reddit wanted you to smile today even if you have to force it for a second please donâ€™t let it get worse its okay I promise
