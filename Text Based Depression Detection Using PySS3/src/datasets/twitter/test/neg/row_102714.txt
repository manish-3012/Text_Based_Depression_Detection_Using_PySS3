I wouldn't blame anyone in my shoes...for committing suicide. Between the years of pain behind me and years of pain to come I don't know what else to do. 

I want a reason to live so bad... but my brain is defective. I know I have BPD. My mother had it. I have all the symptoms. It's miserable. Now that I know, I feel worse. Probably because all of my pain is now officially out of my control. 

I had been thinking "If I had gotten help sooner I might have more friends now, I might still have the person I cared about most." But now I know it doesn't matter. They all deserve someone without a defective brain. Especially my ex. 

Only thing that could make me want to live is if she forgave me. Even just as a friend. I'd kill for her to encourage me. To still care about me. I can't stand having hurt her. I can't stand the disassociation.
