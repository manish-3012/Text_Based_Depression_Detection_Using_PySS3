Hey guys I hope you can help me. I'm 22, I like science, and I live in the south.I have a weird situation and I know that I have depression just based on my belief but seeing a professional will say oh here are some pills to make you feel better. I feel like a professional will just try to fix me physically and mechanically. My real problem is something philosophical. It's like a need some kind of philosopher to tell me how to cope just from the perception of reality I am experiencing. Or just someone to agree with me and says, "ya man, you need to get the hell out of there and run as far away from that place as you can." NOBODY has ever told me too and I'm getting scared like everyone is infected with indoctrination and I can't do anything about it. 

Where I'm from I have to wake up everyday and lie to myself and say I believe in talking snakes and people walking on water just so I can feel somewhat sane. I'm sorry I'm just using my logical brain that God gave me. Do I have to go to my psychologist and tell him I don't believe in talking snakes or that I don't believe in a virgin birth? It scares me because I'm 22 and I feel like I'm not even grown up yet and my parents are 50-60 years old and they believe in the religious stories and go to church every weekend. They constantly talk about how non religious people are the worst kind of people. They always tell me how much my they hated them when they were growing up. All my friends except for 1 is religious. 

I'm telling YOU there is absolutely no diversity where I'm from, which gives the question... Do people think for themselves? Is everyone just scared of death and they'll believe anything they hear just to cover up death as if it's not there? it's so eerie to me to think that everybody is infected with the ideas of early human prehistory and nobody knows. 

Please tell me this isn't actually happening... I feel like I'm in a bad dream or something. Like I don't know why I feel so consciously aware of what's going on. What the hell is my problem? Am I crazy for loving how the world naturally works? Am I not supposed to? Why would God create the dinosaurs? Why would he make it look like the universe is expanding? Why would he make the distance of stars billions of miles away instead of 6 thousand? Why would he make the human genome 98% identical to chimpanzees genome? Why would he make the crust of the earth layer by layer with single cells at the bottom reptiles in the middle and mammals at the top? (And it's like that everywhere on earth) Why did he put almost every hominid fossil in the African Savannah?
Why did he make EVERYTHING so easy to put together? It's so amazing! To write this and know exactly how I got here. WHO CAN'T BE AMAZED BY THAT?!!!?!

If I do come out and if I am honest with myself, I will just be mentally discriminated by everyone. 
I keep thinking about suicide day in and day out, because to be honest, if hell were real; it would be a better place than this living hell I'm experiencing every single day. Like I can't even talk to anyone because all I got are just weird looks as if I'm the crazy one. Shouldn't it be easier to lose faith then it is to have it?? I feel it's easier to gain faith than it is to lose it. "I exist therefore there is a God." I feel like that's how it works. Everybody is already prewired with a predisposition in their mind of already having the idea that there is a deity, no questions asked. If losing faith is so easy.... THEN WHY HAVEN'T I MET ANYBODY WHO DENIES RELIGION?? 

I'm sorry if I offend anybody but that's just what I'm going through and I feel like nobody gives a crap about me because they think I'm probably possessed or something. It makes me so uncomfortable having 3 churches on every block in my town like 1 wasn't enough. I feel like I'm living in the Truman show. 

PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HELP AND GIVE ME SOME ADVICE!! (No pun intended)
