I'm finished (21/M)One time my girlfriend of two years (first love etc) blindsided me and broke it off so then I walked to the train station by my house with the intention of throwing myself in front of the train but it was late and the trains weren't running. I had just turned 20 then. I'm almost 22 now. I wish I could have died then. 

I've alienated most of my friends by this point and my parents care about me but I don't care about them or anyone else. I used to be real hateful towards myself but that's not even the problem anymore. I just feel bad for us all I'm so sad all the time I barely notice it anymore, my natural state is just like a calm and stable misery. I don't have emotional highs and lows like I used to. If I end up killing myself it's going to be carefully planned and calculated and premeditated. I don't know what else to do. I've tried everything a bunch of different times. Counseling, drugs, love, art, mindfulness, anything you could name. I used to want to write books and find the love of my life and make my family proud but I could have all the friends and women and social status in the world and it wouldn't change a thing because I'd still be the same miserable person in the same awful world
