I've lost it all and it is my fault.I had started a marriage and worked a ok job. My wife liked to spend money but not so crazy. I lost my job and found somthibg minimum wage that we could barley get by on. My wife wanted to finish school so I didn't continue.  Life got so stressful and my depression grew and grew. Until one day we got in a fight and she threw her wedding ring at me. I left and we were separated off and on for a year. I needed time to straighten myself out and her just to for once hold me and say it will be ok. I finally see the light at the end of the depression tunnel. I start writing her and plan on giving it to her when we hang out next time. Finally get a chance to hang out and I'm super excited. I get there and we eat dinner and it just feels weird. She asks me to move some,boxes to her basement so she can get the place cleaned up. Of course no problem. Afterwards she hardly will talk to me and stays on phone. I think I'll give it to her next time. The next week can't get a hold of her can't get a text response. Finnally get a response and she says she is busy. Then on her Facebook I find out she has a new boyfriend and he has moved on after a very short time. They have been dating for 3 weeks and he already moved in 2 and a half weeks ago. I now can't see my wife, my dogs, my cat, anything. I wanted so bad to work on it and the second I get up the courage and free myself from depression she moves on. I have no reason to live without my marriage. Without my wife and family I'm nothing. I might as well and it. I can't let 7 years end over stupid mistakes. Now it is over. My life is over goodbye
