I'm such a loser.I'm too weak and pathetic of a person to live. Every day of my life since I was 11 has been a nightmare. As soon as I got to middle school I started having horrible social anxiety. I can't think when I'm around people; my mind goes completely blank and my stomach just constantly flips and I shake and my face goes red and I look like an idiot. Since this started happening, I've literally only ever had one friend who I barely hang out with. I've done everything I'm supposed to do to fix it and nothing works. I also just recently got my first job (embarrassingly late in life) and I can't deal with it. A monkey could replace me and do better. I've never felt this stupid before and that's really saying something. I desperately want to quit but I can't because I'm in a really bad position. I cry and think about suicide constantly. The only reason I'm still here is because I don't want to hurt my family but wasting every single day of my life and failing at everything kills me inside.
