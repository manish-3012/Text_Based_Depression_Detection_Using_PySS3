I'd really like to kill myself now.I think I'm done with life. I suck at it and it's not fun. Add to this the fact that since I'm a middle class person living in North America, I shouldn't be complaining since people have it worse, so on top of everything I'm a whiny loser.

I've tried to change myself so many times. I'm almost 24 and I've gone through therapy, medication, changing the thought patterns in my head, exercise, going out, a combination of all the things. And it's always back to the same mindset eventually of thinking that  I'm a worthless nobody and changing that is impossible. I'm just done. I don't want anything out of life. I suck with girls. I'm broke university student with student loans and the economy is shit and the shitty jobs that are available don't inspire confidence. I'm just a guy with no ability to change or influence anything positively. My life is so insignificant and useless and the realization is too glaring now for me to keep living this lie.

I wish somebody could say something to make this better. But that won't happen and this post has been exercise in futility.
