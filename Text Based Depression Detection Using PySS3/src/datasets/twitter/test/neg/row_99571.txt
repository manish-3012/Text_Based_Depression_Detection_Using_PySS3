Went off the gridToday I decided to delete all social media and cut myself off from everyone. Iâ€™ve been struggling for months and itâ€™s only getting worse. Iâ€™m in college, but Iâ€™m doing rather poorly. Right now I have no money for gas to make it to school, itâ€™s a 50 minutes drive and my car only gets 17 to the gallon. 

 Another thing is my boyfriend, weâ€™ve been together for a few months shy of a year. Friday we celebrated his 20th birthday and we got drunk (including his parents). He started saying horrible things about me, he called me suicide watch and started going on about how bad my mental health was. I had to brush it off and pretend it didnâ€™t happen because his parents were there. I talked to him about it the next morning, he felt bad but that doesnâ€™t deflect the fact he did it. 

Iâ€™m just 18, I have no family nor a stable home. No money for food or gas, no one to help me live. I start a job at Walmart sometime next week and I know thatâ€™s going to take a toll on me as well. I really just want to kill myself, Iâ€™ve been depressed and suicidal since the age of 7. I think itâ€™s time, itâ€™s way overdue.
