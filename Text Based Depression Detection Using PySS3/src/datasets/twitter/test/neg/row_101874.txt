In a rut, if thereâ€™s a way out then itâ€™s so out of reach it might as well not be there.Iâ€™ll try to summarize and make it short and as sweet as I can but I really need to get some things off my chest and I donâ€™t know where to go or what to do anymore.

The last five years of my life has been a slow downhill tumble from â€˜that sucksâ€™ to â€˜yeah I canâ€™t do this anymore, whatâ€™s the easiest way to be done with itâ€™ metaphorically and quite literally. 

Quick backstory; I came from a very abusive upbringing and school was equally tough moving around as I was always â€œthe new kidâ€ and home problems (unending chores, assault, mental and physical pain, hunger) simply turned into school problems (bullying and academic pressure). I knew something wasnâ€™t right with me around 12 when I first attempted in relief from my fathers punishments. I got counselling in my childhood but it never ended up helping because it was just a tool my parents would use against eachother in court. I moved out early and life wasnâ€™t easier - just more difficult in different ways. After an abusive boyfriend of four years was taken away by the police my mother combined me to come to her house and that she will treat me better and help me get on my feet. My mother has her own mental health problems and it quickly became a neverending loop of me quite literally doing chores and babysitting for her as an adult for two years to the point I couldnâ€™t hold a job at all and any money I did make she took from my hands, and I just let her. I know it was wrong but I was raised to do as iâ€™m told and even to the day I find great difficulty in saying â€œnoâ€. She took more and more and my only coping method (training my horse) was taken from me because apparently his value in cash was worth more than my happiness and I was not allowed to ever grieve properly after. It got to the point I couldnâ€™t even cry without her coming down on me and I started to self harm.  In this time I dated a man with anger issues and a drinking problem, I made him my world in all my spare time but he despised even being around me if I wasnâ€™t cleaning the house or making him dinner. He yelled at me and it triggered my ptsd so iâ€™d cry which would make him yell more at me to shut up, it just wasnâ€™t a good match. I tried so hard to make him happy but I never could. He would comment on my body and I even considered getting surgery to appease him so iâ€™d look more like his ex that he lost but made it clear he would always have a part in his heart for her that would never be for me. I know, I never took the hint. I left him on my last birthday after he left his journal out by the living room table detailing his love for another and I knew right then and there by staying im just wasting both of our time. He never loved me and never will, nor will I ever be the person he wants and I couldnâ€™t change that. I hope he found what he is looking for and is happy now at least. Thatâ€™s over and Iâ€™ve finally been able to let go of any thoughts of him aside from a passing glance down the hell of memory lane lmao. 
Catching up, my mother got even tougher on me and I said fuck it, if iâ€™m going to die then I might as well do anything to make it better. I got a ride offer to alberta and I took it. I packed any small possessions I could take with me in a tote and one morning when she wasnâ€™t awake i told them I was ready and got out. She knew earlier I might be leaving and she wouldnâ€™t allow me to leave our property without enough reason, yet alone move despite my pleading and deteriorating health so it had to be this way. I tried weeks before that sitting down and letting her know that I canâ€™t live like this and even though I love her, itâ€™s too much and my life is in shambles. She didnâ€™t care. She wouldnâ€™t even let me see a therapist because she said that I â€œwasnt allowedâ€. I explained that im turning 25 and really I should be allowed thats a bit ridiculous but of course id get the whole â€œtheyll be consenquencesâ€ or â€œwhere will you go you have nothing and nobodyâ€ / â€œyoure a nobody what would you even doâ€. I paid rent over three times any normal person did. I am a human being too I should have rights. I didnâ€™t. It was just a whole mindfuck. I cut ties with my father when I was a teen and she was the last family I had.

Anyhow... 25 now. Just had my birthday and despite being far, far away from all of that and my past I still am suffering. It isnt as sharp of a pain metaphorically but not just a dull sawblade that I know is there but canâ€™t subdue. I got my own banking now so any money I make is now my own. I changed my number. She kept my car and most of my belongings. I donâ€™t have alot of money whatsoever but I can eat and have a roof so thatâ€™s a start. Nothing brings me joy; I can watch movies, play video games, sleep, anything now and yet when I do it I still feel nothingness. Medication never helped me. I wanted to be so much and do so much but all the years of my life others spent building themselves up I was just torn down. I have no purpose. Iâ€™m financially crippled. Im afraid to make friends because of how worthless i am. Iâ€™m not attractive. I cant wear much that reveals skin too because its a cluster of self made scars now. I tried reading dbt books and mindfulness has helped a bit but not enough for any significant change. I donâ€™t want to sleep non-stop forever and whenever iâ€™m not doing a chore/housework I have no idea what to even do with myself. I think about not being here everyday and I want it to be scary but it isnâ€™t - it just feels normal to me. Itâ€™s not like id even have anyone come to my funeral or anything to give in my will anymore lol. What does someone my age with my circumstances do with their life and how do they find any bit of dopamine anymore? I want this nightmare to stop. I just want to feel okay. I donâ€™t think I ever will. 

Thanks for reading, im sorry to whine
