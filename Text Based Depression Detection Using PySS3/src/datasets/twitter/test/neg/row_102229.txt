I just want to not exist anymore.I just typed a huge wall of text, but I figured no one actually wants to read my pathetic life story so I deleted it.


I just feel like my existence has just been one major failure after another. Nothing has ever worked out the way I wanted it to, despite me doing everything I could. 


I have people in my life whom I love and love me, and I'm trying to hold on that to keep me going, but I'm just so tired. I don't know how much longer I can do this. I keep hoping that if I just keep pushing forward my life will get better, but I'm not convinced anymore. 


I just wish I was never born. No one would miss me and I could finally stop hurting.


I'm just so tired of trying for nothing.
