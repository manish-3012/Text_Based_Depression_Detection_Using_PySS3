ReturnA lot has happened recently. New stressors, returning demons, and simply a total swing in my outlook. Of course, I'm not usually peppy or happy, but I was sort of... in the clear for 3 weeks. No thoughts, no overbearing, dominating stress. Just mundane, which is better than it is now.

Fucking Oswald.

I apologize in advance for how incoherent this post is and will be. It's more of a venting session for me to rant than anything else.

So, thoughts are coming back. 2 weeks until a major event, maybe I just won't go. I can't handle it. Of course, if I even cry in front of my family I'll get thrown in a padded room (I don't have any history for thoughts or attempts they're just like that) Not only that, but my emotional footing is falling apart and I can't bear to do any of it but doing anything about any of it or trying to avoid any unfavorable situation will not end well. What am I supposed to do, outright tell my family I have thoughts? Bullshit. That's not going to happen. And then, there's Oswald. I'm not going to specify what it did or anything because again I don't need someone to read this I just need to type it.

I'm falling apart. Again, I'm a mess. And because it's just fucking middle school I can casually suggest thoughts, death, my own existential crisis or even my outlook on life. Nobody gives a shit. I'm just some caricature of 'relatability' to these misunderstanding idiots. Nobody means it when they say 'I want to die'. They can't possibly even understand it. Of course, I've thought about my own funeral enough to understand that death is weird and I don't even want to think about it right now.

So, most of the time in classes I'm either half asleep due to utter lack of sleep (maybe 3 hours this week) that has become routine or thinking about how to die. And I refuse to tell anyone about it. Sometimes I think, 'I have no means but blade, basically. No gun, no nearby river, no incredible height nearby. Then again, if I'm really considering this it suggests pain my while alive was unbearable and constant, so I guess that works.' So I'm only staying for unfinished business or the mental health of those who love me. Despite the fact the only person I actually love is straight, so I'm shit out of luck.

Jesus that was a mess. Goodnight.
