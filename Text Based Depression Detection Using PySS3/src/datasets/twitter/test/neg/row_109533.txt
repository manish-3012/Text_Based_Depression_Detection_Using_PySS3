There is no real purpose to being aliveI have spent many years fighting for a people, fighting for a cause, fighting, thinking, obsessing, stressing, crying, writing...

...now I realize not only is the cause futile, and filled with people who are corrupt outgrowths of that which they fight, but once I put the cause aside, there is no real reason to be alive. 

There is no fundamental purpose. The people who say there is have lied to themselves and others. They have found ways to occupy their time to avoid the recognition that there is fundamentally no real reason to be alive. Being and not being are subjective states of affairs. There is no such thing as human rights, or human wrong, or good or evil. There is nothing. Existence has no purpose. 

And I am all out of sensory reasons to be alive. I don't care about money. I don't care about food or fucking. I don't see a purpose anymore. There is no actual reason to be here or to do anything. Why shouldn't I just be dead? What's the reason not to? Especially when we will all die anyway?
