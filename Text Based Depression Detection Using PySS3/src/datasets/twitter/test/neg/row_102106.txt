Had a manic episode last nightI live in LA. Made the 5 1/2 hour drive to Big Sur in the middle of the right. Drove with the windows down and the music blasting. I was so excited to die I was screaming with glee. I arrived at a beautiful bridge. I parked and walked to the very middle and climbed over. I watched the sunrise. It was so beautiful. A sweet old man talked me out of it. I drove home to a household that had no idea where I was. Told them I was working an 8 hour shift. They believed me. I feel so alone.
