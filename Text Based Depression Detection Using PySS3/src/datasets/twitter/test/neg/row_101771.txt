in betweenI realized at work that I am completely unlovable for long-term, in-person relationships. I am single serve. Too much and people don't want more. 

I wish I could say I was suicidal because then at least I could put words to whatever this urge to pur a bullet in my face is. Which sounds stupid because that's suicidal. I just wonder why I should keep existing when there's no point. Humans are pack animals and I have no pack. No tribe wants me. Andyeah, blah blah "the internet will love you!' but the internet can't be there to help you when you can't help yourself. My best friends live 1500 miles away. They weren't there the last time I almost bought a gun. They weren't there for the tattoos I got to try and stave off this overwhelming feeling of unwanted. 

Does this count? I'm not in danger except that my life no longer matters to me. Do you have to be considering taking action to be suicidal? Can the wanton abandonment of your responsibilities be a kind of suicide?
