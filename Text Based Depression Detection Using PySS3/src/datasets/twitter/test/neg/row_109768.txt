new herehey, this is prob gonna be a lame post but itâ€™s 1:58am and iâ€™m up thinking about how much i hate going through the motions of this life iâ€™m not living. iâ€™m just existing, and barely that. i have no friends and iâ€™m so disconnected from everything. iâ€™ve healed and recovered before but i can tell itâ€™s going to be ten times harder this time, and it feels impossible. iâ€™ve been used, iâ€™ve been abused, so much has happened these past couple years and i know people get through this shit but i donâ€™t even feel worth it. i canâ€™t figure out how to be a normal and high functioning 19 year old with all my mental problems and i think about dying all the time. 
iâ€™m in a dbt program and iâ€™m getting weight loss surgery this summer due to a medical problem, iâ€™m 290 pounds, so i kinda wanna stick around for those two things to see if i improve but i feel like i go downhill no matter what i do. itâ€™s like someone else has the steering wheel of my life, some different version of the true me that just wants to wreck the car.
