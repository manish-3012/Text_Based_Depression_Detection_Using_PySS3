I'm ready.January 15th. That's the date I plan on ending it. I've forced myself into a corner, and it's the only way out. I've spent my whole life using and tanking from people. When I'm done, I just ignore them and pretend they're not there. I'm alone now and it is my fault. I've been lazy at work, and I'm likely to lose my job at the beginning of the year. I'm a giant slob, and my appartment is basically falling apart due to my neglect. If ever management decides to do an inspection I'm likely to be evicted.
