I might commitHi,Iâ€™m 12 years old and I donâ€™t know if I should cling on to my life or just let go.

Yesterday it was my 12th birthday and like always my mum started an argument with my grandma.we have been living with my grandma for 2 years now and there have only been 5-10 days where they havenâ€™t argued.

Most of the time Iâ€™m the one my mum will take everything out on.I know that families have arguments but she takes it to far.Sometimes she will belittle me by calling me a â€œstupid and ungrateful piece of shitâ€ and other times she will call me a â€œdisgusting accidentâ€.

I know this will probably sound like a joke but itâ€™s not she is so horrible every single day and she has even made fun of me because I got bullied in year 4 (Iâ€™m British).

This time though she took it way to far.yesterday she started an argument and walked out on me on my birthday,my 12th fucking birthday.she was gone for 7 hours and when she got back she didnâ€™t apologise or even say hi she just told me and my grandma to fuck off.

I brought this up to her about 30 minutes ago and she once again screamed and swore at me about how itâ€™s all my fault and my grandmas fault.she then stormed out of the house swearing as she went.

Sheâ€™s just so horrible and hurts everyone around her all of the time.This time though she pushed it to far I might commit suicide.The fact that she decides to do all of this on my 12th birthday has pushed me over the edge.
 
             Yours sincerely jack.


And btw 1. I canâ€™t see my dad or have any contact with him other than texts or phone calls and honesty he is just as bad as my mum.2.we are really poor so we canâ€™t just move out.3.she has done stuff like this before
