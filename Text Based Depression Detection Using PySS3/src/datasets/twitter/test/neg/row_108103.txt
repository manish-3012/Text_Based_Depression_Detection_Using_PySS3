I thought i could do itSo it was afterschool, everyone had left and i told myself today was the day! I took of my blazer, my scarf and backpack and was about to step over the railing of my school stair case. But one of my teachers came walking by so i thought I'd wait until they're gone. But they decided to interact with me and looked into my eyes, she took a second but her eys full with worry asked if i was gonna jump. I couldn't get any words out. Shock at the fact she asked me. She's one of the good teachers at my school so i didn't want to lie. She just told me she hopes to see me tomorrow at school. I feel guilt ridden. And i have her first thing tomorrow morning, first period. 
I don't know whether to be disappointed that i couldn't do it or grateful.  But one thing i know is , i dont think i can look her in the eye's again after that.
