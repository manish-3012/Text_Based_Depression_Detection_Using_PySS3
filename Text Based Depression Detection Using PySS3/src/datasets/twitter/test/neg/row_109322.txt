I never thought I'd come here.Hello everyone. I don't think this is any kind of emergency, so if you have time to help other people in this subreddit, please do that first. I don't know why I'm submitting anything here. I'm not even sure what I'm looking for.

 I can see the beauty of the world around us, and how breathtaking the entire universe is. I just don't see the point. We're just placed into schools to 'learn' bucket loads of information, a lot of which we won't need, to progress to higher education to get a useless degree and get a job we hate to get valueless currency and buy shit we don't need and things to increase our race to the grave. (excuse the pseudo fight club reference.) They may not be the greatest words to get my point across, but that is the general idea.

It feels as if I'm playing some big elaborate game with no rules and far too many variables. As if I'm just stringing along the inevitable. Of course, I want to reduce human suffering as a general principle, but again, what is the point? I just don't see what could possibly matter in the grand scheme of things. I don't think I am afraid of death, and (again excuse the reference), I think I would greet death like an old friend. 

Thank you for reading, and I hope you can understand that sometimes other people can say what I want to say a lot better than I could have ever said it.
