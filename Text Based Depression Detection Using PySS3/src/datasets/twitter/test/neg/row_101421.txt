Im just so tired Well this is it I guess. I can't do this anymore. Im to fucked up, depressed, and lonely. No one really bothers to know how i feel. Where ever i end up i feel like an outcast. No friends. No hobbies, no nothing. Just work, games, sleep. A hell of a life. Im just an empty shell anyway. No use in complaining. Happiness wasn't ment for someone like me.

Â  Im just to fucked up. I had a shitty life andni want out. I can't deal with it anymore. I have no one. This crippling loneliness brings such a heavy weight...and I'm ready to be free. This is my life and This is my choice. It's not selfish, being selfish is telling me what to do with my life. If i wanna give up my life. Then i should damn well be allowed.

 I always get ignored. Over shadowed, or dismissed. I could be talking in a group. A few sentences in and people just start talking over me. Im not important. Everyone has a place in life. And mine was to make others feel better about themselves. But hey I was good at something for once...im tired of ranting...i dont have the energy for it anymore. I don't wanna rant. I just want it to be over.
