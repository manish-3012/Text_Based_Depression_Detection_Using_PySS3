Just a few questions and maybe some venting.I've been depressed my whole life. As a child, teen and now a young adult. I've tried a I'm numerous occasions to medicate, attend therapies, and nothing has seemed to help. I suppose my question is this: is there hope? I'm not particularly prone to suicidal ideation, but I don't want to exist. I've this urge for nonexistence...but not because I want to die. I just don't want to exist as I do, and as far as I've experienced, my existence is one based on a foundation of depression and apathy. I'm 28. As far back as I can recall, I've been this way.

Yo. Any tips and tricks for NOT killing yourself? Any tips and tricks for drafting apathy? Finding motivation? 

Anyways, thanks for your time. I appreciate it.
