I Feel Energized, My Plan is in Place!After 33 years on this planet, it's getting to be time for me to leave.

My plan is to sell my possessions and use that money to survive until they are all gone. I will keep enough for a tank of gas in my car and a prostitute so that I can have sex once before I go, and give the rest to my parents. It won't be enough to repay them for all I've taken from them, but it will at least be something.

I feel better than I have in ages with this plan in mind!

If you wish to know: I wasted the last 14 years of my life believing to the core of my being that someone truly loved me and always had my back. They are gone now. I was discarded. 

I've tried for 9 months now, but I can't move on. I've lost my job and I can't move properly anymore because of a medical issue. I've one friend to my name, but they are more of "shoot the shit" friend, nothing deep. I won't be missed, not for long, and less of a burden to everyone. Oh ya, of course I live in my parents basement, cuz why the fuck wouldn't I, am'Iright? (Of COURSE, the virgin lives with his parents at 33, I'm such a stereotype loser haha!)

Feels nice to get this off my chest, even if it's to people I don't know. Thanks for this forum!
