each day is another wasted day.I can't seem to work. I just want to sleep and never wake up. I hate what my mind is doing to me and the people around me. I don't feel bad about taking this step but what I will be doing to the  others in my life. I have so many people depending on me and it is killing me. I just want to escape all this pressure. Please just give me some peace. I sitting here at work where I'm just surfing the net because I can't build up the will to actually get anything done. I'm letting everybody down. I can't do this anymore. The only option that I can see is the final option. I think I'm going to take a drive to the bridge this weekend.
