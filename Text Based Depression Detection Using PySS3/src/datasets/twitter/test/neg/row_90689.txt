Can't seem to jump over the edge...Props to anyone that actually reads all of this.


I have been suicidal for about 6 months now, and I've "tried" just about every method in the book. I say "tried" with quotes because I just can't seem to finish the job.


I find myself pouring countless hours into suicide research. I pick a method and I find ways to not only effectively execute the method, but I also find ways to add my own personal touch. For instance, I am now sitting on my bed and I have cuts all around my neck because I tried to hang myself with a choke collar. Like always, I left myself a way out "just in case," and I took it like the coward that I am after hanging there for what seemed like ages.


I don't know why I'm here, and I don't know why I'm posting this. I don't really know a lot I guess, which is why I constantly find myself trying to end my life. I'm extremely confused about the situation I'm in, and I just can't seem to take the stress and the pressure. My life has been turned upside-down over the past few months and I just simply don't want to go further.


I guess I'm just scared of dying. I'm scared that I'll end up in hell, or somehow worse than what I have now. Anyone posting that things will "go black" or that there is no afterlife can save their time. I have had past involvement in the occult and know first-hand that angels / demons / heaven / hell exist beyond the shadow of a doubt as I have dealt with the first two personally... which logically concludes that the second two exist.


I don't know why I posted this, and I really don't know what I want to hear from you guys. I guess I'm just disappointed. I was absolutely SURE that I was ready to go this time. I'm always so sure, but the thought of finally facing what comes next scares me. I've tried everything from the helium hood method to overdosing to hanging to sitting in the garage with the car on, but it always seems to end the same way. I take the bag off of my head, or claw it apart. I run to the bathroom and force myself to throw up pills. I purposefully leave an object that I can use to stand up "just in case." I turn off the car and stumble into the house light-headed.


I really just. Want. To. Go. but I don't have the guts to finally finish myself.


I currently attend a VERY strict Christian college as I thought that it would help me get my life back on track, but it hasn't. As a matter of fact, it has pushed me the opposite direction. I've stayed out of trouble, so I've been promoted to a prominent position here among students. That position being "prayer leader" - I know, it's hokey sounding, but they take it very seriously here. I can't go for help now or they'll more than likely kick me out of the college which I can't afford at this point. If they don't kick me out, I will, at least lose my position as PL and they will move me to another dorm room which would move me away from one of the few people in life that care about me. (And yes, the rules state that if anyone loses the PL position he has to move rooms so that he's no longer a part of his prayer group. Don't ask, it's crazy around here.)


I. Just. Want. To. Die. ...Or do I? I at least know that I definitely don't want to live anymore, and I wish with all of my heart that I could believe what most of you do - that everything just "goes black." - It would be so much easier that way...
