I scratch myself to prevent myself from breaking down.Whenever my mother yells at me, I get suicidal because of the things sheâ€™s saying. Then i have a anxiety attack (maybe, i donâ€™t really know what it is) and i just want to go away and cry and scream. But i canâ€™t so i scratch my arm and the pain distracts me and i can actually breathe normally. I dont know what other thing i can do except scratching to distract me.
