Just another post.I've been tired for a long time. Tired of going to work every day, and just existing. But it makes me feel guilty, because I'm actually quite lucky. I have friends, a job, a place to live. I get to eat proper meal regularly, and get on well with my parents. I have no reason whatsoever to feel the way I do, no reason to want to kill myself. And yet every moment I'm alone, when I don't need to put on a smile, or joke around, or concentrate on something, I just can't help it.

I offer nothing to the world, or the people around me, nothing that isn't already being done by someone in a more efficiant, or proficiant way. I know where I stand on the list of people that my friends would want to spend time with, I know how low it is. So I quite commonly spend my free time just doing pointless things. Today I sweapt, hoovered, mopped, and cleaned the kitchen, other than that I just sat here, letting youtube videos play, or ideally playing something. There's not a single thing I do that betters the enviroment around me, and there isn't a single thing that would be negativley effected in the long term if I just wasn't around.

I keep coming up with excuses for why I shouldn't do it. Maybe one day I realise that my housemate would have to shoulder the rent by themselves, or another I think that the D&amp;D campaign I'm part of would be spoiled if I killed myself. I can't do it this year, because this year has been so terrible for everyone that it would be selfish to add another awful thing into the mix. Next year two of my friends are getting married after having to push back their weddings from this year, and I don't want me not being there hanging over them. 

They're all stupid excuses, but I don't know. It's getting harder, and harder to care about those excuses. The list of people who would be negativley impacted by my death is getting smaller, and smaller by the day, and everyone has someone they could go to for comfort, so I don't know if it would be that bad.

There's no one I can talk to. My best friend has too much going on right now, their Dad is really ill, and they're going through a lot of personal struggles. My other best friend is struggling with a lot of stuff, and their partner is relying on them for help with their own problems. My other friends are finacially troubled, or struggling with work too much for me to throw my problems at them, and one of my older friends lives abroad, working hard in a taxxing enviroment. It's unfair for me to drop everything onto them, especially when there's not really anything they could do to help.

I don't know what I want from this post.
