worriedSorry for the wall of text. I've struggled with depression since I was in fourth grade, but only realized about mid-way through high school. It comes in waves and after a really dark first half of senior year, I thought I started to care about myself again. I entered in a relationship with a girl I really love and we are still together despite a pretty significant physical distance. Since coming to college I've just hit a fucking wall and have just stopped doing anything I care about and the suicidal thoughts I had last year are coming back super hard. It just seems so easy and I'm so scared. I really just want to feel normal again. My girlfriend knows I'm depressed and she's really understanding cause she has had similar struggles, but I don't want to tell her about the suicidal because she is having a really hard time at her college is and I can't bring myself to put that burden on her. I don't know what the hell I'm doing anymore. I just feel so utterly alone despite having made a lot of great friends since being here.  Sorry for the non-sense
