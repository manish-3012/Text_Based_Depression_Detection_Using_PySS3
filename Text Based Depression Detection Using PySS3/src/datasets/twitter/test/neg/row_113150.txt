I have chosen the treeI always thought I would kill myself by slitting my wrists but I have decided I would much rather go by hanging. There is this really nice tree in the backyard. I saw it today and thought "when it's time, this will be the tree". When I look at this tree and what I would like to do, all the pain in the world slips away. Just me and the end. I truly wonder how long one can endure this level of suffering. 

There is a poem by D.H. Lawrence. It is my favorite psychological sword in the war of words: 

"I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself. A small bird will drop frozen dead from a bough without ever having felt sorry for itself." 

Drop dead from a bough. That's the way I would like to go.
