I fear people and wish to never wake up.Over the last month or so, suicide has felt like a viable goal. I've lost touch with myself, and my dreams are simply fantasy in a world gripped by so much avarice. I'm finishing off an engineering degree and have daily panic attacks that whatever I do with my life will make the world worse. This wouldn't be an issue if I felt like talking to people did any good anymore. Everyone around me seems exclusively interested in talking about their new toys, their vice, or some new pop culture bullshit. I can't even talk to my own family without getting nervous, especially my parents who can't seem to understand mental instability. Worse still I have no money, I'm stuck working a research job for free that I have little interest in, and my car got towed last week. I never do anything for myself, I just sprint at full speed trying to satisfy those around me. What in the fuck is the point of living if you have no hope for the future, and life seems to be extremely shallow and painful? If people care about me so much, why do they seem to enjoy the fact I'm suffering, and never tall to me unless I contact them? Every night I wish for the same dream, to simply be nothing, to deal with no one, to experience the fuzzy oblivion of what is left of my memory, personality, and ability to love. Give me one good reason to live other than keeping those around me from having a short time of trauma.
