So, thinking of killing myself this weekendIf you're going to tell me to keep going, I'd prefer if you can provide me with a tangible plan moving forward. All the info is in my post history. Otherwise, I'm thinking my my time is this weekend. I've had enough of these shenanigans. I'm ready to see my dad again. The only one who truly wanted to see me succeed. Now, I'm sure he'd be happy I'll be out of pain
