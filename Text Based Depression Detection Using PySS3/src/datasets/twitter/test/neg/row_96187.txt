Wednesdays are my shit daysIt's Wednesday today, just fucking great. Just like every other Wednesday for the past 4 weeks now, it turned out shit in the end. I was getting so damn hopeful that I wouldn't be crying myself off to sleep tonight, so damn hopeful that the knife would stay in the drawer this time. No. First Wednesday I pissed off a really good friend of mine. Second Wednesday it happened again. Third Wednesday my parents find that they need to make a point of how they feel I'm being a waste of life. Now, I couldn't even help someone I really cared about. The best I could do was just leave them alone. I thought everything was getting better, I actually managed to be proud of myself for something today. But fuck it, Wednesday night just had to goddamn reset it all. I don't want to leave the house tomorrow, I just want to lay here and breathe, thinking about all the times I've fucked up. All the times where the universe clearly told me I wasn't deserving of love. All the fucking, stupid Wednesdays. I'll most likely see the person tomorrow and they won't be feeling any better, I know they won't talk to me and I'll just feel so fucking useless like always.
