Feeling like I couldI have always had that feeling like, I could throw it all away. Like it would make myself free for the first time. Most of the time I force emotions. When I was younger my dad was abusive and mean, I couldn't stand him, and my mom never divorced him. I grew up being ridiculed by him and learned to suppress my emotions because I couldn't stand it anymore. I recently heard he hit my 11 year old sister. I heard this while at a party at 10pm. I freaked the fuck out got angry then started balling my eyes out, despite being in public knowing that I couldn't help her at that point. My buddies took me home and I passed out and my mom said that they were getting a divorce. But that feeling of not being able to help hurt me, and now I get bad ideas even worse than before. The only thing that is stopping me is knowing what it would do to my little sister. My social life is now fucked, and so is most of my family life. I just need some reassurance as I only want to end it all.
