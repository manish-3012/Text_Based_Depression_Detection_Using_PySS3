I am really done this timeI am 26 years old male 
Currently typing this out from Austin International Airport 
I am really done with my life. My best friend just broke up with me over a silly stupid issue. And I donâ€™t really have anyone else I can reach out to. She was my whole world. I am still in a shock and I really donâ€™t wanna live anymore.
