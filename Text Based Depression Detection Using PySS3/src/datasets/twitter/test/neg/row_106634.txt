I need anyone to talk to.I was taken advantage of a few weeks ago and it's getting harder and harder for me to fall asleep each night. Its 2 am now. How do I protect myself? I can't stop thinking about how many sick, horrible people are out there in this world. I don't want to live here if it means constantly expecting the worst from everyone around me, that's exhausting. But when I trust people, I keep getting hurt. I believe in kindness and empathy, and am constantly let down by selfish, violent people. I have never felt this alone.
