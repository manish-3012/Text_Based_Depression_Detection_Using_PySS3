For anyone that wants someone to talk toI understand that a lot of people are struggling with their mental health due to quarantine. If you need or want someone to talk to during this time please send me a message, I'm more than willing to talk to you or allow you to vent to me. Due to where I live (NZ) and the fact that I stay up pretty late I might be here even if not many people are around you are awake. I just want to try and help, as many people have helped me from this community in the past.
