Sick of my isolated, lonely lifeI'm 19, turning 20 this December. My life is a struggle every day. A struggle with boredom, isolation and loneliness. Ever since graduating school 18 months ago i've essentially been isolated. For most of that time until recently I didn't have a car, so maintaining friendships with people from school was difficult. When I finally did get a car, it was too late, most people had moved on and forgotten about me. Those that hadn't (one small group of friends) had become so engrossed in video games and anime they never wanted to go out anywhere anyway, and I didn't want to go down their path of being unemployed losers who sit at home all day and play games, as I just don't find games fun as much as I used to (used to be a big time addict). I have never been to a bar or club in my life, nor do I ever go out with anybody. I always stay at home because, well, where else is there to go. Nothing is fun when you're all alone. The last time I did anything social was months ago. I just sit at home all day every day and browse the internet, because there's fuck all else to do. I regularly get headaches from boredom, as I have so much spare time but nothing fun to do with it.

I go to university (or college, whatever you want to call it), but it's a 1.5 hour train ride away, so for obvious reasons I havn't really made friends there. I've been off uni for nearly 3 months now (summer holidays in Australia) and the boredom and isolation is killing me. There's nothing to do where I live, I don't know anybody around here anyway. I sometimes go to Sydney to just walk around for something but that gets boring fast. I have a job, but it's only part time, 3 shifts of 4 hours every week, and most of the people there are older so I can't really connect with them. As far as i'm aware there's no clubs or societies in my area that aren't for old people. 

I've told myself that if my life hasn't improved by the time i'm 21, i'm going to kill myself. I've actually become slightly happier since deciding that, happier because I know i've only got at most 2 years left of living this isolating, boredom-inducing life. I thought life after school was supposed to be fun and exciting, clearly I was wrong.
