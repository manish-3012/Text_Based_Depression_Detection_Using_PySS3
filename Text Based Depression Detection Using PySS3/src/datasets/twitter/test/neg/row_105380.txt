I want to kill myself because of schoolTitle says it all. I try, so fucking hard. To the point of taking adderall and doing whatever it takes to do something right for once. But I can't. I can study a whole week with adderalls coffee and everything anyone could possibly think of, only to get a 73 while the girl who sits beside me gets a 98 with a few hours of studying the night before. Lately, I feel worthless, judged, unwanted, and letting everyone around me down. My parents scream at me and even physically hit me for not "trying" hard enough, not knowing I'm vomiting blood due to cognitive enhancing drugs, and trying my hardest to understand my work. This is not fair. I want to die. There's still grade 12, and then college, and I don't think I can live through it... This eduction system is hideous, but I'm stuck in it. I don't want to be stuck in it. I want to die.
