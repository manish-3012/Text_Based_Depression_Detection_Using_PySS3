I can feel the depression coming on and might need some help to get through itHello all,

I'm not usually a depressed person (usually very happy), however, I find that when school starts and I'm under stress, even if it just little things, I become really depressed to the point where I am cutting myself and scouting places to jump if things get too bad. For a year, I have had a lighter course-load (15 credits) than my first semester which was when I first became deeply troubled and started to feel trapped, scared, and angry. This upcoming semester, I'm taking more classes than ever, and many of them are rigorous courses then I've ever had before. As the beginning nears, I have begun to have bouts of extreme stress overcome me and am fearful that I may become extremely depressed again. If there is anybody who would be willing to give me some help to avoid some of this depression I would greatly appreciate it.

Other details: 20/m sophomore 4.0 GPA on scholarship which adds to stress. Forever alone. No friends at all. 

Thanks for any help.
