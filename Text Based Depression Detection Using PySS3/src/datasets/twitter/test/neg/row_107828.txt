I miss my mom so much...I lost my mom to cancer last summer and I miss her so much, I think about her all the time, everyday. She was my everything, all I had in this world and she was taken from me and now im left with nothing and noone. I want to see her, kiss her and hug her so much it makes me cry all the time. I want to go in Heaven to see her. I want to kill myself. I have nothing, no education and no job. I cant live like this and knowing Ill have to live like this for next 50, 60 years makes me want to kill myself even more. For my dad im nothing, he wouldnt even shed a tear after I'm gone. I want to go to Heaven to see my mom, its the only thing I want, can I see her if I kill myself? I did everything right in life and I know I can go to Heaven. My biggest fear is Ill never see my mom if I kill myself.. I never sinned, can I go to Heaven if I kill myself?
