I still want to die everyday except for one person that stops mei just dont want to live anymore

&amp;#x200B;

its been years and years and I just wish life would get better 

&amp;#x200B;

i wish for once something good would happen to me

&amp;#x200B;

i wish i had someone who understood me

&amp;#x200B;

i wish i wasnt so alone in this world

&amp;#x200B;

.

&amp;#x200B;

every night i feel how pathetic i am

&amp;#x200B;

i just want to give up and cry

&amp;#x200B;

forget my life. go do what i want . even if only for a few days

&amp;#x200B;

then blissfully pass away after ive said all that was needed to my only friend

&amp;#x200B;

oh, why is life so cruel. i miss him. i miss him so f king much. its becoming so much harder to cope in everyday life without him. why do i need him and rely on him for my happiness? im such a failure

&amp;#x200B;

everything is all a farce. these thoughts always somehow find their way back into me no matter how hard i try to 'be happy'

&amp;#x200B;

i truly wonder how some people can find such genuine happiness. im a disappointment with no reason to continue trying to survive in this world.
