If I had a gun Iâ€™d have shot my self by nowI donâ€™t know why but itâ€™s the most attractive option for me. Itâ€™s instant. Itâ€™s super unlikely Iâ€™d survive. It takes less thought and preparation than hanging myself or cutting my wrists (and I donâ€™t want to make a mistake and live with scars on my wrists). I wonâ€™t feel fear or pain. 

Too bad Iâ€™m not American.
