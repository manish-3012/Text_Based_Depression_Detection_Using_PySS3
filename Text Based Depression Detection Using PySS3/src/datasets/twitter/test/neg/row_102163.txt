18 years old, and going to commit suicide.  Hello Reddit, I've decided i'm pretty much set on suicide as of today. I've always thought about leaving this world, but only really gotten close to doing it once a long time ago. I have struggled with depression for almost a decade now, and it gets worse and worse each year. I have come to the tip of the ice berg when it comes to my feelings, and emotions, as of today, I can't stand to deal with this constant pain I feel. 
   



 A little back story to where this spiral of emotion started, I work at a store where I met someone who absolutely changed my life. I know it sounds weird but she is about 27 years older than me. Ironically I've known her since I was a kid back in elementary school. She was a friend of my mom's, they met basically waiting out in the halls for the kids to be released. I really became close to this women, she is totally broken, and emotionally spent, but she has helped me through a lot. 
  



  Her ex husband never came back from the service right after his last deployment, he had severe PTSD, and was very mean towards her, and the kids. He left the family, the bills, the house, all to her to take care of while he moved away. I felt terrible when she told me this the first time, and it really made me sad, just a fucked up situation. I have been there for her for a long time where others that should be haven't. I have literally helped her through every problem that she crosses, she is broken. 
    



I fell in love with her, we spent so much time together talking, being with each other, and having fun. Long story short I told her that I loved her like that, and of course I didn't get the reaction I wanted. After all of this everything has gone down hill, it was already killing me everyday when she didn't know that I liked her like that, but now it's worse. We have grown distant with each other, and it sucks. We slowly went from hanging out with the group from work every weekend, to maybe one night a week. We don't talk to each-other much like we used to anymore, and it's all my fault.
  



  I've also been dealing with some close friends who prior to meeting this lady sparked the depression from it's slumber. I literally had about a good year where I was great, and there wasn't a cloud over me, but something happened with former friends, and it just all came flooding back. And after everything was settled I still lived with the clouds, and bad thoughts, and it only got worse with the isolation of my feelings I put myself through when dealing with this lady.  
   



 I've finally come to the realization that this whole time, I feel like I've just been used by her, I won't go into anymore unless asked, but I really am depressed, and want to leave. This has been building up for the past year or so, and I'm at breaking point. So here I sit, drinking a beer I stole from my parents, and staring at a box of pizza I can't force myself to eat. This all probably doesn't make sense, and I'm sorry, but there's a whole story behind it all, and it really belongs in a short book or something to make sense. I am reluctant to post much of it. But I am going to take my life sometime tonight, and I just wanted to be here on Reddit with you guys, for my last day on earth.
