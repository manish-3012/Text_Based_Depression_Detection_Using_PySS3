Suicide attempt and afterwards, my storyI wont bore you with the details of why. But I tried to kill myself a bit less than a month ago. My friends stopped me and convinced me to go to the hospital, it was easy as going to the ED and saying that I'm suicidal, I got taken in, put in a room and someone from mental health came in and we talked for a little bit. My dad showed up and i then did a runner, drove home, got my vodka, painkillers, assorted drugs and a knife, then drove up a mountain, mostly the same details of my first attempt for the night before, I'm sure you can put my plan together from that. All i could think about was one of my friends that stopped me the night before, she was wonderful and supportive and kind and seemed genuinely interested in my continued living. And would be hurt if I died, I couldn't do that to her so I drove back to the hospital and stayed there, they didnt let my parents see me so I was calmer, I was then taken to a unit for youth at another hospital, basically a camp tbh, had activities, rooms, beds, 3 meals a day, school for those who did it etc, throughout my time there I built a relationship with a couple of the nurses and talked to them about everything, it happened as one of the nurses described to me. They held up hope for me, until I could do it myself, took most of my stay (stayed there for 6 days) but by the end I was willing to try and give life another go. The next day, the girl that I was thinking about during my runner from the first hospital needed some help emotionally so I drove over there and spent 6 hours holding her hand and talking, by the end, we were both stable, we did it a few more nights that week and by the Sunday, she was my girlfriend, we've spent a lot of time together and I'm honestly convinced she is the "one," I never believed in that before, and she is my first girlfriend so I might be a little overwhelmed and not thinking straight, but I'm patient, I'm gonna wait and see. Hopefully, we are happy together for months to come, maybe years to come, and if I'm lucky, the rest of my life, she is so kind and we love the same stuff and she is just perfect. I want to live because a world where I get to spend the weekend with her, my afternoons and evenings with her, that world is worth the suffering and pain
