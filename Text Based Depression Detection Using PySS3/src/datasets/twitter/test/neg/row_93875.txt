I'm scared and I feel so aloneI'm starting my 2nd year of college today and I still have no idea what I want to do. All my friends as well as my now ex are breaking ties and it hurts. I get that people do their own things, I just feel so heartbroken, lost, and alone. I don't have my shit figured out and I feel like I'm just wasting time. I feel like such a burden on my family. I want to end it all but I know that my mother and brothers couldn't take that. I wish I could just cease to be without hurting anyone.
