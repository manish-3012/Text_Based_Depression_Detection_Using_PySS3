i have nothing leftIm unemployed, depressed and I have no friends here. And i miss my sister so much. The side-effects from the anti depressants are killing me, i can hardly sleep and food doesn't taste anything. And now my girlfriend baled on me, the only person that makes me happy. Suddenly she just doesn't care anymore.

People are just so fucking selfish. I wish i was more selfish, but somehow i manage to prioritize others before myself. Yet everyone just leaves me all the fucking time.

Im trying to convince myself that things are gonna get better but i just can't see the light. It's so dark everywhere. Everything feels hopeless and i feel pathetic. I haven't cried like this in years...
