My life is over**Monday.** I walked onto the campus of my 53k/yr boarding school. I was a senior. I had alcohol and weed in my backpack. I was one of the first to return to school from Christmas break, along with one of my good friends, Kate. Nothing romantic, we were really just friends and appreciated how platonic things were. We got drunk. She got too drunk. She threw up in the bathroom of the student center and was sent to the infirmary. They smelled alcohol on her and she was trashed. She was expelled and left the next day. I did not say goodbye. 

**October, 2013.** I was going to school at my 25k/yr private day school in my hometown. I got really drunk before a school dance. I was allowed to finish the year but was then asked to leave. I thought I would make no friends at boarding school, but I was wrong. I loved the people I met there, including my current girlfriend, Erica.

**Tuesday.** The administration at school brings me in to question me about the events on Monday. I denied everything. I said I didn't know about Kate's drunkenness or where she got the alcohol. I cleared my room of everything incriminating.

**Wednesday.** More questioning. They search my room. I thought there was nothing there. They open my desk and find some tiny specks of weed. Seriously, such a small amount that I would not even be charged with a crime for it by the police in that state. If I handed you a baggie with the amount they found in it, you would think the bag was empty. However, zero tolerance prevails, and my parents were called to come pick me up. Expelled. Fuck. 

People came to say goodbye. You make some of the best friends in the world when you live with them day in and day out. I hugged Nathan, Aiken, Hwong, Gus, Andrew, Chloe, Connor, Lauren, Chase, Michaela, Alex, and Brandon. I played my and Brandon's song. I sobbed my eyes out. I kissed Erica for what may be the last time. 

**Now.** I have ambition. I want to work hard and be successful. I come from a well off family. I cannot imagine disappointing them, but right now it looks like I may not even be able to go to college. I don't know what to do. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I feel like total shit all the time. I can't live like this. Help. I haven't made any plans for suicide but it's constantly on my mind. I would rather die than have to bear the rest of my life. Nothing is going how I thought it would, everything is in shambles. Fuck. Help me
