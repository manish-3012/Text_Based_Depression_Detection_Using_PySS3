Barely 15 and already have nothing.Hey there. Second post here. I'm just not ok. I don't have a future. If I don't kill myself now, then I'll definitely be dead by 20. I don't have anything to live for. Everyone I've ever known is 2000 miles away. All my pet fish are gone because my family didn't want them anymore. Even if I do magically survive until 16, what next? I'm failing my classes, so its not like I can get a job anywhere over minimum wage. I cry myself to sleep most nights, and I've picked up cutting again. Not to mention my parents would disown me if I ever told them I was trans. The fact is I have nothing to live for anymore. I just wanna hop the fence, and go somewhere no one will find me. My friend is thinking about suicide too, so maybe I won't be alone. I've tried to stop them. I hope they don't go through with it. I hope he understands. What a more poetic way than going out on my cakeday.
