I don't know what to do anymoreI feel like I've already failed at life before it's even began, I've been 18 for a few months and I still can't drive, still never had a job, and still fail everything at school. I can't build myself up anymore. I used to be stronger than this, and I had some level of ambition, but now I just live in my own filth (my parents basement, who woulda fucking guessed?) And every day just feels the same as the next. Before this, I have had one actual plan to commit suicide during my freshman year, and it really wasn't well thought out because it just came down to "a fistful of pills" but at least then I came to my senses, but now I wish I hadn't. Me and my parents just argue, and nothing important is said. I hate that people care about me, I have friends and even a boyfriend, but I know all I'll do is let them down, and waste the time they've given me. I know I'm not special either, so I rarely talk about things like this, and I feel worse because tons of other people deal with things like this everyday and I'm not at that level. I don't know how to fix anything, and I'm just rotting here. So far I don't have reliable means of suicide, but self harm works for now I guess
