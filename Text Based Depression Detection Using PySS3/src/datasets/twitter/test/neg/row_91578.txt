Make the thoughts stopSo I'm still in love with my ex-gf. The reason we broke up is she said something about an ex that made me super insecure. So I feel horrible it ended and I'm wracked with guilt. And I can still hear her voice, feel her touch, smell her scent, see her smile. But those feelings will fade. What's scary is it's two months later and I'm still picturing her and her ex vividly in my mind, and I can't get it out. It's literally always on my mind. Its not fading at all.  Am I really going to have to die just to escape that image?
