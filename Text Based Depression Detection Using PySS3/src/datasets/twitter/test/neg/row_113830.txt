Orange the worldHappy orange the world day everyone,

Orange the world is about domestic violence against women.

It means a lot to me as I am a domestic violence survivor (everything at home is good rn, I have a step dad rn.)

If you or anyone you know experience domestic violence call local authorities immediately and ask friends, people that you can trust good, etc for help and advice.

Have a good day everyone!
