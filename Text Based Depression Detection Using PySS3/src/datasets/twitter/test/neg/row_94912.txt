I don't want to die, but I don't see the point in livingI don't want to go into detail, but the love of my life left me after 3 years. I thought we could work it out, but that seems unlikely now. We've stopped talking and she's shut me out completely. 

I can't focus anymore. I can't deal with it as soon as I get home.

I used to think life was about love. Finding someone special. Now that I had that, the real thing, and it's gone...what's the point?

I'm not sure if I want to kill myself yet, but I do want to die.
