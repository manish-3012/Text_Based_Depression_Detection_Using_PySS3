TrappedIn January I tried to kill myself by overdosing, but I freaked. I told my Mum what I did and she took me to hospital and they said I hadn't done enough to cause any real damage, but then I was put into a program where I had to see all these different psychologists and I hate it! I've been on anti-depressants for a few months but they're not working. I've had depression for almost ten years now and I've been self-harming for about 6. I'm not allowed near medicine even when I need it and I can't leave the house for more than half an hour without my mum freaking out. I just need space, but she won't listen to me! All I want to do is hurt myself until it doesn't hurt anymore. What do I do?
