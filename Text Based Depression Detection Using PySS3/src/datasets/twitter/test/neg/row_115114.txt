Perhaps the Sun will ease the passageI've always felt trapped in my homes, each of them. Safety and comfort reside there, yes, but desolation and the static hum of stillness do also. It's a bleak feeling, walking into the same room, with the same emotions, time and time again, subservient to the oppression of despair. But the sun, and the creation it nourishes replenishes my well-being. My vitality is restored by the peace of nature, and my spirit relaxes in its repose. The organic chemistry that connects me to it, is the elixir of life, it seems, but it's a tonic I drink of far too infrequently, and the artificial repetitions of modern living mute my aspirations for continuing on.

The thought of slipping away, entombed in the same sarcophagus that's enclosed my hopes of a different way of existing, is a cold and putrid thought. The same error that would spill from my veins would only add to the disappointing artifacts of life stored in that tomb. Blank walls and empty shadows would be the same impartial spectators they've always been. Warm blood would meet cold surfaces, and the dissonance would be palpable.

But the sun.. its reassuring rays of light, and the radiation of its passion.. oh, I weep for its beauty. I long for its home, within my heart. To have that source of vibrant vigor settled deep in my soul, to abide in and exude. How terrifying it'd be to die apart from love, away from the communion of love. With its graceful and stoic repose, I love sweet nature dearly. I think surrounded by its beauty, embraced by its supple shape, affected by its penetrating purpose, and graced by the sun's glory, I could venture through that passage that's long called my name.
