When you feel criticalDo you ever read the posts on this sub and think 'well you're lucky, try having my life buddy!".   I can't be the only one!   I have to stop myself from writing comments which negate the OP's point.   I know everything is subjective.  I know that these people are hurting but it kinda feels like my pain is somehow 'more'.   I'm guessing that's natural...everyone wants to let people know about the pain they're in.   It just feels wrong, somehow.
