I just want to die, everything's falling apartI'm in high school and I feel very lost. It feels like all my dreams and the future I planned are crumbling around me. 

I live in an abusive home, I couldn't wait to move out and go to college. I love foreign countries and foreign languages. I wanted to be an esl teacher or learn a language to the point that I could teach it as a job. 

I had a plan: Find a college with a dorm, and I would be set. Money isn't the problem in my eyes. I have savings from my biological grandmother and I have really good grades and can apply for student loans and scholarships. I'm even prepared to pay off a loan if I have, too, I live frugally already. 

But then my mother asked me about college, and strongly inserted her opinion. She wants me to go to a community College (it doesn't have any dorms). She wants me to stay at home and drive to the college. She even stated her idea that I could stay in their dying small town and be a teacher (like I'd ever get a job like that here). She basically shitted on my dreams of traveling to South Korea, China, Spain... saying I was too weak and I wouldn't make it on my own without her help. 

She's always done this, she refuses to teach me real world stuff so I'm forced to use her help. For crying out loud, I'm 17 and I still don't have my learner's permit. 

It really broke me down, I'm scared out of my mind. I don't know if I should just tough it out for 4 more years after high school and stay, just to avoid the rent and utilities cost of living away. She has me questioning if I will even be able to get away. I feel trapped, like a bird in the cage. I'm terrified of what she'll do if I try to leave, she might cut me off and give me no support. 

So should I just try to go with my original plan and get a college with a dorm... or should i just tough it out for 5 more years? 

If I have to spend more years at home then I might as well just kill myself. I can't do it, I just can't do it. I built all my strength up telling myself it would just be until high school was over. I don't think I can make it any longer. If I do it feels like I lied to myself and I'm just going to be stuck here forever and stay in constant fear. 

I worked so hard for a whole year digging myself out of a hole. I wanted to kill myself then and it took everything I had to change my life around. I don't think I'm strong enough to do that again, I just want to leave. I just want to leave. Why is she like this? Why does like torturing me so much?
