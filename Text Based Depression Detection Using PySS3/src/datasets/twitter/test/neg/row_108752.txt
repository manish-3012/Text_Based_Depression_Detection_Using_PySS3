I give up, I'm ready to goI've suffered with social anxiety disorder my whole life, but I didn't even know what it was until a month ago. I've been put on medication, consistently seeing a therapist, but I give up.

I've lost all my friends, I lost the person that I love, I can't do anything to fix it, or explain to make things right.. and I don't want to anymore. I want to die then no one will have to deal with me or worry anymore.
