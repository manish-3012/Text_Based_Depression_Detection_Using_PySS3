Here goes nothing.Ok, as the title suggests, here goes nothing.

I'm a 20 year old university student who has already managed to fail first year, and not much hope for this semester nor the retake exams I'll have to do.

Ever since the morning of my 13th birthday, I've not really been able to feel proper happiness. When I say that, I mean that I just don't believe I have the cognitive ability to feel and mean emotions. It just feels like I'm the actor in a one man show and everyone else is the audience, and I have to keep the show going, forever waiting for the curtain to fall, so I can catch a break.

I won't go into too much detail, but I'm disabled, and as it is because of this that I feel like I am severely disadvantaged in relation to my course mates and that I will never be able to find a respected job in the desired field, even though I despise my course,.

TLDR; I'm failing university and I'll never get anywhere in life, so why not cut my own suffering and my family's future suffering short right now?
