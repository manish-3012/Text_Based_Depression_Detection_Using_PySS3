tiredeveryday is just filled with pain. sheâ€™s gone and never coming back. iâ€™ve always kept hope from the way she still acts with me but sheâ€™s not. was the only thing good in my life and iâ€™ve held onto nothing for 3 years now. iâ€™m too scared to end my life but itâ€™s all i want
iâ€™m going to be a letdown to my parents and i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll be able to handle it when the time comes. iâ€™d be nothing on this earth anyways. have no friends. have nothing
