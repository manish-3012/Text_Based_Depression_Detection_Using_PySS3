I just want to be happyAll I want is to be loved Iâ€™ve given up on real people because they expect you to grow up get a job and leave your childhood as a memory and get over it. but thatâ€™s not me I want to be with someone that wants to be young forever just like me every day weâ€™ll Live out our childhood memories and have a romance like no other Weâ€™ll only have each other and that will be enough weâ€™ll cry to each other laugh with each other weâ€™ll say â€œFUCK ADULTHOODâ€ together thatâ€™s all I want from a partner there is no one like that out there for me Iâ€™m just alone with no one to express myself to thatâ€™s why if I kill myself maybe Iâ€™ll get to be with the person I always dreamed about The person that will never judge me the person that will rebel against society with me THE PERSON THE WILL ALWAYS LOVE ME
