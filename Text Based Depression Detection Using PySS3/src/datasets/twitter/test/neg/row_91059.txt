Fear is the only thing holding me backI'm a coward. That's the only reason i'm alive and i'm wary of the day that i'm not scared anymore. it's getting closer and closer every day and honestly, i don't know if it's a good or a bad thing. Finally being able to end it all. Why is it taboo? Why is suicide regarded as a bad thing? Doesn't it set you free? Make it all stop? isn't that exacly what i want? Peace. Why shouldn't i kill myself? If i'm not afraid.
