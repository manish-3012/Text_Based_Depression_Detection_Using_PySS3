All that matters is how great your social skills areGraduated with an engineering degree with a great gpa? Who cares, gpa is meaningless. Have great work experience? No one bothers calling your references until they make the final offer. People would much rather work with a guy with a shitty gpa and poor work history but is the life of the party than an awkward, introverted, hard-working genius. Most work places sound more like happy hour than work places. 

Same with dating. Sure you may not be able to date online if you're short and fat but in real life your friends who love you can introduce you to cute girls who will adore you. 

Yes I know fat lazy guys who should be losers but because they're popular and have tons of friends, they have great jobs and cute girlfriends. He'll they may even live longer because loneliness is [more unhealthy](https://www.google.com/amp/www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2017/08/06/loneliness-deadlier-obesity-study-suggests/amp/).

I on the other hand bust my ass at the gym, school, networking, work experience, etc but it's a constant uphill battle because I set an awkward first impression or my blunt to the point nature puts people off. One example was discovering that a receptionist told her friend that i am very rude. I didnt know or thought i was rude im a get shit done type of guy. In todays world of sensitive, weak people it is a death sentence. 5 months of intense job searching and not one full-time offer. At this point I'm just looking for anything thst requires a bachelor's not necessarily engineering positions even though I have internship experience and a decent gpa. 

Also I have an easy time getting dates online and an ok time getting interviews but the meetings are where the struggles begin whereas most people struggle at getting dates/interviews but do well once they get them 

Even if I work hard at improving my social skills by the time I get to the level i want, it will be too late. I graduated college a bit late so by the time I get that 65k/year job most people my age will be making 90k/year die to accumulated experience. There s a stigma with age gap relationships and while a girl can be pretty in her mid-late 20s to early 30s, she will never be as good as she was when she was in her [early 20s](http://www.returnofkings.com/123977/5-things-i-hate-about-banging-women-over-30). Not to mention having to deal with being guy number 20 or knowing that she use to have likely more intimate sex with a popular guy I knew when she was in her prime. 

What's stopping me is upsetting my parents. My dad talked about a client of his who can barely function because his son commited suicide. I don't want that to happen to them, I love them too much and they did a lot for me. 

However thst isn't stopping me from giving mdma or extacy a try as it is used to get over social anxiety.
