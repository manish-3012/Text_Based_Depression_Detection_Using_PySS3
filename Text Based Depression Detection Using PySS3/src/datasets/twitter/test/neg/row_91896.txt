I'm hanging myself in half an hourAnd I have to say, I had a good life. My parents tried the best they could, even though there wasn't much they could do to maintain my sanity. I saw some shows, I met some interesting people, I hiked the tallest mountains in my state. Sadly, I'll never be able to do that again. I'm in debt to the point where I'm about to be sued and my only option is death. I've already lived my prime, and the only thing left for me is endless mental breakdowns to the point where I'll probably spend the rest of my days in an asylum. I knew it would come to this point. The only question was when, and now I think it's time for me to go. I'm sorry I couldn't be a better friend. I'm sorry I couldn't pay the rent and walked out of a job. I wanted to make a record before I went, but my brain is fucked to the point where that's no longer possible. Please forgive me. There was nothing else I could do.
