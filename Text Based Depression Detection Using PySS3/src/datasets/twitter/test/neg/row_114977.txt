A final farewellI'm done with depression and caring and falling in love and emotions and effort and failure and exhaustion and whatever else I can put here. I can't do this anymore. It is pretty apparent I am not meant to be here with any of you. I love every one of you more than anything else in life and I just can't deal with this anymore. So I hope you find strength and persistence where I have failed to do so. I hope you find the ability to support each other and show care and love where I failed to do so. I hope you overcome the most oppressing of obstacles where I failed to do so. Most importantly, I truly hope that you find happiness and contentment in life, where I failed to do so.

I'm sorry I have managed to fall in love with you and make things weird again. I can't help it and I hate myself for it more than anything. I wish I never got drunk and I wish I never messaged you. You seriously do mean the world to me and it's pretty apparent you feel nothing of the sort for me. But I do not for one second hold that against you - being honest, i feel disgust towards myself, so how would I expect it be possible for anyone to love me. I am sorry that I wasn't a good friend to you when I could have been so much better. I'm sorry. 

I wish I could leave a note to every single one of you personalized for you and expressing how much you impacted my life, but that takes a lot of energy. So I hope that you don't take it personally that I didn't message you Individually. I hope every single one of my friends realize that I love them and cherish them and wish he best for them. You all are amazing and are going to truly do amazing things. 

Farewell
