I want to hurt myselfI've been fighting with my depression a lot lately, and I'm to the point where I don't think about killing myself nearly as often. That would normally be good, but now my old suicidal thoughts have been replaced with thoughts of self-harm. Whenever I do anything that makes anyone else mad, or hurt's someone's feelings I dig my nails into my arm and tell myself that I'm just a piece of shit I am. I say that I deserve to be hurt, and I shouldn't be happy. 

The other day, I broke a razor trying to get the blades out, but it didn't work. Then I shaved with it. I had cuts and scrapes all over my legs, and I just kept telling myself I deserved it. 

I want to tell my husband about these thoughts, but I can't. He gets upset about my depression, because he doesn't understand it. He always tells me how glad he is that I don't cut because he had to deal with too many girls that did that. And now here I am, slowly destroying myself, because I can't stand to be happy.
