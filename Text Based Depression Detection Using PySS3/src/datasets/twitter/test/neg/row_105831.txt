I want to kill myselfI know what Iâ€™m feeling is fucked up but I just canâ€™t stop myself from having these thoughts. Iâ€™m a terrible husband and father. I know I canâ€™t do this to my family but I just keep on fucking up. My wife would be better off without me. I have insurance so itâ€™s not like I would be leaving them with nothing. I sat in the shower last night after a fight with my wife. I sat there with a blade in my hand crying because Iâ€™m a worthless piece of shit who deserves it. I know I canâ€™t do this. My family doesnâ€™t deserve that. Maybe I could just drive off a cliff and make it look like an accident so it would be so bad for them. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing this I fucking hate myself everything Iâ€™ve done to this woman I can give her the chance to be free I should have done this so long ago itâ€™s not your fault I love u I love all of you and Iâ€™m so sorry
