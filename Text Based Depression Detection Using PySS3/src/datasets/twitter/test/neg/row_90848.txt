I'm not afraid of death.A thought that popped up in my mind.

*I'm not afraid of death*

I'm only held back by the discomfort of killing myself. That would either be a bloody mess, or painful as hell. And what if I poisoned myself and then, while waiting to slowly fade away, I realise that death isn't for me yet?

I don't even care what the people around me would think. My mom would cry. My dad would have the disappointment he's always seen in me confirmed. She would just stand there, silently, like She always does. Would she cry?
