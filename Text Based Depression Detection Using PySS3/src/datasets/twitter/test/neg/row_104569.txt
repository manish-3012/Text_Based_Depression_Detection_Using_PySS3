deep freezehere i am again. unable to stop the thoughts . itâ€™s freezing outside tonight, much more so than usual and it seems like the perfect opportunity.

i know it hurts. it probably hurts like fuck to freeze to death, but i just donâ€™t care. no amount of physical pain can even touch what i feel inside. if i donâ€™t kill myself, then iâ€™m going to hurt myself. iâ€™m tired of feeling numb. 
when i smoke weed i feel ok. i feel like whatever problems i have i can control. it helps my physical pain. but this is the only time i feel in control. any other time and my stupid adhd brain runs amok with thoughts and thoughts and thoughts. thoughts i donâ€™t want to think, thoughts of bad things that have happened to me. 

iâ€™m tired of feeling like this. feeling pain and paralysing anxiety. feeling like a burden to those around me. iâ€™m constantly afraid ill get abandoned because iâ€™m like this, but thereâ€™s nothing i can do. i have a new amazing boyfriend who treats me so well and i canâ€™t help myself, let alone him or anybody else when they need it. the hope of seeing him (long distance) one day kept me alive, but i donâ€™t think thatâ€™s enough anymore.iâ€™m pathetic 
itâ€™ll all end the same. all people die, why should i give a fuck. iâ€™m in pain, and iâ€™m tired.
i didnâ€™t choose to be born. im 21 already, i think after 21 years of mental and physical anguish, abuse of every kind , i can say â€œfuck thisâ€. i just donâ€™t want to be here anymore.
