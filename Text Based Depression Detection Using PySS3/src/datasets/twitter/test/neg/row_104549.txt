I have less than 24h. What the fuck do I do. I am thinking of sliting my wrists somewhere in the city and just pass out. I can't do this anymore. Threats of puting me into some shitty job, threats of being homeless and thrown out. This is the second uni I am dropping out of. Constant yelling and terror. My heart pounding for years and years. I already have nothing left.

Dropped out of second uni. I don't want any job. I just want to live in peace alone and save myself. But my parents will never let this happen. They can't change, I don't want to change. I need to escape today. Maybe I die, maybe I don't. This is a point of no return.
