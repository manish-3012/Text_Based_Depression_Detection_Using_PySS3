High school dropout failed at life, ready to dieTried to jump off a bridge when I was 17 in my senior year of highschool, didn't do it got stopped and put into a psych ward for a week. When I got out somehow I convinced my mom to let me dropout of highschool and just sit on my ass all day doing nothing. Biggest mistake of my fucking life I was so close to graduating.. now I got lucky and got accepted to a community college that has a program where u get ur hs degree and an associates at the same time!! But guess what I failed out of that too. I wish I could restart my life my mom always tells me I have so much potential but I just threw it all away. Literally had a perfect life everything handed to me all I had to do was go to school and get decent grades but ofc I can't even do something so simple as that. Fuck it I'm done procrastinating and sleeping my life away. I'll visit my dad one last time (he's basically paralyzed and on a breathing tube) and tell him how much I love him and that he's an amazing father. Then I'll drop 4tabs of acid and at my peak jump off the bridge I should've jumped off in 2015. Hope I don't destroy my family too bad. Sorry guys I love you all
