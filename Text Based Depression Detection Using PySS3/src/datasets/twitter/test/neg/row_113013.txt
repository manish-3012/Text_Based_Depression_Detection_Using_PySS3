I done fucked upSo some context. 
I've been dealing with Depression and Suicidal Thoughts for a few years now but they recently came back really strong. 
I've become really attached to a girl who had feelings for me. But I fucked over and have nothing left. I eavesdropped on her venting while drunk and didn't leave. 

Ok here's the issue. Shes incredibly mad at me and I ruined any trust I had left in her. She was the only thing keeping me going and not ending it all. She's saved my life multiple times but I took advantage of that. I owe her my life but I'm probably going to take that away from her too. 

I'm not asking for help I just wanted to have a place to vent. 

Thanks to this world for showing me sometimes people can be good. But also showing me how Ungrateful I am.
