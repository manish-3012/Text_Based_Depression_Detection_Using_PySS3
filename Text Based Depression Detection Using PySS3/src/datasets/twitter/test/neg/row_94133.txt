I am going insane, no one wants to helpPlease. All I have is a broken laptop, no phone so I wouldn't be able to call for help. Insecurities are killing me, panic attacks are 24/7, I just need to get out this house and I'll be happy. I'm underage and already have drug addiction, I'm unable to repress any longer. I'm going insane, please help.
