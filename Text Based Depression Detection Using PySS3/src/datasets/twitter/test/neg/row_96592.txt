I have my belt around my neck the end suspended on the door locked into the bathroom, give me one reason to not do itI'm just sick and tired of people blaming me for feeling the way I do, making me feel guilty for looking sad, because that would ruin their fun, and that ofc makes me selfish.

I've gone through so much mental abuse at the hands of my ex gf whom I loved dearly, and I just can't go on with these toxic mindsets anymore no matter how hard I'm fighting against them.

I feel misunderstood, unwelcome and despised by people I hold no grudges against. 

Please save me from myself, I'm begging all of you.
