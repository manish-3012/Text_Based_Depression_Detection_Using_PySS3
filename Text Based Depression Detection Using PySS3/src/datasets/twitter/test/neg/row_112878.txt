Trapped between a rock and a hard place.I'm 3 months PP. suffered from severe depression and anxiety for 20 years, prior to getting pregnant and now it's worse than it's ever been. I am getting treatment but it is not helping. I am getting support but it is not helping.

 I feel trapped by the obligation to my son whom I love with every fiber of my being, but the desire to stop being a burden and a problem for everyone is strong. I do not want to hurt my son but most days I wish I could just swallow a bottle full of pills and be done. Every morning I wake up I consider another failure.
