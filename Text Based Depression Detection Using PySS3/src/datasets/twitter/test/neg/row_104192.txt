Is life really worth living?Is it?I am not sure anymore, i am just too cowardly to actually end it,or maybe i am actually okay? I dont really know anymore , life is isnt really fun,i am 13 and its easy to tell. Most of the people in this community have it probably way worse than i have. Maybe i am just edgy? I mean i am probably not okay if i think those things,and i probably would have killed myself already if i had the courage(i sadly dont have the courage) besides,i am not really a good person anyway soo its not like anyone would really miss me for more than a few weeks probably , and i  probably wont be much better in the future anyway,soo whats the point? I just wish i had the courage to do it, would i regret it? I cant tell,maybe i would be better in the future? Thats probably very unlikely,but there's still a chance?I just,i am not sure.I dont think i am depressed or anything,maybe i am just dramatic?But i wasnt telling anyone?

Sorry if i made you concerned,but i just felt like i had to tell someone eventually.
