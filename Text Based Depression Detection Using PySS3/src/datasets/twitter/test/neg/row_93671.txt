Please help meMy life is falling apart. Itâ€™s my fault. I cheated on my girlfriend because Iâ€™m human garbage. I ruined her life and I can never undo it. The only thing keeping me going was my job and now everyone I work with is going to find out and then thatâ€™s it. Thereâ€™s nothing else left for me. And I canâ€™t blame anyone but myself. I deserve it. And without her thereâ€™s no point.

Iâ€™m halfway through a bottle of tequila and digging through every bottle of pills in my medicine cabinet. Iâ€™ve thought about doing this for so long but now Iâ€™m scared that itâ€™s going to hurt. Iâ€™m a coward right to the end. 

I just wish there was anything redeemable about me. Iâ€™ve done so much more bad than good int his world. Iâ€™m so selfish. And a pointless, miserable death is appropriate for a pointless, miserable person.

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this. I guess I just wanted to tell someone before it happens.
