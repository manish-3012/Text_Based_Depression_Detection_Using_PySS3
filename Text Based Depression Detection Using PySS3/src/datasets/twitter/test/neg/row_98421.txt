Not a single person in my life cares about meI'm 23 and have firmly realized that every single relationship I have had, be it romantic or platonic, ultimately leads to failure because I have nothing to offer. Every single person in my life has given up on me, and quite frankly, I'm giving up on myself as well.

I've tried killing myself several times, but it seems I'm too much of a fuck up to even do that properly. At this point I've gotten to the planning stage, so hopefully all of that goes well.

It's just shameful at this point to have put everything I had on the line, including unwarranted optimism, expecting to eventually have friends and people I trust.

I'm in a long term relationship, but my girlfriend (now fiancÃ©e) doesn't love me or care about me at all. My parents want me dead. None of my friends ever make any effort to contact me, and don't respond when I try to contact them. At this point I've come to accept that it's my fault. I just don't have anything worth sticking around for.

If I die, it'll be headfirst off of a bridge. So hopefully that's a little painless. 

Sorry for all the trouble. I have nobody to turn to anymore. I just wanted to vent. Have a good night.
