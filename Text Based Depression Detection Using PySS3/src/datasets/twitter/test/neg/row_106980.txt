I feel so stupid about thisMy life has been really crappy. My parents are dead. I have tumors in my brain and spinal cord. My grandmother raised me but she never fails to remind me that I held her back from doing things. If it weren't for me, her life would be comfortable, she would be able to retire already . It makes me feel bad, obviously. And I resent her for saying these things to me. But what makes me feel worse is the fact that people are constantly telling me that I'm so lucky to have her. How she's so admirable for stepping up to raise me. But since I was young, all I could think of was how much happier she'll be if I were gone. 

Recently, she bought a miniature dachshund puppy. I really love her and is literally the reason why I get up every morning. She then bought a shih tzu and now doesn't like the dachshund. When the dog misbehaves, she beats her up or tells me to do it. Or she'll yell at me that my dog is so stupid just like me, it's gross just like me. It makes me feel like she hates me as much as she hates my dog and she doesn't care about the things that are important to me. 

The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I'm afraid of what will happen to my dog. But I've always thought of just throwing myself into a busy street and be done with it, since I'm such an unemployed failure. She tells that to everyone too. I've been thinking of different ways how to do it and my mind scares me. 

I feel so stupid and whiny for feeling this bad about something so trivial. But I just can't stop it.
