I absolutely fucking hate my selfI hate my self for some of the decisions ive made, relationship ive ruined, this was a year ago, Im still not passed her, or moved on, I close my eyes, I see her face, I turn on my stomach to try and sleep, I see her face, I cant see my self finding another girl I cant/don't see my self being with anyone else, I had my chance, I ruined it.
