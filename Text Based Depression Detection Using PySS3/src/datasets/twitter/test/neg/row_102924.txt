I'm tired of this fucking cycle.I want to end all this freaking suffering. I've been depressed for 8 years already. I'm tired. I started cutting myself again. There's nothing I look forward to. I want to die so badly right now. I have everything I need to do it ; my antidepressants, a bathtub and a sharp knife. Death is tempting me so much today. I want to end it all. But i' m not even brave enough to do that. I can't do anything. I'm just a ghost. I tried calling a hotline today, and after 10 minutes of conversation the guy hung up on me, that's how much my life sucks. I gave myself a date ; I have to die before my twentieth birthday. It's in two months. I'm gonna give in soon. I'll be strong enough to do it soon.
