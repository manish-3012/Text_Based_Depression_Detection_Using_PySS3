Getting help is a jokeSo I call and schedule an appointment to get help with a doctor and after spending 5 minutes on the phone asking questions on if they can help me they told the could and would gladly do what they can. That was a huge fucking lie. I get there wait 2 hours, get lab work done just to be told they cant really help me and then they pretty much just push me out the door and 100$ later. I'm stuck with the same shit what's going wrong with me, 100$ more broke and even worse feeling. Our healthcare is a joke in Arkansas. I'm moving back to texas this weekend and hope to god I can get the help I need.
