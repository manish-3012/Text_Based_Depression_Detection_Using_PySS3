No one to shareParents, grandparents, all dead at the age of 33. Uncles distant, a brother who doesn't respond.  Almost completely alone.  
  
Today I did something really really good. And no one to share it with. No one cares about me. 
  
I can bear the struggles, the pain, the anxiety. But not the silence
  
I think perhaps, it is time to cut the last dying limb from this tree with root rot.

It won't matter anyways
