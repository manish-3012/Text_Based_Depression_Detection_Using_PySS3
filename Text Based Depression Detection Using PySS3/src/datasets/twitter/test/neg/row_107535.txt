I don't want to be alive anymoreEvery day is boring at best. I just dropped out of college and I don't want to get a job. There's nothing that feels like it's worth doing. The only thing I feel like I could do is write stories. I always think that I want to be a writer so I can communicate to other people how I feel and what the world looks like. But I never write anything. Sometimes I sit down at 3am and try to write something but I just stare at the page and nothing comes out. Even if I did write something I don't have any talent so it wouldn't be any good. I try to make myself feel things. I watched a show today and cried at it but they were empty tears. It was supposed to make me feel sad but I didn't feel anything. I'm out of money and patience and time and I can't stay here any longer. It'll be my 21st birthday soon. I wonder if I'll still know when my birthday is after I'm dead.
