I don't know what I'm supposed to doHello guys, I'm 20 years old and out of school for a couple of years because I lost interest on the course that I took in college. I tried learning a couple of things after dropping out but quickly lost interest in them too. I also tried getting a part time job, but I failed because I just can't handle being and talking around other people. I know I'm being a burden to my mother and there's also my aunt who's still recovering from cancer. Around a month ago, they confronted me about being out of school and my mom made me promise to go enroll to a college. Recently my mom talked again to me because the deadline for application for the semester is nearing, and kept asking me why I don't want to go back to college. This time I answered honestly that I don't know what to do in my life. I don't have any goals or dreams. But she kept asking why I don't know, kept trying to push her own ideals unto me and kept blaming that I'm always on my computer. And then she asked me if I wanted to go to my father (who has his own family and living in another country) and live there because I'm just a burden..I just lost it there. It was then that I decided that I will finally end this life. After all, I'm just another useless human who don't even have an idea how to survive in this world. I don't feel sadness nor fear. I actually feel excited knowing that everything will end soon. 

I have no expectations, I just wrote all of this here on an impulse.
