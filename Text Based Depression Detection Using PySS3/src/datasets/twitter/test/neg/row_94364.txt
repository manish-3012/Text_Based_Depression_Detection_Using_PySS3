A social circle of friends and family can be a tether that gets you to continue living; but what if you don't have that?The idea of a caring circle of friends and family may be true for some people, or even for most people, but certainly not for all people. I'm sure that I am not the only person who is alone to the degree that I am. But I have learned to live with it, and rather be fine with it. I don't have even the remotest trace of social skills to keep myself afloat in the chaos out there. I have known a few people from time to time, but time passes and everyone passes by; I cannot call them friends to whom I can confide my story of a life falling apart. I dont expect people to care anyway, but there is a part of me, an irrational part I believe, that wants pour my heart out and then end it all. It would be like leaving my story behind, but that shouldn't matter to me, but subconsciously it still does.
