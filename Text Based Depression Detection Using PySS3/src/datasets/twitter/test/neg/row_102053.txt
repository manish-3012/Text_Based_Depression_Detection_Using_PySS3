I don't knowI fee like life is pointless. Like we're just here to be here. whats the point of staying alive if ur just going to die and nothing is going to matter. I fee like life is fae and not real. It's a sick twisted game and I bet someone is watching us from somewhere trying to navigate through it, such as a rat in a maze. I'm not happy. I feel like im different form everyone else. I don't know on what way. Well, i know in one way but thats different. I just feel bored and sad all the time. As well as lonely. I hate how i look and act and I don't know why its so hard for me to start a conversation in person. People make me nervous. I'm not sure they like me much.  I just don't know.
