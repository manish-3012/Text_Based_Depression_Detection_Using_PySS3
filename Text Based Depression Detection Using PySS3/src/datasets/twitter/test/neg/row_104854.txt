It's getting harder to come up with reasons to live.My depression has been increasing in severity, and to cope with it I may be engaging in increasingly unhealthy behavior. I have suicidal ideations almost every night, and when I don't have suicidal ideations I often visualize myself being tortured in order to fall asleep. If I sleep with the television on I don't sleep deeply and if I don't fall asleep with the television on I often have nightmares. I sometimes drink heavily for no reason. Not to get drunk or have a good time, but just to deaden my thoughts. I am having a terrible time with any kind of stress. I'm often tired and need to lie down several times a day. I've been abusing caffeine. My youth is over, I haven't made anything of myself. It's hard for me to think that I will actually get better. I've been burning myself in an attempt to stop certain negative compulsive behaviors but now I've come to look forward to the pain. Just existing, just trying to stay alive but for what reason? It's not very convincing. I'm poor and I feel trapped by poverty, cuts to services keep coming and things keep getting more difficult. Things keep falling apart, and I keep trying to keep up. Sorry for the wall of text.
