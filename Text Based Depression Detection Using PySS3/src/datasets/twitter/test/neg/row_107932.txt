November 15thYeah. November 15th- the deadline.. literally lmao. Itâ€™ll be done by then/ on that date. In the meantime, preparation is key :) Ohh, also- you *will* be wasting your time if you comment. I donâ€™t have any problems. I am seriously just a kid who has mental issues. I have things that I donâ€™t bring up- mainly because Iâ€™m ashamed that they happened. Canâ€™t go to my family with this (they donâ€™t believe in depression/ anxiety/ etc. They think that all people who have mental disorders are â€œnut casesâ€. School counselor? Well, itâ€™s summer rn. Also, they are required to tell family if one is considering harming themself/ are harming themself. Yeah, I could probably call/ text a hotline. However, my parents track who I text/ call. I could probably find a way to get over this. Canâ€™t do research on my devices, though. Parents can track what I look up. We live in the middle of nowhere and I canâ€™t legally drive, so the library isnâ€™t possible (pretty sure that it is shutdown anyway lmao). There are more details that go into why I canâ€™t do the things that Iâ€™m not doing- I donâ€™t really feel like writing them out.
