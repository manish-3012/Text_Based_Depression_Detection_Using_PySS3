Feeling like dying would be easierEveryone has been saying the same grass is greener, bright side, stay positive stuff for two months. I have people who are here for me and want to talk and spend time. But nothing makes me feel better. I'm too scared to let myself be happy about anything because I know at night when I'm alone I'll swing all the harder the other way. I can't get these thoughts out of my head and at this point it just feels like dying would be easier. I don't know how else to make it stop hurting. I'm broken hearted and it feels like it will never end. If I tell anyone they'll force me to go the ER and I can't afford another 5 day stay in the psych ward. I just want it to stop. This is a last resort. I don't want to die but it feels like it would be easier than this.
