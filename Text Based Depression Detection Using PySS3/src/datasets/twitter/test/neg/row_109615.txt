Giving upIâ€™ve officially given up on life. Iâ€™ve given up on trying much any more. Iâ€™m just sort of waiting for that urge to come so I can carry in with my eternal peace. Iâ€™ve begun documenting how I feel about it all and wrote a note tonight. I feel horrible about it though. Iâ€™ve got several people who care about me and I donâ€™t want to upset them or crush them, but Iâ€™m just a broken guy with a few screws loose. I just didnâ€™t realize that until I was beyond repair. Beyond hope. I wish my life was more positive. I wish I was different as a whole. I want to enjoy life, yet I canâ€™t. I want to know what being loved or valued is like, but I donâ€™t think I ever will, by hardly anyone in my immediate life. I think it may be about time to write my final chapter. Iâ€™m giving myself a 95% chance to not make it to 25. Thatâ€™s my prediction. Oh well, guess Iâ€™ll see how things progress, just donâ€™t expect much optimism. Night
