If I kill myself, I will inconvenience my family.Thatâ€™s the only thing preventing me from doing it. It will be a huge financial and emotional burden for them to deal with disposing of my body and my possessions. They have enough on their plate. I just canâ€™t do it now. 

Perhaps I will plan and make these arrangements myself. But the idea of living through another day, another week, itâ€™s too much to bear. Itâ€™s all too much.
