I think about suicide on a weekly basisObviously it makes no logical sense to take my life, but it still crosses my mind often. I guess itâ€™s reassuring knowing that thereâ€™s a way out. My nameâ€™s Matt, Iâ€™m 18, and I want to feel excepted. All of my life Iâ€™ve always been a socially awkward person, I donâ€™t know why, but I just canâ€™t seem to connect with people. All of the friends Ive had werenâ€™t my actual friends, they were my brotherâ€™s friends. They just pitied me enough to let me hangout with them. I was also bullied all my years of school, pre-k to 12th grade, I was an easy target seeing as I was always a short person. The only people that I socialize with anymore is my family and 2 co-workers of mine. I donâ€™t know how to be happy anymore, I have no friends, and I will never find love. I think Iâ€™m better off dead sometimes.
