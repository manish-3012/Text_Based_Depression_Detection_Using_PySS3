I think I deserve euthenasia.60% of the time, I am in some sort of pain; and that's just physically.
I also struggle dealing with various mental health issues, which cause a lot of emotional pain (on top of that sixty percent) and i just cant handle it anymore.
Nobody ever offers to help me in dealing with it all. Any of my physical pain is constantly ignored - by everyone - because they don't believe me, they think I'm exaggerating, etc. (?) and as for the mental, it's only when I practically beg online that a few lovely strangers let me know theyre here, but I need more. In both cases. (maybe I sound like a brat *demanding that people give me what I want*, but I really am so sick of it all. Everything hurts and the only solution I see is death. I just wish people understood, so I could leave life causing the least upset possible.)
