I know this feeling isn't permanent but it always comes backThis feeling might pass. Tomorrow I might not feel so strongly about killing myself. But it always comes back. I can't break out of this cycle. I'm always going to wind up back here. Making everyone around me miserable because I can't seem to stay positive or have an ounce of self confidence for longer than 5 seconds.

I just want it all to end. I wish I never let anyone close to me so I wouldn't have anything holding me back from doing it. I stopped looking before I cross the street...here's hoping I get lucky one of these days.

I don't know what I'm expecting out of this. I guess I just wanted to put this somewhere other than endlessly repeating back in my head4. Thamks for reading.
