Is this proper police procedure for suicide attempts?Two nights ago I attempted suicide in my flat kitchen, I was still conscious but very emotional and distraught. My flatmate caught me, knife to my wrists and call 999 without my knowledge. Next thing I know police are storming in tasers charged, shouting for me to put the knife down. This terrified me. I would've thought that they would at least try and negotiate with me gently knowing the situation? When I put the knife down I was handcuffed and told to wait for female officers to search me. They wouldn't let me talk to my flatmate, they wouldn't even let me have a drink of water or anything. I ended up having to voluntarily go to A&amp;E as they wouldn't let me contact my crisis team. I don't know much about police procedure but I was very upset about how it all happened and I'd love to know if anyone else has been in a situation like this or if I was in the wrong and it's just standard police procedure. I'm doing better now, stitched up and in bed.
