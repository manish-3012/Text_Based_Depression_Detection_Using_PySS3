My fiancÃ© remembers a lot of what we did together as a couple, and I canâ€™t remember shit. I can barely remember my log-ins. I canâ€™t believe I forgot about everything...So, Yeah. Title expresses it pretty much.


We were on our way home from eating, and he told me to play a song. I played it and he asked, â€˜Remember when I played this for you on your 25th birthday, and you got mad?â€™ I sheepishly said â€˜No I donâ€™t remember. Sorry...â€™ He kept saying how he remembers everything we did, and I just sat in the car and felt horrible. I felt terrible that I forgot. I need to feel real happiness. I havenâ€™t felt that since I was a kid, and I was ignorant to the world. I was in a bubble of protection then. Now, not so much. When we drove to eat, we were saying how we take stuff for granted. Maybe I took my life for granted.

We were so happy. Nothing but us. I feel bad for not remembering but since I became...this...this bad...I just havenâ€™t really felt true happiness. It made me want to crawl into a cave and kill myself.  I forgot my 25th birthday. I have forgotten most of my birthdays. Soon Iâ€™ll even forget my 27th. Iâ€™ve already forgotten my 26th. My 27th is a bit blurry, to be honest. I donâ€™t want to forget anymore birthdays, but when you physically donâ€™t feel happiness and all you feel is pain, you forget the good. I know Iâ€™m â€˜writing a novel,â€™ but I feel like I should remember. I havenâ€™t got the slightest clue as to what happiness is, I have forgotten most my friggin life, and Iâ€™m deep in a well thatâ€™s out in the rain, with no way out. My parents yell at me for forgetting the things I should remember. Like itâ€™s my fault, and it actually is. My brain isnâ€™t working like it should. Depression doesnâ€™t cause just a deep sadness. It creates problems. Like forgetfulness. Like me. You try and try and try to get out, but itâ€™s damn near impossible.


I feel like maybe people will forget I exist like I forget my past birthdays. My fiancÃ© was so proud of himself for remembering my birthday, even. I feel like this world doesnâ€™t need me. No one wants me here, anyways. What am I in relation to this world, anyway? Iâ€™m just another human being, another air taker and resource guzzler. Iâ€™m a waste of time. Iâ€™m forgetful as fuck and I feel not needed. Maybe itâ€™s time to leave this Earthz
