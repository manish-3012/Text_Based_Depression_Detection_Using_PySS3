I miss her so much!!! (Pls don't click away for the long post)Please don't click away because of the long story! I really need some help and want you guys to know the whole thing...

So a couple months ago, I met this amazing girl at a party in preparation to a prom. At the time she seemed like just a nice girl and at the end of the party, she asked me to go to the prom with her.
We didn't have an awfull lot of contact in between, but at the prom we mainly talked with each other, rather than with others. Which was really great, because we talked about quite a bit of deeper and more personal stuff as well. During the night I started to develop more romantic feelings toward her, and I believe she did too since the night ended in each others arms.
One week later we had our first date, wich lasted for about 8 hours, because we both didn't want to say goodbye.

But then a couple days later, on our second date, she said that she didn't feel in love anymore and didn't want to quit dating. Partially because of her ex, I think... This really came out of the blue for me, because I was truly head over heels for her and we were whatsapping about 24/7. She also told me that she really liked me, and that I was the kind of guy she was looking for. So it really tore me apart, because I knew I'd have to let her go, but I didn't want to. Which resulted in false hope, which was even more painfull.

We continued talking for about two weeks, but when we went out with a couple people some night, I noticed there was no way I could see her as just a friend. So I left early and called her up the next day to tell her we shouldn't speak for a time.

That was about a month ago, but I feel that I only miss her more and more. And right now, I just don't know what to do with myself. I just want to call her or text her, to tell her how much I miss her, hoping for her to suddenly realize that she does want to be with me. Wich obviously isn't going to happen. And it would only cause me more hurting.

Now you must be thinking, "wtf are you crying about", (I know I do...) but I have never felt as appreciated and loved, as I did with her around. I hope someone is going to read this, because I just don't know what to do...
