I wanna kill myself. I have such a boring repetitive life and have no hobbies or skills or any experience with life. I donâ€™t know what to do.

When I wanna start something and chase after my goals I always give up because either Iâ€™m too scared to keep going or I get frustrated and discouraged due to the slow progress I make. 
For example I wanna learn how to draw anime because I love anime. But when I start practicing I get so fucking frustrated because it can take months or even YEARS to get the damn results I want. 

I have no confidence in myself, no skills, no experience with anything. I donâ€™t even have good social skills.  I am even too scared to step outside of my house. And when I do, it takes a great deal of courage to do so. 

Just typing this makes me wanna cry and scream out of anger and frustration. My life is garbage and I just wanna end it. 
I have had multiple therapists and none of them understood me. 
I also get irritated so easily and often lash out in anger. 

The only place I have to go to for advice is reddit but even than, people here are pieces of shit who donâ€™t take me seriously and just tell me to â€œget helpâ€ or tell me to grow up or some other stuff like that. 

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. This is the only place I can ask advice 

Please....! Just PLEASE!!! take this request for advice seriously and if youâ€™re not gonna provide any than please donâ€™t answer at all.
