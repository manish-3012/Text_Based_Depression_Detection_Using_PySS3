Today I slowed down suddenly while crossing the road in hopes that the car driving through will hit me. He hit the breaks for me to cross safely. I'm so disappointed I didn't die.Yet I don't want to go out of my way to actively kill myself. I don't want to jump off a bridge or swerve my car into a tree. I just want something passive like that to happen. Like a ceiling crashing onto me, or some freak accident.

Is there a term for this?
