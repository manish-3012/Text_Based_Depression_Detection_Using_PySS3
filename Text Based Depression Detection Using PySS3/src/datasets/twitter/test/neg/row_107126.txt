I give upLife is not great, its not bad. Its plain, boring and plain. Every day is the same thing, fail in school and go home and fail to use my free time reasonably. No matter how much therapy i get it feels empty except for overwhelming sadness or overwhelming anger at times. Noone cares, noone needs me, i am less than everyone else. I have never done anything of value to anyone, person, animal or thing. If i would die it would just be a misty departure consisting of the little that people remember of me, and like mist it will just fly away in couple of minutes at most and i would be forgotten in the haze of this earth. The endless void before my life never hurt, it never pained me. I give up on this failed project called my life, sucks to have spent so much time on something this useless.
