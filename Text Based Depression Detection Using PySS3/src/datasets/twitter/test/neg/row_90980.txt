Iâ€™m weirdMaybe itâ€™s a symptom of depression but lately Iâ€™ve just been finding everything so dull and boring. Iâ€™ve never found my boyfriend boring but lately Iâ€™ve just been finding our relationship boring and i just donâ€™t want to do anything about it. I rather just kill myself. Why am i like this? Boredom never really made me feel like i have to kill myself but now the slightest feeling of it makes me wanna hang myself.
