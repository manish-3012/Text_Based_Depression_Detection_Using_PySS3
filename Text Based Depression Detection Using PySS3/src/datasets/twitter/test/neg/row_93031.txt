My friend wants to OD and crazy thing so do ISo we are close and Iâ€™m trying to help her and Iâ€™m going to help her. But Iâ€™m trying to keep my head on straight because Iâ€™m thinking irrationally like we could both be free from this shit. I really want to die but I would never encourage her to do it. Itâ€™s just the conversation is triggering. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m not the right person to help but Iâ€™m also like not not the right person to help. The thoughts are strong. I just need help. How do I navigate this situation?
