SuicideI feel so lonely, no I don't feel lonely. I am lonely... and I'm not exaggerating when I say this but nobody texts me, nobody dm's me, nobody snapchats me, etc... I have to text people first, and  nobody checks up on me. I will show u screenshots from however long I've had this phone, cause my older ones got deleted... why Tf have I never been on a date, never had a gf, I lost my best friend, we just stopped talking to each other, and of course I'm the one that has to text him first, so I said fuck it... I wake up, get depressed, go to work, come back home and isolate my self for the rest of the day, and repeat this.... I'm 18, and moved out to my sisters house. I regret this cause it adds on to my depression that I have no clue where and what I'm gonna do after, cause I cant stay there for long... what can I change in my life to get a gf, or to have people message me first. I think about suicide every day, I'm lonely and depressed and have multiple things wrong with me. I have no purpose to live, like actually what is there for me to live for, wake up and work the rest of my life and die alone?? I have no self control which makes life harder too..I can go on for hours..I'm just looking for advice or something that helps...I'm 18 and still going through puberty which sucks and adds into depression too.
