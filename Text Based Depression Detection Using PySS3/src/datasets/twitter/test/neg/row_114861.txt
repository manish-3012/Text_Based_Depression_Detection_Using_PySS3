Suicide is now a point on a map.Suicide has always been there in my mind. In the back of my head kind of asking to be let out. And I never let it. I never talked about it. When I was alone I'd think about how much I wanted that relief. But it was always an exit sign at a show that has never been quite bad enough to make me want to leave.

Now it is. I'm leaving. I've planned it, and the route towards it. It's on my map.
