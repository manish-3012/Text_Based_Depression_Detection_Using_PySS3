Iâ€™m planning to OD in my sleep tonightI found a bottle of hydrocodone in my momâ€™s room and Iâ€™m waiting to take them. Iâ€™ve spent the last hour Googling how many I would need to take kill myself. 
I tried to overdose once before, but ending up throwing up all the pills. Iâ€™m hoping if I mix the pills with a muscle relaxant I wonâ€™t be conscious to feel the effects or call 911. Iâ€™m waiting for everyone in my house to go to sleep so I canâ€™t be revived or saved. 

Iâ€™m sad that my family is going to find me dead in the morning, but Iâ€™m hoping that I can find peace and happiness wherever we go after this life.
