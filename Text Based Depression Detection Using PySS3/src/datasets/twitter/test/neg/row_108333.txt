I want to "opt out".Roughly a year ago I got myself into a fair bit of trouble with the police, it ended in what was most likely the best result in which it could have. Still, it succeeded in scaring the living hell out of me.

What's worse is that my parents were as supportive as they could have possibly been, helped throughout and were by my side from start to finish. 

 I find it hard to put exactly what I feel into words but since then I've been a complete wreck of paranoia and depression. I wake up, disappointed that I've done so. 

I'm finding it close to impossible to enjoy anything, abandoning movies or television shows in which the protagonist engages in romantic relationships. It's too painful to watch. (Completely separate from the Police incident)

I seeked help from a doctor and he just chucked some SSRI's my way. Had I known they contained a "black box" warning I wouldn't have touched them. For the short amount of time I tried them out it improved nothing, still felt exactly the same. 

After the dose being ramped up suicidal thoughts have become daily, almost obsessive. I've stopped the medication against what I assume the doctor would say but I just don't trust them. After stopping sleep has become a challenge, I've been having strange nightmares and trouble sleeping overall. 

Essentially I've got my death planned out but I just could never do it to my parents. Christ, I simply just couldn't do it to my Mother, she'd be devastated. Still, it leaves me in this empty state in which I do genuinely believe that opting out of life is an ideal solution. I have very little drive to do anything, from education to hobbies. Any brief relief I got from recreational drug use has been firmly halted due to the fact SSRI's prevent the drugs from working. 

I can't afford a therapist and any "self help" books I read (I can assure you, I've read a libraries worth) do fuck all. All it does is give me an insight as to why i feel the way I do, yet it's solutions solve nothing. Simply leaving me to dwell on why I'm a terrible, terrible person but giving no solution. 

What really gets me down is the sheer selfishness of it all. People are in far worse positions than I, yet I'm unable to shake the crushing feelings of sadness and anxiety. I'm the definition of first world problems. 

I'm not really sure what I expect from the answers, but now what? What do I do from here on out, carry on in silent misery?
