Lost a friendFound out today that a person I considered to be a close friend of mine actually thinks Iâ€™m a creepy lesbian with ulterior motives. Iâ€™m absolutely devastated. Ever since I left highschool itâ€™s been difficult to make friends, so when I met my new friend group I finally thought that things were turning around. I thought my antidepressants were helping. But this is just too much for me. Iâ€™ve been in a pattern before with people who only pretended to like me when I had something they wanted and talked badly about me behind me back. Things are just repeating. I feel like iâ€™ll never get out of it. I feel like itâ€™s not worth it anymore. i really tried, for years, to become someone that has value. Iâ€™m the constant in all of these failed friendships and relationships. Iâ€™m sure most if not all of it is my fault. Iâ€™m tired of thinking things will get better. They arenâ€™t, and iâ€™m exhausted. Iâ€™m so exhausted. I tried to commit suicide before when i was younger, but i was talked out of it by a friend who really made me hope. Itâ€™s just not enough anymore. I want to end it. Ideally i wouldâ€™ve never been born. I wish my mom had aborted me like my dad wanted her to. Now i have to end it myself, and thatâ€™s so hard. i donâ€™t want to feel this way. i donâ€™t want to be the person i am.
