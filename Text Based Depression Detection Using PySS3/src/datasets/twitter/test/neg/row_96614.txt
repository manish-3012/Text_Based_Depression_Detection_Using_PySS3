Dead inside and soon outsideI dont matter. My existence does not matter. I have known it all my life, my life is a waste of opportunity for someone important. I met someone, he made me feel like I mattered, that It's me and him against the depression. Against myself. But, I am after all just me. I realised not even he cares, my last straw holding on to life. Because we would be happy, together. Build a life. 

It would be better without me, I take up time. Ruin days, moods and everything. If I wasn't so embarrassing it might have gone right 

I wish I mattered, I wish he cared. I wish he never left
