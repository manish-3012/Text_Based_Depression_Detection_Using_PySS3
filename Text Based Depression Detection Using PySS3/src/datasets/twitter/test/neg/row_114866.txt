Oh how I have triedI have ended up in the ICU from attempts to end my life. AND I continue to go to therapy and take meds in an attempt to NOT end my life... But at the end of the day I just do not want to live. My kids don't need me, my family doesn't listen to me, I am invisible, and if I am invisible why should I continue to suffer? Why force suffering?
