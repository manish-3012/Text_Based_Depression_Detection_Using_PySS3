I'm Cold, And My Mind Is Not Here AnymoreI came here because it was the only thing I was willing to do. I'm cold, and I was staring at nothing for so long. I tried to read, but my eyes can't keep up with the words. Tried to watch a movie, and nothing is of interest. Went to walk the dog, because, you know, dogs are always full of energy and will to live, and just wanted to return home. My legs ached so badly, last night I even thought amputation would be a good thing.

I read stories and testimonies from victims of abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and I go "but holy fuck, this is me!!". The isolation, the coldness, the confusion, the regret from everything I've ever done, wanting-to-get-away-from-it-all and hurting me so bad for being such a piece of shit, the shittiest of the shittiest pieces of shit to ever been shit. But I've never been abused. Or I don't recall any memories from being abused. Nor I can remember a time where it could have happened.

So I sit here writing this, because it's the only thing my mind allows me to do. Some people have told me "I can't understand that depression thing, never experienced that, what the hell is it even?" And I know there's no running away from this, it will never stop and there will never be a time from which I can recover from all this. By now I have researched the best ways to do it. There's a train line just five minutes away from home, and there's a very tall building from which I know how to access the rooftop. 

It will be just a small step.
