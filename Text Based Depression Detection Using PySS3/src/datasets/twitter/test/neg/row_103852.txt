RrmmmmmjkmmmkkkkI have no ambitions or goals. I've dropped out of college and am back to living with my parents. My ex left two years ago and I still feel nothing but guilt and regret over her. I've been excommunicated from her life. I go over to my friend's house to smoke pot and forget how horrible I feel, even though it just sets me back and keeps me from being productive. Not like I have anything to be productive with, anyway, considering how little I actually do these days. I'm empty, bored and tired. I'm a burden on my parents and all but my one friend has abandoned me (probably because of my self-destructive tendencies). I'm a bad person, and I'm ready to die. If she can't forgive me, then I don't wanna live.
