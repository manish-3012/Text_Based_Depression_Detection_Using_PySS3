Thinking about it.My dad suffered from Bipolar and depression, he committed suicide last July. My mom's current boyfriend has been coming over my house since the day of my dad's death, he has since moved in. So she was clearly cheating on him. I blame my mother for my dad's death. We are currently broke and I'm scrambling to find a job to help pay for school and gas. I just found out that I have to take a year away from school before I can appeal my dismissal because I failed my classes. I haven't slept in almost a week because really bad nightmares about me killing everyone I love and being left alone. I wake up with cuts on my wrists that I don't remember doing. Today I started with a panic attack. I tried to find a psychologist to start seeing this week but my school's health dept wouldn't answer. Then i tried finding offices in my area but they were all closed today. Then i felt the need to see a psychologist today and I couldn't find a single place. I also don't have insurance and I don't have money to pay for an expensive first visit. I chatted with suicide hotline online and asked them to find me a reasonably priced place in my area. And they did, I called and they were closed for the day. I started panicking again. Got in the car and drove. My boyfriend called and yelled at me to get back home that I was in no state to drive like that (he saw my wrist and thinks I did it on purpose). So here I am lying in bed, wondering if I should take too many sleeping pills tonight. I am exhausted both physically and mentally. I feel like I have no purpose or importance. I just wish I wasn't alone right now.
