I got fired today and just dont want to be alone with my thoughts, can anyone help me?I'm not sure that this is the right place for this but I wasnt sure where else to post. I've had depression and suicidal thoughts for over a decade and today I got fired/laid off (I'm not sure which) and I really dont want to be alone with my thoughts right now.

If anyone can spare some time to help distract me I'd greatly appreciate it.
