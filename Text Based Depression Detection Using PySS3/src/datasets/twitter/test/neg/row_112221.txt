I give upIâ€™ve been struggling with suicidal ideation, depression, and anxiety for too long. Iâ€™m done, I give up, I feel useless. Iâ€™m stupid. Iâ€™m annoying. Iâ€™m a burden. Iâ€™m weak. Iâ€™m done with all of that now though. Iâ€™m honestly more excited than scared at this point. I just want it all to be over.
