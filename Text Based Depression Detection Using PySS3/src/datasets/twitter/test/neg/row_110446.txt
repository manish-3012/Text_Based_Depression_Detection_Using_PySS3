Great..... I got fucking Tinnitus now....pls kill meI'm fucking 14 and now damned for life with s high pitch sound.....  All because I played doom eternal with shitty  cheap headphones on high volume......

What the fuck now.....i can hear it and can't sleep 

First time I got it was few weeks ago when the music teacher played a sound of what Tinnitus sounded like.... Ever since  then it's stuck in my head. But now it's still hear... Now it's louder and permanent.
