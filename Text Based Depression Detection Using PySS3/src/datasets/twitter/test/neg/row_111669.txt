Going to check out soon.I recently reached out for help for these feelings, and speaking to the psychiatrist about my options was difficult. Everything offered to me is really something I have no interest in pursuing. I refuse medication, same for hospitalization, and therapy. I realized I wasted their time based on the chanting of society to "at least give it a try". I walked away ultimately determined in my path.

I came to the conclusion that the only thing keeping me here was the duty I feel to not make an inconvenience of myself.

Forward to the present, and I'm starting to not care if someone finds a bloated corpse after weeks because I have no human connections.

This has opened up so many more options for me, and I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but I feel like this time I can move forward with what I've only ever fantasized about.
