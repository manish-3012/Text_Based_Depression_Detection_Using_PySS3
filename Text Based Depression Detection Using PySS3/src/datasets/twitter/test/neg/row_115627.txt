Existential depression . What is happiness?I just canâ€™t get away from it. 

No matter how hard I fucking try, I canâ€™t stay happy. Well-adjusted. Content.

I have such a hunger for more out of life. It doesnâ€™t sit right with me to just ride the tentatively-lapping waves of dull and repetitive normality. No, I want to fucking be somebody.

I want to be somebody that people respect. I want to be adored.

I need it.

And yet any drive to achieve goals beyond half-arsed composition of pretentious prosaic pseudo-poetry is utterly, utterly lost in the emptiness I feel at night... the laughs of dull derision that echo through the back of my mind tell me to give up.

I want to give up.

I struggled hard with depression last year. I could never say what the cause of its onset was, but I was slicing and dicing the skin from my poor pale forearms like a fucking butcher, day-in and day-out, longsleeve shirts to hide the signals of my pain and half-arsed relationships over the internet consisting of dickpics and titpics and button-clicks and teenaged girls and boys spitting the rhetoric of a generation absorbed in themselves.

I lost my virginity in October. Iâ€™d like to say it changed me. It didnâ€™t. 

Well, maybe I was happy.

Maybe I still am.

Though, I suppose, that wouldnâ€™t explain the weekly crying fits and rotational bullshit of social interaction.

Would it?

Oh, fuck, does happiness actually exist? A consistent state of contentment, or at least of something more than screaming at imaginary goblins to fuck off out of the blackened cavern that is my heart?

Iâ€™m fourteen years old.

Does shit get better?
