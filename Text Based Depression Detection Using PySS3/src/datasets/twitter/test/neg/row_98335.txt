I need helpIm 17, 4 months ago 1 day i thought that i might be gay. From then on i've been thinking it everyday, even though i dont get an erection from men cause i tried masturbating to gay porn several times and didnt get an erection. So that means im attracted to women cause they give me an erection. But for some reason sometimes i'm thinking of kissing a man even though i dont find them attractive and i even thought of kissing male members of my family. But these are all thoughts that pop to my mind because when i'm masturbating and seeing a woman im imidiatelly getting an erection. So my question is am i gay or bi(though i dont get an erection from men and i dont want to be gay or bi)? Or is this just a phase that im going through. Please help me i cant stand it anymore somebody answer me
