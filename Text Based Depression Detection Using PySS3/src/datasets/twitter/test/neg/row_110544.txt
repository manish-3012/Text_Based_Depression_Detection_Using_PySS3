I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. long, confusing text. i need helpiâ€™m a 17 year old girl and iâ€™ve spent the last 5 years of my life catfishing online as a guy. if i could go back and change what i started back then i would in a second but i canâ€™t. i started doing this because of a lack of attention all around i think.  when this started i was 11 or 12 and didnâ€™t think anything serious of it but as iâ€™ve grown up and the relationships i formed with these people have become more deep and meaningful. last year i met a girl and it was like instant attachment, it was the easiest way for me to feel fulfilled and i went with it. i ended things 3 weeks ago and today she texted me and she told me that she was already with someone new and i canâ€™t help but be heartbroken. i know that what i did to her was selfish and wrong and that this is how it should be, but it truly hurts. after she told me this i told her we should not continue talking and to delete my number etc.  When i think of all the time i have wasted on these fake and toxic relationships i canâ€™t help but want to die. I got so caught up in my fake, happy, superficial life that i forgot to live my own and now i have to live with what iâ€™ve done to myself. im overweight, i have no job, iâ€™m on 3 different antidepressants and nothing works, and my GPA is low enough that i probably wonâ€™t get into any colleges.  My friends donâ€™t know that I did this and i donâ€™t think i could ever tell them. iâ€™m so tired of thinking of all the ways iâ€™ve fucked up my life and others and i want it to be over. i really think iâ€™m better off.
