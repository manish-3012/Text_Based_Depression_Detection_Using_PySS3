World getting worse, don't want to be a part of itIn short, as I expected things around me in the world are going from bad to worse and there's nothing I can do about it. I can just feel it getting worse day by day. And it only gets even worse from here on out. I can't avoid it, nor can I make it any better or stop it from getting worse, and it's greatly harming my mind. Ending my life would spare me from having to witness any more horrors. Why shouldn't I try and escape?
