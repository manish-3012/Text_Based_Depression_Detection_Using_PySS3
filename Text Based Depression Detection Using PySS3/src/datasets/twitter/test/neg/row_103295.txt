There's one problem I can never seem to deal with. Myself.Unlike many of you, I have no one to blame for my sorrows and despair but myself. Thinking back over the years, I realize that every single bad thing that has ever happened to me has been, directly or indirectly, my own doing. And as many say, to solve a problem you must take out the root of the problem. In my case that doesn't make sense, or does it?
