i don't want to live but i don't want to die.it's a weird thing. some days i actually, genuinely want to die - but any other time i don't want to die but i don't want to live.. last night i held a bunch of pills in my hand trying to get the courage to take them all. i seriously just can't live with the guilt of all the pain i've caused to people. i was about to take them when someone called me and he helped take my mind off of things. but then again i still thought about suicide.
the only thing that is kinda stopping me is going to a birthday party this weekend and seeing friends i haven't seen in a couple weeks. i'm excited and i'm thinking after that is a good way to die, ending my life on a good note. telling my friends i love them.
i don't know what to do anymore. i have no one... no one i can actually share this with.
