I donâ€™t want to but I canâ€™t think about anything elseSorry if none of this makes sense, I desparetely need to ramble and rant and maybe here is the place. Iâ€™m in a low, low place right now. 
Fucked up at my job today, and it feels like sort of a â€œlast strawâ€. I work in the medical field and somehow mixed up some peopleâ€™s results. Only two people affected, and no actual problems from the mixup because doctors actually pay attention. Iâ€™m just so incredibly disappointed in myself for somehow letting something like that happen. What if the doctor hadnâ€™t paid attention? I felt like my job was one of the only things going well for me, until today. Recently found bedbugs in my apartment and I can barely sleep. The last three places Iâ€™ve lived in have had bugs and it makes me insane. I canâ€™t have people over, and I canâ€™t sleep because every itch makes me turn the lights on in fear that thereâ€™s something on me. I also keep spiders/tarantulas and theyâ€™ve had to be moved elsewhere due to the pesticide. I donâ€™t realize how much I loved my fuzzy, many legs friends and caring for them until Iâ€™ve had to move them. Most people think itâ€™s ridiculous but I love them. :( 
I have a boyfriend who is long distance, but weâ€™re trying to work through how difficult it is to immigrate and itâ€™s the worst. We have to skip the romance of a proposal and a wedding just to get married quickly and be able to be together. Itâ€™s been 7 years. I didnâ€™t need those things, but it would have been nice. I know it sounds very shallow. 
I also donâ€™t have many (1) friends in the city I live in, and donâ€™t find it easy at all to make friends. 
Iâ€™ve been gaining weight steadily and canâ€™t get my self control together to make it stop. I feel disgusting. 
I cried in front of my boss today when she told me about my mistake. The problem is, I canâ€™t even tell how I screwed it up. My mistake looks like the sort of stuff you look at and go â€œwas I high?â€. But my name was on it, plain and simple. I have no idea what I did (and I wasnâ€™t high). 
I got home today and chugged half a bottle of wine before I even got my shoes off. I donâ€™t want to tell anyone I screwed up. Yesterday I bought rope to make a hanging plant pot, and now I canâ€™t stop looking at it in a different light. I donâ€™t want to, but it sounds awful nice right now. Typing this out kind of helped, but Iâ€™m bawling and sitting in a bathtub with the shower running and I donâ€™t want to get out.
