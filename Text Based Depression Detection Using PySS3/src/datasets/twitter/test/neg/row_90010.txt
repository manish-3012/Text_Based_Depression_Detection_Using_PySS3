I've said goodbye to my mother and she doesn't know yetHi

Some of you may recognise me from my previous post.

A few month ago, I intended to end my life but unfortunately I couldn't.
Not because I don't wanted to, but because my ex took what I was going to use.

But, everything got worst since then.

I haven't seen anybody (except for family and doctors) in months, I haven't used my vocal cord since Christmas (yeah, I'm alone), and every "friend" I had turn their back on me for no reason (I just saw on Twitter that a bunch of "good friend" will be on the same party for the new year, and I haven't got a single message from them in month).

I think the worst for me is that I haven't be kissed, cuddled or even hugged in almost 6 months.

I went from having a lot of friends, multiple relationships and everything, to nothing at all in a few weeks.

I spend my days in my bed, doing nothing since I don't have the slightest energy.
My appartement is a mess, I haven't cleaned in a while.

But I know that it will soon be over since thanks to the aid I receive I could buy again what I need.

Now, I have helium, no will to continue and normally, before 2020 I won't be here any more.

I'm not looking for help nor message.
I guess I just wanted to vent a bit and just know that some people may read me.

Thanks for the previous help and goodbye.
