Erase myselfI dont know why im writing this. Its mostly nonsense. Please delete it as soon as possible. 

I want to erase myself. I want to take every journal I have ever written,  every picture I've drawn,  and burn them. Throw away all of my personal belongings and microwave my computers harddrive. 

I'm ashamed to be alive. 

I've felt that way for as long as I can remember. I tried to hang myself when I was 12, but I didn't know how to tie a proper noose. I wouldn't have that problem now. 

But I can't. I'm stuck here. 

I'm 23. Married to a beautiful woman. We have two children. They need me, and so far I've stuck around for them. 

I have an IQ in the 140 range. A friend once told me I should've gone to MIT. I didn't. I dropped out of college and I work in a call center. 

I hate myself. I hate myself for squandering my potential at a young age. I hate myself for hastily impregnating a girl who didn't love me. She wanted and abortion,  I threatened to kill myself. We had a child. We force ourselves to act like a functional family but I no longer love her and she harbors a bitter resentment toward me for forcing her into this life. She never wanted to be a mother. This year we had our second child. 

I'm abusive. Not physically, but emotionally and psychologically. I am manipulative and secretive. I don't think she's good enough for me,  and she knows it. 

I don't have any friends. Most people find me abrasive. I'm a know-it-all,  and I frequently treat people like they're idiots. I don't like people anyways so this suits me fine. Its a lonely life.  

I'm addicted to porn and I recently discovered r/incest. I now have sexual thoughts about my children. Never acted upon it,  but the thoughts are there. It is what it is. 

I give up. I hate myself and everyone around me. And yet I alone chose this. How do I start over? I don't. I should kill myself before I cause any more damage.
