Why canâ€™t I ever be normalIâ€™m always in pain and I donâ€™t think anyone gets me. Like my personality for other people is so complicated or out of this world but I just donâ€™t get why. Nobody can stand to talk to me for more than a few sentences and online it feels even worse. I just donâ€™t get whatâ€™s wrong with me. I want to kill myself. I try so hard but I just fail every time. Nobody likes me and despite what people say too me they get tired and bored of me quickly. Why did I have to be born like this? Why do I have to suffer everyday? Why does everyone hate me and find me weird? Even my parents donâ€™t like me. Iâ€™ll probably kill myself some time this week. This pain is just unbearable
