Mom driving me crazyI had to move home during the pandemic after losing my job.  My mother was always toxic when I was growing up but our relationship improved when I left for college.  I'd been struggling with work the last year, lost my job in January and when the pandemic hit my savings were wiped so I moved home.

What a mistake.

My mother makes me even crazier now.  She always criticizes me and I can't LEAVE to get away from her because nowhere is open anyway.  I don't know what to do.  I feel like everything is impossible and just want it to stop anyway I can.
