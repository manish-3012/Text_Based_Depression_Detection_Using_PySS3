39m, married, kids, "successful", almost jumped from 5 story building todayI have dealt with depression for at minimum 24 years but that was when I was diagnosed. In reality I have likely been dealing with it my entire life. Depression, anxiety and PTSD now as an adult due to multiple traumas in my life including molestation by a family member over the course of several years as a young child into my teen years. I've been on countless meds, been in counseling, been to the hospital, done heavy counseling from that for over a month and still I continue to find darkness and despair in my life. I've been married twice and my second marriage is failing. I struggle over our lack of a sex life as she has zero sex drive which also causes issues for my mental stability likely due to the sexual abuse. I have gotten to the point that I just don't really care anymore. I'm not a very religious man but I do believe in God and that Jesus died for our sins. I also fear that by committing suicide that I'll go to hell. Honestly that's about the only thing from stopping me. It's not my kids or my wife or my parents or friends.

Today I was very close to jumping off the roof of a parking ram at my work. It's 5 stories down to concrete so I'm pretty sure a header would do the job quickly and painfree. For some reason though I just couldn't do it. I have so much pain and can only suffer so much and honestly believe that THIS IS MY LIFE. I do not believe it will get better. I'm ruining my family with my depression and hurting my kids. Why can't I just check out and at least let them live without me? Why can't I just find peace? Why do I continue to suffer day after day after day? When will the pain end?
