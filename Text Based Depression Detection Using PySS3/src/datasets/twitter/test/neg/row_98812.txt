Please help meI never thought my depression and suicidal thoughts would actually make me go through with killing myself but here I am. I tried to kill myself last night. It was unsuccessful, I couldnâ€™t cut deep enough to hit a vein. Iâ€™m only 14. I donâ€™t know why I feel like this please make it stop. Iâ€™m really stressed about my exams and donâ€™t want to fail but I suck at studying and Iâ€™ve been cutting and depressed since I was 11. I donâ€™t know if I want something out of life or if I actually want to die. Please help me I donâ€™t know what to do with myself I shouldnâ€™t even be alive right now Iâ€™m scared.
