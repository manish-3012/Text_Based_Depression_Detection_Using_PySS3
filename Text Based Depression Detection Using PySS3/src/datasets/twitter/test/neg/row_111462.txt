So closeI tried hanging myself yesterday it didnt work i panicked and tried cutting myself down ended up slicing my hand then eventually cutting the rope the only reason i tried to stop is because my gf texted me "please just talk to me" right before i tried it so we talked and talked then i told her i was tired and wanted to go to sleep she knew i was going to try qgain and wouldnt let me go and kept distracting me from trying and im glad she did but i feel awful for making her go through that
