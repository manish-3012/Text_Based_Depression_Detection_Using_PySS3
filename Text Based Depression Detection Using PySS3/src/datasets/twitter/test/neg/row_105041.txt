I want to be happymy therapist and psychiatrist both say that my depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder are something im going to have to deal with for the rest of my life. everyone always says that itâ€™s going to get better but then they drop that bomb on you.

the future doesnâ€™t look promising at all if im going to have to live with these shitty disorders for the rest of my life. all of my medication has worked for a few months then stops. instead of just trying new medicines over and over and then eventually doing something to get me into a hospital, why shouldnâ€™t i just end it all? end that inevitable suffering? i canâ€™t be anxious or depressed if im dead. i canâ€™t ruin my relationships with people if im dead.
