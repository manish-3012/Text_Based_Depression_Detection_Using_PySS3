Thank you allIâ€™ve been reading from this community this afternoon and you all have given me some much needed perspective.
Despite fucking up my job, my career prospects, and for the foreseeable future, my wife/childrenâ€™s chance to get out of crappy rundown apartments, taking my life could only be worse for them still.

I still wish I could start over, go back in time, end this humiliation, but reading your responses to other posts solidifies the nagging thought in the back of my mind that taking my life would forever become my family's scar. A scar my wife/kids will never heal from.

Iâ€™ll keep lurking here to keep this fresh in my mind.

Stay strong everyone and I thank this community for existing.
