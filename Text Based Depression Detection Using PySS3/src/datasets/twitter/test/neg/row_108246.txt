I already killed myself (inside) so why shouldn't I kill myself for good ?Im dead inside, I was a happy person about three months ago before I made a mistake that ruined my life, it just took my life away. Im not the same anymore and I don't think I ever will be. I have nothing to look forward to anymore, I was really excited for life before. I loved life but since I fucked myself up I have nothing to live for. Sorry for rambling. Anyways I don't know how much more I can take, I keep reminiscing the days when I was happy and it kills me to think that I won't ever feel like that again. What is the point on sticking around for a miserable life. This is living hell :(
