The Haven: Mental Health Support on Discord**The Haven Support Network** consists of two servers: The Haven and Haven Retreat. Both offer first-person general mental health support. We are also a nonprofit organization 501(c)3. The Haven has about 4600 members and Retreat has about 1800. We also have an Instagram (@thehavenmh) with 11k followers.

**The Haven** is 18+ and you must be living with or suspect you are living with mental illness.
**Haven Retreat** is 13+ and everyone is welcome to seek emotional support. 

We are heavily modded and aim to maintain a safe space. We have an active community with diverse interests and diagnoses. We do not allow mental health professionals to â€œtreatâ€ folks in our servers.

Our focus is on support, so we have many support channels in which you can talk 1:1 with a support volunteer. We have topic channels for creativity, physical health, meme-spam, group support, and a daily-prompt for writing exercises. 

We are now **partnered with PsychCentral**. You can find us at: &lt;https://forums.psychcentral.com/the-haven/&gt; 

**The Haven**: Care when you need it, care for others when you can.
