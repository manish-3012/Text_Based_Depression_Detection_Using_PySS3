I must kill myself if I fail this examThis exam determines my future

If I fail this I cannot go abroad

I cannot get an actual job

My family will kill themselves

My whole life would be a failure.

My parents said I don't deserve to live if I fail a test.

I will kill myself if I get one question wrong on my finals.

I must kill myself.
