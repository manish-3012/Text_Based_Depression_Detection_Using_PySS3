I'm too weak for this worldI just finished my last day of junior year and I feel so lost. I have been diagnosed with depression, and have overcome an eating disorder. Sometimes, I use my "problems" to make excuses for myself and I hate it. I've tried to kill myself twice, and was hospitalized once. The reason why I haven't attempted more frequently is because my greatest goal in life is to become a vet. My dream school is Cornell, which seems laughable now that my grades have gone down so badly. I know a 77 on a math final might not seem like the end of the world for some, but seeing that grade broke me. Junior year is the most important year of school and I wasted it wallowing in my own self pity. I just know that if I get rejected, I will never forgive myself. I'm so frustrated because I want to achieve my goals so badly, but at the same time I feel like I have no motivation. Everything just seems meaningless and I feel so mediocre and inadequate compared to all the other amazing kids in my grade. I used to think I was fairly smart (35 on ACT), and capable but now everything is crumbling around me and I don't know what to do. I spend all my time ignoring friends who care about me and sleeping, locked away in my room. I haven't exercised in more than a month and I feel disgusting. I might attempt again soon. I'm scared I will fail again and my parents will find me bloody and messy, and I'll have to spend my whole summer at the hospital. I don't think I could go through that for a second time. Sorry if this post is all over the place, I just need to get my thoughts out.
