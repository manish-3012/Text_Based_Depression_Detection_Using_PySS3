I made a promise to myself to commit suicide on my birthday. 6/11I don't think I can do it, I'm not strong enough to do it.

Knowing that I probably can't follow through, is the worst part.  I was actually doing pretty ok.   Now the crushing despair of knowing I'll be alive past that date is unbearable.

I posted a dating profile on okcupid recently, i had a few (distant) friends work on it.  I posted it to reddit.  The overwhelming critique was that they couldn't really figure out who I was with it.  I don't know who I am anymore.  I'm not a person.  I gave up on that a long time ago.  All the things I should be writing in who I am and where I'm going...   I don't have any of that anymore.  I don't have interests, or goals, or desires.  I'm not even sure that when I had them that they were even mine...  I just followed and pursued and achieved what everyone else wanted...   me living is a goal everyone else has for me.  I shouldn't be living the goals of other people. But, my goals? I don't have ones worth talking about...  killing myself?  not feeling bad?  those aren't things people bond on.   I'm pretty much alone, there's noone close by enough to lean on and ask for friendship from.
