I want to die, not to end the pain.I don't want friends or lovers. I don't pursue happiness and I don't want this pain to stop. I want to die, not to end the suffering. There's absolutely no way I can be okay with the world I live in while everyone's views conflict with mine. I see no meaning in living, because there is none. I already tried to end it many times, but I'm sure if they'll know it, they'll try their best to make me "healthy", to get me "working" and they will surely call me mentally ill. I just see it as this and since I see it not as they do â€“ I'm hated and I'm an outcast.
I am sure I will die very soon because I can't take this emotional pain that grew into physical pain a long time ago.
I am literally alone in this and I already don't want any help, because nobody actually understands.
I fear I'm too far gone and my death is just a matter of time. It always was.
