I am walking clicheIâ€™ve never really actively thought about killing myself, but itâ€™s just always there at the back of my mind. My life is good, I guess, itâ€™s definitely not bad. Itâ€™s just that maybe I donâ€™t place that much of an importance in my life. Sometimes when things get too hard, it comforts me knowing that if I really canâ€™t take it anymore, I could always just end my life. But the funny thing is at the same time Iâ€™m a fucking coward, I donâ€™t think I have the guts to go through with it. Iâ€™ve self multilated but I could never cross that line. Everything hurts so bad, and I feel guilty for feeling bad when thereâ€™s really so many things to be grateful about in my life. Nobody knows how I feel and I canâ€™t talk to anyone. To everyone else, Iâ€™m perfectly functional person with nothing to feel shitty about. The one time I try to broach the subject, I was told itâ€™s normal to feel the way I do and my friends tried to comfort me as much as they could but they just donâ€™t understand. I can tell theyâ€™re trying to be there for me but thereâ€™s just a disconnect. So in the end, I pretended like I understood what theyâ€™re trying to tell me and pretended like I was okay. Itâ€™s killing me inside pretending everything is okay when itâ€™s not. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. I have days when itâ€™s all highs and days when itâ€™s all low. And when itâ€™s low, I canâ€™t function and I just wanna curl up and die. Actually, I donâ€™t even know if I actually do want to die or if itâ€™s just a cry for help. I donâ€™t even know where to cry for help in the first place. Iâ€™ll just feel like a burden unloading on everyone and Iâ€™ll feel like shitty person when they donâ€™t get me. Itâ€™s not so bad before this because I have my boyfriend to lean on. Weâ€™ve been going out for 12 years now but we have our ups and downs. Just very recently he told me that he couldnâ€™t do it anymore, that he loves me but he canâ€™t be with me anymore. I feel like someoneâ€™s taken a sledgehammer to my heart, I canâ€™t breathe and I donâ€™t know what to do. I just want all of this to go away. I wish I could be a fully functional adult that can deal with stress properly without having to think about suicide. I am so lame that even my problems are lame compared to people with real problems. How cliche is it to want to end my life just because of a relationship?
