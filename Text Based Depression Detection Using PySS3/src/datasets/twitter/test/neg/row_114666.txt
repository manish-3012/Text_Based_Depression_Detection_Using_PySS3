I don't know what to doI really just don't know what to do anymore. Every single day feels like the same bullshit on repeat. I wake up jobless, full of anxiety, failing nearly all my classes, just dreading having to get out of bed and deal with the world. My girlfriend, one of the only people I live for at this point and the only woman I've ever truly loved, doesn't love me back anymore. She told me herself that she holds nothing but resentment for me. I don't even blame her. I don't think I'd be with myself. A jobless, ugly, inconsiderate piece of shit. That's all I am. My friends left, my girlfriend resents me, I have no future. She doesn't want me, and frankly I don't think anybody wants me around. I promise her I'll change when I fuck up, but somehow, someway, I manage to fuck it up worse. I wish I could end it quietly and fast. I'm on the edge right now. I've set a date and a time. I wish I could do it every day but every time I try I puss out and end up sobbing on the floor. Only thinking of what it would do to my family fills me with guilt for even feeling this way. Wanting to die makes me want to die more. I wish I loved life, I wish I was happy, but I just don't see it happening. I don't see the point. I have no job, no plans, no goals for life. Every single thing I've ever dreamed of doing is hopeless, pointless, and impossible. I always hope that fate will catch up and I'll die in some car accident or get struck by lightning but what are the odds? one in one million? Every single thing I do or say seems to cause nothing but problems and pain. I want to stop being what I am. I'm ready to end it. I have my noose in my closet ready, I'm waiting for nothing but myself
