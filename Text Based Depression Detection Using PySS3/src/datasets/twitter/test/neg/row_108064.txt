How long/bad is the greiving process for family members of suicide victims?I'm pretty much done with living, I have MDD and severe OCD and have exhausted all my treatment options. I am completed isolated by my disorder and I want to die. I have come to the realization that my life will be unnecessary struggle sprinkled with random moments of happiness, and that's just not good enough for me. The only thing that has held me back is my parents as I don't want to ruin their lives, but I'm realizing now that it's my life and my choice to end it. I'm curious to know if the grieving process is difficult and how long it takes for ppl to get over suicide, because if it's a difficult process, I want to alleviate their pain in my note when I'm gone.
