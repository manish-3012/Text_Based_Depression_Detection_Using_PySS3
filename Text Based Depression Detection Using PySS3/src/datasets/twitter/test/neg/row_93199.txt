I want to do it but I can'tHey, I just suffered a huge breakup and now I'm helping my ex date another guy. 

Every day I look out the window and see the fall and just wish I could be weightless. I don't know how to go on. My friend said she would hate me if I took the easy way out and I don't blame her.

My best friend would be an emotional trainwreck and so would my parents.

I've spoken to so many people and none of them have really helped.

I don't want to kill myself but I want to die. I don't want to feel this pain anymore. I have a fear of change and the world is changing so fast around me. 

What do I do guys? I've called all the help lines, I've seen all the therapists, I've spoken to my friends and yet I still want to die. I never have the guts to actually go through with it. I've sat for hours just staring and packs of drugs but I never have the courage to take them. 

I've stood on the precipice of buildings and never taken that extra step.

I don't know what to do. I don't know wha tto do anymore. I just wish I was dead. I want to get into a car accident, or some lunatic mounts the curb and hits me or some freak thing happening. I dont want to cause my own death but i do. I just dont want any more of this. 

I know youre reading this, and im sorry i feel this way. please forgive me. ill take my medication like its prescribed from now on. im so sorry.
