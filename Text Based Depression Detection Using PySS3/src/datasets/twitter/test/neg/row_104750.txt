Best painless death?I've hit my limit with who I am. It's like this cycle that I go through. I hit this high point where I feel like I have a grip on everything then I just lose it and fall into this deepest/darkest hole. I feel my career is going no where. I'm married, but I don't please my wife I feel. I try to keep up with friends, but every time I place crazy expectations on them and I end up losing them. I so strongly feel I do not belong here when I get to this point. I use to be pretty religious in the past. It's been years since I have done any sort of prayer. 

I just want to know if anyone here has researched anything on the best painless death? Pills I would assume? I have the money needed to do whatever is needed. 

I've considered buying a gun. But I need to wait a while for the process in my state. $400 is not bad. I just have no idea if I could do that. Pills have always sounded cleaner and better.
