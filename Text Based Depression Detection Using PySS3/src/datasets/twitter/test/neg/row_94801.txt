wanna kill myself when im 19my birthday is in one month and i just cant take this shit anymore. i dont think anybody around me truly knows how it feels to be alone, and i pray they never do. nobody is gonna miss me til im fucking dead, they wont look for me until im nowhere to be found. i hate this.
