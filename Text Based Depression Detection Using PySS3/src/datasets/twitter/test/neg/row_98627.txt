I don't think hanging is as painful as people sayMy brother is at school right now and im home alone so i jusr got up on the stairs and tied myself to the rail. When I took a step off, it didn't hurt. It was more like discomfort. Like if you try choke yourself but with a bit more pressure. It made my breathing really raspy and I could hear weird noises all over. My face turned bluish but it didn't hurt. The only pain that came from trying that was the headache afterwards. So what's the reason I shouldn't go through with it?
