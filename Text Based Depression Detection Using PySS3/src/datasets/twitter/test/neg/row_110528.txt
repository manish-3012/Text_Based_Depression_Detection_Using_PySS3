I'm doing it, goodbye.I've made up my mind.  I'm commuting suicide and there's nothing anyone can do.  I've already written my note and I have my plan.  My dad isn't going to home tomorrow when I get home from school.  I'm going to park my car in the garage and leave it running while I sit there.  I just simply cannot take it anymore.  I have no one to talk.  My parents won't do anything about it, my sister is 6 hours away, my best friend is 7 hours away, and I have no close enough friends to talk about it.  I'm done and just want to leave.  I've posted before a couple days ago and didn't get any help either.  Goodbye,
