Why would I want to kill myself if nothing is wrong?I'm  happily married, have a wonderful sibling, an alright job, and it's supposed to be a bright future. Everything is great and going well, but I still look forward to ending it all. I have very sound reasons not to,  I love my husband, I love my sister, I want kids one day. I don't understand why this is happening and I'm frustrated. I just want to be happy. This is almost everything I wanted and I should be happy. I think I AM happy, but I would also like to be dead already. Do truly happy people kill themselves?
