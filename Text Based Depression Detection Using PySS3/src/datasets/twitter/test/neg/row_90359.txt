Happiness: The greatest sales pitch of all timeA man who committed suicide a few years ago left a parting note in a forum for those he cared about, where he described the human condition as one of stress, misery and drudgery, a slog from start to finish, citing happiness as a goalpost we can reach that instantly moves further away, and honestly since then i can't think of a better way to reason out the world as it is. We are not happy creatures, it's not our status quo, it's just a moment of elevated levels of dopamine and other chemicals our body releases, or from substances we ingest or inhale. Happiness is sold to us in bottles of pills and alcohol, shitty fast foods and cheap sex appeal, by people with more money, security and indulgences than we care to admit. We, the vast majority of people, have been conned into this stupid fucking mindset that things are supposed to be nice and pretty and where everyone gets along. Horseshit. We strive to work until we die for just enough money to exist and even then, the sick joke is that many cant even get the work. At this stage, i don't know whether to laugh, cry or wash my mouth out with both barrels of a 12gauge. Too sick of this shit to care any more and so bitter that i dont wanna kill myself for fear of missing those old fucks finally dying after messing with us so much. Im starting to think that guy all those years ago was onto something and made the right choice in ending it all, because it sure as fuck doesnt "get better", it only becomes more profitable for salesmen of false hope if you live longer.
