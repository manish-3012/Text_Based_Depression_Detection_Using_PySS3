Should i just killmyself? I think i have Klinefelter syndrome even if i don't have it i have most of the symptomsI'm male turning 16. I don't know whats wrong with me. Wide hips, man boobs, feminine hands, no adam's apple. Should i just kill myself? even if i don't have Klinefelter syndrome whats the point? can i even change my body at this age, would i get testosterone from  some exercise and my body correct itself? i dont fucking know anymore everyone else is so manly i feel like a enlarged kindergarden child
