I should be happy, but the stress is killing me.Male, 18. It's my first summer out of public school. I graduated from high school a few weeks ago and now I'm free! I made some big life changes. I finally got out of a really abusive relationship and found someone who actually make me happy. I started taking community college classes over the summer to give me a rudimentary schedule and prepare me for when I go to a nearby college next semester. I started exercising more, eating better, being more social. My life was looking up.

This week, it all went to shit. I had to cancel my admission to a faraway college that I found out I won't be able to attend. No biggie, I kind of like the local college. They're giving me the run around and making it a generally terrible experience. When I call to ask, they're rude. They don't return my emails for days. I don't even know what to do anymore.

My adviser at my local university told me to take the wrong math class over the summer. When I found out, I thought I'd just roll with it and take the normal math in the fall (rather than getting a head start like we'd planned). Well, turns out the math I'd need to take there is filled up, and I may not be able to switch classes in time. I have no idea what this means, but given my history it probably means I'll be fucked of going to college.

My girl has been on vacation all week, and I really miss her. We can't contact each other since her parents started this anti-technology thing and don't let her use the Internet or phone while on vacation. I really, really miss her and can't wait until she gets back in a few days. In the meantime, ugh.

My ex, the one I just want out of my life, keeps trying to contact me. She's like a ghost that keeps haunting my life. I don't know what to do with it, so I just ignore her and hope she'll go away. But every time I see her messages or phone calls it just takes me back and makes me feel like shit.

I'm still living with my family, and they treat me like shit. I have no freedom or choice in anything, except when I fuck up, that's always "my choice." I'm expected to just spend my days babysitting my siblings or going to class. To top it all off, I've been getting gradually more and more ill the past couple days and no one seems to mind.

I have no one to talk to but you, Reddit. I have a history of depression and suicide attempts. The stress is seriously tearing me apart. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. My head feels like it's about to explode. I just want all of this to stop.
