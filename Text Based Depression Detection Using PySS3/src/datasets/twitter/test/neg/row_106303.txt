I just want to end it for no reasonI'm happy, I have a family, friends and i got accepted to a new school. I have almost everything I ever wanted but sometimes i just want to end it all.. At first it was because of love but now im over her and the breakup was for the better. As writing this i just feel empty. Usually i laugh and fuck around with my friends and don't care about shit in the world. And suddenly i just want to die. Is it because lack of sleep or what is wrong.. Maybe a personality disorder. I have tried commiting suicide many times but never went through with it. Anyway I'm gonna take a nap and see what i feel like after waking up. Will edit after but still would love some advice or suggestions orsmth.
