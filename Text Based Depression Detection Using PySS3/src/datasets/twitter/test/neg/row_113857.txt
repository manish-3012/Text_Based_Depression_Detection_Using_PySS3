i would have given anything to be beautiful.being an ugly girl hurts so fucking much, its like im living out some sort of punishment, its basically lifes way of saying "fuck you" to me ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

and more than anything, its so exhausting and mentally consuming. i cant focus on anything, especially not school, so im a failure all around. like, if i woke up one day with a nice face, i wouldnt have to put in all the extra mental energy required just to get by in the world. sooo much of my mental capacity or whatever would be freed. i would actually be able to focus on things in life. this has ruined my personality too, im so miserable and i can tell no one wants to be around me. why couldnt i just have been born beautiful 

"beauty is subjective", "theres someone for everyone", "you could think youre ugly, but youre someones perfect type", are just some of the things ive heard. sure, these are true to a certain extent. these dont apply to you if youre conventionally and objectively unattractive. youre invisible to people. i fucking hate it, and surgery is out of the question bc im only 17 rn and broke as fuck, also im terrified of the risks

i give up on this life.
