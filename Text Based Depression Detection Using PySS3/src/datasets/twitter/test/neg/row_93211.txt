I feel numb.Usually i feel all the things all at once all the time. 

Lately, i feel nothing. Lately i feel like putting my car in the garage and just turning it on...and sitting in it for a very long time. Lately, things i would get excited about or interested in, i feel whats the point. Lately, people i love would fill my heart with joy when i see them and now i just feel like a disappointment. 

Keep thinking about driving my car into a lake, or being extremely understanding when people overdose on drugs. (I've never taken anything worse than vodka.) 

I just wish that people could understand how much i try and how much love i can give, but now i just feel numb. I dont want to think about it all or be anxious or feel disappointed when i dont mean the same to people. 

I just want to disappear.
