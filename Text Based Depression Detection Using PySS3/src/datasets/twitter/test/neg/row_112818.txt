4 months late on rent, evicted from apartment tomorrow, self-evicting from everything else shortly afterI never imagined myself homeless but I'm not surprised either. I'm 4 months late on rent due to poor luck and poor financial management. Our landlord is being generous and offering us a reprieve if we can come up with $500 today but there's no way that can happen, so we'll get evicted tomorrow. My partner is disabled and can't work. I have no credit cards, no savings, and less than $100 in the bank for the next two weeks.

I'm not good with money, I know that. Neither of us have family that can or will help. 

Today is our 11th anniversary. Our car is in the shop and costs $1300 to get out, rent is 4 months late, totaling over $4000, and I have a credit score under 500. I don't see any point in going on. At all. I have no future and have only done terrible things in my life that have led to this moment. I ask for forgiveness to those whom I've wronged. I am sorry for being a liar, and I don't see anyway out of this hole. I have failed.

Please do not view this as a money beg. More of an explanation of circumstances.

Sorry to have wasted your time. Sorry to have wasted the air. Sorry to have hurt so many people.
