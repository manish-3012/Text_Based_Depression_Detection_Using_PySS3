relapseHello everyone,

I am 14 so sorry if this doesn't make sense I'm really stupid (please no r/im14andthisisdeep jokes). I have been struggling with my mental health from as early as I can remember. 7 is the age I remember clearly wanting to kill myself. I first cut on August 25th I think 2018 or 17, I'm sorry I have a really bad memory. 

Last year, around the same date, I managed to stop somehow. I don't know what came over me but I stopped. However this year I believe it was October 13th, I relapsed.

I first began cutting with a paper-knife I don't know what the proper name is. Like those blades used for arts and crafts; I got it in a set with extra blades and a box cutter included (that comes in to play later). I also remember using the blade in a pencil sharpener. I took it out using a screwdriver, obviously, I was desperate.

This year my first relapse was with using a pair of haircutting scissors, they were very pointy so I closed them and dragged them against my skin. My go-to place to cut is my forearms; the top, not the other side. Then on October 23rd, I used that box cutter from the set; I can't find the paper-knife thingy and I'm not stupid so I'm gonna go around asking for it. 

I got carried away, I cut on both arms - something I've never done before, it was usually always on my left arm. Now I've also cut the back of my hands. It looks like many cat scratches and my mum saw them yesterday. I made up some stupid excuse and I don't think she knows about my arms. 

I'm scared because I feel myself getting addicted. 

I had a couple of therapy appointments but due to covid they were cancelled; apparently, my school is trying to get in contact with my therapist but it's taking so long I feel like giving up.

I don't feel real. I feel like I'm not even existing. Nothing feels right. Everything feels off. I can't keep up in school; although my grades are good I don't feel like doing anything anymore. I feel like crying every day; I do cry every day. I don't have an interest in anything anymore. School is in 1 day and I haven't even touched my books let alone revised for tests and done my homework. I want to die.

I feel so empty but so weighed down I can't describe the feeling.
