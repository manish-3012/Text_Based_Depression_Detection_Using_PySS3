I had to stop subbing here because it was too intense even though I wanted to help, but now I breaking down anywaysI can't find any hope for the future anymore. I have a transmittable std that can't be cute that prevents me from ever having a physically meaningful relationship with anyone ever again. I'm 32 and have no savings, the best I can hope for is "lottery" type financial luck or working for the rest of my life. There's nothing I hate more than selling my life for a wage.

I'm lost, I'm frantic and manic when I'm usually everyone's rock. I can't do this anymore.

I can't anymore. God damn  it
