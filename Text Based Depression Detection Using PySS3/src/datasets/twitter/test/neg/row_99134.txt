I've accepted that I have no use anymoreFor the past 10 years now ive been depressed and ive always made myself stay strong by telling myself I'm needed, and as long as I have some use I should stay around. At this point I've realized that I have no reason to live anymore I'm not wanted not needed nothing. It's obvious that they don't care about me or my emotions so what's the point. If the only person you have in your life desides they don't want you anymore why stay alive at all.
Edit 1: tonight's the night that I do it there's really no point going on anymore 

Goodbye
