Planing on killing myself tonightHi. 

I am a 19 year old transgender woman in Japan. I have struggled with intense depression and anxiety my entire life and without any end in sight I have decided I cannot cope with the pain and will kill myself tonight.

I had a terrible childhood, ever since I was little I knew I did not like living as a boy, I acted girlishly throughout elementary school but had it beaten out of me by bullies so that I began a socially awkward, anxious, distant shell by the time I in middle and high school. I always felt out of place and constantly have anxiety where it is impossible for me to get anything done.

I future is not bright, but dark. I hate my body more then anything in the world. Of all the people in the world, why could not I have been born a woman? Or even just a regular man. Why did I have to be born a transgender? I will never have a vagina, the closest thing I can get is  sloppy approximation that will cost insane amounts of money. My voice is deep and gives me away whenever I go out even if my face is not that masculine. I will have to be on expensive, and copious amounts of female hormones for the rest of my to just get semblance of something that 50% of people are born with. I am aware that if most people think of transgender as disgusting, strange and gross and it saddens me.

I have to live with a danger sign to all men. Most men in my country are not comfortable dating  a transgender woman, much less one that is constantly suicidal and cannot have children naturally. I will never be pregnant and I will never be a mother. My parents look at me with disappointment, and they will always consider me their son, never a daughter like I wish. 

I have no friends. I was bullied so much that I had no friends in school and the few friends I did make abandoned me whne I told them I have a woman's heart. 

My life will never be simple or easy and I am too WEAK to deal with that fact. Even if I try my very best  I will only get a artificial version of my ideal life, it can't be helped.

I walk to the red light district almost every day past midnight and go to hotels with any man approaches me. My hope is that one of them will be shocked and furious that I have a penis and will murder me, that way my parents will have to live with less shame and sadness. But, this is taking too long, so instead I am planning to jump in front of the rapid train in a station without people so I do not scar others.

University starts tomorrow for me. I have already legally changed my name to a female one meaning that I am forced to go to school in a female appearance. I am so terrified that they will see through my makeup, and clothes, and trained voice and see me as the people in high school and bully me again.

Why should I not kill myself? I will jump in front of the train tonight,.
