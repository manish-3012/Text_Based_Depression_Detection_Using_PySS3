I need so much help.I'm 22 years old. I'm 2 months out of a long term relationship. She's with someone else, but I saw her for 2 nights this past week and we had sex again. She expressed doubt that she'd be able to face her boyfriend again since this, but she has with no problem. I've begged and pleaded to get back together with her and she doesn't seem to care, no one seems to care. 

I can't talk to anyone, I tried therapy but I omitted the fact that I had a plan for suicide 3 weeks ago. My best friend and my ex both know it happened but no one else does, and no one knows that I'm at that point right now. My brother is away for the army, my mom is around but we aren't close. My father died when I was 8. I have an awesome job that I love, but I can't shake the feeling that cold steel against my forehead wouldn't be such a bad feeling right now. I'm fucking miserable, I don't know what to do. 

I feel worthless, cheated, abandoned, used, meaningless. I feel like no one gives a fuck about me, and besides having to clean up and repaint my room, my suicide wouldn't affect anyone. I miss my brother and father more than anything, and I miss that relationship with the girl of my dreams. I'm rambling and don't know what else to say. I go to the gym, it doesn't help. I go to work, it doesn't help. My ex is in everything I do and see, and I feel like I'm not even a thought in her mind. I constantly feel I have to fill my father's shoes, and I'm failing miserably. I'm a constant disappointment.

Someone help... I need reasons to not pull a trigger.. soon
