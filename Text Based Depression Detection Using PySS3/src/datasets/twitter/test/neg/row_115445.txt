VentingI'm self diagnosed depressed.  At least what I've been feeling for the last 3 years.

Consistently I'm telling myself I'm a fucking idiot, I don't matter, that I'm worthless. And the worst part is deep down I believe it. Friends tell me otherwise but I don't believe it.

I don't want to reach out because I don't want to be labeled as that person with a disability/mental issues. It seems like mens mental health has been put on the back burner for other social programs. I don't know what to do. 
Consistently I'm sleeping. I don't want to wake up, why ruin a good thing? It varies from day to day.
I want to die but hate what it would do to the people around me (especially my Mom for some weird reason), and also I'm not sure if I could go through with it.

Everyone knows me as the happiest guy when I'm around them, the truth is I'm slowly dying. Not when I'm out with them, but when I'm alone with my thoughts. Maybe I just need a place to vent like this. Maybe I just need to get away.

I hate what I've become. Not that I'm a rude or bad person - just that I hate my fucking life. It's easy to say change, but it's hard to do.

Fuck my life I'm such a coward, even on my own thoughts.
