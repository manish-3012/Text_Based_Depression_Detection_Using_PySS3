Maybe my cousin was right about me being a failure and a disappointment\*TW\* Assault

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this semester (I'm a second year at Uni) I started pledging for a sorority. Before that, I was assaulted by someone in the brother fraternity and it was a really hard decision for me to continue. I had been raped twice two years ago and I could not grasp those feelings until I was forced to deal with them when my assault case had to be reported. I thought the girls I pledged with were my true friends but since we finished, I have been dealing with depression on my own.  Since then, I've become dissatisfied with my entire life--I failed my first class in uni, was looked down upon for reporting my case by other girls in my sorority, and haven't been doing well as I used to be. The semester before that, I got a citation for drinking. This entire academic year was another adjustment for me and it seems like my decisions made my life harder and it was my fault. My older cousin (who I'm barely close with) who has a child on the way, messaged me that it would be better for me to go back to community college because my continuous failures have led me to be a disappointment. I received my grades earlier today and my gpa is now a 2.2 cumulative. I couldn't get into business school. I lost interest in my love for making videos and social media and just life in general. No matter what I do, no matter what I say, how is this supposed to be any better? I feel like I have no one. I think it would be better if I just swallowed pills and slept it off. I don't believe it when people say they're proud of me or that they love me--I just want someone to truly mean it when they say that they care about me. But I feel like I literally have no one.
