Slave to my regretsI've done a lot of wrong in my life. Made a lot of poor decisions. Missed a lot of opportunities. It feels too late now. It's not as simple as just starting fresh.

For context, I've always wondered how things would have been different if I got to know her 7 years ago, rather than waiting 6 years before asking her out. When we finally started going out, I was already too far gone in my depression. The insecurities I developed droved her away. Covid happened few months into our relationship. Became extremely suicidal from not being able to see her, and eventually had a meltdown which made her leave.

7 years ago, if I got to know her, would I be happy today? Would I have followed a career path I loved? She was someone that believed people should follow their dreams. Would still have developed all my insecurities? Would I still be with her today?

I would trade everything I have so I could go back in time to the day I first saw her, 7 years ago.
