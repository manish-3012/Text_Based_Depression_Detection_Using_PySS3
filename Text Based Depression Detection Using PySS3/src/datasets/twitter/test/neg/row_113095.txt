2 years..It's the 2 year anniversary (that sounds too cheery but I'm not sure what else to call it) of my second sexual assault on the 30th and my 13 year for my 1st was last week. I'm feeling really unstable but I have exams coming up so I can't afford to stop, and I don't want to talk to my friends because a. I'm embarrassed and b. I already feel like a massive burden on everyone and this secret would be too much. 

I literally don't know what to do but I feel so alone and helpless. If I was dead I wouldn't burden others or have to deal with this. Fucking dreading Easter dinner because I'm supposed to be cheery but inside all I want to do is peel my skin off or throw myself off something tall.
