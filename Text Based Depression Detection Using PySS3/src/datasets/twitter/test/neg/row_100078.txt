My computer is broken, I ruin everythingI tripped and spilled like 1 teaspoon of iced coffee on my computer. It stopped working, I took it to the Apple genius bar, and itâ€™s destroyed. I donâ€™t have $750 to fix it, Iâ€™m in high school and I canâ€™t get a job because Iâ€™m 14 and no where around me hires kids my age and I canâ€™t take this. My mom is going to fucking KILL me, and I canâ€™t continue school now because I literally DO NOT have that kind of money to repair mine or buy a new one or rent one from the school. My mom wonâ€™t chip in or help me. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I got over suicidal urges like a year ago but now I think Iâ€™m going to do it tonight or tomorrow night. 

tl;dr my computer is destroyed, I simply canâ€™t afford to repair it or rent one from the school, and my mom wonâ€™t help me. I didnâ€™t want to die anymore after 6 years in therapy but here I am. I canâ€™t face my mom and sheâ€™ll kill me.
