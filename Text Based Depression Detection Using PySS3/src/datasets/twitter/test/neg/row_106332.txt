Never posted but here I goNo one in my life can give me the â€œencouragementâ€ of anything I do. Iâ€™m wrong. Always. My mother tells me I made my kids â€œsufferâ€ by teaching them to walk in out walking school district. I was with them. They need to learn I donâ€™t have a car and I want to make sure they can be safe. Apparently thatâ€™s not good enough. My husband doesnâ€™t understand where my severe anxiety and depression come from, so itâ€™s dismissed as me being crazy. Iâ€™m over it. I want to die. I canâ€™t even explain how badly. My kids are young and I donâ€™t want to leave them. But, apparently I canâ€™t  do anything right for them. So this is my first post, and hopefully my last. Thanks for being a support for feeling this way. Iâ€™ve been a long time lurker, never posted my own status. This has been one of the worst days Iâ€™ve had in a while. Maybe everyone is right. Theyâ€™ll forget what a piece of shit I was and love a happy life.
