Going to end this, for good...(16 M) I donâ€™t care what everyone says to me. Slightly, maybe. Iâ€™m tired of living the pain, every single second of my day. No friends, no happiness. Everyone hates me.

You know what? Iâ€™m done with this. Iâ€™m going to kill myself tomorrow after school. Iâ€™m doing everyone a favor. Donâ€™t worry, I wonâ€™t come back.

Choose my punishment. Know my fate.

- Stab in Back of the Head
- Stab in the Neck
- Stab in the Heart
- Stab in the Stomach
