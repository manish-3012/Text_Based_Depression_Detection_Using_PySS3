To whoever this may concernI'm ending my life.
I wrote  a detailed letter in here and then the battery on my phone died and now the entire long story is gone.

I will just make this short.
I stood by a woman who promised me loyalty and a better life and what I got is that she cheated and abandoned me W/O car food or money and refused to take me to get pills I need and LIED over &amp; over about taking me to the surgery I needed.   She cheated on me and tried everything to cause me to die. Getting in the way if medical needs and causing me to starve literally!!!!
      She refused to buy me food.
I was just abandoned while she is making over 7500 monthly income AFTER TAXES besides bonus. She got a job as a director in a medical field. She got that job  because I LIED FOR HER by giving her a great review as a past employer, I was never her employer. She tried to kill me by stealing my cardiac pills.
  She cheated on me started on Thanksgiving  with a subordinate asshole from that job.  She now has TWO INCOMES AND TWO CARS and I have nothing!!     She preaches "patient care" to rge employees but literally caused situations over and over so I would die. She actually tried to kill me in ways that would show as medical problems. 

I'm now in horrible living conditions!!   Toilet leaks snf rbe place smells like a sewer and I have no decision ability since I can't work.  She knew I can't work and told me after my open heart surgery that  I will never work again abf that she will take care of everything.

I'm miserable and tired of living. 

I have NO ONE to even write a goodbye letter to. I'm homeless and hopeless. 

I had a long detailed letter all typed out until the phone battery died and all the text was gone.

I want to die without anger.
I want to just cry but I can't even even do THAT.  I don't want to be in this world. I don't belong here.
