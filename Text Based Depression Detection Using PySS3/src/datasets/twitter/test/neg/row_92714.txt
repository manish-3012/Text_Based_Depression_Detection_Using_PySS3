I want to die because of boredomI don't know if anyone is like me or really understands. I don't have any problems.
I just don't care about anyone, life is incredibly boring. I have some friends, I've almost always been first in my class, i wouldn't say I'm ugly but that's all. Nothing really  excites me, no hobbies. I don't even really care about my own family, they love me but I can't say I love them, I wouldn't care much if they'd die tommorow. They've done nothing wrong, I just dont care about them or anyone else.
I might be a bit crazy.
