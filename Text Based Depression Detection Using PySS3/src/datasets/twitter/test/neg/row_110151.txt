It feels like its overIâ€™ve always struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts ever since I was a kid, but shit has just gotten so much worse over the years. Usually when I get bad something always pulls me back out... I think of my cats, my sister, my friends or maybe I just get too scared. As i sit here right now though Iâ€™m drawing a blank. I canâ€™t put my finger on it but it just feels like its over, like I can finally just end it. I ended a three year long relationship in preparation for it. Iâ€™m up at school with no friends, no motivation, just completely isolated and idk. I just feel like its meant to happen, my chapter is ready to end.
