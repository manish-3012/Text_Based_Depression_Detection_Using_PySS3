I feel totally unhappy unmotivated about life suicide may be only option. Stuck for a while now.Hello all,

I don't have the energy to give a huge background but I feel like it might be time to think about killing myself.  I feel so stuck and scared, sad and empty about life.  Every day is like waking up to massive emptiness and just wondering how I can waste time.

I got to the point I've had ECT but idk for what it did help in some other ways I feel different or possibly a bit worse.
 
I'm 24 feel like a complete looser.  Hardly had any employment experience to my name other than some seasonal jobs in the past, and around here just sucks overall with employment and I can't move I have no means.  Parents take care of me or I'd be SOL.  However this has gone on for a long time and can't forever,p.

Even though I'm scared and reluctant about the mysteries of death I really am wondering if I should just really be strong and push myself to go through with it.  Help doesn't work for me and I've lost hope.

My life will never be anything successful and just going to waste.  My early 20s already flew by and I have no idea,p.

I'm so scared and lost and screwed.
