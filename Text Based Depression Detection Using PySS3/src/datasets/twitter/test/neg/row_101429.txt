Would really like to kill my selfI moved away from my old city kept contact with a of my old friends and have told them I'd like to kill myself. But it seems like they're getting tired of me telling them cause half the time they dont respond. My sister sexually abused me as a child and now I hate being touched by a woman and fear them and have never been in a relationship. I can't figure out what career I'd like to go in and even if I did the local college offers very little and nothing I'm interested in. I have no car so I can't even go where I want. I've told my mom about this a lot and when I told her again last night she just said not this again. When I told my dad he just saw said forget about what happened and get confidence (just get it out of thin air I guess) I've seen a therapist yet for about a year yet it it didn't help whatsoever. I mainly can't go back seeing one because they're all an hour+ away and my parents won't drive me that far. I'm at my wits end and just want to end it all I'm so fucking tired.
