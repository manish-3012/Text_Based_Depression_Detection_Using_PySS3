I am nothingI don't know where to start but ill just go ahead and say how I got here. I was talking to my friend and he said he had to leave even though he really didn't, cutting to the chase he said he would "rather play cricket anyday" than talk to me. I thought he was my best friend, and now I realise that was one of the last things I had. I am a failing student. I really liked a girl so I asked her out, she said shed get back to me and she never did. I've been socially anxious ever since I was assaulted and had my nose broke two years ago. I don't understand anything about life. I don't know what religion is correct, or why we do things the way we do, or why we should, I don't fucking get any of it. 
I guess it just pushed me real close to the edge hearing my best friend say that and know that people always mean more to me than I mean to them.

If you read all that, I love you.
