About "support system"I constantly see people saying it's important to have a support system. I just feel when you already don't have it, it's nearly impossible to build one. 

I recently moved to a new place and lost contact with the only friend I had. I feel like I'm losing the ability to make connections with people. I just don't know how to make friends again, and I'm so burdened to talk about my mental problems with anyone I know, afraid  they would think I'm just spreading negativities.

I feel you make friends when you're mentally fit and engaged, not when you're just lost and fucked. when you're at your worst times, it's already hard to keep connections with old friends, how is it possible to make new ones?
