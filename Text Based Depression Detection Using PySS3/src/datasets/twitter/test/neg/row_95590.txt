Im trying but its not enoughLong story short was inpatient about 4 weeks ago.

Was put on medication.

Medication has made my concentration horrible Im unable to focus on my courses.

So much so that I am having to incomplete this semester and try to come back next fall.

Ive been sleeping much more than usual. 16 plus hours a day.

I want to die  not exist. I want to cry myself to sleep and not wake up.
