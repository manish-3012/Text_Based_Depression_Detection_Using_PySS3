i hate everyone in this worldI really do. Its so overwhelming.
1. the teacher just dropped a bombshell. my group project has to be re-done. everything changed. and i find that my groupmates feel that i am a burden. and my teacher talked about the girl who dresses nicely, but is ostracised in the class? me.
2. i told a girl that i suffer from depression, she told other girls in the class and i saw them twirl their fingers around their head and say that i am crazy. i agreed to work on a project with her, i am not sure if she will even bail out.
3. for another group project, i was wondering if we should switch topic from suicide to ageism. the girl who suggested the topics did not want to meet the teacher for consultations. i was the one meeting the teacher for consultation, and asking her everything about the project. i suggested the topic about suicide and i can't find any stories on suicide.....
4. my churchmate wants to meet me....she will be telling me how much commitment i put into the church, and its not enough. how i always leave after the church sermon on saturdays, how i leave 30 mins early, how i always fall sick and not turn up for church.
u know what? i don't need that. i need someone to offer concrete solutions. she doesn't do jackshit when i am suicidal. she will say, how much i am compromising and shit.
5. my psychiatrist doesn't do jackshit. no special accomodations for me. he does nothing. even if i end up in hospital, my problems won't be solved. the school counsellor can't help much either.
my hands are tied. and i am so tired, really tired.
why am i still alive? i am holding on to the little glimmer of hope. outing with my friends. 
since day 1, i have been struggling.academic. friendship. health. every kind of issue plagues me. studying/working has always been a struggle. struggling to learn. struggling to work with others. i just feel so dumb. and i have a test coming up tmr. i just feel like ending it all.
