I have but one day to my planThis is not a plea for help. Just a curious observance. I just took my final draught and I will be dead in 24 hours. Not found for 2 months. 

But I don't feel fear. I'm excited to see what's on the other side after a life of constant pain.

Sometimes it's just what's meant to be.
