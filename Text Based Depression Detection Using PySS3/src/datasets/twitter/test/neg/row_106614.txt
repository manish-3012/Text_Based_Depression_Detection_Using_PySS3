I've always been a lurker.. Today I think I've had enough.I've always had this deep emptiness inside me ever since I was abused as a kid. I come from a Muslim family and I'm far from Muslim. I come from a family where the American Dream is somewhat frowned at. I've tried to kill myself before but failed. My problems seem to get worse and worse. I used to use a game called League of legends as my escape as well as got help from my LD girlfriend.  Recently after 3 years my girlfriend has broken up with me and the day after my dad has stopped me from becoming independent and has stopped my plans of transferring to a Uni. My parents want me to forget about what I want and focus on theirselves. I think it's so selfish of them to make me work months on ends 10 hour shifts everyday for free. But I am a hypocrite because my gf stated that I was selfish as well... At this moment in my life I've never felt so used, so thrown away. I forgot what happiness feels like. I forgot what it feels like to be my own self. I don't want to charge legal action against my parents because then my sisters might go through troubles.. I'm expecting a letter from my girlfriend within the next few days. I think I'll be ready to go after I read it. I just needed a place to drown in my self pity.. That's what she (ex) calls it.   Sorry if there's typos or whatever... I'm currently being slaved...
