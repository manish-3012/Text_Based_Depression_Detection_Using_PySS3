Anyone else - Suicidal Ideation?Anyone else constantly think about suicide? I looked it up and I believe it is called suicidal ideation. At first the thoughts were with me only at times of extreme stress as a coping mechanism. They calmed me down. Now they're with me hourly, every single day. They've become comfortable. Even when I'm happy I fall into the thoughts. I compare it to this: being on vacation and then coming home and sleeping in your own bed for the first time in a couple weeks...it feels comfortable and satisfying. That's what the thoughts are to me. They don't seem so crazy anymore because they've become familiar. Can you share your experience(s)?
