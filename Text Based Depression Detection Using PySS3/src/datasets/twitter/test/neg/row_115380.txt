No one likes meIn my entire life I've never had a girlfriend. I have no friends people ignore me. I'm shy so even if I wanted to get rejected I physically couldnt. I've been praying I haven't really asked god for anything else in my life that I can remember. So I prayed, is asked god to give me a normal life. Half a week later my life is 4x worse than it was before I prayed. I can only imagine how nice it must be to have a small friend group and a girl who cares about you I will never know the feeling.
