Best Gun?I've received some extra money from the gov due to covid situation, since i've been preparing for the lockdown for a while, i'm probably using it to get a gun, i'm tired of spending my extra money on games which dont bring me joy anymore due to depression.

So the question is: **A Revolver or a Glock?**
