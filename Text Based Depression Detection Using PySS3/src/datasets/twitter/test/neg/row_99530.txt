I just threw my keys and wallet off the bridgeNow I have no way back, literally and figuratively. I hate that my last act was to litter but it's sort of fitting since my entire existence has been a waste of space and resources on this earth. Once I finish writing this, I'll finish my drink and toss that out too. And then my phone. And then I'm next.
