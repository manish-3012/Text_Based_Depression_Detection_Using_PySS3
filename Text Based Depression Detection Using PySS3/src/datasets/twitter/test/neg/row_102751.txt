Just Hold OnHello.

I have also had suicide in my head, and for very long time. Currently I am in a path of fighting the evil forces that have ruined my life up until now and I stumbled upon a book which I think you should give a try and read.

The book is called "Just Hold On", written by Denise Haas, a woman who was also where we are. It's available in Audiobook too, so you can listen to it when you don't even have forces to get out of bed.

A piece of advice, however. In the book the woman will explain to you that Jesus Christ saved her life, but do not let prejudices rob you of salvation. Whatever it is that you believe in, it will save you. It can be Jesus, the teachings of Buddha, or even just yourself. We all believe in something, but in all believes resides the same powerful principle: The spirit of life, of evolution, of becoming greater, of overcoming suffering.

This time of the year is specially difficult for us. Many will spend these days with misery as their only companion. That is why we must stay specially strong.

Merry Christmas.
