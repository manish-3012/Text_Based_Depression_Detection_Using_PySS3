My life is mistake19 yo male, uni freshman. Sorry for mistakes. My genes are worst. I'm short , hairy,  have really bad acne , puffy face , feminine lips, weak chin, big nose and dark features while living in Eastern Europe . Right now im using acuttane, fin, rogaine , seeing dermotologist for 2 years, but its useless. I'm tired, i look so unhealthy , like homeless . I don't feel comfortable in this body, i can't imagine myself in future looking like this. I feel like men, who is trapped in this fucking small, ugly body. Being like this ruined my life, i can' t live in dorm, because of all medications, so i don't have close friends, i can't leave my house for more than one day.Im so jealous when i see attractive guy or girl,they don't need to listen disgusting words, they don't know what it feels to be rejected by everyone, i would be happy if i could be atleast normal.  Its so fucking unfair that things like genes determine your life, i really hate my parents, i wish i was never born, i hate when they ask why i don't have girlfriend or why my grades are getting worse. I'm not weak, i tried all the best i can, i tried be confident, charismatic , funny and etc and nothing worked. So why i have to suffer every day? I was strong till now, but i can't take it anymore. I wish reincarnation is real, so that means i have small chance to be more lucky. My parents have a gun, im scared , but i really want to do that. I tasted life and realized that there isn't enough place in this world for me. I will try to visit therapist, i have nothing to lose.
