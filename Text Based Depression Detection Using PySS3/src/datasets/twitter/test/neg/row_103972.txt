every day is a struggleAnd I'm not sure how much I have left to give. Literally everything in my life fucking sucks. I have an as-yet undiagnosed mental illness. I know it's BPD, but my quack psychiatrist doesn't care. He says it's too 'complicated' because I'm married and have kids. Meanwhile my life burns around me. 3 of my 4 kids have additional needs. Not profound, can't speak or walk, but rather extreme difficult behavior, they've destroyed everything we own, they've damaged our rented house, they need 24/7 supervision. 

My daughter is also feeling suicidal. She's 11. She said her older brother molested her for 4 years. We still don't know everything. The police are taking way too long to figure all of this out, so she can't go to counselling until they do. 

I have no friends. I have never been good at having friends, my entire life I was bullied, harassed, abused, until I met my husband. But even he's not 'typical'...he is autistic, so it's a challenge. I seem to always find people who are only interested in using me. The one person I had as my closest friend, who didn't use me and throw me away, ended up becoming a racist bigot who is not the person I grew up with. We're worlds apart, physically and personally. I try to make friends, but I'm a lot to handle, so I guess I scare people off. I'm very open and honest about my problems, and people can't seem to deal with that. 

I'm living in a different country to where I grew up, and honestly, I hate it here. I don't know why I thought things would be different, I lived here before, and it didn't work out. Things have gotten far worse since the last time we lived here, why did I think it would ever work? And now we're stuck here. We can't afford to move, we couldn't afford for me to have treatment back home, because I have several illnesses that wouldn't be covered by insurance since they're all considered pre-existing conditions now.

I'm in constant pain, I'm on 4 meds for pain and it's not enough. I'm not on the right medication for my mental illness, but without it I go into an even deeper pit of despair, if that's even possible. Nothing ever works out for us. I hate my neighbors, I hate having 13 houses on top of us. Literally, we are so squeezed in there are 13 different houses within a stones throw, 6 of them connected to our house or yard in some way. Even more of them in the immediate neighborhood. I hate having to drive my kids to school every day because the school near us (walking distance) is overfull and has been for years, but no one told us when we moved to this stuck up douchebag town. The school's are full of judgemental assholes, I dread going near the school gate. 

There's so much more, I could write an entire book on my shitty life. I can't get a break, ever. Nothing good ever happens. My husband took a huge pay cut to move to this stupid fucking country, with a far higher cost of living. We thought he'd be able to advance his career quickly, but that's not happened. He's vastly underpaid, but the company he works for says he's the highest paid in his team, as if that's how to measure what he's worth as an employee. They 'promoted' him, but didn't give him a pay raise, just more work. He brings it home. In the new position, he should be making an extra 20k, but the company claims they just can't afford it. Meanwhile, his coworkers are abandoning ship because the company is such a fucking mess, the ceo and cto (own the company together) have their heads up their asses and don't know how to run a fucking business. 

 I can't work, because of the kids' issues and my own. Our car is a pos that's falling apart and we can't afford to fix it. Our furniture has been destroyed by the kids, they even broke the tv, but we can't afford to replace anything. Our rent is half my husbands pay, before bills, before council tax, before anything but the fucking rent. I know I sound like I'm being materialistic, but I'm really not. I just want somewhere to sit down that isn't ripped to shreds, or actually falling apart so you sink into a giant hole. 

I'm just not sure how much more I can take. I wish I could just disappear. I wish I wouldn't fuck up my kids lives if I died, so I could just do it and not have to feel the guilt of knowing the burden I'd be putting on them. Some days I think I never should have had kids. Social services got involved, claiming they are trying to help, but all they've managed to do is cause me even more stress, anger, and sadness. They aren't helping, they are just trying to tear our family apart, spying on us, and giving us unrealistic expectations. I wish we'd never moved here. Things are so much worse since we have.
