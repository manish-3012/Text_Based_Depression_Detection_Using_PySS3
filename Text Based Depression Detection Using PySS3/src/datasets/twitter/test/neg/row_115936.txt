hopeless, worthless and rdy 2 die28/m

my life is pathetic. i'm short, fat and depressed all the time. I have serious self loathing. i'm so fucking irritated that I even exist. I think the only reason i'm still alive is because i don't want to hurt my family. i think the only reason i haven't put a gun to my head and blown my fucking brains out, is because i dont' want to cause them pain. But it's getting to the point that it won't even matter if i'm dead, because, well, i'll be dead.

they know i'm suicidal. I talked to them about it. I stopped taking my prozac and now the lows are even lower. I stopped taking prozac because it made me feel like a even bigger loser in life. 

i have no future. no women want me. it was pretty pathetic really. i tried online dating, contacted several hundred women in my state (to increase my chances) i didn't get one response. I deleted my account in shame and embarrassment.

every accomplishment i have achieved is nothing worth praising. i've accepted my lot in life, and well, it sucks. i've never had any talents and everything I try I suck at. why live another 40 years of this fucking joke life? 

the depression is worsening. excessive sleep, insomnia and not wanting to sleep. I stay up thinking about ways I can kill myself. I search all the signs on the web and I have all the signs of a suicidal person. I'll probably use whatever money i have saved to take one last vacation then after i'll just end it. Somewhere remote where no one will find my body until it's too decomposed to identify.
