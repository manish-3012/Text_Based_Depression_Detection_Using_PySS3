I need people to talk to, theres no one on facebook that I can take seriously to talk to.Im 27 years old and I consider myself to be anti social, I have 2 degrees in engineering and bio (dont ask long story) Im definitely not good with woman at all, I blame it on my strict learning habits, throughout my college life. 

Ive been rejected by a girl that  I was genuinely affectionate to
 for a different guy 

Ive literally downed a half bottle of grey goose and took my zoloft and sleeping pills.
