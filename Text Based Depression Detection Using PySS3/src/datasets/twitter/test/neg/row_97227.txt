I desperately want to dieItâ€™s 2:33am here... Iâ€™ve scrolled through my phone for hours now hoping to find someone I could reach out to and I can find a million reasons why not to call any of them... 

I hate being guilted by family about what I feel... I hate seeing the sadness in my motherâ€™s face and her telling me she wouldnâ€™t know what to do if I did something like that.

Words feel empty. I donâ€™t see much for myself in the future. 

I feel alone and this huge emptiness inside me that Iâ€™ve had for forever now (most my life). An emptiness I tried filling with drinking, partying, fitness, sex, and toxic relationships. None help. Itâ€™s always there.

I had dreams. But I donâ€™t know if they were for myself or what I think people expected of me. 

I feel hopeless. I feel like this emptiness will always be there. Itâ€™ll numb a bit and always surface... I want to not be afraid to die at my own hand.
