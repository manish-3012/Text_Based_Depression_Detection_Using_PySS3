helpIve been replaced by someone, i feel like garbage. Am i not good enough? Am i not worth fighting for? I thought she wasn't not allowed anymore, i thought she couldn't handle being in a relationship anymore, i thought she wanted to be alone, i thought she was depressed, but it was all shallow lies, shallow lies to get rid of me, shallow lies in order for her to be free of me, so she can be with someone else

I just want to die, i just want to end my life, i just want to be happy, I can't stand feeling empty anymore
