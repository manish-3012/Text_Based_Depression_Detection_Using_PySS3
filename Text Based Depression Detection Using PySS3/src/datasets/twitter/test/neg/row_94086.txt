Tinnitus - try theseI have tinnitus too. Iâ€™m 38 , it started 4 mths ago. Iâ€™m still waiting to see my eNT doc. I have hearing loss as well. I donâ€™t wear hearing aid.  For me , it started when my dad passed away. I think itâ€™s stress related I think. Iâ€™ve notice when I move my jaw, thereâ€™s a lot of cracking noise in my ear on the bth sides. I wonder if that has anything to with it. Oh well, I canâ€™t jus sit here n let my life be miserable. Iâ€™m trying to stay positive. I have been trying few things here n there.
When I take reactine a night before, my my ringing in the ears suppresses the next morning. So try that at your risk.  Iâ€™ve been taking 2-3 pills a week it works most of the time. 

When I consume too much sodium and or sugar, I notice my ringing spikes 

Try taking steam and or ginkgo biloba. Iâ€™m trying the ginkgo biloba now , itâ€™s been 1 week so far. Iâ€™m gonna try it out for 90 days n see what happens. 

At least tinnitus is not life threatening
