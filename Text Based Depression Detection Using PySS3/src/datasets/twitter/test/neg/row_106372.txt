I just need helpIn the past Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts. Iâ€™ve always struggled with depression and anxiety. My depression is kicking my ass right now but I donâ€™t wanna commit suicide, I just want help. Iâ€™m afraid to go to a crisis center because I canâ€™t afford 1) to miss work 2) I donâ€™t have health insurance 3) Iâ€™m afraid to be disconnected with my life, to be pulled away and admitted. But I want help
