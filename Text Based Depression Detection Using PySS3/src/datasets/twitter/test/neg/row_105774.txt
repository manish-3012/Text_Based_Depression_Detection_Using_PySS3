Recent suicide, Friend talking like she is going under. Am I going next?My mother recently killed herself for understandable reasons. Unrealistic debt, a recent divorce  and a failing buisness. I don't know what to honestly think about the whole situation.. We were never very close but she was still my mother.. im just very confused. Anyways my older friend recently moved out of state for college and she is not doing well. Her past holds her back and she doesn't feel like she will ever get over it.. i've gave her as many words of encouragment as I can possibly think of. She is very sad and it only got worse since she moved away. I dont want to lose her as she is the only person I can talk too... I've told her to get help but that only upsets her more. 


Now... for me. Obviously losing my mother wasnt easy on me although it wasnt particularly hard on me either. I am under 18 and now living with my grandparents (father killed himself when I was an infant) and they're getting old. They do not have much longer left and I feel as though I am a burden to them especially with their daughters recent passing. I've had to stay up many nights listening to my grandfather sob as quietly as he can in the bathroom. I've seen the look in their eyes. They realize they are going soon and they feel bad. They feel bad because their daughter but they're also worried about their grandchildren. I've always (attempted) to be somewhat of a father figure to my younger siblings but growing up wasnt as easy as it could have been. Mother was gone for schooling during the day and worked a shit job during the night. I raised them for 6 years by myself pretty much. She would shop and buy us clothes when she had the money, I would cook and wake up to send the little ones off to school in the morning. This wore on me and I turned into something I never wanted to be, an abusive older brother. It wasnt fucking easy raising them.. throwing away my youth because my shit head mother abandoned us for 6 years. She had a job under that degree for one year! Nothing but debt and unfulfilled dreams. I felt like the spotlight was on me and I hated it. I never felt attached to my brothers but here I was, caring for them 24/7 because she couldnt do shit. I raised them well and they know where they stand. When I look at them I just cant help but seeing them cowering in a corner me with belt in hand. Why the fuck would I do this? What the hell am I supposed to do when I get older? Family re unions and all that shit. I doubt if i'll ever even have a girlfriend.. thats the only thing that I honestly want to live for.. I love kids and I want nothing more then to have a couple kids of my own. I could have a second chance.. watch them grow up. Nothing excites me more.. I often worry though. Old tradition never dies and I feel like that anger will come back.. I felt so superior when they would cower and whimper. I dont like it.. but.. fuck. I dont know. I dont know where im going with this post. I dont know what the reason is. Im just worried about my friend more then anything. If she goes I go. If I go im sure she'll go. I've had my neck in the noose before and it feels great. Knowing the unknown. Death is the ultimate restart you know? Enter the void with no chance of coming back. I like to believe in rebirth, a second chance. I am very young and I just.. I want to know there are people out there. People who understand, even just a bit. I want people to tell me no. I get closer to doing it every day and I see almost no reason not too. I dont know. Why does it have to be like this?
