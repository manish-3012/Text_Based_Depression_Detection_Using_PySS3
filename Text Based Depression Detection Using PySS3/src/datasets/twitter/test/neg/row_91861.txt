I think thats itI (19m) was supposed to do it by the end of the year but i might do it pretty soon. I just dont understand but its all i have in mind. Im upset about everything. Even minor things make me angry.

I am not poor, nor have any mental illnesses. I'm bad at school because i never do my homeworks. I got no self confidence. Never had a girlfriend cause im too shy. I an ugly and I dont know how to change. I lost around 20lbs by making myself puke. But i recently regained everything eventhough i never stopped.

I came to a point I dont even care about the effect it will have on my friends and family. I figured i wont be there anyway ;). I know this propably wont be read but I just wanted to get it off my chest.
