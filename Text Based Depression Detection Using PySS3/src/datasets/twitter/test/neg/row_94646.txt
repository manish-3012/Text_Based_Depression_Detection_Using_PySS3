I should be grateful for this lifeI know I should be grateful for this life. I have access to water, food, shelter, clean clothes, electricity, and an education. I talk to my mom, dad, and sister often and despite some issues in the past I would say (\*knock on wood) our relationship has been improving. BUT HOLY SHIT I think about suicide so much it's like a joke now. I am severely lacking in physical and emotional intimacy with others and society and have been an outside observer for many years. I think of suicide as the first option when faced with any difficulty because I don't have much of a support system but then I have a mental image of my parents crying over my dead body and just can't. Recently, I've been justifying not committing suicide and just living and doing what I want and maintaining hope that I can to reach my goals but I don't feel like anything is changing day to day. Like what if I don't reach my dream and end up alone while I watch people in this world move on and do everything that's supposed to happen like get a job and get married. Then suicide would be the only option. Why am I like this? It's not supposed to go this way for me I'm supposed to be normal and average but I don't even have those basic things such as relationships. I really want my life to change or just to go away honestly.
