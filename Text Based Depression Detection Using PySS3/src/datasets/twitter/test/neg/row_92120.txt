I'm sick and tired of this lifeI don't get why people want to me to live. I'm worthless and just don't want to be around anymore. I plan to try to hang myself again when I get home from work. Maybe this time I will get it right. I'm struggling with bills. No one loves me and I'm too scared to tell my therapist because I can't go inpatient again or I lose my job
