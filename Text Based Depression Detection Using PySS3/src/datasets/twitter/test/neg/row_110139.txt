Not wanting to live but relationship gives me no choice.I feel so stuck and alone. I am in a very caregiving relationship due to my mental health and disability needs. I feel like Iâ€™ve become such a burden on my SO because of how angry and annoyed they get when I bring up that Iâ€™m suicidal. They mention the hospital any time I do something remotely knowing Iâ€™m afraid of the hospital from past ha experiences. I just wish one day Iâ€™ll stop breathing and stop being such an issue.
