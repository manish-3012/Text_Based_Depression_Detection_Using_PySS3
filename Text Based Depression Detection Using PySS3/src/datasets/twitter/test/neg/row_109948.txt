Done againYeah Iâ€™ve said this before and maybe this wonâ€™t be the last time but Iâ€™m just done. I donâ€™t have the energy to fix how broken Iâ€™ve become mentally and physically. Iâ€™m years away even if I did somehow have the energy to. 

Itâ€™s clear at this point Iâ€™m never going to get a chance at anything and Iâ€™d rather just stop now. Iâ€™m not one for more empty words.

Bye.
