hyper fixated on committing suicidei got out of the psychiatric hospital less than a week ago and i feel like a zombie. i don't really think about anything anymore besides killing myself. i am still going through life and fulfilling my responsibilities, and i'm in a good place right now, but i just don't think i like living. i refrain from reaching out for support because i feel as though i am being ungrateful, but again, i just don't want to live anymore. i have the means to do so at my disposal but i don't want to traumatize anyone who might come across my lifeless corpse, nor do i want to traumatize my family and friends as i have burdened them enough already, but i do not know what to do. i feel numb and lifeless and worthless and i think nobody realizes that they would in fact be better off without me
