I was hereWhatâ€™s life? Whatâ€™s my purpose ? ... is reincarnation real? I honestly feel like life is a game literally life is a stimulation ... if I kill myself do I get a another one like when Iâ€™m playing GTA ? idk, man Iâ€™m just not a naturally happy person. I canâ€™t quite figure out what made me this way... I tend to not have a good memory of my past maybe my past was so fucked up my mind blocked it out ..: I do have vague memories and each of them are either me feeling bullied, neglects awkward, lame just a pure weirdo !!! I really just want to start over. I failed this life ... Iâ€™m horrible to my family like I have these manic moments where I completely lose my mind and once I come back I have to deal with the consequences of whatever has taken place and that may be the most haunting shit ever .... Iâ€™m no good to my family to no one Iâ€™m a liability. I know one I die ppl will be sad cry two weeks later Iâ€™ll be forgotten. I have no purpose Iâ€™m nothing to nobody. I hate it here! God I love you believe in you and trust you whole heartedly... I just donâ€™t understand my oaths an journey ... whatâ€™s the reason ? I wish COVID wouldâ€™ve killed me so I wonâ€™t have to continuously think about suicide everyday! Why does my kind work
Like this Iâ€™m so misunderstood sometimes I donâ€™t even understand myself? Who am I what am I why me !! Idk life is weird. Hopefully one day Iâ€™ll have the courage to end it all ! One day I can find a affective way to to kill myself successfully ? Idk man my mind sways some days I canâ€™t phantom the thought Of suicide most days thatâ€™s all that consumes me. Idk idk
