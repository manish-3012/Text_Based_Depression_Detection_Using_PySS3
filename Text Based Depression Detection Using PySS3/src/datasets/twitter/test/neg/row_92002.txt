I can't do it anymore.I am ready to check out. Everything important to me has been lost as a result of my own actions. I've lied to people who loved me most about what I needed money for, because I was too ashamed to admit I couldn't get myself out of homelessness. I can't find fulfilling employment despite my education. I have a violent home life with a narcissistic grandmother and her thieving adopted kid, who is of course being abused  by that narcissistic grandmother.  

I don't have a healthy support system. I don't have the resources to get healthy. My life is just one bad break after another that results in me making it even worse with how I react, and I really can't do it anymore. I don't want to die, but I need to. I wake up depressed that I woke up. I cannot continue this way.
