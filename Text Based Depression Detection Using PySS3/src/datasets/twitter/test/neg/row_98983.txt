Friday nightToday, I got a huge bonus for doing good work over the past few months. I went out at night to Fry's and picked myself up a Wii U. I set it up at around 11pm (still living with parents btw, and I'm 29 years old) and launched Super Mario 3D World. The screen asked that three other players should join in.

At that point I realized my situation, no friends, no girlfriend (never had one), still playing video games while living in my parents house on a friday night (while my parents are asleep). It clicked and I was ready to kill myself at that point.

I'm still having anxiety over this thought. I turned off my wii and here I am before I try to get some sleep.
