I am thinking about being institutionalized but I need adviceI am 19 and I have never been diagnosed with anything beyond major depression when I was 12. I was institutionalized twice when I was 12 and aside from a few rough patches when I was 14, I have been self-harm free and completely independent and happy with my life. 

But about a month ago I think, everything started going downhill fast. I didnâ€™t know it was possible to deteriorate so quickly without warning or reason. I cry every single night, I dread going to bed, I wake up and I feel awful. I am constantly on the verge of tears, I keep zoning out while driving, Iâ€™m having what I guess are intrusive thoughts about ways to attempt suicide constantly. But on the bright side I donâ€™t want to cut myself, I just feel like punching things and drinking.

On Sunday I tried to stop all the pain for a little and I spent $60 on 2 movies just to stay distracted. I actually had a really good night and it was amazing I felt so happy and light and whenever I remembered a problem I would just say weâ€™ll deal with that tomorrow. Then Monday or yesterday came and everything went to hell again. 
 
A summary of my problems:

My boss forgot to pay me before he went on vacation and Iâ€™m sad because all the saving Iâ€™ve been doing to build up my bank account is getting destroyed. Iâ€™m worried about failing my math class because Iâ€™m 3 weeks behind on homework because my professor makes all the online home work due 8 hours after class so I never have time to get it done. If I donâ€™t get a C in that class it wont transfer to the college I was accepted too. Also if my GPA goes below a 2.0 I get rejected. My mom pays for my classes so she keeps asking me if my homeworkâ€™s done and how are my classes and I donâ€™t have the heart to tell her Iâ€™m gonna fail. My family keeps asking if I even wanna be in college and of course I do, I want a degree, I want to party and make new friends, I want to learn and be successful but I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. I am also fucking terrified Iâ€™m going to be diagnosed with an actual mental disorder other than major depression. My grandfather had severe bipolar and my uncle had paranoid schizophrenia so severe Iâ€™ve never met him because heâ€™s been locked up in California since the 90s. My father and his other sibling absolutely do not about him and I am scared my dad will be upset if thereâ€™s something that severely wrong with me. 

I think I need to go to the hospital but I donâ€™t want to be kicked out of school, I donâ€™t want my life thrown completely off track even though Iâ€™m not sure I can save it. I wanna be alive, I love living but itâ€™s so awful.
