I'm a selfish stupid lazy coward.Im nearly 25. This year is my last year in uni. I'm doing my thesis this year. Just my thesis. I did all the additional classes last year. I'm doing a year that's 1/3rd the load of the normal student. And i'm in the easy 'industrial' part of engineering. The light version. It's halfway through the year. I should have half a thesis by now. I don't. I'm stuck on step 1 of tutorial 1 of part 1 of the first thing in the list of things i need to do to finish the first quarter of my thesis. I'm stupid. I'm lazy. I'm a wreck. No wonder my thesis partner jumped ship after two weeks. I'm a sinking ship. A stupid incompetent old antisocial friendless dumb brainless ship. 

**So why does this bother me?**

I'm selfish. Because I should be grateful and I'm not. I should be grateful i have a home, sort of. A family, sort of. Two friends, sort of. But I'm not. Because I don't want to continue my life with this shame hanging over me. The shame of failing to finish a fucking easy thesis in an easy year in an easy version of a normal education. How the fuck am I going to talk to people later? How the fuck am I going to sit in a solicitation interview, with my fucking bachelor's degree, explaining how I took 2 extra years of time to get it, and that I couldn't finish a dumb fucking thesis, given 3 times as much time to work on it than other students?


**pathetic self-pity and self-hatred part. ignore it**

I'm stupid, i'm unworthy, i'm embarassing, i'm shameful, i'm useless, and i'm too fucking ungrateful, and too fucking ashamed to live with this backstory. I wish i died in that car accident I had as a child. My dad would be ashamed of me if he were alive. My mom already is. I'm ashamed of myself. I'm weak and stupid and childish. All i can think about is how i hope there's an afterlife because I just want to reset my life.

**conclusion**

I cant turn back time. I cant make myself smarter. I can't bear the shame of reality, of the facts. My past is unchangeable, my present is embarrassing, my future is pathetic and painful. I want to be selfish and just do myself in somewhere quietly in a forest. 

**how does this concern you?**

I don't expect anyone to change my mind, i don't want to change my mind, I probably won't anyway. I just thought it was proper decorum to mention it on here. (Edit: and this is probably just a pathetic grasp for attention. Which gives me even more reason to be ashamed.) That way, I've reached out, and nobody must feel bad for having 'failed' to notice my intentions. I did reach out, wasn't able to turn myself around, nobody to blame, that's that. My worries gone. World better. But mostly my worries gone. I'll feel no more shame. 

**i'm just a bad egg, it's ok**

I took the easy way out and avoided living a life of shame, that I rightly deserve for my incompetence. I fucked up, and refuse to take the consequences. Sorry. I'm a coward. Taking the easy way out. Don't blame yourself. My opinions won't change. Reality won't change. Some people just cannot be saved. It's fine. We can't all be the courageous hero of the story. Just a fact of life. 

**done**

There. Reached out. No one can blame themselves now. Just a guy who fucked up big time and can't face the consequences. A regular old stock-market-crash building-jumper who left a note. [There it is.](https://i.imgur.com/Cj3bVDh.gif)
