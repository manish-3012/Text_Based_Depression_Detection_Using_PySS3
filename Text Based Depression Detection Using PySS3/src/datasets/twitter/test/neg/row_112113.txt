People trying to push me towards doing it?Throw away just because Iâ€™m worried thereâ€™s info on my account that could lead to me.  

Itâ€™s gotten really, really bad the past couple of weeks. Iâ€™m just resigned to it now. Iâ€™ve written my notes and just finalising my plan. I donâ€™t think anybody around me really knows how I feel, I mean they know Iâ€™m struggling and how bad things have been but I donâ€™t think they know Iâ€™m planning to take my life. But it feels like maybe they do and theyâ€™re encouraging it. Iâ€™m a complete drain on everyone around me so I couldnâ€™t blame them for wanting me to end it, and I know Iâ€™ll be doing them a favour in the end. In a way itâ€™s kind of helped because if they want me to go maybe itâ€™ll be easier for them to recover after. I hope so. Sorry, I think I started this post with the intention of asking a question but I guess I just wanted to vent.
