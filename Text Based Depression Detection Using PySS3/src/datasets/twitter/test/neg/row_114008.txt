It doesn't seem worth it anymoreFirst off...I'm really really sorry for even posting this. I actually really hate myself for posting here. I feel like I'm just wasting space and people's time here. All I can say is I don't want to do this anymore. No one cares that I'm hurting this much and they shrug it off. No one would notice if I disappeared, people already forget about me after a few days. When I try to talk to people I get called stupid for being this upset. I guess it's wrong to be this upset. I just want to disappear and make it easier for the people I care about because I'm obviously bothering them with me feeling this way. But it's not their problem, why should they care anyway? I was never worth it to begin with.

The last time I tried to kill myself, no one cared when they found out. It was shrugged off like everything else. When I try to talk to someone, I'm told to "not bring up things like that" or to "forget about it." How can I forget about it when every morning I wake up I'm upset that I woke up? How can I forget about it when I'm reminded every day how no one wants me? How is *any* of this worth it? Maybe everyone would be better off if I just finally disappeared.
