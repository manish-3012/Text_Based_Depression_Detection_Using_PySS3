isnâ€™t it weird how alone we can feel?for me, I know that there are people I can talk to but the thing is-I donâ€™t like discussing my pain. I donâ€™t like talking about things that remind me of past mistakes or regrets. I know that people say to live your life without any regrets, and to that person I say fuck you. itâ€™s okay to have done things in your life that you arenâ€™t proud of. they are called lessons. itâ€™s just difficult to feel so much all the time, and then have to fake a smile to go to work. 
â€”when does it end.
