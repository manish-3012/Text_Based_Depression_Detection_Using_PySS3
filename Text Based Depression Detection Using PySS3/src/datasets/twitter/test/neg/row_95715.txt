FML: Probably be out of a job, unable to drive, $50k+ in debt with no way out, and alone in a strange city soon. Thinking dark thoughts.Left mt condo to move cities so I can be with my 3-hour away LDR girlfriend of 2 years. After a few weeks, she says she's too busy for a relationship and needs it to just be FWB a few times a month.

Two-years ago I rear-ended a guy when he slammed on his breaks for a pedestrian that jaywalked in front of him. Unknown to me, my liability insurance had been cancelled by my provider since I'd let my general membership fee lapse (it's for AMA, like a AAA membership but they do insurance too). They sent me a letter before they cancelled it stating that I needed to renew my membership or they'd cancel it. I did just that, but I called their general membership phone number and not the insurance number in the letter. 

Talked to a lawyer and since my pink card had expired, nothing can be done about their mistake. The accident was a fairly low-speed collision, there was barely any damage to their car, but now they're seeking  about $50k in medical, lost wages, etc. I have piles of debt from school, and the only asset I have is a 1/3 share in the condo, split with my parents, with a mortgage that puts it basically underwater. And in Canada, once judgement is set against me, the Uninsured Motorists fund will cancel my driver's license, meaning I won't be able to get to work aside from a 1-2 hour bus ride there and then again back. And given I'm in inside sales set to go outside, if me license is cancelled I can't advance to a position where I'd be able to pay them back. Even if I declare bankruptcy, I'll never be able to drive until I pay off the debt, with interest.

So now I'm alone, in a strange city with barely any friends, trying to learn at this new job, dealing with lawyers, knowing that I'm probably going to be majorly screwed by Christmas. 2013 looks set to be the year my life burns. Been having dark thoughts, thinking about getting benzo's for insomnia and making it easy.
