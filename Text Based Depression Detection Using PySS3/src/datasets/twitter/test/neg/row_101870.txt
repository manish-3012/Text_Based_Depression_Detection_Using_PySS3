Iâ€™m going to kill myself before I drag everyone else down with meIâ€™ve been sliding into depression for god knows how many years now. Iâ€™ve really noticed it and sought any kind of help or at least took effort to remedy it within the past two years.

None of it has helped. 4 therapists, 3 medications, improving my lifestyle, friends, girlfriend, getting a better job, moving out, I basically achieved everything I wanted to by this age. And still I spend my 8 hours of work fantasizing about suicide.

Just this past weekend I saw a new therapist who said that he canâ€™t help me if Iâ€™m unwilling to put the work in. Well Iâ€™m not, Iâ€™ve got enough on my plate already.

I do have a support system, but that doesnâ€™t seem to help either. Iâ€™m starting to find that Most people annoy me, even the ones I used to like. And theyâ€™re still helping me, whether out of true empathy or because they donâ€™t want to have to take care of me when I hit rock bottom.

But why should they bother? Itâ€™s not going to work until I want to get better, until I want to participate in this shitty life and the daily grind punctuated by occasional bits of fun. 

Everyone laughs when I say my only real goal is not to have to work, but honestly, thatâ€™s the condition on which I stay alive. But I canâ€™t do another 20-25 years of this. Iâ€™m already worse off than I was a year ago when I started this job and moved out.

Also, every time I do get some short lived motivation to fix things, people assume Iâ€™m normal again and expect me to fix everything Iâ€™ve broken in my life. I canâ€™t run this gauntlet of ever increasing amounts of misery and work.

As scary as standing next to the proverbial edge is, itâ€™s all I think about most of the day, and Iâ€™m just waiting for the rest of the good to filter out of my life so I can finally end it. Hopefully people donâ€™t invest too much time, money, and energy into keeping my current shell of a human alive for much longer.
