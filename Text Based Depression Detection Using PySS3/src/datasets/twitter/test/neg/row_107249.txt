Parents.... :/i look at my parents and all they do is complain about how crappy there lives are and how i wont be able to get into college and they'll never pay for college if i keep my grades the way the are (all As.. 2 subjects i'm advancedin ... and 1 B... i'm trying as hard as i can..) i'm also in 6th grade... it's just gonna get harder and harder and they also complain about how i ruin there lives and how i'm always mean to them and horrible and a hastle. I tryed telling someone about it, but then they told my parents right away and my parent just tried convincing me they werent doing anything. me and my mom get in fights at least once or twice a day... if we fight in the mornings i usually dont wanna go home and dread getting off the bus, if it's at night i usually lock myself up in my room and dont talk to them for the rest of the night. I'm really jelous of all my other friends, i heard one of them talking with there mom one day and they were discusing how they've only gotten in one fight. EVER. I'm also adopted (i was adopted at birth so i've only been in one family and i've never known my biological birth mother) and i've always wondered what life would have been like if she didnt give me away, i feel like she would have loved me somewhat more because i'm actually related to her. but idk, maybe it is me and maybe i'm just a horrible person.
