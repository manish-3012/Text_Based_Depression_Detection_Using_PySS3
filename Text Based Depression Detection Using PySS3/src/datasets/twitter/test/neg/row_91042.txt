I'm thinking of checking out...I've been depressed for quite some time. Drinking to excess and making very bad choices. I've been feeling that my husband doesn't love me anymore.  

I got drunk made a huge mistake and ruined not only my life, but the life (and marriage) of a dear friend. 

My own life hangs in the balance. If I could, I would off myself - but I am a coward. I'm sorry for the hurt I have caused everyone - especially my husband. 

TL;DR I fucked up my life and a friend's life while drunk and now I wish I could end it all.
