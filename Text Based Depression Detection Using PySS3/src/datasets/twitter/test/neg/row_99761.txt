There's no help for meI just called everyone on my contacts list and no one picked up. For months I've tried and tried to get people to hang out with me. I haven't been able to hang out with anyone since 2017. I'm touch deprived and deprived of social interaction as well.

I'm currently looking for a new job since I got laid off in June. Been through 16 rounds of interviews and 2 rounds of pre-employment tests, no offers. I've actually been pretty close. I made it to the 8th and final round of Google. I've also interviewed at other top companies like Two Sigma (rejected after 3rd round) and Facebook (rejected after HR call).

Already tried therapy. Switched therapists trying to one that works. None of them did.
