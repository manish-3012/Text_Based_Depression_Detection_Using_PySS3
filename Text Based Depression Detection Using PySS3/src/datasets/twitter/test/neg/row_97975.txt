It won't ever get better...I just can't take it anymore. I'm 26 and have been thinking about killing myself since i was 14. Of course there's been ups and downs but the overall situation never changed. 

I have a plan on how i'm going to do it.
Honestly, I don't want to die, i just want it to get better but i lost hope. I would like to go to a doctor but i don't even have the balls to make an appointment. I thought about calling the suicide hotline but i'm too anxious. I also can't talk to my friends because i don't want them to feel bad because of me...
