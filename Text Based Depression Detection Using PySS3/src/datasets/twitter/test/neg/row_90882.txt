bummerWhats up. Been a while, stuff was mostly good for the last year.. but right now with trying to graduate from uni and some serious shit hitting the fan at work, I'm really tempted to just take the easy path you know.. all the bullshit is not worth it - financially I'm not even able to afford a home due to a price hike in real estate.. so what's the point? Going to work for no apparent reason only to pay rent and eat? Yeah, there is no point in keep on living.
