Not to join the meme bandwagon, but my cat saved meMy father passed back in September, after a quick and angry bout of cancer. Our cat (his cat), Boris, was devastated at his leaving. Losing hair,  losing weight, general aloofness (from a formerly VERY affectionate pet).

I have fought depression and general anxiety for my entire life. It has gotten worse since my dad's death in September.  Cancer took him hard and fast. The other day,  I was ready to end it. Hang myself in the garage, to be specific. 

Then, that fuzzy little fucker (Boris) forced his way into the garage. He's not allowed in the garage. I dropped my planned activity (killing myself) to get him back into the house. And those 2 minutes saved me. His fur is growing back. He's starting to love on us again. 

That was when I realized that it's not worth it. Fuck all the family that would miss me, apparently. It's my dad's cat, needing me more than anyone ever has, that brought me back to reality. 

Your life is worth saving, my friends. Please don't underestimate who will miss you when you're gone.
