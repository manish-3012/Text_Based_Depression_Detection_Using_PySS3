I don't want to die but that's where things seem to be heading.I don't want to die. I don't want to go, I don't want to leave all of the people I care about behind. But I feel like that's where I'm headed. It's that same feeling when you wake up in the morning and the bed is nice and comfy. Maybe you are even a bit sick. You tell yourself "I don't want to get up. I don't want to go to class. I don't want to go to work." But no matter how many times you tell yourself this, you know that you are eventually going to get up and do what needs to be done.

 I feel like that right now. Part of me has taken it as an inevitability and is waiting for the time. I find myself making lose plans. Part of me is fighting back, trying to throw up as many safeguards as I can.  When the suicidal part is in control, I find myself slipping in messages of "help me" into conversations, but nobody ever listens and nobody comes to help. When my rational mind is in control, I find myself unconsciously making small preparations.

 This war in my head is really tearing me apart. I can't do anything at times, I just lie/sit there or mechanically go through whatever needs to happen. We had a big career fair at my school this week and I couldn't even manage to go there because the depression hit so hard, even though I know that I need to go because I need to get a job for the next summer. If I even make it to next summer.  

I'm not making a positive change in the world and my existence only hurts people. Any good I do like with the guy from last week I just feel like I'm attoning for the terrible things that I've done. but I know that some things about me won't and can't change, so I know I will hurt people in the future.

I'm writing this as someone with some sense of control right now. I know that all of these thoughts, including the suicidal ones, are mine. It is me and I am it. I just don't know how much longer I get to be myself.
