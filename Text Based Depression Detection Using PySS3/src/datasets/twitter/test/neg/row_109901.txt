I have a brain disease and my family is going to kill me by neglecting the treatment for my disease5 years ago I developed a terminal neurodegenerative condition and my family began to cover up its existence and misdiagnose me as a schizophrenic.

My doctors have all told me that it is real after diagnosing autonomic dysfunction an extremely painful disease which is physical torture.

For years now my family is pretending the disease isnâ€™t real and they have begun trying to murder me and hasten my death every single day.

They try to cover up the existence of the disease and claim it is schizophrenia and they are always trying to abuse me and frame me as a behavior problem to get me put on a 14 day hold in the hospital.

I know for certain that there are plenty of people with brain damage and neurodegenerative disease that live happily with their families, so I am unsure why my family has decided to murder me by neglecting the disease and trying to hasten death.

They abuse me and frame me as having problems with aggression so that they can get a 5150 14 day hold.

Itâ€™s all manipulation I am not aggressive but my family constantly provokes me into becoming aggressive.

They are just murders I am not a behavior problem or aggressive I am being intentionally abused in order to frame me as being aggressive.

I have been arguing like this for years now because my mother is always trying to abuse me  and frame it as a mental health crisis.

It seems like there is nothing I can do to make my family love me, they have been trying to kill me for 5 years now so itâ€™s probably impossible to stop their homicidal obsession.
