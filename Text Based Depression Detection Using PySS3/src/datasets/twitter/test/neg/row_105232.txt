I fucked upI fucked up so fucking bad.

I had heatstroke yesterday combined with a panic attack and made a stupid post on the dysfunctional family subreddit. Had to remove it. That voice in my head wonâ€™t stop. Itâ€™s been going on virtually nonstop since yesterday afternoon. Iâ€™m starting to believe what it says.

I donâ€™t want anyone to save me. I donâ€™t want anyone to reach out to me this time. I fucked up bc I wasnâ€™t lucid and now everyone thinks Iâ€™m a liar. This site is the only real resource I have bc I donâ€™t have access to any suicide hotlines, and Iâ€™ve just lost all credibility. It doesnâ€™t matter what I do, I always dig my own grave. 

I think itâ€™s about time I do that, literally. 

I donâ€™t know if I should hold on for my 20th birthday. Itâ€™s a month from now and I feel like Iâ€™ve already wasted my life. 

Gaslighted and manipulated to high heaven since I was an infant, physically, verbally and sexually assaulted on multiple occasions, coming to terms with being trans and disabled and now these fucking episodes where I find myself believing that a God of Death is telling me to kill myself. 

Why didnâ€™t anyone do something to prevent this? 

All anyone does is link me to fucking phone numbers and tell me to see a therapist but I CANT

I just feel too angry and sad and bitter

I donâ€™t want any help, itâ€™ll just make me look like Iâ€™m faking it all

Please, everyone, just forget me

Iâ€™m a piece of shit and Iâ€™m not worth remembering
