Too many things to think about.Seems like the more I trudge along towards the greener grass, the further away it seems. Every day I find myself wondering, "what if I did it right now?". I've never been as worried for my own life as I am now, and that's bothersome to me. My brain wants me to live, but my heart just wants it to be over with. I long every night when I go to sleep, to not wake up in the morning. I was just fired from my job under strenuous circumstances, and everything is pooling to a head. Do I have a plan? No. Do I want it anyway? More than ever. I really just need someone to talk to. I don't have a crutch. Please.
