Can't drive without considering crashingFor the past few months I've considered myself to be suicidal, but I never actually thought I could go through with it, because I love my family too much to hurt them like that.  My biggest problem is that I want to die, but I feel too guilty to go through with it, but I'm scared that I will anyway.  Well, usually I live in a big city and take the bus everywhere, but I'm home for Christmas break, and therefore drive everywhere with a car that I keep at home.  

Every time that I get in my car and am driving alone, I consider crashing; just finding a brick wall and driving into it as fast as I can, or crashing into a lamp post, anything.  I'm afraid that I'll do it, but I'm also afraid that I'll do it and end up disabled instead of dead.

I just don't really know how to stop these thoughts while I'm home, because I can't help not driving.
