bored with lifeHey guys

I'm a college student, and I've really never had a lot of luck with making friends. I even dropped out of college for a year because I was so depressed, mostly because I had no one to talk to or hang out with. When I finally enrolled in university again, I ended up making friends. I made the best friends anyone could possible ask for, and that school year was honestly the best year of my life. The bad news is that they were international exchange students, and have since gone back home. Now I'm back at square one. I have no friends. Whenever I'm not working, I'm just sitting at home staring at my phone. I hate my life. I have nothing to live for, no one to hang out with. Now I constantly think about death, like if I'm cutting food with a knife or I'm on a bridge, I just think about how I could easily kill myself. The constant feelings of dread never stop. I'll probably just drink myself into a coma, and hopefully alcohol poisoning will kill me.
