I desperately need empathyEver since three weeks ago, when my husband finally admitted that he's not sure he wants to have a family with me, I've been devastated.  He says it's the stress of my 13-yo son and his ADHD and OCD that makes him feel no desire to have a baby with me.  Before we married I was clear that I wanted more children and he agreed.  I feel betrayed as much as if he had cheated on me.

I'm trying my best to empathize with his feelings.  However, he has, over the last six months, steadily withdrawn from me and my son.  We've had one counseling appointment last week.  He is clearly uncomfortable opening up.

Meanwhile, in the last three weeks, I've spent more and more days at home alone crying.  We live abroad and, quite literally, I have no one to talk to.  I can't even call my mom because of her work and the time difference.

My heart is breaking.  I feel like my life is a farce.  I raised my son alone for 11 years.  I had no financial help and very little support from my family.  It was a lonely life.  To top it off, I have been raped and sexually assaulted twice in my adult life.  I just want to be a good wife and a good mother, devoted to making a loving home and my heart feels as though my husband has torn my heart from my chest and left on the floor to die.

I'm tired and very scared.  Even when things were bleak before, I had an internal flame of hope--suicide was not a concern.  Last night, I thanked God that we don't have a gun because I feel the temptation of suicide for the first time.

I am full of emotional misery that I can't ease.

More than anything, I need to feel a sense of empathy from someone...at this point, anyone.
