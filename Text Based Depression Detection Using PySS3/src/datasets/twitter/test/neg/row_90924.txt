"It will get better"? I don't even care. It's just not worth it.TL;DR: Even when you expect nothing, this world still finds a way to f...ck you up. Some days will be better, some will be as shitty as this day again. So why fight through the shitty days just to wait for the few less shitty ones? It's not worth it. 


Longer version: It just... doesn't matter. At least not for me. I've been working my ass off to help other people for my whole life, I always put others first. I even chose a career that involves helping people. But a few months ago, I met someone who - for the first time ever - made me think that maybe, just maybe, I could have something beautiful in my life, too. I thought that maybe, after years and years of giving, this world might actually give something back, something really good. Never before I had hoped for that. And I fell in love, and he even loved me back. And it felt like destiny. We immediately felt connected, as if we were meant to be together. Almost like a f...ing disney movie! But it turned out that before we met, there was another women. He doesn't love her, they have the worst arguments and hardly get along, he even stated that she's basically the opposite of me. But she's pregnant. So... since he's a good person, he decided to go with her and try to work things out because he thinks it'd be the best for the child to have both parents being together. So we parted. And we both cried like children. And now I'm supposed to just go on, knowing that there is someone in this world I'd be happy with and he'd be happy with me, but it just can't be. God, I'm devastated. I know, it won't feel this way forever, but I don't even want to pick up the threads of my old life. I was okay back then, with no expectations whatsoever, just hoping to help others. I expected nothing and I accepted that this world is a shitty place, but this world managed to get my hopes up just to punch me in the face. I know, it will get better, but it's just not worth it. Why wait for it to be less miserable? This world has nothing for me, this life is not worth fighting through the hard times.
