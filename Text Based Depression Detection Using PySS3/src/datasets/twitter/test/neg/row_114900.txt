My gf is the only thing keeping me alive rnI have had many episodes recently of me just sitting in my room with a bottle of pills trying to bring the will to end it all, and now i finally convinced myself of how much my gf cares about me and i couldnâ€™t possibly do this to her myself, but i still feel like dying and am constantly wishing some accident will happen that will kill me so that i donâ€™t have to do it myself. and recently iâ€™ve been having random rushes of this unbearable pain go over my whole body that just make this whole situation worse and i have no idea what to do anymore about my situation.
