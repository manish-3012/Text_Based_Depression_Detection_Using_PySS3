Scared and apathetic. I don't see a way out.I recently quit my job and moved back to my hometown 2 years after a divorce. I'm jobless, friendless, penniless, autistic, and severely depressed. To top it off my condo is making me sick. I don't have the will to go on any longer. Life has kicked me too many times when I'm already down. I wasn't meant to be.
