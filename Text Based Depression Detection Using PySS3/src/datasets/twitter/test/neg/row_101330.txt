I'm tired.I'm waiting to die at this point. No one takes my cystic acne seriously enough. I have it all over my body and it's so painful that it feels like I'm being stabbed in multiple areas of my body all the time. Not to mention it's hideous to look at. I can't afford health insurance (for anti-depressants as well) and there's only one cure that has way too many side effects and is banned in a lot of states.

I also just hate myself. I'm selfish and I don't deserve to walk on this planet. The only things that keeps my pain dulled down are video games. I could write a book about the differences between Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, but that won't get me anywhere in life. I'm worthless. I'm weak. I'm a coward. I'm garbage. I will pay someone to come murder me right now. Please, I don't want to exist anymore.
