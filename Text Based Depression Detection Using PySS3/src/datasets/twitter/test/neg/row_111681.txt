Iâ€™m doneI have 100% given up. My life has been nothing but disappointment, heartbreak, and never ending struggle. I see absolutely no light at the end of my tunnel and there is nothing or nobody to keep me going. There is nobody who will miss me so I guess this is my way of getting the last of it out. The world has won, and I lost.
