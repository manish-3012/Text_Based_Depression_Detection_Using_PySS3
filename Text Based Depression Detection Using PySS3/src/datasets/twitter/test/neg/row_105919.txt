I feel like I donâ€™t belong here, and I canâ€™t get any better.I feel as though I should kill myself. My mother says that I havenâ€™t improved any since being eight years old. I feel as though Iâ€™ve made lots of improvement, but Iâ€™m not capable of much.

Maybe thatâ€™s not accurate, and I donâ€™t even know anymore.

All I know is that Iâ€™ve been depressed since I was nine and nothing is helping. I have nothing outside of my house. My parents have growing contempt for me and I have no friends irl. 

I spend most of every day cleaning the house. We have lots of animals and I take care of all of them. My father is gone most of the time because of work and my mother is here all the time but she works. 

I donâ€™t have any trauma, but I just feel that I could never meet the standards of my parents. I am constantly criticized and yelled at often at least once a week. My mother told me today that I am a failure in her eyes. 

Her main complaint is that I donâ€™t do enough around the house and that I am not organized. However, I do all of the household tasks and complete all personal tasks as well. Sometimes I am not timely on the personal stuff however (mostly related to my college admissions). 

I feel as though I do as much as I possibly have time + energy for. The only room that I ever let slip is my room (all of them are cleaned by me including parentâ€™s room). My mother knows that I have been suicidally depressed for over a year and her response is to tell me to exercise and to just deal with it.

Exercise is only barely keeping me out of suicidal, and I very rarely get to go. Iâ€™m eighteen and Iâ€™m having trouble getting my license. My mother is extremely resentful of having to take me and insists that the housework should be sufficient. 

Now she is threatening to kick me out of the house and says that the only way I can stay is if I donâ€™t go to the gym anymore. 

I know all of this is petty, but I feel like this was the one thing keeping me from ending it. I donâ€™t know how to get better. On top of that Iâ€™m developing anxiety and I canâ€™t get treatment for either. 

The only hope for me is if I can get some counseling through my college. She isnâ€™t supporting any effort to reduce my depression, and she is pretty much my only access to the world at large. Iâ€™m terrified that my depression will escalate past what I can handle. 

Iâ€™m not looking for sympathy. I know that I am indeed a failure in many respects. However, I have no idea how to get better and Iâ€™ve lost my only potential access to help. 

I am eighteen and Iâ€™m not allowed to leave the house without a parent. They have agreed to let me walk to college, but thatâ€™s it. Any advice is greatly appreciated.
