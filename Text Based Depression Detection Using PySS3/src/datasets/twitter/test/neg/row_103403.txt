This world is sick.This world needs to be destroyed. We cause each other immense suffering and tears. We are miserable creatures that stab our parents in the hearts while casting our own children to hungry wolves. Things look like they are getting better through the illusions of technology, but we are really just sinking deeper into the filthy, wicked mires of our unclean souls.

I'm not what would be considered "suicidal", but I do give up on this life. It's not a surprise to me that suicide rates are increasing around the world. People are throwing away their humanity for the superficial pleasures provided to them by technology, and our economies are absolutely raping us for this perverted privilege. We are becoming less human; it causes me grief. I have no idea what we've become, but it needs to be destroyed.

Somebody, save us.
