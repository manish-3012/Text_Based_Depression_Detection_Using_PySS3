15, barely hanging onThe only person i can rely on is my mother and she treats me like shit and blames a lot of stupid things on me, im disabled and i feel unwanted because of it.

I dont know what  to do, i love my mom and i have no one else to go to, i dont see any reason for me to live anymore.

What should i do?
