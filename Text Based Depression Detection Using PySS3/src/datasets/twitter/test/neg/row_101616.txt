I wish I knew...I wish I knew what gives a person enough courage to commit suicide. I wish I was brave enough to just get it over with. I hate living but Iâ€™m afraid of dying. I wish I had the courage to end it all today.

I make so many plans to end my life and I never follow through. I feel like such a failure. Everything would be okay if it were all over. My life is a complete waste and I have no hope for it to improve. Thereâ€™s nothing to look forward to or be happy for. I just anticipate all of the horrible things that will inevitably happen to me.  Living is prolonging my suffering. 

Before anyone tries to say it: no, there is literally not a single person who would actually miss me and I know this for a fact.
