18 YEAR OLD FAT FAILURE, NEVER HAD A GIRLFRIEND.Where do i begin, from a young age i have een bullied and made fun of,i was always called names for my obese looking body. i am currently 5'10 weighing in at 237 pounds and a receeding hairline that makes my balding head look even worse. to top things off i also just got rejected by my crush of 4-5 years in which i always made her laugh and smile, but because of my disgusting body and teeth she rejected me after i offered to take her out on dinner. a failure in school as well, with terrible grades and a low self esteeem. in the hallways the teachers usually stare at me for some odd reason, maybe its because of the things i mentioned earlier, same as the kids in school. well alright guess im blowing my head off :L
