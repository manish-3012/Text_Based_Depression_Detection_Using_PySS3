I'm ready to go but also not readyI don't even know where to start, or what to say. My apologies for the text of nonsense. 


I've attempted suicide multiple times, two were almost successful. 

It's been a year since my last attempt, and here I am, considering it again. 

It feels like I ruin everything I touch or come into contact with. 

I can't even make simple decisions. 

I'm failing my family, friends, and myself. 

I wish to die but fear what happens next. 

I have too much empathy that also prevents me from being successful with my attempts. 

I don't know who I am or what purpose I have. 

I know I have reasons to be present, but then why do I feel like such a burden on everyone? 


I don't know if I can hold on much longer, I really don't want to be here anymore.
