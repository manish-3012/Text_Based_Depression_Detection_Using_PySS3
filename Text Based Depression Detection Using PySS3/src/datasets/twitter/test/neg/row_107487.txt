I don't know why?I am not going into how my life sucks.. I just don't feel the need to live... I don't want to .. I don't like this world. I don't fear death.  Even if things get better... even if I have that guaranteed I don't want to live.. just why... I don't really even get this subreddit at all... why helping people from committing suicide? Shouldn't you rather help people do it ? I get that there are people who want to live and you might be one of them or you might be a survivor who is going to share how he is glad he did not do it and shit.. But I just am not one of those people I don't want to live and I don't really care about anything at all.. I would be fine with everyone dying, nothing would happen anyway... we once lived now we don't great... we die anyway of old age... ilness. accident.. so you'll die sooner...is there something wrong with that ? I despise everything about this world. I hate emotions, I don't want them. I don't need them.  Eat,Sleep,Reproduce,Die. It's as simple as that. And I hate it.
