Why couldn't I do it?My whole dad was at work, my mom was taling my sister to school and I was alone with the gun.  I probably sat there for 15 mins just with the gun to my head and my finger on the trigger. I just couldn't do it. I dont know what was stopping me. It's not like I want to be alive anyway and it's not worth living at all if you cant live happily. There was nothing I had to live for but I still couldn't do it.
