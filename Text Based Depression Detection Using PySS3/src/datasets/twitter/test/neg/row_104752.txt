I'm so tiredI've been begging my husband nearly every day to come back. I'm unemployed. An impatient mom. A selfish bitch. I'm tired of all of it. I so badly wish the universe would take me out because I'm too much of a chicken to do it myself. I'm just tired. I'm tired of trying and failing to do life on my own. Please don't tell me to be strong for my kid. Hes the only reason I'm not killing myself. I'm being as strong as I can for him. But no one is strong for me.
