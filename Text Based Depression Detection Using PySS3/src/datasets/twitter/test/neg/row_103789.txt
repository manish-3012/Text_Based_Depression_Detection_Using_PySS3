everything went down hill so fastLast night was so typical. I got off work, was feeling kind of depressed and wanted to hurt myself so my sister said I could crash at her place. I've been depressed and suicidal since I was 12 by the way... anyways at around four my sister asks me to watch her son so she can get a nap in before work. She goes upstairs and I get a call from my dad... I'd been kicked out of my online school... this was my second year in online and I'd transfered from my local high school because of the bullying and I'm extremely socially awkward and don't get along with authority figures so it's a constant battle with my teachers. Well... I gotta go back to that high-school. I'm supposed to be a senior but I have nearly no credits. Because of how much I was in and out of mental hospitals since seventh grade. I've never thought that suicide would be my best option until now. It was always just... well... an option. But now it seems like I'm just gonna be a high school drop out loser... my life really isn't that worth it...

Edit: I'd talk to my parents about it but my father told me not to go home because of how pissed they are at me and they'd think I was just looking for attention or a way to get out of trouble
