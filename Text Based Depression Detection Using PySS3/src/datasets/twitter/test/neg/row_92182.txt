This is my final cry for help. I am done waiting for things to fix themselves. I have tried talking to my friends about this to feel better. But no matter how much I know they care, I still want to die. 

I feel like a burden to everyone and I really want to be done now more than ever. I don't want to be here. And I can finally, clearly see the solution. I know what I have to do. 

I have to remove myself from everyone else's lives. They'll all be better off without me. Even the ones that want to help. They'll get over me. I'm only in their life because they know I might kill myself. 

I am tired of having to repeat myself every day that I want to kill myself with no result. I am done. I am sick of crying for help. I am sick of living. This will be the last time unless any of you can truly convince me to do otherwise.
