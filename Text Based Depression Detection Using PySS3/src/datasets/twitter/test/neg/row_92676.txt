I can't figure this out.So I've been depressed for a long time, and suicidal for most of that time, but I usually had a reason why I wanted to end it. Now, it seems like I'm looking for reasons to want to do it, as I've cut out most of the stressors that made me feel so bad.   
I just need this to stop.   
No one that I talk to can fathom what is going on, and I'm wondering why I'm bothering with this post, because I only ever feel marginally better, and only for a couple hours.   
I tried to get my mom to help me, but I'm thinking that she thinks that my mental health problems are a failing on her character. Which kind of explains why she ignores problems when I try to get her help to fix.   
And I really don't have any faith in the medical field to help me. They've put me on all kinds of shit, and I never had any decrease of negative symptoms. I'd rather be just suicidally depressed than suicidally depressed and dealing with a ton of side effects and have even less money.
