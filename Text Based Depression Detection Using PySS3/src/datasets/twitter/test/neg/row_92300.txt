Distractions destroying me (x-post from /r/depression)A throwaway message to get some opinion.

I'm 26, with a depression diagnosis, I am taking sertraline. I just don't feel happy continuing my life, but I can't consider suicide: I don't want to destroy the life of my mother, who I know loves me unconditionally.

I am stuck in a job that I absolutely hate and I'm starting a master's degree soon in a field I don't like either (both taken under my relatively wealthy father's pressure, basically). I am absolutely tired of my life, both figuratively and literally, as I have constant fatigue. The only moment of solace I can find is eating alone and resting at night, alone.

To make matters worse I am desperately lazy, and I can't help it. Every day I wake up foolishly thinking "today I'm gonna do my best, concentrate and achieve", but every day's the same: I get easily distracted with everything, I am unattentive, I fail to perform at work, as I did at school. Right now I feel I'll never have a solution. I wish my parents would understand that if I kill myself it's for the better - otherwise, I will continue failing, losing money, and destroying our family name. But I know they won't understand it. I feel trapped and damned, knowing that both continuing living and dying are invalid solutions. But in me there's still some hope, very tiny hope, of finding inner strength and a good philosophy to help me pull through. I am an incurable skeptic, but I want to believe :)
