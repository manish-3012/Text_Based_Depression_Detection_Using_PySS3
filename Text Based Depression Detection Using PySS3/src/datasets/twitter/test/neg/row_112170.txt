Iâ€™m a failure and huge disappointmentI guess my last cry for help wasnâ€™t enoiugh for my family. Noe they donâ€™t even talk to me theyâ€™ve isolated from me. My mom just looks at me in disappointment. Whats the point of being here? When not even the people close to you care about you. I donâ€™t belong here.
