The number of reasons to die is slowly overcoming my reasons to live.I'm 19. I've been depressed since I was about 16. It's only gotten worse over the years. I go through the same routine every night.

I think about how much of a failure I am. I was praised as a "smart" child. I grew up thinking that I was destined to be something great.

High school came and went in the blink of an eye. My grades very poor. I couldn't find a reason to do well. "High school is dumb, college is where it matters". Here I am in college, I haven't gone to class in 4 weeks because I can't find the motivation.

My mother is the unforgiving type. "You only do poorly in school because of the damn computer" Maybe it isn't my overbearing feelings of self worthlessness and wanting to kill myself. Maybe it is the only escape I have left in this dull world that is pulling me down. At least it isn't a heroin addiction like my brother, right?
Maybe I will work at a fast food chain for the rest of my life like she said I would.

The semester is almost over. I fear what my mother will do when she sees I failed all my classes. Maybe when she said "community college doesn't matter" I shouldn't have taken it literally. I don't know what awaits for my future. College makes me want to kill myself. The boring lectures, the professors who ask for requirements that I have no idea what they mean. It only adds on to my list for reasons to die than to live. I know they're temporary, I know the solution is permanent, but I don't care.

I just don't care anymore.

I recently had to leave my old job due to circumstances that I caused by accident. I'm struggling to find a new one. I need a purpose in my life. It's one of the few things that keeps me going. All I do is sleep and go on the computer. The only things that keep me alive at this point are my father and my friends.

I'm insignificant as a human. Even if I become the greatest person on Earth to cure cancer and invent an infinite renewable energy source, all life ends. I'll just be dust in the sands of time. Why should I wait?
