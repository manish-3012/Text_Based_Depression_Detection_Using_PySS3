Horribly lonely, hitting the last straw. Death seems like the only way out. I'm transgender. A girl trapped in a boys body. I'm only sixteen years old at that. Nobody around me has a clue about it. I came out to one person back in October, and she doesn't give a fuck about me anymore. I haven't even talked to her in forever and we live about 3 minutes from each other. 

If my parents found out, knowing their stances on gay marriage and everything, they would more than likely abandon me. On top of all of this, I'm homeschooled, I never see my friends, and this loneliness is only adding to my depression. 

I want to die so badly.
