I feel a strong desire to kill myself when I scroll through social mediaReal quick, Iâ€™m not in immediate danger, this is more of me getting something off my chest thatâ€™s been bothering me for a long time and I donâ€™t know why I feel like this. Iâ€™m a teen boy who doesnâ€™t have a lot of friends but the few friends I do have are very near and dear to me. Due to conflicting and busy schedules, I hardly ever see them and theyâ€™re often out with their friends if Iâ€™m busy otherwise. I also follow people on social media I donâ€™t really know all too well but theyâ€™re in some of my classes. They all seem to have far more interesting lives than I do and they always look so goddamn happy. Even if they post something when feeling down they get a flurry of positive responses and support. 

It makes me feel so fucking empty.

Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression for several years now but most people just avoid me if Iâ€™m feeling down.

Also, everyone is way better looking than I am?

Like, I know Iâ€™m â€œaverageâ€ looking, maybe even above â€œaverageâ€ on good days, but I always feel like I look like a toad in pictures and I hate having my picture taken by other people, even if itâ€™s pictures taken by people close to me like by my family or my gf. 

I feel like my life is so boring and uninteresting and no one really cares about what I have to say or do. Other teens my age have so many more followers than I do and they just post pictures of themselves or their food or their vacations or a fucking sunset over a lake. So I try to copy some of their trends but I canâ€™t get anywhere near the 200+ likes they get.

It just feels like a giant game that Iâ€™m not a part of; a joke whose punchline is me.

I just wish I didnâ€™t feel envious of the lives around me on social media. I know I have a lot going for me; Iâ€™m doing very well in my school, Iâ€™m on the right track to college, Iâ€™m maintaining a pretty healthy relationship with my girlfriend, and Iâ€™ve been having a good deal of fun playing and learning guitar on my own. My parents love me (even if they give me hell) and I have a job. 

So why do I feel so envious?! Why canâ€™t I just feel normal and able to fit in with the rest?

I look like them and talk like them and dress like them why arenâ€™t I them??

I just feel so alone with all these lives being lived around me.

Cheers.
