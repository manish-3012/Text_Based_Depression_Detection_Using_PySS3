I did everything for the past few weeks to get better...I ate healthy, i did cardio everyday, Iâ€™ve made friends and talked to people, but i still feel like relapsing to self harm and hiding back to my depression cave. I donâ€™t know what else to do. I donâ€™t understand why society forces me to be alive.
