I'm done. Everything I do is somehow wrong.Every single day, wherever i go, I get laughed at for trying to be a good person. You can go find some homeless cripple, and you'll laugh at me more. Reddit can't keep me going anymore, I can't afford to tell my parents because I know I'll disappoint them, my brother has always been better than me in every way yet refuses to admit it, claiming he's dumb. What would that make me then? Everything I do is somehow wrong in some way, and I'm just so god damn tired of this. I'll have a presentation (made the same day i'm presenting it even) and because of the system we use people will just come in and terrorize it, and when the time comes for me to actually present, I'll have nothing and people will just say I didn't even try, costing me even more marks. All I ever wanted to do was make my parents happy but I can't even seem to do that. Whenever I mess up I have flashes towards my own death, which I look forward to but am too much of a coward to do it myself. At this point, I just want to know what I'm doing wrong. If my brother is reading this, it's not your fault. It's only to the fault of someone named Broc. I should have filed for assault when it happened but I didn't. Reddit, this might be my last post unless someone actually comes up with a way I can fix this. Thank you, Reddit, for being there when I always needed you.
