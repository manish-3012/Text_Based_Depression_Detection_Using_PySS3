Suicide is suppose to be calming.When I first attempted, there was a calming feeling. When I first planned my suicide, i felt very calm and content. I've been planning to die on May 2nd. And I've been an anxious mess. I've been such an anxious mess to the point, it makes me think " I don't want to kill myself. " I get so sick to the point, I temporarily have to stop thinking of suicide to calm me down. Sometimes suicide makes me feel calm, but when I'm heading to my classes and every morning , it just doesn't calm me down. 

It's like I anticipate what is coming. I'm not sure what is gonna happen on that day. But it's making me nervous. Not to mention, I recently found out I have a final on May 2nd.. so I'm delaying my suicide to May 4th
