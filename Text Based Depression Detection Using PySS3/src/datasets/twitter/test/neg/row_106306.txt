I don't even know anymoreI'm at a crossroads in life right now. I don't have a permanent job, and I dropped out of college, and have no funding left to go back. At this point, I could either by some miracle find a job, or my life could spiral into the gutter. I'm 21, who knows what will happen. 

The problem is I find myself not caring which way it goes. Nothing excites me, and I can't help but think nothing ever will. I play games and binge watch TV shows all day almost every day simply to pass the time but it feels empty because I've long lost interest in even that.  

I'm a severely socially anxious introvert on the autistic spectrum, and I have never once in my life fit in anywhere. I will never have a girlfriend, and I will never even have more than a surface level friendship because I am simply incapable of opening up to anyone. As the days go by, I'm drifting more and more towards total apathy towards everything. 

Everything feels pointless. We work just to survive, and survive just to work. That is not life, yet I fail to see any other point to it. I just can't deal with all the lonely nights anymore. The last time I remember being happy, or having an imagination of my own was as a kid. As it is now, reality is just boring, only in dreams do I ever feel alive.  So why not peacefully slip into the blackness no? 

I'm sorry for the wall of text , I simply don't know what to do anymore. I don't even know where to begin. Therapy will not help, because even if I could afford such a thing, they are paid to care. They don't actually care, and that will only make me feel worse. I could never open up to a therapist of any kind. I don't want their pity, and I don't wanna be treated like some kind of freak show because my brain is wired differently.

Is there any tips you guys can give me to help make life feel even remotely bearable again?
