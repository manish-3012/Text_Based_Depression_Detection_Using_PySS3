im so tiredi attempted overdose about two weeks ago now, and ever since ive regretted not pushing myself harder. i should have gone through with it. i cant live with these feelings anymore, i just feel trapped in my own head. i want it to stop. i just want it all to end. i cant even imagine a future. i just want it all to stop. but i cant even bring myself to do it.
