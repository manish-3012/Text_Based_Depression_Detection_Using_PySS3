I want to be mentally ill and be excecuted by gunshot to my low IQ brainI just want to have extreme paranoid schizophrenia or any mental disorder. I want to be locked up. I want to have a delusion like a mathematician who though that his food was being positioned and he starved himself to death.  I want to be extremely mentally ill that I won't recognise my own family , parents or friends. I am self aware, so I know I won't amount  to anything. Basically a piece of garbage from my trashcan family. Cursed with low IQ, extreme anxiety where I think about stupid things, for example I had my exams today I was worried about filling correct info or writing my name properly, rather than solving the paper. I make smallest mistakes. I think it is due to the fact that my paternal grandparents were imbecile who were extremely stupid. My mother is stupid. My dead father was dumb. He died a failure. I wish I become like mentally ill patients who are not aware about anything. Lose a grip on reality. I am not making fun of mentally ill. But I want to be locked up. Put away!
