I just need to talk to someoneI'm having such a hard time with everything. Nothing is working out. My family is struggling and I can't do anything about it. Tried to stay positive by opening a fund, didnt work out. My grades are going to shit. I'm just stupid and my mistakes in the past give me regret every single day. Especially when i knew what people say about me behind my back. Im so embarassed. I wish i could be a badass boss and ignore those but..every since i've been told, i cant stop thinking about it. I just want to disappear. My boyfriend is depressed and I'm trying so hard not to spill all my problems onto him. Im scared to tell anyone from my family because we literally grew up not really talking about our feelings and the last thing i want is me being a burden specially since we lost out nana this week. Called a suicide hotline to talk but none of the numbers worked. Anybody who can talk, please let me know..
