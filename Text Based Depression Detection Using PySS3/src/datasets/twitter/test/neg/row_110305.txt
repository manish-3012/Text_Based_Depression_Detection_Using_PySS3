Everything has come crashing down in the past four weeksI have both everything someone could essentially want and yet every day I wake up and I feel like shit. Whenever genuine happiness seems to be within reach its just grabbed from me. I should be happy with what I have, but I don't and I just feel so incredibly guilty for it. I tried to OD on fucking Panadols of all things but I can't even do that right. With how I'm feeling right now I just hope there's an afterlife or at least SOMETHING on the other side, because it'll beat feeling like shit all the time...
