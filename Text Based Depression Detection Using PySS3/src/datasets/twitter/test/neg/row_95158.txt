I've lost all individuality I have due to depression.It's hard, fighting for your salvation. Depression makes me an NPC. I'm trying very hard to fight against depression, but I feel like I'm losing. The only thing keeping me going is that I don't want to lose my bf, but I feel I would sooner or later.
