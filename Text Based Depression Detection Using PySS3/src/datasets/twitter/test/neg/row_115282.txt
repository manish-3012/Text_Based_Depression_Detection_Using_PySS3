I have nothing to live for anymoreIâ€™m 18 My parents think Iâ€™m a lost cause alcoholic , And decided to give up on me i donâ€™t blame them

My best friend is the love of my life but she will only ever see me as just that a best friend 

Iâ€™m broke , i tarnished my reputation this summer hanging with the wrong people  leaving me with no friends ,  

It is not going to get better i see no light at the end of the tunnel , 

I have no motivation to even want to get my life on track , i just donâ€™t want to be here anymore 

Iâ€™m thinking of just taking a bus/plane across the country and ODing there without my ID present , no one in my life will no what happened 

Iâ€™ll be a John Doe
