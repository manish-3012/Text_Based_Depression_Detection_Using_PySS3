I feel dangerously aloneI dunno what I do to deserve this and constantly beat myself up thinking I'm a bad person. Maybe if I did x,y,z different people would like me, I'd have more friends. Such is likely not the case but I still believe it so thoroughly. 

I have friends with almost identical pasts, thought patterns, behavioral patterns, but because they are hot, talented, etc, they can get away with having flaws that I cannot. 

My current friend group operates wholly conditionally. If you do things they like, you get attention. If you 'slip up,' you get the boot. I am convinced one of my friends is a clinical narcissist and needs help but I'd never dare say it. I can't even say he's hurt my feelings after flipping out at me without being 'punished.'

I feel dangerously alone. I moved away from home at 21 with no friends or family near me. The friends I have I hold on to bc I feel like they are my family. But they shit on me 24/7 now and idk what to do. I'll text them to apologize if I think I've done something wrong and they'll either ignore it or use it against me. I don't even know anymore. I just took 3 shots alone on a monday night, my hands are numb. I have nobody

I dont even have a real job, i risked leaving my grandma and mom and sister 4K miles away for a career that doesnt exist and friends who gaslight me until i cry and dont even give me the time of day. they'll give other friends the time of day, but not me. i have never felt lifted up or inspired by one of them, its clear they dont want me. im dangerously alone and no amount of self care will save my career if they're gonna just keep trying to ruin it with slander when all ive ever done is defend them
