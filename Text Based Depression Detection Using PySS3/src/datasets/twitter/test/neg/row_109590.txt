All I have are a few people I care about, but they ignore me and I think they might be fake. They mean the world to me even if they're fake friends but it hurts so much to be blown off. I just want friendsAll I have are a few people I care about, but they ignore me and I think they might be fake. They mean the world to me even if they're fake friends but it hurts so much to be blown off. I just want friends. If it helps, I'm 16. I don't have many close friends. I know how to make friends but it seems like nobody wants to be close or hang out with me at all. Even though my friends aren't very close I still care about them and they're still important to me. I try to make plans but it never works. Should I keep inviting people who I think are blowing off my plans? I mean they always say they're busy and I'm not 100% sure that they are blowing me off, but the odds of them literally always being busy are near nothing. I mean I've invited my friends like 30 times over the past 6 months or so but every time they've had something to do. I want to keep inviting them because it would be great if they could actually go, but I don't want to keep getting let down. What I should do? I'm new to the sub so idk if this is going to be deleted but if it is because it belongs in some other sub then I would understand. I just want help. These people are all I have and even if they're fake they mean the world to me. They're all I have. Especially one of them who was my first friend after I got rid of my social anxiett and abusive friends. She means more to me than anything because nobody other than my parents were ever that nice to me and it felt great to have someone want to talk to me, especially someone as cute as she was. I'm not a creep, or wierd and it pains me to say this because it almost hurts not to be humble but I have been tolf I'm attractive, and in I've had random attractive people ask me for my number and stuff like that. I don't know why they wouldn't want to be around me or hang out with me.Please help
