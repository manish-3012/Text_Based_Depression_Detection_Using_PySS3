I'm tired of everything...I can't ever have good things, or if I do, they don't last. I have zero self esteem, I have been in two loveless relationships, and I can't feel anything but pain. Antidepressants take what little joy I have out of my life in order to "level my moods" but it makes it so I can't feel joy. My mum will not let me go off of them, since I live at home (I'm 20 years old)...
I guess what threw me over the edge (this time, I've had over a dozen of these episodes in the past) is that I met a guy, and we both really like each other. I mean, I hadn't felt this way before in my life. Everything is going great ( I hadn't taken my zoloft in a few days prior to meeting him) and we basically fell for each other and them I took my zoloft and BAM, the feelings I had went away... I hadn't been this happy in a decade and it got ripped from me... I cannot be happy.... I am seriously considering killing myself sometime in the near future because I have bloody fucking awful luck in my life in a million other areas other than this and i'd be writing a full length novel if I went into all of that. Simply, this is what's relevant and driving me to a dark place this time...
