I don't know who to turn toNo one really listens. They listen but they don't understand. No body can help me change the way I think. The sadness comforts me sometimes. But lately it's uncomfortable. I'm uncomfortably sad. I can't stand being this sad. I want to rip my hair out or tear my flesh apart. I wish I oukd go back to cutting. I miss the feeling so bad. I was so calming. But the last few times I almost died. I was seven months clean up until a month ago. My and my boyfriend broke up, I got in a fight with my dad and his family, my friend ditched me. I felt so alone. Everyone who I loved left. I don't know how I can keep going. Every time I get a mood swing I think "this will pass" but I remember the feeling will always come back. It never ends. It's a constant circle. I've tried psych wards, meds, therapy. Nothing works. I feel even more miserable after it all. Cutti g was my only escape. Then that got taken away from me. Now it feels like the only escape is suicide. I'm depressed everyday. I see no point in anything. I'm sixteen and the past five years have been hell. The good days don't outweigh the bad. I'm losing my mind. No one understands what it's like to be this close to killing myself. Everything gets worse. I don't want to live anymore. Im really just tired of it. I know nobody can help me so I guess I'm writing this to vent. Maybe somebody out there understands what it's like. I need someone to understand me and not pity me. It's so lonely. I hang out with my friends and feel more alone then ever. I don't know how to cope anymore. When I say I'm suicidal they tell me to go to the hospital but the hospital says they can't helps me, so what do I turn to...? I try to kill myself. I tried to slit my wrist. I almost hit the tendon and I didn't hit any veins. Last time I cut there, I hit an artry and passed out. But I couldn't find the artry. I don't understand how that's physically possible but it wasn't there. I'm always going to be sad. When I get happy, it's crushed and ruined. I'm never happy for more than a day. I get one good day every couple days. They don't make the bad days hurt any worse.
