I just can't seek help...I'm close to 31 and I don't even remember when I started feeling like this, maybe when I was 15? maybe when I was 17? it's been so many years and I'm so tired, I don't even fully understand how and why I'm still here... Probably cause of my mom and my cat.

When it comes to seeking for help, I just can't, I don't trust psychologists and psychiatrists I know they're just doing it for the money, I can't even fully open myself with friends and family (Not that they'd care) how could I open myself with some stranger? I tried talking with my older bro a couple of months ago, he listened to me, he said he cared... But he doesn't understand, he's one of those people "just don't think about that stuff, you don't need help, just think differently" I know he loves me and he means well but I feel so stupid trying to talk to him on that level, I regret it, what was I thinking? I don't know. 

I know friends wouldn't want to hear it either, why would they? I don't even know if they see me the same way I see them, they'd think I'm pathetic or annoying, they'd think I'm weak or weird, I'm an adult I'm supposed to be able to control this kind of shit not burden and bother them with it and I don't have that many friends anyway, in short I can only talk to myself and I'm such a bummer... That and venting on the internet I guess. 

I'm so tired I don't even have the mental strength to keep writing and I'm not sure exactly what I wanna accomplish by coming here and writing this, in any case thanks for reading...
