I need a ton of dental work that I can't afford. I think this is it.I went to the dentist for what I thought was a single broken tooth, and instead found out that not only does that one tooth need to be removed, I also have cavities in all but three or four of my other teeth. And that was just the preliminary exam. God only knows what they might find when they do the real exam.

The last time I had dental problems, it was about four cavities caused by not brushing at all for at least a month or two. I haven't gone that long without brushing since then, so I figured I was basically safe from this kind of nightmare scenario. How could I end up developing worse problems with better hygiene? I posted about this in r/depression and got a reply from someone who claimed he only brushed his teeth maybe once or twice in the span of several *years*, and apparently all he needs are two root canals. Still serious, but nowhere near this. How could I be so fucking unlucky?

Naturally, this was caused by my crippling depression and OCD. I spent so much time trying to avoid going to the bathroom (OCD makes washing my hands painful because it takes a lot for me to be satisfied I've done it correctly) and just being depressed in general that I often just forgot about my teeth, plus I figured that if all I got from months of no brushing was just a few bad teeth, all I had to do was not neglect brushing *that* much and I could be reasonably sure I wouldn't have anything more serious than that.

On top of all this, I have no insurance, and I'm unemployed. I don't have the means to pay for all those fillings.

If only I'd had the nerve to shoot myself when I had the chance. That's why all this happened. I didn't have the nerve to overcome the fear of pain from a bullet in the chest, and now things will be even worse because of it. Even if my parents are willing to pay for all of this, I'll still be a suicidal, depressive wreck. My life has been over for years; I just didn't have the courage to finish the job. Now I'm completely lost because I'm not even sure how to kill myself. Maybe if I go to my doctor and explain all of this, he can say something like "I'm not telling you to do this, but, hypothetically speaking, if you were to mix this with that, it would kill you." Fuck that oath of his - he'd be doing harm to let me continue living, and it's not like anyone will ever know.

Edit: Someone please tell me that this kind of situation isn't that unusual. I know it's an established fact that severe depression often causes people to neglect taking care of themselves, but dental problems aren't really mentioned very often when you read things that discuss that issue. Dental stuff seems to be in this weird category all its own where you seem to get more blame for neglecting to brush than you do for neglecting other stuff.
