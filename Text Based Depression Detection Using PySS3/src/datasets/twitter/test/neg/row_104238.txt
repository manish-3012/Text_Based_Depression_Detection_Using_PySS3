Stop telling me to "Get over the bridge"I can't. It's been 12 years and I can't get over my father's death. The thing is, he committed suicide. I miss him all the time. I wish I could've known him better, tried to help him. But I was pretty young at the time, I had no idea what was going on. I was so clueless.

It doesn't help when you tell me to "get over the grief and remember him for the good things he did". Sure, he did many great things. He was a really great guy.
Knowing that just makes me feel worse, though.

I've tried, but I can't get over the grief. I've almost attempted suicide a couple times before, but I've stopped myself somehow. I didn't want to make the same mistake my dad made.
