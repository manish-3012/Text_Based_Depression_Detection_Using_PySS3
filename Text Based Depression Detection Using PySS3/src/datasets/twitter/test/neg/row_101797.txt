Alone my whole lifeIâ€™ve never been in a relationship and Iâ€™m 26, itâ€™s been a while since Iâ€™ve fallen in love but I have fallen in love again. My luck has never been good, this time I love this lady who is actually married and Iâ€™ve been losing my mind as sheâ€™s the perfect woman in every way for me. Seriously, Iâ€™m so deeply in love with her but of course I can never tell her as sheâ€™s already married and our relation is strictly professional. So on top of my underlining sadness and loneliness the worst feeling for me (love) has been added but for me itâ€™s always been a one way relationship. I canâ€™t take this anymore, I break down everyday and I canâ€™t stop thinking about her. I just want to end it now, being alone is bad enough for so many years but falling in love and having it go nowhere is another punch in the face by life. 
I feel I was born at the wrong time, I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to either. So in my eyes itâ€™s not if anyone will even notice if Iâ€™m gone.
