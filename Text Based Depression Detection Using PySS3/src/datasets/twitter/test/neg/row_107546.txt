No one ever repliesI just want people to understand that the sad state my life is in isn't because of lack of motivation, but because of terrible circumstances and the limits of my body. I am so tired of people insisting that I could work or volunteer or go out and see friends or anything despite how much I explain that I can't. The worst part of my dreams dying, is being treated like it's because I didn't work hard enough for them. I'm seriously ill and disabled, but those words seem to translate to the rest of the world as 'i'm unmotivated and lazy'. It's tearing me apart the isolation that comes from being patronised by people constantly treating me like shit because they don't understand that 'disabled' means I'm 'unable to do things'. 

I'm lonely, I'm depressed, I'm terribly ill and in pain and I don't even have money to buy food. People treat me awfully because I am disabled, and I'm always exhausted by the effort of going to doctors and having to fight to get help because so many think I'm too unwell to even bother taking on as a patient since there are no treatment options left.

I'm so sick of having people call out comments at me when I go out, and this expectation that I am only allowed to be 'inspiring' and to be upset about being disabled is to be shamed. Like I am other people's fucking entertainment. I'm so sick of the way people treat me because of my illness.

I'm sick of losing friends, I'm tired of being alone. And now there's all this fucking Christmas shit happening, and everyone's so happily celebrating and I'm alone. My 'friends' know I have no one to be with on Christmas day but they don't give a shit. There was a Christmas party on the weekend that they had and no one even replied when I messaged them all and asked if someone could drive me there from round the corner. Doesn't matter though, I ended up too sick to even go anyway.

No one gives a shit about me, and I'm sick of everyone judging me because I struggle to cope. My life is a cess pool of suffering every minute of every day, but no one ever thinks beyond their own experience to realise maybe mine is a little harder to endure and maybe they could try to at least phone me once in a while or volunteer to take me out. But I matter to no one, and I'm so sick of it. I want to be loved, but I hate everyone. And I'm so, so, so sick of being treated like shit.
