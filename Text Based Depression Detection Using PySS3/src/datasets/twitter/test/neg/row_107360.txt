In need of some kind words..Ive been bullied severely throughout high school and even though it has stopped, I still feel so depressed and suicidal everyday. 

I donâ€™t have anyone to comfort me because I feel like a nuisance when I talk about my feelings so i rarely do.

If itâ€™s not too much to ask maybe you guys could share some nice thoughts or quotes or anything uplifting to help me, and anyone reading this who feels the same way, get through these dark times.
