I am at the edge today.Hi. To start, I am a 17 years old (yeah, "you're too young" "you still have a lot of things to happen in your life" expected.) teenager. Actually, today wasn't the first time I tried to commit suicide, and it wasn't the second. It was the third. The first one was in 2013, when I was only 14 years old (yep).

Before everything else, I will just say that: it's holidays. Guess what I have been doing in all my holidays? Watching anime, reading manga and staying on my bed all day. Hahahaha. I love it. Absolutely love it. What a sick joke of life, fuck it. Even my mom says that this is "sad". :)

Now, let's move on from that. I have been bullied for almost 10 years of my life. I have a bad father, and I didn't had a lot of friends because of him and his damned job. I have being beaten physically (by people that were supposed to be my friends) and verbally. I have been accused of things that I didn't commit. 

The people that I liked? Of course, I am trash, and I have been treated as such. I have never been liked by anyone, I have never been in a relationship. I never had a kiss. Never. Ah, I have been called "vision of hell itself" by a person I liked. I am a joke, right? Go, you all can call me a joke.

I honestly see no point in living anymore. And yes, I did went to a doctor because the school counselor said I was too "low" or something like it. I just don't understand anymore. I am failure, I am rejected by every single person I like. I am lonely and alone. I like "weird" stuff. I am an abomination. 

I truly wonder if those "life gets better" are legit. I truly do. People of Reddit, please... I really don't want to die. I fear death more than everything else. However, the pain is just too big. Everything haunts me and I remember that I failure as a person. Why? Why do I have be like that???? I can't endure anymore! What have I done?? ... Should I truly just die?
