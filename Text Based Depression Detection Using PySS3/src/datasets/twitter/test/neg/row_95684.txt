I almost was committed to a facility tonight against my will.I just got home from the most terrifying and strange day.

I have intense panic attacks triggered by confrontations with others, and had a problem this morning that spiked my worry and obsession spiral that I'm unfortunately growing to know too well.

I went to a facility for behavioral medicine after looking at their web site and thinking it looked like a promising place to get direction on counseling and medication if needed.  

I brought my wife with me, and went into the room to be asked a lot of pretty generic questions.  I tried to be as honest as possible so that I could get the help that would be best for me, and answered some questions in ways that were apparently red flags.

She asked if I wished I was dead, and I made a comment about how I feel that way sometimes, but I had no desire to kill myself.  My opinion about my own life was at worst indifferent.  

Next, she asked me in front of my wife if I knew how I would kill myself.  I started crying and said I don't care for that question.  She kept asking and I had to ask my wife to leave.  I asked for clarification and she said "If you were going to kill yourself today, do you know how you would do it?".  I cried at the bizarre hypothetical and told her that I thought car in the garage would be the easiest way.  She asked "So that's what you have planned to do?" and I said "No, you asked how I would do it *if* I would do it".

Apparently that was enough red flags to start threatening to hold me.  I didn't even go in for help for suicidal thoughts, but she made me cry and scared me more than I've been scared in a very long time.

The whole thing was incredibly bizarre.  She took her recommendation to the doctor who said I was just having panic attacks and I wasn't a threat to myself.  I was incredibly relieved that he somehow saw the intent of my answers clearly despite her interpretations.

Anyways, this has left me with an abnormal amount of questions.  How are people supposed to get help if they were genuinely scared of hurting themselves knowing that honesty will get them locked up?  Is this *normal* or *legal* to be placed in a facility against their will?  

Most importantly:  My anxiety issues are escalated to an abnormal level and my chest is tight and I'm very afraid.  I don't feel safe.  I feel like they have a chance to keep me there if I were to ever return.  Where do I go for help?

I'm not a risk to myself, but really thought this subreddit would be the most knowledgeable.
