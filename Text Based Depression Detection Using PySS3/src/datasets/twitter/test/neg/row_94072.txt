I think I'm going to do itI have my note written and prepared. It's in an email and I'm going to schedule it for tomorrow at noon. I hope he moves on from me. I've been drinking so, I feel fine enough to do it. I hope I do this time. I want to be free from my misery and to stop hurting everyone around me. I loathe myself. I only deserve for my wasted body to be recycled into the earth.
