I posted here long ago when I was having some issues, mostly because I don't know where else to post these things. I often worry about everything having its right place and inconveniencing others, but then I never actually do anything so I guess I'm being a little lazy and selfish. Folks were open and communicated to me in a very human way and I appreciated that a lot at the time. I am a dark man with an old soul, so I don't often get to talk freely and open. I just don't have the disposition for it. I keep to myself and all my few friends are distant and online. I have been in an self-imposed pseudo-exile for about 15 years now and you tend to develop a deep reservoir for the chaos of life, relationships and everything else. Sometimes that well fills up to the brim, and I'm sort of at that point now. In such times I'm normally okay to ride the waves until the sludge subsides, but not today. Today I need a little catharsis or I might lose a bit of myself that I won't be able to repair.

I'm 31. That's really old to me, mostly because I still feel like a teenager. That's okay and all, but I have a deep seeded preoccupation with mortality. Time is running out. I have to leave my mark before I leave this earth. My field is artwork and has been for 1 year now. Actually, it has always been my weapon of choice, but I wasn't really serious about it throughout my entire 20's. I have always been a slowpoke in life. A slow grower. Slow to choose, slow to move. Just slow. That's fine, but it was always in the back of my head, like a splinter or a light. I wouldn't say it's a calling because I'm not very good, but I enjoy it and it brings me fulfillment in a life that has otherwise lacked all significance. Being slow is relevant to note and that will become apparent later on in my story.

My life has been a junkyard of failed starts. I don't really fit into the boomers or the millennial or the whatevers that people use to categorize themselves these days. I just sort of exist. Sometimes I feel like a lost soul. I don't value much in this world past integrity and happiness. That's convenient for someone without a real job or experiences to say, I suppose, but it's true and it's a huge part of why I am the way I am. I am as simple as simple gets and as complicated as complicated gets. I'm a real basket-case, as folks over here would say. Back home, we call such people headcases. It isn't so different I guess.

I went to a good school. It was a local school in the country where I lived for 28 years (Ireland). It was an odd school in that it's common for the schools back then to be segregated into one of the two major religions in the north. My school was integrated, which was great. You can consider it a progressive school in that sense and it's reflected in its teaching values. Why do those differences matter? What's I suppose ironic, and this became apparent to me in my later years there, is that political division was instead replaced by economic division. I grew up poor and money would play a huge role in how I developed as a person. The majority of my classmates were extremely wealthy and it reflected in their attitudes. I was in on merit only, you know? They were too, but also wealth. I developed a deep resentment for privilege and entitlement. I stand by it, even today. It's important to remember that we are all the same people. We're all peasants, ultimately. I could go through the list of situations at my school that made me develop such bitterness, but we would be here all day. Entitlement sucks to deal with. Fuck the wealthy.

I left school early and I have been adrift ever since. I was in and out of CBT for most of my early 20s until I realized that it was time for me to just think my way out of my problems. So I did. Despite being in and out of jobs and in out of education, in my mid 20s I finally completed 2 A levels without quitting. Of course, I fucked up my favourite class (Politics) that I was nailing because I walked out of the last paper in protest of the boring question (essay based on lame-duck presidency aka dry-ass contentless curveball prompt) and disappointed my teacher, but oh well. At least I had 2 A-levels. The problem with this is that I couldn't go to university on just 2 A levels, so there I was adrift again. Around about this time I had just come out of a chaotic relationship that deserves its own paragraph.

Women have defined a lot of my life. As a man, with pride and a big ego, a man that has toiled for what little he has had throughout his entire existence and is fully prepared to be homeless if it means that I die with my integrity intact, women have defined me. I grew up in a single household with my divorced mother. My father cheated on her and left us in the dirt. She didn't contest any of his military affluence. Fuck him. For all her shortcomings, I will forever love and admire this small part of our story. She just took me and left. This unfortunately made life difficult though. I was a work-baby and almost died of boredom whilst my mother cleaned the houses of the wealthy for a living. I guess that's part of where my resentments come from.

&amp;#x200B;

My mother is a force of nature. In many ways she is still a child. When I think of her, I like to think that she raised me until I raised her for the remainder of our time together. I love her and I loathe her. She's great, and she's awful. She is the embodiment of empathy and also so woefully human. I wouldn't know where to start with her, but she had a huge impact on how I developed of course and for the first part of my life our relationship would define how I treated other women too. What you don't hear very often from people in similar situations; it's really hard being the man of a family. Really hard. I spent a lot of my teenage years and adulthood dealing with my mothers boyfriends and their dysfunctional relationships that were often abusive. I wasn't prepared, but I learned valuable lessons. I will never put anyone in that situation nor will I live it myself. Domestic abuse and those environments are maybe the worst things I can think of. There is something perverse about your safe space being corrupted.

Anyway, women. Of all my girlfriends, the Romanian probably left the biggest impression, topped only by my wife. She was strong, beautiful and smart. Most of all, she wanted me. I flew to Europe to see her and then I flew again. It was a whirlwind of a few years and then it blew up spectacularly. My trip to Romania was maybe the worst experience I have ever had. There is nothing quite like being in a foreign land where you don't speak the language with no allies to hold onto. Something broke in me then. I have had a couple of situations that I would consider breaking points. At those points in your life, you lose a part of yourself. I'm not sure what it is. I can almost hear it snap off. Something important goes down the drain and you can't get it back. 

We fought bitterly, like rabbits. On leaving, I knew that was it. I hadn't accepted it though, so it was still a shock to hear it happen when I got home. What's worse is, it was a couple of months afterwards and there were already plans for me to spend Christmas. What's even worse than that is that I found out our mutual German friend was coming to stay with her in her apartment. You can probably guess what was going on there. I loved her, you know? Sometimes I still stalk her. She's one of the heads of the EU Commission now. Good for her, I guess. Cunt. Anyway, this prompted a pretty steep spiral for me that almost landed me in a mental institution. This is where the second piece of me broke off. 

3 years into my schooling and attempt to champion myself into a better man, with lungs that were about to eject out of my body from the 20 cigarettes a day I was smoking post-breakup, I had finally decided I had had enough and wanted out. I wanted to die. My plan was to go visit my Kiwi friend living in Essex and then wander off in the middle of the night after saying my goodbyes and kill myself in a field. I made the stupid mistake of telling my school counselor that I was seeing for some reason. She freaked out and got me into a lot of bother, but I guess I'm still alive. When I went up to commit myself, they wouldn't take me. They said it wasn't a serious case. They showed me the door at 10pm during winter with no way to get myself home. I was stunned. I sat down against a building on their grounds and held my head. I had nothing and I had no one. I broke then. I only had myself. I realized that. No one gave a fuck. We're all just animals, in the end. The best part was when security came to remove me from the premises. A nice touch.

Such is life, I suppose? That's what I told myself. After that, I worked a shitty job for 3 months, quit, and then drifted from crappy relationships to crappy homes and then back to crappy Mums. I did some illegal stuff and I did a whole lot of nothing. I wouldn't call myself a shell of a man, but I developed some pretty dark philosophies. I realized that everything is relative and that everything is just about perspective. I realized that I was the only thing that mattered. I still believe that, to an extent, but as I'm about to get into, I did remove myself from that philosophy to a degree. I still being in the practical easiness of life, where grand super-philosophies hold no precedent and common sense takes over. I consider this a dominant Irishism. The ability to put your bloody torso and maimed limbs to one side to have a laugh about how stupid it all is. If you didn't laugh, you'd cry, right?

I'm married. I met my wife on here. I met my wife after I posted my rambling nonsense on this very subreddit 4 or 5 years ago now. She's American and I now live in America with her. I have mentioned all of the above for context. My life has been hard and I am the way I am for a reason. I am not a bad man, but I can be a difficult man. I accept that. However, despite this, I have tried my very best to be a better man for my wife. After-all, we are married, right? I have shed a lot of my self-developed ways of dealing with the world so that I can function with another person. I did that for her and I did that with a lot of thought and feeling involved. Now, I am hopelessly vulnerable and as much as I hate it, I recognize that it is healthy too. Sure, whatever. 

The problem is that 2 years ago she cheated on me. It isn't your standard cheating. When I came to visit originally, 6 months after we had decided we wanted to be together and 6 months 2 weeks before we had started talking to each other here on Reddit we had a lovely time. It was just so easy. It just made sense. I felt as if I was waiting for this my whole life. A reward for putting up with so much garbage. Some relief. Some respite. I can't begin to describe to you how happy I was. I really can't. Once you've been through hell and you make it through, it isn't even elation really. It's just fatigue and relief. A great wave of it. Fucking finally.

She got a text message that Christmas from some guy. This guy was from her history and she was still in contact with him. We never really shared our relationships in any great detail and my wife is a little wishy-washy with the nature of her relationships. She is dangerously intelligent and very savvy when it comes to wordplay. It's difficult for me to know what she means when she is guarding herself. We had an argument that Christmas, before I went home and we started the visa proceedings about the nature of this guy. I said, fine, fuck it, I'll let you deal with it and deal with it she did.

One year later I was now in America. I had packed up my whole 28 years of life in the country I love to come here to be with her. It took us a year to get me a drawer to put my clothes, because her job is stressful and life is busy, I guess. That's fine. She left her phone at home one day. I looked at her text messages, because, reasons. There he was near the top. I went through her text messages all the way back to when we were talking about being together and how much of a done and dusted deal it was. She was talking to him about taking him to bed. I was shattered. I paced the house for 6 hours until she came home. 6 hours. I did. I walked for 6 hours. I couldn't sit still or my heart would break. She said it didn't mean what I thought it meant, after she was done being outraged that her husband looked at her phone that is. 

Several months later, I decided that if this were to work, I would need to let it go. We argued a lot during those months. I almost walked out on more than one occasion. It wasn't so much the event that bothered me, although it did basically corrupt any notion of something pure for me, which isn't supposed to happen because fuck me, I guess. It was mostly her reactions afterwards. It was defensive, not apologetic. Even to this day, she is defensive, not apologetic. I can't really get over that. We're 2 years in now and I'm sleeping on the floor. She's at her parents in another state for Christmas. 

We have dealt with death together and done all the married things, but it doesn't seem right. It seems broken. I feel broken and lost. I feel so hopeless in this country that I actually loathe with every fibre of my being. Something else broke off of me during these years. She just doesn't care and if she does, she hides it very well under some very well developed defense mechanisms. Most days I wonder what I'm doing here still and I am definitely wondering that this Christmas. I told her it was fine to go, and it is, but it also isn't. It just isn't as simple as that anymore. Besides my time in Romania, this is the only other time that I have felt so alone. I actually have nothing left. I'm trying not to dwell on it because I might break for good if I do. However, I just wanted to get that off my chest.

We discussed going to marriage counseling because I'm trying not to add to my junkyard and I'm trying to champion myself again, but this one definitely feels like a struggle. The bedroom has been basically dead on arrival with stress cited as reasons. I can't really approach her anymore after those text messages and she doesn't care enough to work on it. Stress only goes so far, you know? I'm a man, and I'm just not getting anything. I'm frustrated. I was working hard on my artwork up until 2 months ago where I just lost all motivation and started sleeping in the other room. She has to sleep with an industrial fan that I have been okay with and understanding for most of our life together, but only under the promise that she would work on it so that we can sleep together. She didn't, of course. So, in order for me to take control of myself once again instead of being passive, I started sleeping elsewhere. I'm glad I did, but it also means that my marriage is basically dead. At least I'm getting sleep. She doesn't care that I'm sleeping in the other room. She's scared of me because I shouted at her during arguments. I actually find it completely absurd that she claims she's scared of me. Absolutely absurd, but everything is perspective, right? To me, it just seems like she's playing victim, though. That's my perspective. So, I just don't discuss anything with her anymore. And that's my life. I sit here and waste time until something happens. Until a meteor lands on my head, I guess. I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I gave up a lot to be here. I have sacrificed a lot in my life to deal with demons that were forced upon me or accidentally summoned by me. I just wanted one pure thing that wasn't anybody elses. Just mine. Me. A reason to be, other than just being for me. I guess I don't even get that and I am doomed to carry the weight of my history and me, forever. I just don't have anything good or anything to look forward to anymore. It's going to be a long Christmas, y'know? Anyway. Thanks for listening, if you got this far. Cheers. Have a good one.
