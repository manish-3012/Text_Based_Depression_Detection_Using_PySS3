IdkHello,
  I am so alone. I have been alone since the day I was born, and will remain alone till the day I begin decomposing 6 feet under. I have no friends, no love, and nobody in general. I live with my parents and spend my days sitting at home all alone doing nothing. My loneliness has began to have a serious toll on my confidence, to the point where now I have absolutely no confidence in myself. I am beyond depressed, and have nobody to talk to, and nobody to help me through the day. I donâ€™t see a point in continuing onward knowing I will never find love, and knowing I will remain a failure forever. 

Cheers!
