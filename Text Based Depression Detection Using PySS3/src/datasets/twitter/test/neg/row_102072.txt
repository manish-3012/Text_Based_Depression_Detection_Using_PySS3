This quarantine is gonna be the death of meIâ€™m losing my mind being stuck here with all these fucking people i try to avoid regularly, now they wont leave me the fuck alone, i never get a moment of peace in this house, itâ€™s coming very soon, suicide is almost inevitable, to all the people itâ€™ll hurt fuck you, youâ€™re only gonna pretend to care, milk my death for likes on facebook or whatever then go on with your regular lives. Fuck all of you i hate every single one of you and i hope life is as unpleasant for you as it has been for me. Sick of this shit, why canâ€™t anyone leave me alone if i want to isolate thatâ€™s my fucking business FUCK!!!
