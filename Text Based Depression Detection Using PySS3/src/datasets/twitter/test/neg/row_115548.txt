None of the common reassurances work for me, did this happen to any of you?The common ones are like:
*What about your poor family (you mean the fundamentalist fuckers that literally tried to kill me several times and who beat me regularly fir being gay? Fuck their feelings)
*Friends? (Don't have any. I have shallow classmates that say hi and then scatter when I complete the work for them) 
*Passions? Not worth the pain. 
*Love? Never felt it from a human. Got used a whole lot. Stopped caring for it. It's no longer a reassuring thought to prevent suicide. 
*It gets better! Statistically for people in my exact position it is more likely to get worse in all sections of life. 

I'm I alone in this? If you ever felt the same, what worked for you out of your personal experience? What keeps you going.
All and I mean all stories are appreciated.
