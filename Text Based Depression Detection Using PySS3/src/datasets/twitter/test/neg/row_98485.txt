what now?i tried to overdose with pills &amp; alcohol last night, but i woke up and my first thought was â€œi should be dead thoughâ€. i tried calling AND texting the suicide hotline, but i hung up because i was scared for anyone to hear my voice and say what i did and i stopped texting because it felt like speaking to an automated reply system (and i could just talk to siri if thatâ€™s what i needed). i drove myself to the emergency room because i got a text from my little sister at school reminding me she loves me and so iâ€™m here but i canâ€™t convince myself to go inside and be admitted. thanks for reading this, i donâ€™t know if i need advice or just need to stop being a baby and go in but i at least knew that staying home would just end up with me trying to od again and she said she loves me so i canâ€™t do that
