I made a mistakeI dated a girl for a year and a half and only worried about her mental health. She was extremely suicidal along with other things. When we broke up, I had noticed that all that time worrying about her made an impact on me. I wasnt watching myself. I guess it just rubbed off a little. Now fast forward, i started talking to another girl who I had such strong feelings for, but my ex was still in the picture. During a week where new girl was a little upset, i talked to old girl and we hooked up kind of. Now under extreme guilt, i confessed to the new girl, essentially ending any hope of a relationship with her telling me she has no respect for me which i deserve. I hate myself so much because of this and almost cant resist the temptation right now because i loved her so much but i ruined it all because i made a dumb mistake.
