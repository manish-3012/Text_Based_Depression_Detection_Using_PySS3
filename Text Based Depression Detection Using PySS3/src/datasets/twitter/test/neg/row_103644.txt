If I donâ€™t get this job Iâ€™m doing itThatâ€™s my last chance. If I get the job thereâ€™s tangible hope for the first time in a long time. If not, itâ€™s the universes way of telling me it never wanted me here in the first place. I need to be strong and I need to be brave. I wonâ€™t waste anyoneâ€™s time anymore. Iâ€™ll make the burden go away, Iâ€™ll be good.
