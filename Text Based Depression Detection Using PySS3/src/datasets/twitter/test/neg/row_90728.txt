Worried my suicidal ideation has progressed into planningI've never made an attempt on my life. I've had a lot of suicidal ideation in the past but I never did anything about it apart from self-harm &amp; other reckless behaviour like taking drugs.

I've been depressed for about 2 months. I quit smoking weed for my mental health but I think quitting made the depression resurface. But I can't smoke again because I've got schizophrenia and weed makes the symptoms a lot worse.

Anyway something has changed. I never drink &amp; now I'm pouring myself a genourous portion of vodka just so I can escape for a while. I've self-harmed again after not doing it since January. I think I'm going to take a seroquel overdose. I've got plenty of them. I'm not going to do it tonight but I have very strong urges to.

I've never taken an OD before but that's what my brain is urging me to do. I don't even know if I'm ready to die but I can't go on much longer. My depression is unbearable &amp; my schizophrenia has pretty much destroyed a lot of things for me. Used to have a lot of potential before my first episode of psychosis a few years ago. I'm only 25 but I'm pretty useless anyway with all the meds I'm on.

I feel selfish of course. I know this will destroy my family but I'm focused on how I feel in the present as opposed to how I might feel in the future. Things might get better but that's a big might. And my present situation is bad. I'm tired and I just want out.
