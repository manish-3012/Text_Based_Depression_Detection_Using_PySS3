I don't think there's someone out there that's capable of truly loving meI'm 25, I don't think I'm a terrible looking person, but every relationship I try just fails. I try to be a good person and caring and am accepting of faults, but it doesn't seem like there's someone out there that will accept me and my faults. I have PTSD and am a very anxious person. I really try to have a big offering heart, but it just seems like I scare off everyone dating wise with what I have and it's making me feel so worthless and so unimportant. I just want to feel desired.
