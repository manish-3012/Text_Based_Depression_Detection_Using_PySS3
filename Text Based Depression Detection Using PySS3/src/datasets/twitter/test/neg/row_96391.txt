Friend reported other friend's suicide attempt to police, now what?Ok so at around 2am last week friend "Samantha" contacted my best friend "Isaac" to say that she was going to kill herself and was just saying goodbye. Isaac called the police and then me (both of us know her but are not particularly close friends with her) and according to Samantha the police apparently found her in her apartment where she was just hanging out (this would have been around 5 in the morning). She had said to Isaac she was going to jump from her apartment where she lives in a fairly tall building. 

After this she did not contact him for several days until now. Isaac just texted me this: "Samantha is mad at me for not letting her jump. I guess she was gonna do it but the cops stop her."

To which I responded: "fuck that what the fuck"

he said: "I dunno but she says I ruined her life cuz they keep a watch on her now and they fined her and all this shit."

to which I responded: "I would say to her that that's the most insensitive thing you've ever heard and how could she expect you to have done anything else?"

But I don't know what else to say. 

It seems possible that there's a lie somewhere in her story. Do the police in a major metropolitan area even have the personal to have someone watching her? He called the police in her area in addition to the campus security at the university she attends, but has not received subsequent information from them. Neither of us live close enough to her (hundreds of miles away) to go and check on her. 

What do?
