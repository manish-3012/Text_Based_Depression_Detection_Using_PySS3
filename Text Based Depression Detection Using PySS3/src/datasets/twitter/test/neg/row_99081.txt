The end of feeling aliveEverything good comes to an end. Where once I was a living spirit, this world has destroyed it. I looked for something and found nothing. I hid myself away to protect myself, I lost myself in the process. I tried to heal myself, and found I was more broken beyond repair. I tried to find the happiness in others, instead I found the emptiness within mine. I tried to sleep through the pain, I woke up and my pain has spread. I tried to do away with love, I am instead left in starvation for it. I asked time to dissolve my mind, I am left with time reminding me all that was lost. I tried to become stronger from this pain, I've become strong through destroying my spirit. My body is destroyed, my spirit is weeping, my mind is dulled. I have been walking on brimstones for ten years. Every day a step that burns the soul of my feet, every step I wake up in a pain. The pain is exhausting and I begin to sleep, awaken by another step. My feet will fail and I will fall on it, and let it dissolve me entirely. I came from place far above here, a living loving spirit I've known to be true. My spirit has been charred and twisted. My soul wants to rip open this ruined blanket of flesh, it is leaving through my eyes.
