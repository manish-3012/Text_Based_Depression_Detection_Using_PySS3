Its on and offIts like every few months ill go from being really depressed then for a week or two ill be fine, then ill be back to being depressed. But now, Im really sad and I don't know why. It's only a few days until my 17th birthday, but Ive been wanting to end it all before that day comes so my parents don't feel the need to get me something. I found a shotgun in their room a while back, but I never checked if it was loaded. If it is, Im probably going to do it, but I have had no chances to go and get it.
