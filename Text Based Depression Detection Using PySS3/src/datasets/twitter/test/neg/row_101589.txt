Iâ€™m craving for the end more now then ever.Iâ€™m so close,

I just want to kill myself. I feel like I have no friends. Iâ€™ve got my keys in my hands wanting to start tearing away at my forearm. Iâ€™m finding no help from anyone I know. This is my last attempt at getting better. What should I do? I donâ€™t want to die but Iâ€™ve also never wanted to end it so badly. Iâ€™ve been stuck in a loop of this before but this time is different. Iâ€™ve got a plan, a general thought of when I want to end it, and Iâ€™m so close to go so far as to try to make my â€œfriendsâ€ hate me. They are there for me but none of them understand what Iâ€™m going through. My best friend of 5 years now will just yell â€œSamuel, NO!â€ at me but he usually leaves it at that as I canâ€™t bring myself to mention it again. Iâ€™m getting really depressed and I canâ€™t go 10 minutes without wanting to end it.
