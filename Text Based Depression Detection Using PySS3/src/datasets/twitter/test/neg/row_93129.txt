Im doneIm done being hurt. Im done being everyones second choice, im done opening my heart. Im better off just being nothing. This is to you all, im done with everyone and every fucking thing just hurting or using me. Not once, not fucking once does anyone want me. I guess im just that bad of a guy. i truly hate myself. My boxed is closed. No one is ever getting close to me again. This is to you all. Our fucking species is a fucking mistake we are all selfish pieces of dirt who run around in circles believing what others tell us to. Why cant i be selfish to, why do i always have to sit back and do what others want so they dont hurt. Well fuck you all. This planet is a mistake anyway, we all are just nothing, the pure fact i type this is a mistake, even if all of humanity hates me i dont fucking care anymore, everything is dark now, i cant see anymore. In the big scale of it, we are smaller then atoms compared to everything else. Nothing we do is worth anything, we all will die in the blackhole we are being sucked into and vanish without a trace of our existence. Goodbye. Fuck you all. This is to all of humanity. Im done.
