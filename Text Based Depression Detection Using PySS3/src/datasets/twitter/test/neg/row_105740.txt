I'm just tired. I'm done.I don't feel sorry for myself... 

I'm afraid of a painful death, but I've decided I'm going to hang myself in the coming hour. 


There's no one close that could prevent me from doing it... there's no reason for me to just keep hanging on.

I'm 25 years and I'm a shameful disgrace to my family. Regardless, I know they love me unconditionally... I would never think of hurting them, but they'll just have to learn how to cope with my death and not blame themselves.

I have just one good friend... but even he doesn't care about me enough to wonder about how I'm doing.

I haven't had a girlfriend in many years... 7 years at least. I just can't seem to grasp the idea of how to behave around people... or I'm just as uninteresting as I've always feared.
I drive everyone away... even my closest friend, of which none seem to give a shit about me any longer.

I don't have a career. I don't have a job, and I don't think I could get even the shittiest one so easily. I haven't accomplish nothing with my life... just a failed partnership with my father on a failed business venture a couple years ago...




I don't even know why I'm writing this... maybe this is the last way of holding on to hope... hope that someone here can drastically change my life with magical words... bah


I'm just tired. I'm done.

So long, and thanks for all the fish
