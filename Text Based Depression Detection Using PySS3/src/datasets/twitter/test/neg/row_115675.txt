Iâ€™m scaredIâ€™m not responding to any of my medications. Iâ€™ve tried all 3 antidepressants that I can use at my age in my state. None of itâ€™s worked. Will I get forced into a mental hospital? I have an appointment with my psychiatrist in a week or so and I feel like thatâ€™s what heâ€™s going to say.
