I need to end this but I can't.I own my own house, and car and every electronic or appliance I could ever want or need but since my girlfriend cheated on me, left me, my dad lost his job and my mothers deteriorating health.
I've lost three close friends so recently I have no one to connect or talk to and my suicide hotline said the best option is to cry myself to sleep, wow thanks a lot. 

Waht do I do? Is there anything I can do?
