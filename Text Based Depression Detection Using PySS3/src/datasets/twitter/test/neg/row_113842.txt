Scared of death but canâ€™t waitI donâ€™t want to die, like, at all. But Iâ€™ve been suffering mental illness for 10 years now and itâ€™s only proven to me with every hopeful year that I shouldâ€™ve killed myself the previous year. Now Iâ€™m just exhausted and want it all to be over. Thereâ€™s more reasons to die than to live. Iâ€™ve done a basic note and started to clear the crap from my phone and all that stuff. And will probably leave my old journals behind for them to read, just because. I used to think Iâ€™d make a big show out of it and â€œgo out in styleâ€ but now I just want to be forgotten. I am so exhausted I canâ€™t even explain. Itâ€™s overcome the instinct to live thatâ€™s always been strong in me. Now just to distract myself and fuck about until itâ€™s time to go. Itâ€™s just hard to believe itâ€™s really going to end like this, and almost no one will come to my funeral.
