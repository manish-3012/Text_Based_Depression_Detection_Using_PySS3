Debt and the American Pseudo-PrisonI want to kill myself. That much is obvious given the subreddit Iâ€™m posting this into. I needed somewhere to go to write my thoughts, so here I am, and thank you for reading. Recently I have been crushed under the weight of debt from a minor surgery that, although minor, was still life-threatening if not performed. How is it fair, then, that I need to go into debt just so I can live? How does it make any sense to these greedy bastard doctors, pharmacists, surgeons, hospitals, that I am forced into debt upon threat of death?

What makes it even more disgusting is where my debt will go if I shot myself right in my head.

The debt doesnâ€™t go away, the debt goes to my family. Entrapping me in this position where if I live, I suffer, and if I kill myself, my family suffers. How do these â€œprofessionalsâ€ sleep at night, knowing that they are causing the ruination of families across the nation? I have no respect for these cretin, and putting me in this position of pure hopeless suicidal depression is an offense that frankly, I wish was litigable. These people live on mountains while their indebted slaves live in the ghetto slum apartment complexes below, never to leave, trapped by overwhelming debt, just because they wanted to live. 

If you donâ€™t live in the US, be thankful. This nation is a completely broken, disgusting cesspool of greed, filth, and selfishness. 

I want to die, and America is to blame. 

Thank you for taking the time to read.
