really need help, i'm so close to killing myself.i just dont know what to do, i feel depressed most of the time, i dont really have friends and i just feel like a bother to the few i have, i feel scared being at home as my parents just make every second hell. i've just had to sit through my parents screaming at me and each other. i just hate going to school, all i get is mocked and tormented,. i'm just sat here now crying, i've given up all hope of happiness, i'm just depressed and lonely, i have a plastic bag in my hand and all i want to do is kill myself.
