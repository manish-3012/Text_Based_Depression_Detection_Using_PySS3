I'm supposed to be getting married in 2 months but I really don't want to be alive anymore. A secret was revealed and I feel trapped with it and so alone.I don't want to get into the specifics of what the secret is because I tried to reach out for help on reddit yesterday and it honestly made me feel so beaten down. Maybe I am a horrible person. I don't know.

I just don't see the point of carrying on anymore. I can't reach out to anyone I know because it's not my secret to share. I'm so alone and just so lost.

I guess I just want to talk. About what? I don't even know. I just feel so hopeless.
