I just want to turn myself offIâ€™m 26, I live at home, I work a shitty job at a bank, have so much college debt, Iâ€™m depressed, my girl left me a month ago, Iâ€™m so tired of this life. Iâ€™ve already written letters and have made plans. Iâ€™m just so ready to stop living in pain. Iâ€™m tired of this life. I have to no one to blame but myself. Iâ€™m sorry to anyone Iâ€™ll hurt with my decision.
