Wake up everyday thinking of Suicide )=Im 18 years old (male) and i can't stop thinking of suicide. No one really knows how sad i really am i just act happy and put a smile on my face, i feel really lonely and used to have friends but not anymore. I do have a family that really cares about but it still isn't  helping. I have a problem where everyday for the past 10 years or so i have not been able to wake up in the morning without severe stomach problems( I have seen a doctor and they have done northing). Everyday i sit in the house all alone, out of a town and just feel like i have northing. I have the fear of meeting new people and cant talk to any stranger without looking weird and awkward. I got bullied really bad when i was in school,from grade 4 to when i left recently. One time at school a whole group surrounded me and was just throwing a balls at me and laughing and there was worser stuff then that which i will not say because ill go on forever.Im thinking i'm going to just hang my self or cut my wrist in the bath, not sure when but i'm getting to a stage where i think its going to happen.
