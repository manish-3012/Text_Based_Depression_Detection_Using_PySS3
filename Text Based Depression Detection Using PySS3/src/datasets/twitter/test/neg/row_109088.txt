My husband's best friend is severely depressed and paranoid to the point of suicide. What can we do?My husband's best friend (we'll call him Dan) has been struggling with serious depression and anxiety for years. He refuses help. The one time his family managed to convince him to go to a doctor, he quit his medication in the middle of the prescription and never took any other meds again, something the doctor had told him to never do. 

Recently, he's gotten much worse. He's withdrawn from almost everyone he loves and talks incessantly about all these insane conspiracy theories whenever he gets the chance to. He refuses to talk to anyone for days on end, but when he does, he just rambles on and on about his theories, like how the government is slowly killing us all, etc. There are multiple people in his circle of friends/family wondering if he has something else going on, like bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, because of the paranoia combined with his depression. 

Beyond the paranoia, Dan has been talking a lot about suicide lately. This has been going on for the last few months and has gotten worse and worse. Because of all the terrible things he believes, he feels that life isn't worth living. 

His family knows all this. He's even casually brought up suicide to them. I really think he needs to see a doctor, but despite all the people who's begged him to go for years, he refuses to, claiming he can't because his insurance won't cover it. Is there anything my husband and I can do to help him? 

TL;DR:  Husband's best friend is severely depressed and paranoid to the point of suicide and we're at a loss as to how to help him.
