Why am I even posting thisWhat do I even expect from this? A "please don't do it"? I don't even know. Attention maybe, I don't know. Even the best most thoughtful comment wouldn't work because I'm stubborn and I don't want to talk about anything to anyone. I can, but I don't want to. Which is weird because I'm sort of talking about it right now but in a pretty in your face way. I'm making you feel helpless and useless, like nothing you can do will help. It's true but I feel bad about that. It's not your fault it's just the way it is. 
I feel like my parents are the only obstacles stopping me from peace with myself. I don't want them to see my ugly lifeless body but I want to die so much. Or live alone forever or something, I can't see an alternative option. 
I don't like anyone and I hate myself, I don't want to love or be loved (I'm being serious), I don't want friends, I don't want to socialise with anyone. That just isn't achievable in this world so I'm going to take option A. 
Everything's an effort and boring, yes everything even hang gliding or bungee jumping. I hate myself due to how I act and how I think and also physiological stuff that's hard to explain but it makes everyday life difficult.       
It's not giving up it's just a shortcut to the end. This is so stupid lol. Also I'm 19, even if I was younger it's not nice to dismiss people's feelings. This would be so much easier if I was just never born, life is like being picked for jury duty. I never wanted it. 

Don't worry about reading this or typing or anything I'm just venting. Or am I? I don't even know. I don't know if this is reverse psychology or reverse reverse psychology. I don't even want help because no one can help. Brains are so dumb.
