Deranged FatherI've been tired of life for awhile. But recently I've wanted to die more than ever. I have never expressed these thoughts to anyone, I mostly just make jokes about it to people. Recently my father has found a new way to punish/terrorize me. Whenever I don't do something right away he will get up and go the the front door and yell at the neighbors how bad of a child I am. He even walked outside bare naked last week. This is embarrassing and I think he has some form of serious mental illness. I have told him that he's behaving like a terrorist, but he responded by saying "I'll do it again." I honestly want to kill myself just to make him feel guilty about his shit attitude. Many years ago I would go to the store with him because he can't go himself. He used to punish me by waiting for people to be all around us and let out a loud fart. I think he needs serious help but there's nothing I can do about it. My sister threatened suicide many times before and all he says is "Do It!" I'm wondering if anyone else has met someone this messed up before.
