Killing myself is always so hard and I hate itPlanning it out always seems simple and promising. "I'll jump off the building and die." "I'll cover my mouth and nostrils with duct tape and die." "I'll drink a bottle of bleach and die." "I'll stab myself in the throat and die."

There's no easy solution. There's no simple action followed by death, but it always seems that way in my head. I imagine myself taking a knife and shoving it into myself no problem. But even when I was so done with everything and I felt like I was at my breaking point, it was nearly impossible when I tried. 

It was the same for jumping off a building. I was eight stories high and I was ready to die. I sent my goodbyes to everyone and threw my phone off the edge. I didn't even care, I was gonna be dead soon. But I was wrong. I just couldn't do it no matter how badly I wanted to. My mind wouldn't let me and I settled for buying some bleach and drinking it all. Didn't work either.

That was three months ago. Three months of feeling this horrible way and countless plans of ending it all. Three months of hospitalizations, therapy, treatment programs. I wish I could just press a button and die instantly. It's so frustrating. I'm crying right now because of how hard it is to actually kill myself. I just want to die so very bad.
