I should have a say to my lifeYou know what really sucks, when you really are sure that you don't want to be in this life anymore but it's more complicated than that. I am a sponsored student and this makes it so hard, because it literally states in the agreement that if you commit suicide, then your parents will have to pay the full amount back provided from the scholarship. I know that it is obvious and all, but I'm done but I also can't do that to my single mom. I can't put a huge $100000+ debt on her. I feel so helpless, why does my life cost so much, I feel like the government owns me, it's the only thing stopping me, god knows I tried. I can't help it, will she blame me?
