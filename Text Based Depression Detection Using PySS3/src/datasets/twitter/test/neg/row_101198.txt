I feel like self harming or committing suicide... Impulsive thoughts, someone please reach out and help meI have been having huge issues with my girlfriend (she did some pretty nasty stuff to me not abusive) to the point I don't think we're going to be okay. I need constant reassurance that I am going to be okay, otherwise I spin out and I'm not okay (I know I need to fix this issue and I am trying different ways to cope) but today was a particularly bad day my BPD feels really hard to deal with so I text her a few times, like 4 times, in a 4 hour period. And I've heard nothing back. And now my mind is ticking, like 'what if she's doing this' or 'what if she's with someone else' totally irrational thoughts but I can't push them aside and I'm scared I am going to self destruct or damage our relationship further. How do I deal with this, I feel just about ready to self harm or resign from my job or something else impulsive. Even if someone wants to chat, please I need a distraction xxx
