Not gone today but maybe TuesdayI kinda talked to some friends.  My best friend is trying really hard to be supportive and help me. 

My spouse doesn't know as much as my friend does.  He dsnt know about the suicidal thoughts or the drug bit.  I dont know how to tell him.  He can see im depressed and he is trying to help. 

I feel shitty that i cnt verbalize this to him.

All my other friends are so depressed rn that i dont know what to do. 

Even after talking to my friend about everything today i still cnt shake off the over bearing  feeling of wanting to die.  Im to tired rn to think but i dnt think im goin to last another week.
