My last dayReally considering today to be my last day. My life has been nothing but a ride through the mud with my head just barely above water. Smiling because that's what was expected of me. I can't do this anymore. This constant struggle. I have bpd (please just look it up) and I'm petrified to tell anyone because people are scared of personality disorders.
Imagine this:
You wake up in the morning, everything is great. You look in the mirror and have no idea who is staring back at you. You get scared, but smile anyway. It feels fake. It is. You're petrified but you leave the mirror....
God damnit... I don't even know why I'm trying to explain it. Fuck that... I'm sorry but I'm really just done with life. I want to die and I don't think anyone will understand what it's like in my head or my life...
I've been thinking for a few days and I'm thinking of just taking a bunch of my Flexaril(spelling). I really can't do this anymore...

If I don't get this job, I'm done.
