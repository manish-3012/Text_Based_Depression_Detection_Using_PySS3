I keep talking shit to myself and I don't know how to stop...All throughout the day I talk crap about myself in my mind and I hate it. It's not like auditory hallucinations, just my mental voice telling me how much I just fucked something up, no matter how small or big. I'm so scared of messing stuff up because of my own minds dialog. I wish I knew how to stop criticizing myself so hard.
