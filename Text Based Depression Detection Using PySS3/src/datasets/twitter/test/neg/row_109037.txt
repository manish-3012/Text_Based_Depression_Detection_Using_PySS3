How do I stop this feeling of needing someone?I kind of get the feeling that the only people I can connect to are people of the opposite sex (females). Guys just seem, I don't know, extremely hard to relate to. Girls are usually so nice and sympathetic and sweet. They make you feel good just by talking to them and you can compliment them which makes you feel even better. I've never been in an irl relationship before, save the time I got mixed up with the school slut (still a complete virgin), but she was really abusive and it only lasted a few weeks so I don't really consider it an actual relationship. To me it just feels so darn nice to be able to pour your heart out into them, or whatever little heart I have left. I feel like not having someone I am able to do this to is extremely hurtful to my health, and is one of the reasons that I am depressed a lot. Of course I can't really just come here and ask for a girl to talk to me, however nice that would be. I feel like it would be better to figure out how to not have to rely on having someone in order to feel good about myself..
