Want To Just Kill Myself, Getting Less and Less Scared of ItI really don't see how people are able to just keep going. I get so mad when I see people who are obviously happy, smiling, motivated in life, or even just able to pick themselves back up. I'm finding it harder and harder to want to keep going at all. I've dealt with depression for a long time now, but for a few years now it's been just unbearable, simply going through the motions without really feeling anything. Even at the start I had a few hobbies, but now I don't have anything. Feel bad when people as what I like to do, because I honestly just don't have an answer. It's enough I go to classes at all, completely numb and unmotivated in the slightest. I'm currently a biology and biochemistry undergrad with piss poor grades. When I started I was simply getting my generals, but at least felt a moment of joy when I declared my major. Though now I'm right back to square one, not caring about my grades and yet still feeling enraged and disappointed at myself for them. Wake up, go through classes and lab, go home, and just sit at my desk alone with YouTube or Netflix, that's really about it for me. I absolutely can't see how the hell I'm supposed to do anything with my life if I'm already like this early on. What's the fucking point?

Lately all I can seem to think about is how I'd want to kill myself. Seems like the only thing I can do. If I really did, I wouldn't mind just buying a gun or some rope and going out into the woods late at night, decrease the chance anyone could actually stop me. Hell, maybe pop as many pills as I can beforehand for fun. Doesn't matter. At first I was concerned about how much it'd hurt friends and family. But I can't keep going for the sake of others. How the fuck is that something to tell someone anyway? I've never understood how telling someone to keep suffering for your own happiness is meant to be a good thing to tell someone. Killing myself seems like the one thing I know I could do right.
