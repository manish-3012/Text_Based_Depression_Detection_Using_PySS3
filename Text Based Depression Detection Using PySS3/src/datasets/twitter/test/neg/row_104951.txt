How did you get "exposed" to suicidality?Much to my distress, my partner decided to end his life in April 2019. Before that event, I had only been exposed to suicidality in movies or cartoons when I was younger. 
All that time I was thinking.. how did the mode of suicide enter his thoughts? 
It is after that event that suicide has crossed my mind more than once, and I've realized that it has infiltrated my way of coping with life's difficulties. It would really interest me to know how you were faced with the idea of suicide. 

Maybe it could also serve as a moment of reflection for you and the environment you were present in.

I don't know.. merely shuffling my thoughts. Thank you for reading! Please have a virtual hug...
