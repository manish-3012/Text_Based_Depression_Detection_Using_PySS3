For god sake, just let me die.I just can't do it anymore. I don't want therapy, i don't want anything. I just wanted to be gone, but i lack the will to do so. Nobody lets me get drunk because they know that when i lose this fucking survival instinct nothing will stop me from doing so. I'm so tired of crying on every corner, of hiding from everyone, of hating myself, i just need to end this. There's no point on staying here.
