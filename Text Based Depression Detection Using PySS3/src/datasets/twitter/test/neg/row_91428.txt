I finally told someone todaythat I realized I just don't want to be alive anymore.  Everything I ever thought I was looking forward to has been taken away, or I lost it, and it just doesn't seem worth the effort anymore.

I've felt like this for months.  Even though I continue living, it's mostly a show.

What's amazing is how it's possible to feel so alone and unwanted.  I'm fairly good looking.  I'm pretty skinny, but in no way am I scrawny.  I'm intelligent, if just a little quirky.  I'm finally on my way to being able to finish my education in a career that should be fairly stable.  And over the past several years I've actually come out of my shell a lot, become more social, and seemingly more adapt at approaching girls that I've been interested in.  But it doesn't seem to matter.  Sooner more often than later I'm tossed aside for something new, left alone wondering what I did wrong, and no one will tell me.

What are you supposed to do, when you lose all hope for love, all hope for honesty and goodness in other people?

When someone calls asking for help, if they say they're going to commit suicide, one of the questions you can ask is if they have a plan.  The idea is to figure out if they really have the ability to harm themselves.  I've had lots of plans.  Generally I don't want to scar whoever would have to find me, so most of the more gruesome methods are out.  But I'd also like to go out as much of a man as possible.  Is that strange?

The other option is to make it seem like an accident, so my friends and family, and all the girls I've loved don't have to feel guilty, don't have to think that they did something wrong.  But how do you make it look like an accident while ensuring that you're successful?

I'm sorry if that was too much detail.
