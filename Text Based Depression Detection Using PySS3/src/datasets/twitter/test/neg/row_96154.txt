Childhood abuse is leading me to where I belong, in the dirt.I won't bore you with details about my age or gender or anything like that; just know that I'm at the end of my ropes.

I don't make enough money to apply for or afford health or medicare of any kind, so that's out of the question- don't even suggest it. I can't afford the debt if I were to walk into a hospital or ward or anything like that, so it's not worth trying because it'll just make my situation worse. My family is very dysfunctional, I've purposely burned bridges with my friends so they're not affected by my choice- so I don't have anyone to talk to. 

I just wanted somewhere to vent before I go. To tell my story one last time to someone who might read it.

I'm suffering from something that I cannot name, I've searched online for some similar experience and there's nothing. I've been able to somewhat figure it out from reading articles and studies done on animals, but it's still not quite right.

When I was a child I was severely abused by my school system and locked in a dark room alone for four months of my elementary school years. I cried loudly, hit my head on the walls of the room, wasn't allowed to sit down, use the restroom, and I only ate in secret so the teachers wouldn't know- my only solace was my mother sending my lunches during that time, otherwise I would not have been able to eat alongside all those other things I was subjected to.

I suppressed the memory of this abuse until recently, and more and more details have been coming back since and I can't take it anymore.

I don't know what that did to me, and I'll never know. Because I'm going to end my life soon. There's no research on what that abuse did to my mind, my brain, my psyche- everything I've read is only about adults or animals, and even though I'm an adult now and fell like I'm less than an animal, those results do not apply to a child who was severely abused.

I can't take not knowing anymore.
