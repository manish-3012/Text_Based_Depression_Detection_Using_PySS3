A friend I really care about is attempting to kill herself again, but I'm starting to give upThe title says most of it.

She lives in a horrible environment, where everyone she lives with hates her. Her mom literally has told her she doesn't give a flying f*ck if she kills herself. Her mom is undiagnosed (I live in a country where mental health centres are not that common), but my friend and I are convinced she is bipolar.

My friend has tried doing it multiple times, not attempting but thinking about it. I have deterred her from it multiple times, but my willpower starting to falter.... I am getting exhausted. 

If I go to her house, there is many dangers. She lives in a red zone, where crime is high. Apart from that, she is in even worse trouble if her mom finds me there, and to make matters worse, her aunt and uncle (who are assholes to her too) are friends with my parents, and they would tell them about my visit. This would all make it worse for her but I don't know what else to do

On top of all that, there is feelings involved. She is in love with me, but I don't reciprocate the same feelings. Regardless, I care a f*ckton for her, and would hate seeing her life wasted.

I don't know if this is the best place for help, but I don't know where else to ask without getting any close 3rd parties involved...
