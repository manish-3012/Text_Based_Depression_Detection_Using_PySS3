Am I too young to make the decision?Everyone I know fucking hates me. I live with my grandparents. Everyone I meet doesn't want to talk to me. Am I that fucking ugly and socially retarded. I'm 14 and this summer I never went outside because everyone I fucking look at fucking hates me. I wake up go on the internet and it's just full of fucking retards and idiots. I try to make a fucking friend and they fucking hate me too. I fuck up every single thing I do. Anything you can think of that can be fucked up. I fuck it up. I'm just a worthless piece of shit no one cares about. Every community I join every chatroom I chat in everyone just somehow fucking hates me.

See I even fucked up the stupid title. I sound like a piece of shit like I always make myself look like.
