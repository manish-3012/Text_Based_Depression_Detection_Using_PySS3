Just another person that no one knows and few care about.I have only failed. And I want to give up. Im a grown man, working a part time retail job. I have little use of my legs sure to a disease called elhers danlos. One wrong step can make me tear up and be in pain through the rest of the day and possibly the next day. I used to rely on my mother, but recently... she has changed. Where she used to be caring and considerate, she has changed to be demanding and cruel. She doesn't care anymore about my pain or my depression, and is intent on taking away from me all the things that help, in order to "teach me something". I had plans to work in a manual labor job until my elhers danlos actually made day to day life painful working retail. Then I had planned to go to school, but medical bills racked up to an absurd amount. My girlfriend of a year and a half had left me, and my health plummeted even further, to where I had to walk with a cane and be on absurd amounts of painkillers to bear standing. I went to the hospital several times with problems with my heart, which they never quite found out what exactly had happened. I'm in debt, I'm losing all stress relief and things that help my depression, my mother is demanding more and more of me, and I just can't. I can't and she won't accept that. I can't go any further right now...
