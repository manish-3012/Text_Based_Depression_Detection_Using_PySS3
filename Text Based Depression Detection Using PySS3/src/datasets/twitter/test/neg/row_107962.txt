What do I say to my therapist who found out?So my therapist had me do a survey and I thought she wouldn't know any of my answers so I was honest.  One of the questions was asking if I had thoughts of suicide and I answered yes.  Well that got flagged so now she knows and she asked me about it.  I lied that they were past thoughts and since I was uncomfortable talking about it she let it go and said she might bring it up again.  She probably thinks she can help me but she can't because I will one day commit suicide not because of how I see myself or life but because I would rather die than grow old and be in the wrong body.  Suicide is my only way out, I have no other choice.  I want to be open with my therapist because she's really nice and cares a lot about me and I feel terrible about lying to her.  I just don't want her to get me locked in a hospital somewhere or tell my family and she said she wouldn't, that she works with suicidal people but with me I know for sure I will commit suicide so that makes my situation different.  So I can't be sure that she wouldn't do something I wouldn't want if I were to tell her this.  How much should I tell her?  Is it safe to tell her?  I never needed any of you before but I do now more than ever.
