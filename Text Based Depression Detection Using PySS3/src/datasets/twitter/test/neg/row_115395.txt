I'm doneI just want to die, literally nobody would cry for me, I have no friends, my parents hate me, my brother wouldn't care, and my dogs, they're... Dogs...

I've been suicidal for quite a long time, I was bullied so much, my classmates did horrible things with me that I don't want to remember, and now I have PTSD because some dude literally died in front of me in a local surf school, and I did nothing, I was there sitting like the stupid I am.

And coronavirus, lol.
I'm from Chile, with 1000~ cases, so I don't care. But the government is inefficient af, a fucking curfew but no quarantine? More curfew for the rest of April so no holidays?

And online classes, f* my school, I have PE online classes, with some dumbass who didn't care I broke my damn leg in his fucking class, falsely accused me of stealing a $40 volleyball, and literally broke both of my legs.
