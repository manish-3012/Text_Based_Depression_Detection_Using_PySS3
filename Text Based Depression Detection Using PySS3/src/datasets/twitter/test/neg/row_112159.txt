I wish someone caredEveryone around me knows how fucked up my life is but nobody seems to care 
I donâ€™t know if this counts as wanting attention but, sometimes I just wish I could cry in front of someone so they would ask me â€œAre you okay?â€  and I could feel like if Iâ€™m leaving this world because I want to do it and not because nobody cared 

I wish I wasnâ€™t so good at hiding how much everything affects me

I wish life was like one of those Suicide short films, where someone is going through hard times and then someone asks â€œAre you okay?â€ 
But reality is that nobody cares until you are dead 
The only person that truly cares is my mom and I donâ€™t want to let her alone but I canâ€™t take it anymore, Iâ€™m so fucking tired of everything
