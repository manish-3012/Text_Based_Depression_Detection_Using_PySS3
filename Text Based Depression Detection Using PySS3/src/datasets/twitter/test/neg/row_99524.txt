I'm sick of livingMy boyfriend broke up with me, told his friends that he never loved me (although he would say it all the time to me). He told me I pressured him into loving me, then he said his definition of love is different. Even after he had made up his mind he pretended everything was fine and  continued to be loving and kiss me and cuddle me and be sexual with me for a whole day. I feel so violated. I would have never done things with him ever if he didn't love me and I told him that early on. But I can't stop imagining him cuddling me and looking into my eyes lovingly. It hurts. It hurts so much. I opened myself up in this relationship which was surprising given that I had been in an abusive relationship before. When he told me that we were done I took some benzos because I was anxious and also reached over to grab some Motrin cause the anxiety was causing severe chest pains and he yelled at me and grabbed my hair. He said he didn't want to be responsible for me ODing in his car. The rest of the ride home I was dissociating and later when I cried to him on the phone he told me that was weird and didn't sit right with him or something. (I guess he didn't believe it or something.) Since then we've argued a bit and I talked about methods of killing myself, which he gave me advice for, but then when I said I bought he he was like oh you're taking a joke too far (nothing about what I said hinted at it being a joke) and noooooo don't do it. I genuinely wonder if he wants me dead. I want to be dead. I'm in poly relationship (I guess it's monogamous now) but there's almost no love there on the other side of things. He obviously doesn't want me dead but he never kisses me or touches me or does anything sexual. He's just there. I have one friend and we haven't talked in a month. I'm completely isolated. No one gives a shit about me. My life is fucked up in so many ways. I'm asleep most of the time from a sleep disorder so I'm just wasting away in bed doing nothing. I've been taking benzos and melatonin to stay asleep even longer because that's the closest thing to death I can get right now. I'll feel bad for my family and my boyfriend and my friend if I die but I'm such a failure that I don't think the loss will be that great. They'll get over it.
