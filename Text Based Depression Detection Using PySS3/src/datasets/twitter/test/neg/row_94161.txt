An old friend saved my lifeSo yesterday was a fucking mess. Everything was falling apart and a had the greatest feeling to end my life. It was even stronger than the time I was actually trying to do it but couldn't. I was trying to text my best friend and talk to him about it but all he said was the infamous "it gets better". And then a saw that a friend with whom I drifted apart was online. I texted him that I am sorry for everything and probably going to die tonight. He actually started to question what I was feeling and why I think I should die. After finding out that I feel worthless he began to list all the fucking times I helped him in life. He stated that I am a great person and the reason he has a good life and relationship right now. "You may not see your worth but to me, you are a major part of my life" his quote. At this point, I was tearing up and decided to give life another go. Today we chatted again and he said that always will be here for me, I just need to call. 

My point is if you have a similar person in your life like my old friend HOLD ONTO THEM. They will give you hope and meaning. I wish everyone all of the best. Stay strong!
