I need help!!I have been so suicidal up to the point where I do have a plan on a way to do it. I have been suffering for a while. Every since I lost my baby in August I have been having these thoughts. I had a best friend just kill herself not to long ago... Everything is falling apart around me and I really just don't know what else to do other than ending it all..
