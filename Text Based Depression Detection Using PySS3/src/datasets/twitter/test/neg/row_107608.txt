Tired of living2020 consisted of a break up from an abuser, a few hospital visits for self harm related injuries, 2 moves, losing my job because of COVID, a car crash, and Iâ€™m exhausted.

I donâ€™t see the point in continuing how Iâ€™m going. I have a job interview tomorrow that I legitimately cannot get to because my bank account is at 0 and I donâ€™t have a car. I see no end to what Iâ€™m going through. How pathetic I donâ€™t have $40 to get food and a Lyft. Razors in my bathroom are just taunting me but the last place I want to be is the hospital, plus I was just there for a cut. 

Iâ€™m sorry for the venting. Like I said, Iâ€™m just exhausted.
