My girlfriend tried to commit suicideA little background- My girlfriend(Aby) and I both have varying degrees of depression, so we both kinda of understand what the other is going through,but hers is worse.  When she was a little kid, she was abused by her parents. She wasnâ€™t sexually abused, but she was hit by her father who was a drunk. When her mother left him, she went down a similar path as a drunk.Her mother is a nice lady, but whenever I could come over she was drunk off her mind. Her mom is a happy drunk, but completely unable to take care of herself when she is. After her mom got a boyfriend and sobered up, Aby wanted to move in with me.

So Iâ€™ve had your standard 9-5 job for a few months now.My girlfriend has an etsy account and is pretty successful with it. I usually come home beat and I have to admit that I havenâ€™t showed her much affection. I donâ€™t snap at her, get mad at her or any of that,Iâ€™ve just been really tired. Whenever she tries to â€œget it onâ€ with me in bed, I tell her that Iâ€™m too tired. The other day, I came home to her crying. I asked her what was wrong and she said that she was afraid that I didnâ€™t love her and how she felt worthless. I told her that I loved her and explained to her that Iâ€™m simply tired. I kept repeating to her that I love her and that I promise to show her more affection. She stopped crying and we hung out for the rest of the night. The next day(today) I come same times as usual. I open the door and see her crying her eyes out while sitting on the bed. I drop my bag and I asked her what's wrong. I guess she didnâ€™t hear me come because she got really startled and jumped up. When she got up, I noticed she had the .38 revolver I kept in the nightstand.I asked her again and all she said was

&gt; Aby-Stay back, please just stay back

&gt;Me- Whatâ€™s going on, Aby please, Whatâ€™s wrong

&gt;Aby- Im done, I just canâ€™t keep going on like this, I just want it to end

&gt;Me- Aby, listen to me, we can talk about this, just put the gun down. Everything is going to be alright.

&gt;Aby- Iâ€™m sorry, I hope one day you can find it in your heart to forgive me.

I saw her slowly raising the gun so I sprinted across the room and swatted it out of her hand. I held her and we both collapsed to the floor. She dug her head in my chest and started to cry and keeping repeat â€œIm sorryâ€. I tried to calm her down by caressing her hair and saying â€œDonâ€™t worry, everything is going to be ok,â€  and things like that. We laid there for about an hour, until we decided to go bed. She and I laughed about pasted memories and we were telling each other jokes. She fell asleep and now Iâ€™m here asking you for advice.I love her,but my heart is broken to know that I almost lost her.What do I do? Iâ€™m really shaken up by that and I have no idea what to do.
