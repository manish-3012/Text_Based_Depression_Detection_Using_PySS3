18 and nothing to live forMy first post here and English isn't my first language, be gentle with me. Also, sorry, long post.

I turned 18 about a month ago and this year has been hell for me. I started self harming through cutting and burning when I was 11 but stopped two years ago and instead started self harming through chain smoking and abusive sex. I slept around carelessly and asked all of my partners, mainly older men, to degrade me sexually and beat me, just so they could hurt me. That way, I wouldn't need to hurt myself. They did it for me. 

I'm quite a pretty girl, tall and thin. It wasn't hard for me to get guys, but only one has ever really loved me and he dumped me in december.

This put me on a very self destructive path. I started seeing a lot of men and neglecting everything other than my self hatred. This eventually lead to getting raped by my then best friend in march this year. I went to the cops and after that everything's gone downhill. 

All my friends thought I was lying about the rape. I went from having a lot of friends and constantly stuff to do to having none in the span of a week. They told me I'm just a disgusting whore who threw my "best friend" in jail so I'd get money. 

The last couple months I've had a single friend, and have been casually seeing a guy who made me feel like I could trust men again after the rape. I've been mostly laying at home sleeping throughout all this time, and I'm a very extroverted person, so that has really ruined me. 

The whole thing messed me up. I got thrown out of school for neglecting my grades after the rape, so now I don't have a job, or an education, or friends. 

The thing that really tipped everything over is the fact that I always go in for routine STD checks every two months. I'd read about a new STD that's started to spread in my country, that isn't that common yet and that they don't normally test for, and I asked them to test me for it. They called me back today and turns out I have it, and most likely got it from my rapist.

I texted the guy I've been seeing about it immediately so he could get tested and he flipped out on me, telling me I'm disgusting and that he doesn't wanna ever see me again. I texted my one friend, and he said he's too disgusted by me and hopes to not have to talk to me again.

I'm crushed. I feel like I have nothing left to live for - it may sound dumb, but the rape has ruined my life (at least the guy's in prison for 8 months) and I've been dealing with depression and anxiety and eating disorders for more than 11 years, I'm done with all this. I don't have any way to do the only things that make me happy, which is going to soccer games and hanging out with lots of people. 

How do you move on when everything you've loved is crashing around you? What do you do when all doors to get somewhere new are locked? I feel like I'm drowning and I've never been as suicidal as I've been recently - this final thing, losing the last bit of stability in this storm, is just it. I'm done. I want to die.

TLDR: 18 year old girl whos lost it all and really kind of very much wants to die.
