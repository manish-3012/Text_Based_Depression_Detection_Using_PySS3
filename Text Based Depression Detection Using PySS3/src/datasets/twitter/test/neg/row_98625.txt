A friend needs helpA friend of mine is in need of some help. Recently he came to me saying that he wanted to kill himself and that he â€œhates everyone and is alienated by everyoneâ€. Iâ€™m trying to help him by making this post for him so that he can get some help from you, if only by proxy. 

A few weeks back I helped him build up the courage to tell the second of his two best friends in real life about him being gay. He was incredibly worried at the time about making things weird between him and his friends and still is. More recently he started talking to me in chat about wanting to kill himself and how he hated everyone around him. 

Over the last week Iâ€™ve talked with him trying to convince him to get some help and convince him that things arenâ€™t all that bad but heâ€™s said he doesnâ€™t have control over the suicidal thoughts and is embarrassed seeking help. He isnâ€™t ready to open up to the people he knows in real life just yet but is watching this post. 

Iâ€™m worried because friends he was willing to confide in a few weeks earlier he is now disdainful of and unwilling to open up to about these issues. He really is a nice guy but seems to think everything is against him at this time, though heâ€™s still willing to talk to myself and some others online. Please help him.

edit: he's watching this post so you can talk to him if you like, responses will likely come through me though.
