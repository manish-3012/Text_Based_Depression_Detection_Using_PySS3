I'm so aloneEven when I'm around people I feel alone.  I used to be scared of death but now I just apathetic and empty all the time. I've had my heart crushed so hard and so many times, I'm convinced that no one would ever want a relationship with me, and if they do, they leave because of how messed up and depressed I am. I'll likely be alone forever at this point because I'm already 20 and I have no one that could even remotely be a possibility to date and I'm horrible at meeting people. The only people who seem to like me are guys that prey on my insecurities and end up breaking my heart to pieces. People tell me that I'm pretty and I'll find someone one day but pretty means nothing if you dont have the personality to back it up. 

Most of my friends have become distant from me. Someone I was involved with said he wanted to stay friends and hang out but hasn't really ever made an effort so I kind of lost him as a friend. Another one of the people that helped me when I was really emotionally hurting said that he doesnt want to hang out with me anymore because he dowsnt want his girlfriend to get "the wrong idea" so he's gone now.

The only person I'm alive for is my sister, but I'm so fucking alone even though I have her. I feel bad because she'll never never be the same, but I know she has a boyfriend at least that will be there for her. 

People think I'm getting better but I've never been more alone in my life. I dont care about anything anymore. All of my goals I've given up, and all of the things that used to make me happy dont anymore. I'm completely dead inside. I feel like I'm ready to just do it whenever, no one cares about me and I'm giving up.
