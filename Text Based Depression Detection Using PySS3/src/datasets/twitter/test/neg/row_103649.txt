Stick a Fork in me.Stick a Fork in me.

I was born.                                                                                      It was okay for a while.                                                              It all started changing in 2011.                                                                 Itâ€™s been downhill since then.                                               It took a very nasty turn in 2014.                                                 Life was a living, breathing hell until 2018.                             I thought things were finally looking up.                                      But the world had simply allowed me to foster a false sense of hope before dashing those hopes again.                                                                                        Itâ€™s been hard.                                                                            Iâ€™ve tried.                                                                                  Iâ€™ve fought.                                                                      Iâ€™ve struggled.                                                                   Iâ€™ve had opportunities, Iâ€™ve squandered opportunities.                                                                     I feel lonely, low defeated and small.                             
I cry tears of pain.                                                             
Iâ€™m broken.                                                                         
Iâ€™m dead.
