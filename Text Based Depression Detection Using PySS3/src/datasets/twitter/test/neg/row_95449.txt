Never thought I would do thisJust so sad and lonely I know I don't want to kill myself but I been thinking about it and that's disturbing enough. I'm tired of putting on this front I'm ok. My girlfriend left me 2 months ago I try and man up and move on but it's just so hard. We were together a year and half everyday I introduced her to my mom in jersey we live in VA I introduced her to my church I'm just so embarrassed I'm tired of living with regret I fucked up a lot my addictions made it impossible to be with me. She was my first love I should of just had sex once and let her go do whatever beside getting my heart involved and having it stomped on and ripped out. I have no friends because I was always with her i lost my car a year ago. I can't get into the army because of my possession charge I'm just so fucked up. I just sit in my room all day lonely. I just want to get away the other night I was sleep woke and I just kept seeing a shotgun on my bed it's like I just wanted it to blow my brains out I don't mean to be dramatic i take suicide seriously. I'm just so lost before I met her i never needed a girlfriend and I was happy with myself playing basketball being social doing stuff 21 year olds I wanted and was having sex and enjoyed female company but never made it a priority never really cared like I said I was happy with myself. This girl was all I knew the last year and a half dedicated most of my time with her and fell in love and I regret it because now I just always feel bad even though you could never tell. I stopped smoking weed a week ago and now I feel like for what if I can't get into the marines I feel like I may as well live a life of complacency not really having goals or whatever and keep smoking weed. Did I mess up in the relationship yes a lot I was extremely selfish but I geuss that comes with learning about love she was my first serious serious relationship. I don't want to live with regret anymore I'm tired of being lonely im tired of being bored tired of feeling like it's no hope for me and I'm just going to end up like the everyday joe. I know reddit can't fix my problems but sometime you just need to vent. I'm just lost right now and feel bad about the direction of my life and just want to get away. The memories eat away at me. I just wish things could be different.
