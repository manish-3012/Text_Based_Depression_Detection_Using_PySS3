Pretty sure I died last year. The remains aren't worth it.I changed last year, after trying to get a narcissistic sociopathic man to fall in love with me. I obsessed over him, until it felt like I was literally driven crazy by his mind games. I've never been the same since he came into my life for those 9 months. We only met 4 times.

I used to be a pretty amazing person. I relentlessly achieved a lot at university, whereas now I don't care about passing. I'm meant to be learning a script right now. Last year, I would've learnt it 2 weeks ago. It's due tomorrow. And I just...don't care. I have no fear, no anxiety, no nothing. 

I even have a boyfriend now. A nice person, but I don't know how I feel about him. Sometimes I pine and obsess for him, whilst thinking I could do better. I think I have a lot of issues. Starting Therapy tomorrow.

Sometimes I get flash thoughts of suicide. I thought this was behind me, or that I would get better with space from the sociopathic guy's manipulation techniques. But I've never been happy since. I don't love anything like I used to. 

I get a horrible sadness/fear when I have suicide flash thoughts. Hard to understand. I'm scared I'll lose control for just 1 tiny second, and do it. Does a part of me want it at the same time? It would be so easy, but I shouldn't. 

But what if I stay this unhappy? It makes logical sense to just quit whilst your ahead. I see plenty of unhappy adults - I could very easily avoid that fate for myself. It doesn't look worth it. It doesn't get better.
