I turn 29 on Feburary 9th and I'm going to kill myself before thenI contacted (via online chat) the national suicide prevention lifeline tonight. About 45 minutes after I get off with them there is a knock at my door and it's 3 fucking cops. So my day went from bad to absolutely hellish. I acted like I had no idea what they were talking about, and they eventually left.

I'm so fucking angry. I will never contact any type of mental health service ever again because of this shit.

I've tried therapy, medication, etc. if anything it's only made my depression worse.

I can't talk to anyone about it now for fear of this happening again.

So I'm going to hang myself before I turn 29 next month. I have no desire to a 30 year old virgin, with absolutely no hope of life getting any better.

I've been told the same old bullshit line "it gets better" for years now. It only gets worse, it only gets more lonely, and when you try to seek help 3 assholes with guns show up at your door. Not a doctor, not a mental health precessional, no of course not. 

Fuck life. I'm done.
