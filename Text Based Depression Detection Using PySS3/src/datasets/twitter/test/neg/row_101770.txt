Coming on 16 years of therapy and meds and its still shit.I wish I was a motivational situation. A real "it gets better." Nah bra. And trust me, the entire path has always been lit by knowing I'm my own worst enemy. I feel like my new survival mode of "I can live for 1 more day" is coming to a halt. How could that phase into anything other than the end? Oof...sorry for the ramble. Thanks for listening.
