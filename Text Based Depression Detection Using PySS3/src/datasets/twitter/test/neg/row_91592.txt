I hate everythingIâ€™ve been severely depressed for a while now... I havenâ€™t known how depressed I could get though till I joined the army. I had a bunch of friends and family that genuinely cared about me, but since being away for so long it seems like they kinda forgot about me or moved on. I left that so that people would either yell at me, criticize me, or pretend I donâ€™t exist all day every day 24/7. There has been fighting within my friend group since Iâ€™ve left and itâ€™s not the same as it used to be (Iâ€™ve been talking to them via my phone since I got to my duty station). Iâ€™m tired of hearing that I should get help, cause help doesnâ€™t help. I donâ€™t wanna go back there, but I donâ€™t wanna stay here. I donâ€™t see any other way out of this shitty life. I just wanna hit the reset button. I truly have no one rn
