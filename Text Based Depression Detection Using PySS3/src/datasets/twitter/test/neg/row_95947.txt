i'm like living in a hellish jailed sunken place of a matrix planet.i hate my parent and people tbh and i'm been tired of that absurd life each day is a repetition and i'm expecting different result my country is a piece of giant turd and the dictatorship of religion had been a huge part of the problem from that many of reasons not like that i'm 200% depressed but at that point i feel like it better if i had a gun to do that though.
