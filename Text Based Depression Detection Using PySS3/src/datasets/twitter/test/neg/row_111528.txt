I wish I could be convinced its worth it, but its notIt's not like I want to kill myself. I couldn't do that to my parents or brother, I know how much suicide affects family and friends and I could never do that. But, like if there was a car speeding towards me I know I wouldn't step away. If someone pointed a gun at me I wouldn't fucking argue. I smoke for the cancer and drink for the poison. Sometimes I push on my arm just to feel pain, pressing so hard onto the marks I make into my skin that I bleed. I don't like pain but I fucking deserve it. I don't deserve to exist happily and healthily in this fucking world. My life is meaningless because I am a human piece of garbage that isn't worth the fucking time of day. My friends pretend to like me, my parents are brainwashed into "loving" me. I have no future so why not just fucking die now, before I can disappoint the whole world even more??!!!! 

I know I'm only 17 but shouldn't I end it now before I have to fucking fail at life and school and love? Life is terrible and mine is hopeless and meaningless. People have tried to convince me otherwise but they don't know. I am in pain all the time, my mind hurts me. I am constantly miserable and tired and fucking sad. It sucks! I can't like like this anymore!!!!!
