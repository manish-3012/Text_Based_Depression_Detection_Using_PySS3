I want to leaveâ€” I suppose thereâ€™s no saving me this time.I had to make a new reddit due to privacy concerns with the only person I trusted.

I trusted her with my private information to which Iâ€™ve never even told anyone about, she made so many reddit posts about me and talked about me with people who truly donâ€™t care about her as I do, the comments hurt the most people are just so awful and utterly disgusting towards the other side of the stories. I am a piece of garbage and I deserve to die and honestly Iâ€™m okay with that.

I hate myself I *FUCKING* hate myself and I wish for a painful death right about now, Iâ€™m surprised my last attempt didnâ€™t work but I know it will do so now. I have nothing to give to this world and the more people say that I do I know they are saying it out of pity and all of that.

No one will miss me, Iâ€™m sorry for doing it but I have to. Iâ€™m sorry
