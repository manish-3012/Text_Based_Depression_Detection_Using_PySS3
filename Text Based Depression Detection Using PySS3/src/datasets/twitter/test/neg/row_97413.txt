I tried to kill myself last weekI don't really feel much better.  I just feel guilty about hurting so many people with my instability.   I don't feel like i deserve to be alive at all if all I'm going to do is hurt people. What the fuck is the point. I feel so bad about the people I hurt, I wish i could ever explain to them how guilty I feel.  But right now, god, I just hope i die in my sleep and never wake up.
