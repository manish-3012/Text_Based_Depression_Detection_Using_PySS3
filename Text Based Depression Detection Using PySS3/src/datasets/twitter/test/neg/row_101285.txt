People in school make me want to kill myselfI don't know why, but few "mates" from my school started bullying and insulting me recently. A lot of people tell me I'm handsome, I have well-groomed apperance and I'm well dressed. I always think a lot about what others say about me and I take eveything seriously. So they're kidding about my face, I've been exercising for few months and I can see some results in my body and know they're telling me I'm fat, maybe I really am but I can't see it? I don't know what have I done to them and why're the so mean. I'm a nice and genial guy, I never insult others cause I don't like it and I don't need to. You might think it's a trifle but it makes me depressed very badly. I used to love going to school, but now I'm scared of being offened. Otherwise, I've been having depression for about a year related to other things and I've been thinking about suicide many times but I never attempted to. I was actually fine for a while and now these people laid me down and my depression is worse than before. I just want someone or something to kill me cause I feel like nobody needs me and my depressed life feels like hell. When someone insults me, I can't fight back and I always regret that after all, I wish I could be brave enough to tell someone in face what I think, but I just can't. I don't know what to do... Sorry for my english.
