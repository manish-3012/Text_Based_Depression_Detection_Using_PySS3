Dear DiaryYou know, A while back, when I was introduced to Reddit, I was shown a channel called r/WatchPeopleDie. Then I went awol for a while, then I came back for the memes, area 51 and all that. But I realised that they had created a community here. People who care, though this being worldwide (or is it?) there might be trolls as well. I have no purpose in this life. I have a dysfunctional family of more than 20 brothers and sisters (my dad was polygamous). Yet I feel so alone. I am unable to die, though I bled a lot for a while, around 2 litres only. I did not get as deep as I would have wanted. In my defence, I did not know better. I do not, rather, I find a very hard time understanding emotions. My life is ruled by reason. Emotions are not. I wish for human company. someone to sit, and listen, and not judge. God knows I have done that a lot for people. I am a developer. I spend most times with my computer than with people... I wish to reinvent myself. I have a passion in teaching. But I lost my job in doing that because I took care of someone. Oh well.
