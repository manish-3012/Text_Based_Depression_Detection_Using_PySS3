I don't feel good.. It's like my best option is to end it..My sister just more or less confirmed that I am not part of her family.. which means I am utterly and completely alone.. No one gives a damn about me..
Not worth shit.. even if I help people with their various computer problems it's not enough to them even caring about me..
I feel like I've had enough.. A whole life and noting to show for it.. except fear, debt and loneliness.. Right now eternal peace seems inviting..
