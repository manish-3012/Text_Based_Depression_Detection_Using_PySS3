I have a serious dilemma. Roommate is spiraling out of control...Moved to Boston in January. I leave in August. My three roommates are total strangers and one of them, who has been in the same room for seven years, is showing signs of serious disorder. 

He is a major alcoholic and takes Venlafaxine and Clonzepam. Last week I woke up to four policemen and a paramedic in my kitchen. Someone had called them in and they surrounded him, asking him how much he had to drink. He said "just two shots" in a very dilapidated manner. That night he stayed in a hospital and listed me as a contact. 

Our apartment is disgusting. His room is covered in trash, clothes, power cords, empty whiskey bottles, and cigarette butts.  

Then I find out that our rent is $8,000 in the hole. He is very difficult to talk to and the four of us hardly speak. So now I'm in communication with his brother and sister-in-law who are reluctantly going to help him pay the rent.

He doesn't work and doesn't go to school, he lies to his family about school and getting job interviews. I hear him screaming and vomiting and banging on the wall every night. He stumbles around, breaking things and making a mess. 

He needs to go to rehab or something because this situation is only worsening. 

I'm very scared to live with him and I don't know what to do. I am the only one who, when the situation arises, speaks to him in a helpful and friendly manner. But at the same time I am scared for my own safety. 

Do any of you have ideas about what I can do to calm down or maybe reach out to him? Thankyou.
