I think Iâ€™m going to go through with itIâ€™m 33yrs old, struggling to complete my degree in Psychology (ironic), and Iâ€™m stuck in a marriage with an abusive wife. I have ocd, ptsd, adhd, phobias, panic attack disorder, depressing, and the list goes on. Even if I leave my wife (I canâ€™t afford to), I canâ€™t escape her subtly abusive ways. On top of my own issues, I feel like sheâ€™s sucked the life out of me, literally. I donâ€™t even know how I came up with the energy to type any of this, as Iâ€™ve felt extreme fatigue over the last week. Idk if Iâ€™m going to do it but I really want to hang myself, more than ever before.
