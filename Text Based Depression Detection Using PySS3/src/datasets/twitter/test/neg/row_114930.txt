I hate being maleAs a male, I'm expected to not show emotion and to instead be emotionally "strong". Well that's not easy considering I'm autistic, have anxiety, I'm depressed and I want to kill myself. I'm also expected to be outgoing, extremely social and not awkward, but it's just impossible. I'm sure I just make people uncomfortable instead. I'm only saying this here because I'm anonymous online. I wouldn't dare show any negative emotions in real life unless I'm with people who accept me. Also, men are pressured to be physically attractive just as much as women are. However, I feel it's harder to make yourself look good as a man unless you're extremely lucky. Again, men also can't complain about any of that because they'll be deemed as weak, attention seekers and just "trying to get sympathy from women". Women get a lot of support and are encouraged but men aren't as much (of course women's issues are important too, I'm just saying that men's issues also exist and should be talked about because I believe in gender equality). I also hate being awkward and physically unattractive because I feel worthless and I don't know how to properly interact with people like a normal person. I'm reluctant to talk to women because I fear I'll just be making them uncomfortable. Actually, I would be doing the world a favour by killing myself. Maybe I'll take an overdose right now. I'm so tempted but my parents are still alive and I can't do that to them, so I will just have to stay miserable and hope my life gets better even though it won't.

Again, I believe in gender equality and think women's issues are just as important. I actually care about women's rights and women's issues. However, there are also issues men face. Both should be addressed.
