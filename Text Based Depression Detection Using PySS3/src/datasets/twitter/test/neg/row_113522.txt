This probably doesn't belong hereI'm sorry if this all doesn't make sense I'm just typing.

I dont have a shit life. Like I have a beautiful girlfriend, supportive parents,starting a diploma and a car that I love but I just cant seem to stay...."happy".... things always get me down like really down to the point where I have self harmed, I was diagnosed with depression when I was about 12 or 13 and stopped taking the meds for it at about 15 idk why I stopped taking them but nothing really affected me till I was about 16 and a half where I would just get so upset over shit and it didnt help I was in a decently toxic relationship like that girl has made a permanent scar on me, I used to self harm heaps but I've self harmed over many things two main ones being the death of my step dad and nan, I owe so much to both of them and I did shit all when they needed me and now I'll forever regret not going to visit my step dad regularly in hospice and not wanting to call my nan on sundays because I was too ignorant of a kid to understand how important those were I usually self harm because I'm doing to replicate the pain I caused them and ik people are going to say things like "they never would of wanted you to do that" or " you didnt cause them pain" but that's bullshit of course I caused them pain who wouldn't be hurt if someone you put effort and love into them wouldn't visit you heaps while you're on your death bed. I said at the top I have a beautiful girl friend in which I do she's anything and everything i would want but i just cant seem to put my full trust in her like i love her it's just i dont want to get hurt again. I've been cheated on multiple times and used as a toy because they were bored or because no one else flirted with them and now i have massive trust issues i cant even imagine to explain. We are almost at a year of dating and honestly I cant believe she's still with me, but I still keep self harming I have all these great things but I just cant seem to be happy all I can think about is negative things, I still self harm but I've changed where I do it because she now regularly checks my shoulders when she thinks I'm depressed I dont want to worry her but she thinks she's not doing enough if I'm still doing it but she's doing amazing it's just I need to feel that pain because I've caused it to other people and at some points it helps me and it's the only thing that's real at that time, I often think of how it would just be better if I ended it because then all this sadness would stop but I cant because I have her. To be honest she's the only reason why I havent gone any deeper not my parents not my friends or my siblings it's her. And only her.

My mum and brother used to blame me/dish their anger and sorrow from my step dad death onto me this could be from shouting at me to my mum choking and slamming me into walls...what are you suppose to do against your mum? Nothing is the answer I told myself then and would still now, just put up with it...because you deserve it, that's what I would tell myself. I would always remember his funeral because I couldn't cry. Even though I tried I just couldn't cry. I can now. 
They would also slander me for that as well, this carried on for about a year, he died in 2015.

As for my nan no one did anything to me apart from myself I respected her alot and loved her alot more than my mother because she was a lot nicer I didnt have to worry about getting hit or thrown into somthing from her she was what my mother should of been but it her last year I was naive and didnt call her as much as I should then she got cancer and went down hill very fast. I made it just in time two days before she died at this time I lived with my father in another part of the country. I flew down the night my mum told me she was going down hill because she was fine at first and I wasn't scheduled to fly down for another couple days but she took a dive so I took the earliest flight down. I went to the hospital to see her on her death bed in my ball suit as it was my school ball the next night. She could on just barely see me and talk it was one of the most painful things I've ever had happen to me was seeing her like this and remembering all the times I missed Skype calls because I forgot because I was too busy gaming I still beat myself up for it she had done so much for me both of them my step dad and her and all I had done was be a selfish prick
