Nobody IRL I can talk to about this.I canâ€™t tell anyone how frightened, dreaded, hopeless and suicidal I have become in the past few weeks. I tried, but then I lied. went to get some kind of counseling and maybe rx for depression, anxiety, and hypothyroid. Of course dr. Wants to make a fuss about my blood pressure. So I fill in the surveys about depression, anxiety, and bipolar. I have no mania at all, so yes on the first two. Dr asks if I ever attempted suicide, i admit yes, 2x. She looked concerned and asked if I have any plans. Like what, to find a job? No, plans to do myself in. I said no. I know, you never admit you have plans, they can take legal/physical action against you if you admit to it. Not always, but it is possible. I have nobody I can really be 100% authentic and honest about my dread, pain, and obsession to leave the fucked up planet. I have the equipment to do the DWD and will leave it at that. We donâ€™t discuss methods. I can say the first time I attempted was a bucket of drugs and alcohol, and being dedicated, I decided to blend up the concoction for better absorption. Was entirely passed out for 4 days, some time during the blackout I vomited. Was not really happy to wake up alive, but it was like ECT to the brain, broke up the rumination and obsession to die, was just numb and flatline. I have no reason to live or hang on and fucking struggle any more. To tell people I know this, it only hurts them and/or pushes them away. I read dozens of posts here every night when Iâ€™m feeling suicidal. I can have compassion for others but not myself. My life is shit and it rolls down hill. No chance it will get better, so why the fuck bother? People just lie to my face to tell me it will get better. Iâ€™m angry, and more or less resigned that itâ€™s time to call it quits. So now I will pull up the covers and curl up in a ball. Sleep helps.
