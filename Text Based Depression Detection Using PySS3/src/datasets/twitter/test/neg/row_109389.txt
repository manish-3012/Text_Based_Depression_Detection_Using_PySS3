iâ€™ve told my therapist i was having suicidal thoughts and she didnâ€™t help me. perhaps itâ€™s a sign.I thought that once I talked to my therapist about my suicidal thoughts sheâ€™d help me but she hasnâ€™t. 
at this point Iâ€™m afraid to be left alone because I canâ€™t control my impulses. before I was too afraid to kill myself because I didnâ€™t want to fuck it up and quite possibly become a vegetable or go into a coma but now that doesnâ€™t faze me. nothing seems more welcoming then bliss nothingness.
