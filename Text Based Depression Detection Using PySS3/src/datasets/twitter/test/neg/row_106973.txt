No one to talk toI really have a few friends who say they care about me and that I should let them know when I'm down, but I'm down all the fucking time. I'm tired of being around myself all the time, they surely don't want to either. I've been burned by people before so I guess I don't ever fully believe them when they say they care. 

I'm just too messed up and weak and needy to go on. I've thought about calling someone up but it's 3:30 am, everyone is asleep and wouldn't want to talk anyway. If I were dead I wouldn't feel this way and no one would have to worry about helping me. I feel like I'm holding people back. 

I get no enjoyment from life, I have no logical basis to assume things will get better. Things don't just magically change. I'm not going to wake up and be happy. I'll have to change myself, which is highly unlikely to happen. 

I've pretty much known I'd end my own life for a while now, it's just finding the right moment. I don't have a plan because everything seems painful. OD is unlikely to work without stronger meds. Hanging, cutting, and suffocating all seem very painful. Gun would be quick but I don't own a gun and don't want to leave a gruesome scene for someone to find either. I just want to check out, fall asleep and never wake up. 

I'm sorry I feel this way, but I just can't take the anxiety, self hatred, fear, and sadness anymore. I have nothing to look forward to. I just want someone to notice me. 

When friends ask me how I'm doing I say "couldn't be happier." They assume I mean 'I am very happy' when really it's 'I am physically incapable of being happy.' It's childish but I just can't seem to bring myself to tell them in person how I feel. It's easier to tell strangers on the Internet I wish I hadn't been born than my closest friends. But really, they won't care. They can't do anything. So disclosing won't change anything. It ultimately all comes back to me. I have to choose to be happy and actively work towards it. 

I've tried, but I don't think I can be happy.
