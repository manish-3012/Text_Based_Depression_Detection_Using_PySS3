I can't keep living like this...I don't know what else to do...

I've dealt with severe depression and anxiety for years. The older I get the worse it gets. Now, I've found out that I have some potentially serious medical issues which are basically making me even more useless than I already am. I'm 28 years old, and I've achieved nothing in my life except being particularly excellent at failing and giving up.

I'm having severe debilitating pain almost 24/7. I can't work. I can barely walk. I can't function without pain medication, and I'm scared of addiction. I'm going to the doctor, and seeking treatment. I'm on antidepressants, I talk with a therapist...but it's just getting worse. Every time I take two steps forward I get shoved fifty steps back it seems.

I've talked to my boyfriend many times. He and his family are understanding so far, but it doesn't make me feel any better because I can't help. I'm a leech now, and I hate myself for it.

I've wanted to die for years. I've attempted before, but obviously wasn't successful.

I want to die now more than ever. I AM a burden. I am broken. Something is really wrong with me. No matter how much everyone tells me I'm not...I know I am. I can see it. I feel it.

I'm having constant breakdowns all the time. I'm scared, and I feel like I'm going insane. Everything feels too real and not real at all-all at the same time.

I'm sick of feeling this way, and I want it to end. I've convinced myself that I don't matter. I don't contribute to society in any way. Everyone I know would be better off without me.
