No one caresI know my mom cares and my immeadiate family cares but they just ignore me when I wanna talk, I got a 6 pack of strong beer and have taken about 1.5 mg xanax and had 3 beers. I really don't know guys my life is hell with my anxiety and depression and I'm genuinely afraid of what I'll do next. I love life when I'm high but living sober is a fucking nightmare. I don't know what to do, I've lost hope. I never understood thoughts of suicide until a few months ago, and now I get it completely.
