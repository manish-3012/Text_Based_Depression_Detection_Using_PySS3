Bully payback helpMy best friend is getting harassed and bullied SEVERELY by a woman she doesnâ€™t even know.
Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said â€œdo the world a favor and go kill yourselfâ€ as well as â€œwhen I find you itâ€™s gonna be the fucking end of youâ€ as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, Iâ€™m guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman wonâ€™t stop. Its going on 5 days now. The woman has created 17 Instagram accounts to harass her over, as well as so far 7 phone numbers, as well as 2 Facebook accounts. 
Itâ€™s mentally disturbing my friend at this point. Sheâ€™s been constantly tired. Iâ€™m trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she wonâ€™t and isnâ€™t doing well. I think sheâ€™s really overwhelmed and itâ€™s getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself. 
This bullying woman calls herself a reverend, therapist, witch, light worker, and healer. She is also a personal trainer. HOW?!
With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.
