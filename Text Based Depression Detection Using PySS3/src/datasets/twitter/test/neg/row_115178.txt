Too weak for this worldWho am I kidding. I tried to live my life by the rules, but what's the point. I've been here before, when my ex left me. I never loved someone so much before. They say there are plenty of fish in the sea, but that's a bunch of bs. Who cares how many fish there are, she was the one. I was sent to a mental hospital following a suicide attempt. I lost many friends and my job. I try to move on, have taken meds, in the end what's it all for. I don't even care much about the future, if she is not here. People tell you to play by there rules, think about everyone you will hurt, Think about everything you will miss out on. Yeah at this point my life has become stagnant, no will left to push me forward. I tried to move forward, but it just doesn't seem to be happening. I look at myself and ask, Why do I keep going? Anything I come up with just isn't good enough anymore. I can't lie to myself anymore. I can't keep going anymore, i feel like it's just a matter of time now.
