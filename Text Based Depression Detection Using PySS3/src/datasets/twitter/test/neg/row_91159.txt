This is my letter to you, the World. A world that I have loved dearly, cherish a lot, and realise I canâ€™t have a place here anymore.Since I was 11 years old, Iâ€™ve had this issue where I never saw a point to living. I had no meaning in my life, and fought incredibly hard to assign my own meaning to life. I knew that simply hoping that something in my life would inspire a meaning to it wasnâ€™t the way to go. I knew I had to work hard to find my own meaning to give my life. So I set myself these goals. 
If I made it through school, I would get to college and find a larger pool in which I could find a meaning to life. Similarly once I got to college, made lots of new great friends, fell in love and the likes, I decided that because that hadnâ€™t changed things, I would make it to the end of college and get out to the working world where I would have a large variety of avenues I could explore to give my life meaning. So thatâ€™s what I did. Through extreme trials and tribulations where I made and lost friends, suffered through an abusive relationship where I came out the other side for the better and ended up in my ideal job, I found new avenues to explore. I travelled, earned money, searched hard for something to assign to my life as a meaning to live for. I confronted my problems head on by getting help and going on a voyage of self-discovery. I found things I genuinely loved in life. I made some friends who are absolutely friends for life, who I am my complete self with. Friends that I donâ€™t need to pretend to be someone else for. I even met a woman who is perfect for me in every way, and I fell for deeply. 
And eventually I realised that I still have the same mentality of â€œif I lose any of this, if anything goes wrong for me, I can just kill myself with a simple phone callâ€. 
What kind of a mentality is that to have, when you have everything you could possibly want from life. 
I have friends, a supportive family, I am â€œlovedâ€ my many, and everyone sees me as this great beacon of happiness and support. And I couldnâ€™t feel more empty and lonely. Because at the end of the day, I still havenâ€™t been able to find some reasoning for myself to keep living. 
I went through a 1 year period where I decided to enjoy everything to its fullest, and at the end of it, I was going to kill myself. When the date came that I had set for my suicide, I disposed of everything I was going to use. It was the first time in my life I considered the consequences that those actions would have on all the people in my life. 
I am not bragging, and I am doing my best not to sound like the biggest, most ungrateful cunt on the planet, but I know that I have a lot more going for me in my life than a lot of the people that frequent this sub. I have â€œstability. For me, the definition of stability is a stable job, stable friendships, stable family relationships. Everything on top of that is a humongous bonus that should be cherished incredibly. And despite having all of these things, I still donâ€™t want to live. 
Every day is a struggle for me. I have to constantly battle with my head for control of myself so that I donâ€™t impulsively kill myself. But why am I resisting it anymore? Itâ€™s not changed. I still want to do it. I still have no desire to live, I havenâ€™t found something to assign to my life as a reason for being. Iâ€™ve had people try to get me through it by suggesting that life doesnâ€™t have to have a meaning. But if thereâ€™s no meaning, then why do I do it? So Iâ€™ve reached the conclusion that I am going to live out the next 10 weeks of my life finishing up all my planned trips with friends and family, enjoy the company of those close to me, and then once Iâ€™ve gotten through it all, I will finally kill myself. 
To those who are deeply suicidal because they donâ€™t have access to the kinds of supports and scaffolds that I have, I am deeply sorry. I know how ungrateful I sound. I would actually give anything to gift what I have to all of you, so that you do not have to suffer through what youâ€™re going through. Even though I donâ€™t know you, I love you all, and I think that maybe there is a chance that you can get through it to the other side. Find your own semblance of stability and balance in your life, find your reason to be. But I cannot go another year in my life feeling the way I do. Because itâ€™ll always end up with the same result; me killing myself. 
So this is my last letter to anyone who has the time to read this. 
Anyone who is reading this, I hope you are doing well because there is someone out there who needs you. Someone out there who can help you through it, someone or something that can help you find a meaning in your life. Even those these words completely contradict everything Iâ€™ve written above, I do firmly believe that these situations are a person-by-person, case-by-case basis. Just because Iâ€™ve done all these things in my life and not found a reason for being, it does not mean that you wonâ€™t. I donâ€™t want anyone to go down the same roads and paths Iâ€™ve gone down and end up where Iâ€™m at. So please, keep trying. I love this world, I love the people, I love everyone who was and still is in my life; both the good and the bad. 
And for a bit of family based selfishness: to my grandmother who passed away a few years ago: I love you so much, and if thereâ€™s is anything after we die; I hope I see you. Because I miss you so terribly. 
To anyone who has read this: thank you.
