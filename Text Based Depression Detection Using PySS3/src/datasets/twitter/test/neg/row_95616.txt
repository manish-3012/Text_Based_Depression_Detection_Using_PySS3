I'm thinking about threatening suicide to one of my professors. I know that this is very bad attention-seeking behavior. But what's the worst that could happen?In case anyone wants some background, I come from a household that doesn't really care about me.  All my life I've been treated as some sort of object by my parents, not an actual person with their own feelings and aspirations.  In addition I was hidden away from the outside world which I was constantly told was evil.  Now, as I am 22 years old and going to college, I still have a lot of trouble with socialization and lack of self worth.  Random things will trigger spirals of self-loathing and fear.  It can be hard to go to school sometimes knowing that I have never had any friends, but I desperately long for someone who cares about me.  The closest person who fits this description is one of my teachers, who I have three classes under this semester.  He respects me and likes talking to me even though I know he's a lot smarter and more well-off than I am.  But now it's gotten to the point where I feel so rejected by my peers that I want to get his attention in a big way just so I know that he cares about me.  I WANT him to worry about me.  And I think that the best way to do this is to exploit how I'm feeling and threaten suicide, even though that's really not what I want right now.  I ultimately just want him to notice me enough to care, something that no one else in my life has really, truly done.  What I'm really wondering is what could become of this.  Will I get in trouble with the law?  Will I be forced to go to an institution?  I've already been in mental facilities several times already and they're horrible places to be in, so I want to avoid them if at all possible.  What should I do?
