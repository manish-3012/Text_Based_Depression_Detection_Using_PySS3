Is there anyone here???I have already posted in SW twice and I tried looking online but didn't find what I need.

At the moment I do not have any kind of medical insurance and I'm having a bit of a time getting it back. Long story...
I am in Brooklyn, New York and want to ask if anyone on here knows of a psychiatrist/psychologist/counselor, etc who will see me for free? I receive zero income. ZERO... So I can't do a sliding scale whatsoever. 

It's a shot in the dark but I know if I don't see a doctor soon and talk things out with someone who will help me, I will definitely kill myself. I cannot keep surviving on my own with no one to help me or really talk to. I cannot keep being in pain and constantly crying til it feels like I'm literally choking and can't breathe. I made it through this week but it feels like very very very soon that I'll be gone forever.

So again I'm in Brooklyn, New York and in desperate need of a qualified mental health doctor who will help me through my darkness. If there's anyone here with information that they can share with me, please do. I'm drowning.
