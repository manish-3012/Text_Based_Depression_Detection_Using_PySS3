A burden.That's how I feel, I lie, I cheat, I even steal from my own parents. I do nothing to make this world better. I've tried to change, but I can't it's who I am. I have no real friends, at least none that I could trust to help me, and I feel like I'm a burden to this world. I think, I might just leave, give them some excuse about going to find myself, and the end it somewhere remote and far away. So I won't be a burden to anyone anymore.
