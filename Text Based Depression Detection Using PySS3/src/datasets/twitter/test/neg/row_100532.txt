I'm doneI'm so done with life. All we do is go too school mostly of our lives then go into debt and then die. I'm at the point where I just want to end my life. I spend most of my time in bed, I don't eat as much as I used to. Tried to kill myself by overdosing on pills but the only things that happened were vomiting and stomach pain and then went on with the rest of my day. I'm just looking for the best pills to kill myself I found some oxy in my parents bedroom. How many pills do I have to take in order for it to kill me in my sleep. P.S. there's no point in telling me life is going to get better......its not I've been told that so many times at this point it's predictable what people are going to say when you're depressed. So please just answer my question about the oxy and I'll be on my way.
