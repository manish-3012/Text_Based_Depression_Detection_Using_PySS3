Work ironically keeping me aliveThe only thing keeping me going right now is work and that is almost done. People need me to do my part until next week and they would be fucked without me, so I guess I'll be here until then. Once the projects I'm working on are done, well, that is a good stopping point. My boss is a friend and a mentor to me, so the idea of disappointing her is all that's really there. I guess that is kinda funny: I'm past concern about how my family will be devastated when I die, but the idea of my boss being disappointed in me is keeping me here right now. Once that baggage is gone at the end of the month, I don't know what I'm going to do. I bought a gun to kill myself a couple weeks ago. I hope I can finally use it and just be done. I'm tired of life. It's just a bleak, endless, featureless expanse. There is no hope of it ever being better. I can't do it anymore. I just want to give up. I don't know why I am bothering to try to put my thoughts into words right now. This is no different than any other fucking post here.
