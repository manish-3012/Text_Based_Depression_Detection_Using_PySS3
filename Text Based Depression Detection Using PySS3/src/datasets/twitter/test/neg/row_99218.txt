You ever feel like you lost the one?I just broke up with my girlfriend a little under a month ago. Long story short, we just can't be together right now. Mostly because I need to work on myself. I just feel so down though. We were only dating for 3 months. But I legitimately feel like I lost the one. I've been in way longer relationships, but I feel like none of them have effected me this much. I feel like I want to kill myself, I don't think I'll find anyone like her.
