I hate myselfI feel like noone cares, I feel so insignificant. Like a little speck of dirt, or as someone once told me, I'm like like a stain on a shirt. 

I should have the right to choose how my life ends, and I think people should accept that. No one has to go through what I go through but me. No one has to experience the feelings I feel but me. I have to fucking suffer through all of it.

My psychologist says we all have thousands of passing thoughts every day but we may not always act of them. 

I dont understand why, in todays society, if one is suicidal they are deemed mentally ill because of it. Not everyone has the desire to live, perhaps they've honestly given it their all and they just weren't made for this world. 

I think Ive given life a good shot. I've experienced love - not for long but thats good enough for me. I've experienced what poverty looks like, I've provided help to those in a third world country. Heck, i'm the type of person to drop everything for anyone who needs help. But i just can't seem to help myself anymore.
