I contemplate suicide even though I have no reason toIt is my first time posting it here, and I'm doing it cause I'm able to remain anonymous.

I've sometimes caught myself entertaining thoughts of suicide, sometimes idly when I'm on the bus and just evaluating my life, sometimes when things are bad and I'm upset. It doesn't happen frequently, but it happens.

I'm unable to talk about it because I feel like it would freak people out. Cause here's the fucked up thing about me - I'm actually engaged to marry, and my life has never been better. In that sense, I never have to worry about money or if I'm able to feed myself, I've a loving partner whom I love so much and I miss so much because we're in a LDR.

What prompted me to post this was because a couple of days back I found myself being increasingly anxious about everything. I find that I have a need to plan out my life properly and panic when there is uncertainties. I imagined worst case scenarios all the time and find that I actually would consider just ending it all because I wouldn't need to worry anymore.

I decided to take a chance and post it here instead of talking with my friends. I don't understand what is wrong with me for contemplating this.
