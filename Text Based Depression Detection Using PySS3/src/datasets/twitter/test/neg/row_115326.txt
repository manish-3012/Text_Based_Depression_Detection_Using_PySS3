Global warming anxiety has been hitting me hard for the past week.I feel. absolutely horrible. To know I'll die before I get a chance to even live out my middle age. To die before I get a chance to move to Poland with my beautiful friend of 5 years. That was our plan. On the day I flew in we would kiss each other on the spot and I legitmitly thought of making plans to propose to her. But i wont get the chance to do that. I'll just sit here while people around me waste their breathe to get 80 year old Republicans to listen to their ""stupid and childish"" ideas.

I guess it's not all bad. I can rent a nice hotel room and binge the drugs I was too scared to take out of fear for my health.

My only wish is that I could somehow tag that type of stuff so I wouldnt have to see it. Because everytime I see new information by someone on Twitter I've never heard of my heart will start racing. I dont need that. But if I were to tell anyone to please tag it with something related to global warming or climate change I get called ignorant or that I dont care.
