Over it already honestlyI honestly hate my life right now just been living in darkness for 2-3 years already. My family treats me like absolute shit, all I have are fake friends, girls only use me in the end, people casually talk shit in front of me and behind my back, the most important person in my life passed away, I dont even have my own dad in my life, people gets mad at me for the smallest shit, and so far I never truly felt happy for awhile now, I'm just starting to lose myself, cus at this point I dont even know who's the real me, I just put on so much different masks that I lost track of my self and I just be holding all this in since theres nothing that I can do its just so tiring that I just wanna go to sleep and never wake up again. I mean I tried to OD but failed on multiple occasions and i know that if i do die no one would even care I'm just that irrelevant. I ligit stay up all night thinking "why cant it all just end" and so far only a few friends know of this but they all just treat it as a joke and it honestly hurts so much I dont know what to do so what's the point in living anymore what's the point of reliving all of my mistakes. Now you may say that in the future I'll find someone in the future but I honestly wont and I know that because so far I've only been used and thrown away so fuck it I really do have no point in living anymore I truly am just a wast of space if only someone could just take over for me so I would9have to live in this nightmare any longer.
