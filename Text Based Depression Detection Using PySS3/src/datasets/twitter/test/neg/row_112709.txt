Thinking about Resetting my CharacterWhile this post title is tongue-in-cheek, the contents of this post aren't.

Depression has been a recurring theme in my life since I was 15 or so - which is over 20 years ago. I have been diagnosed three times. Medications and counselling have not helped, and I constantly feel emotionless about almost anything I do.

Since my first diagnosis I have secured a good job, have a nice home, have children and a happy wife. So there are no external factors that are causing me to write this, or think this way. Even contemplating leaving this earth and the effect it may have on my family has little effect.

My wife has a vague feeling something in my life is askew, but tends towards the cliched (affair, childhood trauma etc). And it is not something I want to share.

My feelings about suicide are becoming stronger and it feels like a case of when, not if (very close to finishing it last year). I wonder if sometimes I sabotage work projects, relationships, plans to provide the justification to do it.

Unsure what to expect from posting this. Thanks if you have taken the time to read it.
