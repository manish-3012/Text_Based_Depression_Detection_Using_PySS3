I canâ€™t stop fantasying about this one scenario.Iâ€™m hooked on benzos and donâ€™t see a way out. Every time I try to lower my dose I get extremely depressed and anxious. In all honesty, suicide hasnâ€™t been in my head for a while and overall Iâ€™ve been fairly hopeful for the future. The last few days however, the want to kill myself has been pretty much consistent. All I can think about is picking up 100 Xanax, possibly some Oxy and a bottle or two of spirits, walking up to a high cliff and sinking away peacefully. Normally I would talk to friends about how Iâ€™m feeling but everytime my parents have been alerted and any attempt at suicide has been made impossible. This time Iâ€™m leaving my options open..... No showing any warning signs. I love my friends and I love my parents and itâ€™s going to break them if I kill myself but as selfish as it is, itâ€™s not something Iâ€™m gonna be thinking about once Iâ€™m dead.
