I think I have a good reason to end myselfTRIGGER WARNING: SUICIDE

This is a throw away account, as I'm usually not one to post things like this publicly.

I guess I'll give you the lay-down of my situation: 

A year ago, after a depressive break down at a dead end job left me hospitalized and unemployed, I've decided to move back to my home town in order be certified to build websites. My reasoning was that if I could gain a skill that would be valuable to today's market, in addition to my current BFA, I could potentially give myself a chance to be more employable and financially independent. I signed up with a community college (because for-profit schools are predatory), set up healthy boundaries between me and my family, and felt like I was making a positive change for the future. It seemed like things we're looking up. 

Cut to now, and I am a 26 year-old dead beat who lives out of his grandmother's basement, has to rely on his father for financial support, who's only job prospect is an "internship" at a graphic design studio, and who lacks personal discipline/self-organization/planning skills what so ever.

Before I talk about anything else, I will state that I am fully aware that I am the cause of my own misfortune, and as a result, my family have to suffer for my actions. Every time I mess up (scratched my grandmother's car at a garage, get sunblock stains on my mother's furniture, etc.), I go through an emotional break where I end up hating myself for a few days, finally let go, and then proceed to forget everything I should have learned from my own mistakes. Not only that, but I am inconsiderate of other people's feelings, often side-tracked by work that stops me from focusing on other work, and lack the ambition and discipline to actually make actual lasting change in my life.

I am not here to present myself as some "tragic" victim of a cruel world. Instead I am going to be truthful: I'm just some asshole who never learns. I live an otherwise privileged life and have a family who, despite screwing them over repetitively, loves me very much. On all accounts, I'm lucky; Other people have it worse. What I realize is that I'm parasitic, I take and never give back, and whenever I try to change this about myself, I just go back to square one. The funny thing about rock bottom is that it's not a one time thing that people hit and progress from their; It's a constant loop of repetitive failure, an inability to learn from past actions and a unwillingness to change bad habits.

At this point, I realized that the only good thing I may contribute to society, as well as my family, would be for me to end myself. Ideally, I would like to go to somewhere beautiful (a national/state park), find an isolated high place, and then jump towards my death and become carrion to whatever finds my remains. I would like to leave a note for my family, sating why I chose to die and instructing them to cremate my remains (if found) and to not hold a funeral. I don't want to be remembered for anything.

This might be a post where I might just ignore it for the next couple of weeks, or I might actually take initiative in my life for once and end things once and for all. All I know is that I want to make sure I don't leave a impact that would significantly harm someone. I understand that killing myself would be detrimental to my family's emotional wellbeing, but in the long run, they would be in a better place not having to worry or take care of someone like me. The only reason I am making this public is mostly trying to find a place to vent. Part of me wants me to think this plan is all wrong, and that I only want verification that I still "matter". Also, I feel that telling my therapist the true extent of my plans would land me back into a psychiatric ward, and thus burdening my myself with medical debt.

This has been an issue that I have been dealing with for years now. I guess now I understand that disappearing into the woods would be a better alternative then living the parasitic lifestyle I have now.

TLDR: I am a human parasite who is unable to learn from past mistakes and realize that this is harming everyone I love. Going into the woods to die is a better alternative that putting other people through hell.
