Nobody cares whether I live or die, so I want to dieI'm ready to die. I wept tonight telling my boyfriend how I wanted to just peacefully die. He said nothing. I tell my mom I want to die and she says it's just a symptom of depression. I'm ready to go, I've taken this as a sign it's time for me to just go. I feel numb everywhere and I feel almost happy. I just want to go. I want a cigarette before I die, I want to be drunk and go quietly. Everyone is embarrassed of me, of my presence, I know they will be relieved when I am gone. My boyfriend can move on and live a wonderful life, my parents have another successful child and there is no need for a rotting loser like me. I can't wait to relieve everyone of my presence
