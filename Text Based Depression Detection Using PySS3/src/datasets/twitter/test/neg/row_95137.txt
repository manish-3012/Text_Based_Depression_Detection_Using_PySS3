Thinking about everything Iâ€™ve been throughWhy? Whatâ€™s the lesson? Whats the point of feeling utterly worthless and destroyed? Whats the pont to all of this? To become so desensitized to pain that you end up just being a emotionally numbed out robot just to manage being a functioning adult?? 

I feel fucking broken I feel like I donâ€™t deserve to be here. Everything just hit me and I canâ€™t stop crying. Why the fuck am I here. The people I love donâ€™t give a flying fuck about me? I get that external validation doesnâ€™t *matter* but it does every fucking human craves it. The rules to life are so fucking backwards (you canâ€™t be like this but you also gotta process emotions like this xyz.) 

Mom wished I wasnâ€™t born, ex bf didnâ€™t give a flying fuck about me and discarded me to the side like garbage, past relationships have always pushed the blame to me or made me feel like I wasnâ€™t enough. Father and older brother are physically abusive. They havent respect my boundaries or appreciate anything that I do for them. I have so many deep rooted issues because of these traumas that I just canâ€™t fucking do it. 

And Iâ€™m about getting sick and tired of hearing â€œit gets better.â€ 


Really? After 20+ years of the same bullshit cycling in and out? I really canâ€™t fucking stand to be here for another day but know my bullshittin ass ainâ€™t gonna do anything about it other than live another day completely numb.
