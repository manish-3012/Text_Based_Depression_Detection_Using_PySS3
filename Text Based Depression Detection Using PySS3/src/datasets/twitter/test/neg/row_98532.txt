Beyond helpI don't know why I'm writing this. I'm not here to get help. I don't want help because I know there is no help for me.

I've battled depression and a series of misdiagnosed mental illnesses for more than 20 years. At this point, I don't know which diagnoses are right and which are wrong, and I honestly don't care. I know I'm screwed up, in many ways. And at the end, that's all that matters.

I tried really hard for many years. I tried to better myself. I was brought up in all the wrong ways. I was obese, socially awkward, emotionally unstable, I never finished school. I decided to change all that. It took me many years. I changed my eating habits, I started exercising, I went to therapy regularly, I started working and opened a small businesses. But that wasn't enough. I was still screwed up inside. Those things never change, no matter how hard you work at it.  I fell in love once and again, and I failed miserably at it. Depression always reigned over my qualities, and every relationship I had succumbed to darkness. Finally the love of my life left me too, and I lost everything. I lost my business, I secluded myself and lost of my friends, I gained all the weight I had lost, I gave into depression. Now I hate myself outside and inside.

It's been 3 years and each year is worse. I lost all motivation. Nothing makes me feel right. I've stopped caring about everything. I don't want to start all over again. What's the point? I worked so hard to become what I thought was a decent human deserving of being loved. But that was a fantasy. I'll never be good enough. I'm rotten inside. I'm destined to fail. It's not even in my hands. I don't have the power to change every little thing about myself, because everything about myself is wrong. 

I have little contact with my family, I don't have any friends left, I'm unable to make new friends. I'm nobody. It's as if I don't exist. I'm just a mass that takes up space and makes no difference in the world.

Every night when I go to bed the only way I can fall asleep is if I go over the details of my suicide. Every night I pray to be dead the next morning, even when I know nobody is listening to those prayers.

Those who say killing yourself is easy don't know what they talk about. Killing yourself is hard and scary. Even when you have nothing left to live for, it is scary. 

I've given myself six more moths. I don't even know why. I'm scared, I guess. It's stupid. I'm scared of a failed attempt, not even about death. I guess it also makes me sad, and angry. I'm angry because I tried really hard, but it didn't matter. All my efforts don't matter, and that makes me very mad.

I rambled, and I'm sorry. I guess I just needed to let all this out.

I truly believe some of us would be happier dead. Life should be a choice, not an obligation, especially if you're completely alone.
