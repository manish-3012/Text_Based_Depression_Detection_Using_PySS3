How can a depressed person help another depressed person? I need help, this last weekend my boyfriend and I had some LSD pappers. He had an O.D. and a hysterical collapse. He became something else and broke down our hole appartment, he took off his clothes and started to scream nonsense opened the door, ran through the hallway, and jumped the 3rd floor window... I thought it was over. But fortunately, he fell into the 2nd floor roof and only suffered a few bruises. He's ok now, as good as possible, but I find myself in a complicated situation, I am clinically depressed and bipolar,  and we both had attempted to suicide before. He's unemployed since february, and very unhappy in college. At this point, I don't now what to say to him, we live alone here in Brasil, and there is no hope for us here. We're trying to move to Europe, but everything's so hard for him. Since his father died he has no strength to move on. And even doing everything that I can, I am unable to keep him up for long. We're in psychiatric treatment, but even so, it hasn't been enough.
 
 So I'm here to ask you guys, if you have any idea about what to do for now one, what habits can we adopt to get through it.  

 Thank you! :)
