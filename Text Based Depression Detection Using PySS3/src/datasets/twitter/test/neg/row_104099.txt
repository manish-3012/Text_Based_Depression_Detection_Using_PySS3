All of this talking about it is doing me no goodI'm 18 I'm a man now. Men don't sit around talking about stuff we do it. I'm done talking, I set a date and I'm just going to do it. Probably tie a belt around my neck and find a high place to do it. Maybe the pull up bars at Santa Monica at night so nobody sees me.
