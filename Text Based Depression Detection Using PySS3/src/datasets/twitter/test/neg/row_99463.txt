Extremely lonely and can't make any friends. Been isolated from people for months and still a virginThe only thing that's keeping me alive right now is the fact that I haven't had sex. Otherwise, I probably would've killed myself by now. I wish people can be upfront about stuff and teach me social skills instead of being made fun of. For years, i worked and went go school without partying or friends and I don't enjoy life. I've been on house arrest for a few months because I was "suicidal" which is stupid. If my thing gets extended on September 21, I'll probably commit suicide by hang myself or I'll find heroine to OD on
