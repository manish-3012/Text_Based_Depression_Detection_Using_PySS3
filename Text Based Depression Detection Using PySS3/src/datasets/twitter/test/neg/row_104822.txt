i just feel like I'm stuck in limbo...or is it purgatory?I don't want to live....but I don't want to truly die either, because if that was the case I would have already attempted to do so. But I also don't truly want to live, because if I wanted to live than I would not actively and deliberately try to destroy my life. Because that's what I do: I spend all my time in bed and I don't study nearly enough, some days i don't even show up to the lectures. I'm in university and I messed up last semster and I will mess up this semster even more so and I feel so guilty because my parents are paying for it and I'm a loser and a waste of space. 

I'm actively sabotaging myself, I don't drink enough water and my sleep cycle is fucked up. Some weeks I sleep too little some weeks I sleep too much, but either way I need ages to fall asleep and it's torture.

i used to be clever, I used to have ambitions, now I'm just a mess. I don't want to live, I don't want to die, I just want to sleep forever.
