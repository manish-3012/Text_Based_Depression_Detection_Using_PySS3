How do you get over the guilt of hurting your family?I think I'm ready to go. But I don't know how to go ahead with it when I think of how it'll affect my family. Maybe they'll take it too hard, or maybe they'll just eventually accept it. But the thought of them crying and being in pain really hurts me. 

I don't know what to do. Maybe I should numb myself to go through with it. But that nagging thought is still there in my head.
