Can anyone relate? Wth is wrong with me?It's been more than a year now that I not only lost the ability to enjoy anything but literally every kind of fun activity became actually painful. I can't listen to music, can't draw, can't read, can't play video games etc without starting to hate myself or getting reminded of terrible things that happened to me in the past. The emotional reaction is always very severe. I must have some kind of PTSD...I don't even know but it's hell. I'm doing DBT, I eat healthy and exercise, I take care of all my responsibilities. These things obviously help but life is still unbearably painful. I can only start therapy from September and idk how will I survive until then.

I told all my family and friend(s) about it but no one seems to care much. They treat me a tiny bit better but I'm guessing they don't even understand what I'm going through. I had depression and anxiety pretty much my whole life and even that was difficult for them to accept. Everyone just thought that I was lazy and weird. But this thing what I'm going through is just so much worse I can't express it with words. I have no quality of life....not a single minute where I could relax. It's torture. People keep telling me that im so disciplined and hardworking and they could never do what I'm doing...but I literally have nothing else to do!!! I could just stare at the wall for a change (most amount of fun I can possibly have) and sometimes I do but I get bored and then I get back to doing something useful instead.
