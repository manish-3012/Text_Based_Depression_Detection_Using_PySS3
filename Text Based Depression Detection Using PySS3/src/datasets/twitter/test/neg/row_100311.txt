I hate my life at this point anywayI'm a 20 year old guy with no friends and no prospects. I'm failing out of college because of how dumb and lazy I am, and my parents don't know since I've been lying to them about my grades. I don't know anything with my freetime besides moderate exercises, video games, and browsing the Internet. I have no hobbies at all. I also have a very specific anxiety trigger that's ruining my life. Anytime I mention socializing around my parents I get a panic attack for no ducking reason. I can't make friends because I would have severe anxiety attacks if my parents saw me socializing with somebody. I hate this anxiety and don't know what to do about it. There's a girl at my job I like and I think she likes me to, but I can never date her because my anxiety would skyrocket if my parents found out. Do I'm just a lazy jerk. I can't take this much longer. I want to die.
