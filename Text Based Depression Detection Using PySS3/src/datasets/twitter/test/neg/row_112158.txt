Dying with everything I doNo matter what I do, every single little thing that happens, kills me a little inside every time. Loud noises exhaust me, having to explain myself when people don't understand what I'm saying the first time infuriates me, having to repeat myself when they couldn't hear me just makes me want to lose my shit. I'm so tired, angry, and so so fucking SAD all the time. My moods are so blah, they swing so drastically and I don't know what to fucking do with myself.
