DrowningThe past three years have been the worst of my life and everytime I pick myself back up something kicks me back down. I was engaged three years ago to someone in the military with PTSD. He assaulted me a few times, we broke up. I found out that I was pregnant so I went back and we got engaged yada yada yada. Found out he had been cheating and had another baby with a woman so I tried to leave; he beat me so badly I lost the baby. Hes in jail, i move back in with my mom and try to move on with my life. 
All my family start dropping like flies. I lost my great grandparents, both sets of grandparents, two of my best friends and I can honestly say I dont know how I survived that shit. 
I move back home to the east coast to get to lnow my dads aide of the family better. Horrible decision- theres a reason my mom took my ass and fled. My dads a psychopath. I have a shit job, working for shit people, no friends, in the tony backwoods town filled with horrible narrow minded racist people. My finances are a total mess, I can't move. I mean a new guy, the first person i allow my self to truly open up to on years. I fall in love, he tells me he loves. Then bam ghosts me. My open support system is just suddenly gone and crushed my heart and soul at the same time. I almost got raped by my stepdads father, which i for some reason keep trying to downplay. I fantasize about killing myself all the time. Its become a fun little game. Evaluate a room everytime you walk in and try to figure out all the ways you could kill yourself. I just so sick of this shit. It never fucking ends and I'm so sick of existing.
