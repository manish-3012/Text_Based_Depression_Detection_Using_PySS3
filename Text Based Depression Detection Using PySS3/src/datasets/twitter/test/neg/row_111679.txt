How do I keep myself alive?Hello, 
To start off, I'm coming down from a bender just now, so the chemicals in my brain aren't working right. I stopped taking lithium a few weeks ago and since then I've been pretty suicidal, so I think that caused the bender. Just so you understand that the bender isn't the cause for my suicidality. I can't go to the psych ward because I'm starting uni soon and can't be away from that. I've been self harming pretty badly to deal with the bad thoughts and I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm in this destructive spiral and can't get out. I know my brain isn't working right at the moment, so I need to keep myself from making an irreversible decision. How do I go about doing that?
