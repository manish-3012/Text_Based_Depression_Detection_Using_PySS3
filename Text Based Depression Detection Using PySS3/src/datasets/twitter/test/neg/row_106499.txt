I already know I'm going to do it. I put a fight against suicide but I know I'm going to lose. It's like the universe is yelling at me to get it over with. No one wants me around anyways I am overstaying my welcomeI am too weird no one wants to have anything to do with me. I know how to go through with it now. I am so close. I dont know how to interact i guess this or im surrounded by assholes. both i dont know how to interact bc im surrounded by assholes. who cares. no one cares. i have to do it eventually. i can't deal w this. you can look atm y post history there you can see a man screaming in a room full of deaf people. so many say you can talk they'll listen and guess what they never do. i tried therapy. i tried and tried to find a good therapist it's 8 yrs i tried again recently. It's discouraging I don't know who to talk to. I don't trust the hotlines anymore now either becuase of those asshole therapists. I don't want to do this anymore I don't want to live thi life all I want to do is die
