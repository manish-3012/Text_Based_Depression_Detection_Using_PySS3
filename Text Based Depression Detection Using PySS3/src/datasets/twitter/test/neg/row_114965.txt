Iâ€™m trying really hard not to just end it.Iâ€™ve called my few friends, theyâ€™re phones are off. I called my boyfriend, or ex-boyfriend now, I guess, but his phone is dead and I ruined our relationship with my self destructive behavior, anyway. My anxiety prevents me from talking on the phone, so I canâ€™t call the suicide hotline. This is my last resort. 
I hate myself; Iâ€™ve always hated myself, and I just really want it all to stop. I have regular suicidal thoughts almost constantly, but now Iâ€™m really just thinking of taking a fistful of pills and lying in bed. I had a wonderful longterm significant other who cared about me and tried to help me, and I destroyed it. He supported me emotionally and financially until I started drinking recklessly and hurt him. It hurts to think about the people I would leave behind, but living hurts so much more. 
I guess I really donâ€™t want to do it, because Iâ€™m posting here, but I feel like I have no choice. Iâ€™m in heaps of debt, I canâ€™t work a full time job because of my mental problems, all of my family members live in a different state, and I had to stop seeing my psychiatrist due to the cost. Furthermore, I have no discernible skills, no ambition, and no hobbies/activities that I enjoy. 
Please just tell me itâ€™s going to be okay, or that Iâ€™m worth a damn, or something. I donâ€™t believe in an afterlife, so Iâ€™m scared. I just want it all to go away. I donâ€™t want anyone to have to tolerate my existence anymore.

Please help.
