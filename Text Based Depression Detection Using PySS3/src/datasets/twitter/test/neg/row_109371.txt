I hate waking up every dayFrom the moment that I wake up to the moment that I fall asleep, all I ever think about is wanting to end my life. I haven't done it yet because I'm too scared of surviving somehow, but lately I've been considering just doing it anyways and hoping I succeed. There is nothing I enjoy doing, the games I play only serve as a distraction from how much I want to end my life, but those distractions can only last so long. I have no aspirations in life, I feel so lonely no matter where I am, I have nothing left to lose. I've tried getting help before, but the treatment didnt work so here i am now. I know that the way I feel is not anyone else's fault, but I just don't want to live anymore. I don't know how my friends or family will feel when I die, but I cannot go through this mental pain anymore.
