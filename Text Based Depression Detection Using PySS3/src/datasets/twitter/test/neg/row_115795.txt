The stupid thing is I know my life can and probably will get better. I just donâ€™t have enough strength to live in this agony until it does.Iâ€™m a 17 year old girl and I have no desire to keep on living. The main thing is holding me back is I donâ€™t think my mom could handle my death. But I just donâ€™t know how to keep on living at this point.

I absolutely hate myself. I look in the mirror and I want to cry. I suffer from extreme anxiety that keeps me on edge almost constantly. I am in misery and it wonâ€™t stop. 

I know it could get better for me. Iâ€™m still young. But Iâ€™m just so overwhelmed and hurt that I do not care. I just want this pain to stop now.

I crave love and attention, but at the same time I want to completely isolate myself with no contact for years. I want to be around others, but at the same time I canâ€™t stand to be seen. I donâ€™t know what I want. I donâ€™t know what would help me at this point.

I have been up since 5 AM even though I donâ€™t have school. Iâ€™ve just been laying in bed crying. I have no desire to do anything but die at this point.
