Contemplating asking people who hate me with a passion to kill me and make it look like a non-assisted suicideIn the past I have made several women uncomfortable by harassing them in different ways. At least one woman is still traumatized by my harassment after over half a decade. Her friends hate me with a passion for harassing her and she refuses to accept my apologies.  I can't live with myself knowing that I have hurt her and the other women (among other reasons).  I'm thinking about asking her friends to kill me and make it look like a non-assisted suicide since it would be giving them what they want as well.
