QuestionDoes it make me an awful person that when I kill myself, I WANT people to give me attention? Maybe my friends will come to their senses that they shouldnâ€™t have abandoned me, or maybe my ex will realize how much he loved me, or maybe my sister will realize that she should have spent more time with me. I want to know what the people around me would do and I want them to feel bad. Wow, that sounds so conceited. Iâ€™m such a piece of shit.
