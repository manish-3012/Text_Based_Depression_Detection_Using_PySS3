Please save meI'm in so much pain... I think I am losing my mind.

I can feel the depression eating my brain.

I want to scream.... It hurts to even try to articulate. My brain doesn't want to confront anything.


I have hardly left my bed in weeks. I use the most minimal amount of information processing possible to get by. I'm losing everything... I'm so lonely. I'm so fucking lonely.


I'm so scared, I'm so lost I'm so detached... Wtf is this.. What the fuck is this...

I am becoming terrified of the world and people, I'm so angry. I am insidiously angry, it's disgusting.
