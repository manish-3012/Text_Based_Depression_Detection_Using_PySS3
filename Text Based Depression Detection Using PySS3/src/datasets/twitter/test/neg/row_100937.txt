My roommate wants to kill himself and I don't know whether I should stop him or let him decide.I've always believed that suicide is a personal choice that everyone should be allowed to make. I'm now having to put my money where my mouth is. My roommate is making arrangements for after he's dead and intends to kill himself. It's not just a cry for help. He's had some really tough breaks and he's tired of working himself to the bones just to try and scrape by in life. He wants to just set up a care plan for his loved ones, make sure I have a replacement roommate in place, and then commit suicide. I've cried, I've listened, I've begged. It's getting to be that time now and I'm trying to decide whether to let him be or to intervene on his behalf. He won't see a shrink. He lied and told me that he was seeing one just to get me off his back. If I interfere and he goes through with it afterwards, I could be taking away the only thing that he feels happy about - the ability to take care of loved ones with his life insurance. I don't actually see a shrink being able to convince him otherwise, but I would love for him to live. I wish I didn't know. I guess he felt he was safe telling me because of how many times I've said that it shouldn't be up to others when we die.

Thanks in advance for any advice guys.
