How i feelI feel lost and empty, like all the sympathy that you get from others is all fake, I'm an awful person. Made so many mistakes in life and there's no escape because you can't change the past. God I wish you could. It's so difficult wondering what you could have done to avoid what bothers you so deeply. I don't want to die, but the choice of taking the easy way out is like an intense itch. I'm so scared about the future, it makes things even worse. I'm also scared about what happens after death. I'm too tired to keep typing. I just want this pain to end.
