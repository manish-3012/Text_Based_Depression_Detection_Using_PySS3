A friend is asking for help with her cousin.Hi SW, 

I've heard great things about this group and thought you might be willing to help.  My friend's 12 year old cousin is being bullied and has been talking about killing himself.  His family is getting him help (therapy) but they are asking people to send letters (to a PO box that they are moderating for safety) of encouragement, support and love to Noah to show him that people aren't all jerks.  

This is the [FB](http://www.facebook.com/LettersForNoah/posts/327096897390687) page they have set up for him. If you would be willing to write a nice letter to him I know his family would appreciate it.

Thank you
