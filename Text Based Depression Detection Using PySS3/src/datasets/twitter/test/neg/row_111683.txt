Been A WhileSorry this might be long.

So, I haven't posted in here in like 5 months because things got better. College was going well and friends was good. Last time I posted I wrote a bit about them. So let me tell you about them.

I won't use real names. So there is BH and JW, my best friends I would like to say. They are wonderful people, I go out with them a lot, play games and have some good times, I've known them for years and I wouldn't trade them for anything. There is my friend SB, I met him in college, had some drinks with him, I play games with him and we have serious chats a lot. He has helped a lot, another best friend. A lovely guy he is. There is ER, all I'm going to say is I fell in love with her, same with her towards me but she lived in America and didn't want me because I wasn't physical. There is TD, another American girl, she is lovely, sweet and amazing in every way and is trying to help me move there.
And the college lot I met in September, they are okay.

For 5 months I have been getting better. Feeling happier and everything, and all of a sudden. I feel awful. And my suicidal thoughts are coming back. I've always been full of anxiety and it is awful because I'm shit at everything. I've been stressed to shit and I want to end it, I've been played like a arsehole and want to die. 

I think I should end it. It would be so easy. I'm not needed any where, not wanted. I'm forever alone, a failure, a piece of shit and I have infected all these lovely people with myself, my mind, my friendship. So I should, want and might at least try and end my life... Again. I tried with pills, that didn't work.

So you know who I am, and if you don't then leave it like that and save yourself.

Goodbye everyone, I'll try do it as soon as possible.
