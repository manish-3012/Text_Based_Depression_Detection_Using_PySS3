Dont know what to doIve been depressed for a few months now and have had some serious thoughts of suicide. Since my parents divorce started Ive been stressed out constantly. I now have no friends because i was always stressed and in a shitty mood and everyone stopped hanging out with me. I feel hopeless about the future and i think it would be better to have just killed myself by now. I find it hard to care about anything and i just want to kill myself, Ive thought about how and what id do. I feel like shit all the time...
