Tonight is the night.We dated for three years. She broke up with me, but says we will get back together one day. I'm pretty sure she is sleeping with another guy. I can't go on like this. My eyes are red, I have nightmares constantly, and I'm hanging onto to false hope. The only time she ever wants to see me is when she needs gas and/or money. She is my true love. I can't go on without her, but she is treating me so mean.

I'm going to kill myself. Take my car, duct tape it up and run a hose from the exhaust pipe. I'm sick of living.
