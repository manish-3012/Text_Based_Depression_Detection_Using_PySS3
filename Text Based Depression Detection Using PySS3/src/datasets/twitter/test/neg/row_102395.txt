Crying againI don't know what i'm doing anymore. I acted extremely happy for the past week. I pretended to be confident and energised and social. And people believed me, as always. 
I just woke up and i'm down. I'm crying in bed,  again. Didn't cry for a while, so... 
last night i was babysitting 2boys, and when they were playing outside my psychiatrist called.. she doubled my dosis and thank god she didn't force me to go see a psychologist. Last time i saw her she was concincing me to go and i just can't handle it. I am so bad at saying no. I let people take advantage out of me because i don't stop them. And then i blame myself for being so weak and stupid and because it's my fault not theirs. And i get all messed up.. no one knows. I can't tell anyone anymore. It feels bad to tell my friend because it'll make him sad too. I don't know what to do. I'm just laying here, feel like it is worthless, like i am worthless..
