Can I report a potential suicide with just a first name?I have an online friend that I've known for a while. We would talk about our problems and give support. Today they said some suicidal things/overdosing and disappeared. I never asked them their last name because I never had a reason to. I know their first name, city/state, and I have pictures of them. Is this enough to report to the police to find them?
