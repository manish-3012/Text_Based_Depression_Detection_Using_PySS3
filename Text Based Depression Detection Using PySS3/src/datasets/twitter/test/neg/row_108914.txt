Small ConfessionI did something terrible to my cousin 6 years ago, i was 13. Itâ€™s been on my mind ever since and I canâ€™t talk to her and apologize because ima wimp. 

So i was just thinking if i should take the easy way out and slit my throat in the canyon i live by. 

But there is two reasons Iâ€™m hesitating, first one is mostly because of my mom, sister, and dad. Second is the pain Iâ€™ll feel when i do it. 

It would be nice if i had courage and apologize to my cousin because i know it scarred her. 

I think Iâ€™m slowly going crazy and I donâ€™t know how i can continue being alive with all this guilt Iâ€™m feeling. 

I just want a little help from a stranger to give me advice on what to do. People donâ€™t realize how much one sentence or word can change a persons life.
