AITA for traumatizing my friend with my suicide attemptHi, so Iâ€™m sorta new to this thing and English isnâ€™t my first language so I sincerely apologize for everything beforehand.

A year and a few months back I was in a very rough place and was thinking about committing when I decided to text (one of) my best friend to say goodbyes a heads up before I completely disappeared. Fortunately, she convinced me to not do it that night.

A long time after this incident, we got into another argument about something irrelevant and it got very heated but point is, she brought up that ever since that night, sheâ€™s been paranoid and anxious in everything, our lives werenâ€™t really in the best circumstances and she said that my attempt was kinda the breaking point. 

She said that I was selfish and had no idea what I put her through that night and how could I have been so inconsiderate. We made up since but Iâ€™ve always sort of feel like it was my fault and lost sleep thinking about this multiple times. We are getting ready for college now but I keep getting distracted by our past argument.

Was I the AITA for this? I just need an outsiderâ€™s opinion on this please.
