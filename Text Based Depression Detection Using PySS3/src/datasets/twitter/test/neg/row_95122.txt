My friends have came out to me about being suicidal. What do I do?Yesterday, I was having a conversation with two of my best friends. One is a boy and one is a girl. The boy told me he moderately cut himself every so often, and has a knife in his room. I had no words for him. Because we were on this topic, the girl also told me that she tried to kill herself by eating countless pills, only to end up sick (she skipped school). I have no idea what to do in this situation. Please help.
