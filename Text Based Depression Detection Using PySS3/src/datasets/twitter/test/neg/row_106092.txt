All I wanted was someone to talk to. Nobody answered. Now I want to attempt to kill my self for the first time in 12 years.My gf got caught cheating and still lies to me. I met the guy she cheated with. She still denies it and doesnâ€™t know we talked. Sheâ€™s been manipulating me for the last month. Now I want to jump off the tallest bridge i can find. I called everyone close to me and no one answered. I called the suicide hotline guy out on hold. This is my sign itâ€™s time to do what I should have done years ago.
