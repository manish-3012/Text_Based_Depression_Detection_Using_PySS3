boom, headshotI've been thinking about suicide for a long time. The depression started about 5 years ago and was followed by severe anxiety and social paranoia. In the early stages of my depression I reached out to a close friend and told him about the thoughts that were going through my head, how everything felt bland and nothing made me happy anymore but he told me it was just a phase that everybody goes through and it would get better with time, so I waited. 

When the anxiety started, my friends started to notice my behavior and began to ask why I was acting so crazy so I started ignoring their calls and making excuses to be alone so I wouldn't have to answer their questions. The social paranoia came last but not least and It hit like a truck. Everywhere I went, it felt like people were watching me and judging everything I did. It was like they were whispering about me behind my back, and it was as if even my friends were out to get me. The weight of those 3 behemoths were too much for me to handle, so I confined myself to my house for about 3 years to dwell in my own self-loathing and disgust. It's been 5 years and I'm still waiting for it to get better, but it only seems to get worse and I'm running out of patience. I know suicide is a selfish act and it will hurt the few people that I have left but I don't want to deal with this anymore. I'll be remembered as a coward who couldn't face his problems but I couldn't care less. 

In the end I've decided on a rather messy ending for myself, but from what I've read it's not very painful and has a high fatality rate. My only concern is what my family will see if they need to identify my body,  I don't want to scar them with that image.
