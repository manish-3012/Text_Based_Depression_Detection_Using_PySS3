What are the next stepsIve already posted this in /r/depression but I dont know if it better belongs here. I would just like some opinions.

Hi, So its rather difficult for me to write this, either because I am lethargic or I dont like thinking about it, or im conflicted but here it goes.

For several months know I have felt down and or angry for a few days durning each week. Its not constant everyday but its there. By down I mean feeling that the world is one big piece of shit, and everyone in it is a piece of shit including myself. I feel like people only do what is absoulute best for themselves no matter what without regards to other people or promises or friendship or anything really. I feel like "doing the right thing" is worthless. I feel like everyone else around me doesnt do the right thing, and I feel if you do the right thing you end up getting fucked. I feel that when I do the right thing I end up getting less, or getting fucked. Nothing fucking matters. I feel like this is reality, not depression, not my mind being fucked up. I feel as if my eyes are open to the reality of the shit hole world, that this is life, this is real

This down feeling usually leads to anger, with me going off on some depressing tirade about how the world is one big piece of shit. Thinking about all the things in my life and how I didn't get far enough or I made the wrong decision.

I have been drinking quite a bit over the last year. It feels good for a while and I forget shit, but sometimes it manifests it self in anger. It also takes away inhibition. There was one time where when I was drunk and high I took out a loaded hand gun and put it to my temple, and to the back of my neck pointing upwards (as Ive researched this is the best place for max effect). My finger was off the trigger, that was the one gun safety rule I followed. I think I just wanted to know what it would feel like, I dont recall having the inclination of going though with it. I also have a tendency to go ride my motorcycle when im drinking, and push myself towards higher speeds. I find this very thrilling, and likley the inhibition loss makes this easier. All that said I know its very fucking stupid, but I love it. Alcohol makes things go away for a while. I try to distract myself by staying busy with things, but I recently hurt my back and have been without that distraction.

I find myself doing a ton of research on suicide and methods. Ive thought about the gun but frankly its going to be messy and disturbing for others, but it will be quick. Other methods take a lot of planning and require dedication and time and arent fool proof. At times I feel like I dont have the fucking balls to kill myself, yelling at myself dont be a fucking pussy.

I'm concerend about the above for obvious reasons. I have a baby girl that I love more then anything in this world, she is the one pure good thing in my life I feel sometimes. I have a wife who sincerely cares about me despite my lunacy (although other times I dont think that much.) I have been isolating myself from people and at times want to not deal with anyone.

I have told my doctor (primary care) about some of this. The feeling like shit, feeling like a piece of shit and the anger etc. Not the gun alcohol or motorcycle stupidity. I dont want to tell her the other stuff becasue I know more then likley what it will lead to (hospital). She gave me some numbers of phycatrists to call and see if I can get an appointment, I have calls into 3 and waiting on a call back. Its going to take a while I know. We also discussed inpatient, she essentially said that when depression has anger it can lead to impulsive actions, this makes sense especially with the alcohol involved and current diag of ADHD. She said she thought about going the inpatient route. I have another appointment tomorrow after I emailed her regarding which docs will accept my insurance and what the process would be for inpatinet. The last three days I have felt kind of empty, with energy in the evenings after I drink.

I just have so many qualms about this shit. In a way I want to go the inpatient route via MY OWN DECISION before shit gets out of hand (I emailed her about this and asked about the critera) I feel like Im being a needy fuck, an asshole who is doing shit for attention when there are people far worse off then me. I feel like a coward and I'm going to emotionally hurt my wife and daugter and put more stress on them (my wife already is stressed out but I try to tell her that its not her fault, its on me). I feel like a fucking failure that Im having these issues and its like this. I'm concerened about my work and people finding out (I work for a hospital with a very specific insurance plan, which means I would be going to a hospital associated program and or phycatrist, and I assure you its rather easy to look up peoples records on the system, its happened to me for something minor and I had to remind this person to never ever do that again). I feel like these feelings come and go intensly but there is something underlying as well, but its not all the time. I want to be better for my wife and daughter (the doctor had brought this up) but I just dont know if Im just being an attention whore or its serious enough at this point. I just dont want to let people down with my shit. I dont want to miss enough work that causes whatever excuse I come up with goes out the window. What the fuck do I tell my boss that is believable. I overall just feel weak and dont know what to say tomorrow to the doc. fuck I feel like an asshole even writing all this shit, like fucking poor me.
