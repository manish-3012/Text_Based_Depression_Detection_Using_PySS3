Guess I should tell someone45, been suicidal on and off my whole life. First attempted at 11. Maternal grandfather committed suicide. Mother/myself have depression.

 
I have figured out how to kill myself and my cats (there will be nowhere for them to go,they are 16, and the female will be unadoptable. Better I soothe them and me at the end)


My dysfunctional parents fucked me up, and I ran with it as an adult. 
Long story short, within a week or so, I wonâ€™t be able to work anymore. Through a number of bad choices and a horrible 20+year relationship, I owe the taxman, and my wages will be siezed. Recently out of that relationship, too depressed to do anything but work, and laundry, Iâ€™ve been unable to save any money. Iâ€™ll be homeless next month. My parents cannot/will not help.

 
Iâ€™ve always figured I would kill myself. I believe it would only hurt 1 person to find out Iâ€™m dead. Sure, others would be sad. But Iâ€™ve reached out to most people I know, and still have no good reasons to go on


I am sad and crying, yet solid in my choice. 


Today, I will empty my car and go to the local Home Depot and buy some hose. Tonight, I will cook a steak over a driftwood fire on the beach. 
Tomorrow I will finish up some important work for my boss
Then some time during the next 7 days, I will load up the car with my 2 cats, drive out to a rural, remote area, and hook up my hose to my tailpipe. Iâ€™ve already  made a thing to go in my back window. I will take all the pills I have and soothe my cats to sleep. Then I will turn the engine on and pass out from the pills. Iâ€™m not going to fail this time


I have posted here to give the universe/god/karma a chance to step in


Iâ€™d rather be dead than homeless again
