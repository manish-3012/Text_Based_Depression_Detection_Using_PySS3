No hope. Exhausted.I skipped clinic. Haven't eaten today.  
No energy.  
No friends. No family. No hobbies. No goals. No job.  
Meds don't work.  

Whenever my therapist asks if I have a plan for suicide, I lie.   
I have a closet. Tie the rope to the handle on the inside. Flip rope over the frame. Close closet. Tie noose. put head in. Lean forward on knees in a partial suspension.
