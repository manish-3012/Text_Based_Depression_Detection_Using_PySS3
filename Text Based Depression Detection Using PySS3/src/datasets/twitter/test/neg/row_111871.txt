Suicidal thoughts have come back, im afraid of myselfLast week i had 2 big crisis and I tried to choke myself with a belt. When it finished I couldn't realized what I just did. I tried it again yesterday after another crisis. The only reason why I stopped it was BC of my family and my friends, I know that it will be painful for them to see me death, but if I have the choice to do it without their pain, I would be death for sure rn. My suicidal thoughts are back and I'm afraid of what I could do tomorrow or later.
