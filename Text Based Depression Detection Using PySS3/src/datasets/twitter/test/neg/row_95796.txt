A pocket dimension of hellIt started with friends growing up, they always betrayed my trust. Became bullies who mocked me in school. This must have happened a 1000 times.

Girlfriends I loved left me as soon as I ever showed any signs of depression. My last one told me a month ago, after two weeks seeing each other, that Iâ€™m â€œbasically dead.â€ 

And four years ago, when I was forced out of going to Uni for a lucrative career, had to move back in with my mother, it was my family that turned their backs on me.

I was homeless and nobody cared. They didnâ€™t call, they just told me â€œto get helpâ€ without offering any, while they all went on with their lives together... Months later and I eventually broke down and tried to talk to them, and they told me I had to â€œfigure it outâ€ because they couldnâ€™t help me, they would only smugly talk about their trips and their happy lives, and ***if*** they asked about me and I responded honestly, it was like sucking the air out of the room. Each one of them said â€œI canâ€™t listen to this. You have no boundaries.â€ Their cult of positivity wouldnâ€™t permit me to discuss suffering. 

I worked many pathetic jobs and tolerated endless abuse (Ever peeled shrimp for 8 hours in a 100 degree kitchen for months on end and gone to bed without a shower in a van? Served monstrous bougies/their vile brats and been laughed at and called trash? Been stabbed in the back by â€œfriendsâ€ and coworkers right after getting the job?)

I tried desperately to cling onto the hope I could regain my life and respectability (money, exciting endeavors, relationships) if I worked endlessly, but being completely isolated took its toll. Trying to make friends and be around other people with successful lives (of inheritances, better decisions, and good connections) left me certain of how inferior I am by my being disconnected. They mocked me in in front of my face using generalities (making broad statements about *certain types of people* like the mentally ill/incels/people who â€œfail to growâ€). These people were connected to my family, who didnâ€™t even believe me about what was said, instead blaming me for â€œnot being willing to make connections.â€

Now Iâ€™m at a subhuman level of intelligence for my age, have a panic disorder, agoraphobia, and my family treats me like Iâ€™m just mental. Iâ€™m already dead to them. 

Iâ€™ve started just sleeping all the time. To not feel the pain and confusion. This scares me, but I feel powerless to poverty, the merciless passage of time, and I havenâ€™t got any dreams possible enough left to keep me going. 

I have no one to talk to anymore, and I can see why. I donâ€™t know what to do with myself except find a way to end this nightmare.
