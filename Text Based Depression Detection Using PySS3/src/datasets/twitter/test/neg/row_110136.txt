My therapist thinks I'll be dead soon.I haven't been this bad like ever. Today I sat at my therapists and cried for a whole hour. I never cry. Like never ever.

We were talking about how she really wanted to put me inpatient again, because she doesn't feel like she can bear the responsibilty any longer.
I told her that I can't go inpatient again, because I need to graduate first.
Her answer was: "You can't graduate when you're dead."
This hit me.

Then she asked me, if I tried to kill myself. I mean, she knows that I never did, but she probably thought I did between our last session and todays session.
After my answer she asked me why I laughed.
This hit me again.
If it wasn't for the fear of surviving, I would've already left.
