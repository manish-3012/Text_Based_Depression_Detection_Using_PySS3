Can barely leave my apartmentI've just felt sickeningly awful today. After work I rushed straight back here and spent most of my time in bed.

So I've been feeling this way because recently I've been talking to my ex (probably mistake #1) and one of the things that of course came up was our breakup. Back then I was doing pretty bad and was cutting myself and threatening suicide. Her current boyfriend and my former best friend (mainly because of this) took this opportunity to tell me to kill myself back then. So I finally tell this to her, the first person I've ever told, and she says it's bad... but seems to kinda not care. 

I know that since it's been over a year I should really be over all this by now, but I've just been feeling really worthless and uncared for again.
