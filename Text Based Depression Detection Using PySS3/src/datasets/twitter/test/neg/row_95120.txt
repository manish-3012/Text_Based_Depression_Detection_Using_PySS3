Iâ€™m not suicidal at the moment, but Iâ€™ve felt it creeping up on me for months and Iâ€™m scaredIâ€™ve tried before on multiple occasions and failed and Iâ€™ve gone through years of effort trying to get better. Iâ€™ve had backslides and downswings, Iâ€™ve even had brief flashes of suicidal thoughts, but nothing Iâ€™ve had any temptation to act on has hit me in years.

For the past few months what I thought was just another downswing has kept going down and Iâ€™ve started having those thoughts of how much of a relief it would be again. Iâ€™ve started having thoughts again of â€œweighing the optionâ€, if you will. The kind of thing where I debate with myself about how much longer I should try before throwing in the towel, how long should I try before I determine that I canâ€™t be saved and that cutting my losses will be preferable to suffering for the rest of my life.

I hate being this weak and fragile, I hate it more than anything in the world. I hate that Iâ€™m back here after fighting so hard and I hate that even though I know whatâ€™s coming I canâ€™t seem to stop it. Iâ€™ve had brief periods of feeling okay and oh my god was it wonderful but now itâ€™s just painful because Iâ€™ve been reminded of just how far Iâ€™ve fallen.

Iâ€™m a strong guy physically and I was once strong mentally too. I was once a successful guy. Iâ€™m the guy that people are shocked when they learn I have this much emotional pain going on behind the scenes. But I drew the short straw on mental health and itâ€™s eaten me alive. Everything that I do by choice now is some form of escapism. I feel like thereâ€™s not enough left of me to salvage and my endurance is wearing thin. I look at what I used to be and know that he would be disgusted by me.

Iâ€™m tired of trying yaâ€™ll. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m asking for, I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m asking for anything. I feel like all that can be said to me has been said and everything that could be done for me has been done. Iâ€™m terrified of what may happen if this continues and I donâ€™t want to let it but Jesus fucking Christ Iâ€™m exhausted.
