caring is a liepeople always say, "so many people care about you, theres someone who loves you." but it's all a lie, no one really cares. how long would my friends remember me as part of the group? maybe a week before they wouldn't even be able to recognize my face. how many tears would my mother really cry after telling me and my brothers to "always listen to the voice inside your head" today at dinner. after I talked to her and all she did was yell at me telling it's my fault. yes, it is my fault, everything is, I chose to be like this, you dont understand mother. how would she feel when she realized she failed to support me when she finds me lifeless in my bed on a Monday morning? how would she feel, handing my last note to my father? truth is, I'd disappear from their memories in a few days, nothing would change around the house. maybe I'd haunt them every once in a while like all my problems constantly haunt me.
