Does anyone have advice on how to deal with my suicidal girlfriend? I am the only one who she told, honestly I don't know what to do. She goes to a psychiatrist but won't tell him about it because if she does, he will have to tell her mom. She doesn't *want* to kill herself, but she thinks its the only way to get over school work that she can't comprehend. She doesn't like talking to teachers and I can't help her because I have sports after school. Another part of the problem is that I only have 1 class with her, and then she just mopes around for the rest of the day. I have to drag her into some classes because she doesn't want to go to class. 

Isn't much better when she's at home; that's when she has to do all her homework and constantly be bothered by her family since she told me she sulks for 2 hours before doing any work (which her family doesn't know she's depressed or suicidal, so they don't really care). Her new psychiatrist doesn't know about her depression (he only diagnosed her with anxiety and ADD so far, her first psychiatrist diagnosed her with social anxiety and minor depression, since it wasn't that bad in the summer).
