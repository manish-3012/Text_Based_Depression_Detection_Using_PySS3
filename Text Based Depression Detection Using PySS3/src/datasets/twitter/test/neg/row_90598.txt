I am finally ready to dieI've been depressed for a very very long time and ever since then I never was truly happy,  I have been suffering due to my ugliness and my unforgivingness idiocy, hatred, family and country, two days ago I had the straw that broke the camels back.

It was my mom, one of the only people I truly believed that they believed in me, told me that I am failure and that I will never amount to anything.
 

I was always trying to latch to any bit of hope in my miserable life trying my best to stay alive hoping for the "happy ending" trying to find someone\something to live for,or that maybe I will finally be able to "love" someone again or be so curious about a phenomenon that I have to wait to see it through,  give my life a meaning rather than let it just stay as the pain that it is, but I am not sure that is possible anymore.


Every day I ask myself if my life is ever going to become worthwhile, or if it's going to matter in the long run, or if it's worth all the embarrassment,the tears,the pain,and work, maybe one mistake could ruin all that I endured, and knowing me and knowing how much of an idiot I can be, and knowing that even defending what I believe in could get me into a worst situation than the one I live in right now.




So due to all of that and much more,  I am very sure that life is never going to be liveable never mind good, ever.



No matter what I do and no matter how hard I try I will always be broken and unrepairable.
So I guess, good bye cruel world.
