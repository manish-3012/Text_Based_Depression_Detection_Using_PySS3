So Lonely and Losing ControlI've suffered with mental health issues for approx 16/17 years but it's usually stable. These last three weeks I feel I've lost control.
 
I have no friends so no one to talk to which adds into the depression.
 
I'm so utterly alone right now. These last three weeks my depression has hit like a brick wall. I'm sweaty, dizzy, stomach churning, can't think straight and constantly wishing I wasn't here and always considering self harm. Thats's not something I've really had before.
 
I'm so scared right now and can't see a way to begin to get out of this and can't even see that I will get out.
 
Please, anyone, help.
