I'm not suicidal, but the thought keeps popping unbidden into my headLong story short, I'm at a low point in life right now but it's really not that bad. While I'm unemployed, I'm not socially isolated. I do stuff with friends and go to a weekly board game night. Still, the whole unemployment thing is getting to me, and sometimes when I try to think of how to resolve it, my brain comes up with suicide. I dismiss it, but it keeps coming up. I'm confident I'm going to eventually turn this around, but in the meantime this is just something I want my brain to stop doing. I also wanted to vent I guess because I haven't told anyone about this. There's a family history of suicide, and a few years ago when something similar happened, I mentioned this to my mother and she immediately called the cops to come check up on me, and that was an awful and unnecessary experience.
