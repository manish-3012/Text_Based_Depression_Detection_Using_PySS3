I'm scared. I am scared that one day, probably one day soon, it's going to get bad enough that I make an attempt. I know for a fact that if I reach that point, it's over. I have access to more than enough equipment that I cannot make an unsuccessful attempt. 

I am scared of failure. I am in the final year of my phd. It is not going well enough. I am well aware that I have little else going for me and nothing else in my life.

I am scared for my family. My dad is quite ill and attempted suicide a couple of years back. I worry that if I kill myself, he will too. I don't want to do that to my mum.

I am scared of drugs. As I said, all I have is my PhD. I am scared that if I go to the doctor, they will give me medication that will affect my brain. I'm scared that I can't be both healthy and smart enough to do my job. 

I don't really know what this post is for. I am well aware that I should seek help, and I am well aware that i will most likely continue to take the path of least resistance until it finally gets bad enough to be fatal. I just needed to say this to someone, and, sadly enough, this was the best I could manage. 

If you read this far, thanks.
