Life isnâ€™t enough for me and it will never be enough.I long for something else. I donâ€™t know what it is, but itâ€™s not this. Itâ€™s not on earth. Every day is painful. I try to find joy in things, but nothing can make me happy. Thereâ€™s always something missing. Living isnâ€™t living if youâ€™re just waiting to die. Thereâ€™s nothing here for me.
