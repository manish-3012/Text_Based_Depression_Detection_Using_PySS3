Is this normal?Okay so like the rest of you Iâ€™m a suicidal kid only not doing it cause I promised my twin (my friend that looks like me as a girl) I wouldnâ€™t do it. So even though I myself am suicidal I always convince people who I know not to kill themselves even though theyâ€™re not regularly suicidal Iâ€™m just wondering if thatâ€™s normal since wise man did say â€œwe are suicidal kids telling other suicidal kids not to kill themselvesâ€
