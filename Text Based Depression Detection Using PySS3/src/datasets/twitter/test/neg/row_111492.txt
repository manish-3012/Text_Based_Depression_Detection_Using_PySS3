Am I alone in this?Does anyone else feel like youâ€™re ok then suddenly depressed af. I have reasons to hate myself and my life but damn does it feel like a bitch. I canâ€™t even make friends anymore cuz I hate everyone but at the same time I hate being lonely. Whenever Iâ€™m happy I know Iâ€™ll be sad as fuck after. It sounds stupid but itâ€™s like my mood shifts. Iâ€™m introverted but I can be extroverted depending on the situation. Half an hour ago I wanted to cry. Iâ€™m still hurting a bit inside but I feel better... like way better. Iâ€™m fucking stupid. Itâ€™s hard for me to describe my depression when Iâ€™m not feeling it as bad but when it hits you can see how much I really want to die
