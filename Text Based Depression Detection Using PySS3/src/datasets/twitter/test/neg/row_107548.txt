Feeling tiredI'm feeling tired lately.. I used to really enjoy life, I used to love going out and making friends. I wish I had someone to talk to. I wish my mom and dad understood what happened. I wish my dad understood more. I wish my mom didn't listen to my dad so much and ignore the warning signs or the bad things that happen. My dad has always been non confrontational when it comes to difficult news. I feel at times he goes into denial about it and some things he just never accepts. It's not his fault though, and I still love both of you dearly. I wish you understood that a child needs more than just what money can buy. They need understanding and patience, kindness, and to be able to listen. And not a cold shoulder when their child needs them most.. 
    
Parents can be so naive about their children.. Where they really go.. Who they really see.. What they really do.. What people are doing to them.. I am at a huge crossroad in my life. I have a life growing inside of me and I don't think even you have fully accepted it as I have, your daughter. If it weren't for the life inside of me right now I would swallow a bottle of pills in a heartbeat. I wouldn't think twice.. I'm writing this because at this moment I have decided not to, but I don't know how long I can keep this up.. I am ruined. I know I will give up soon after. I just can't bring myself to do it right now because of the death I would cause to someone else.. I don't aim to cause anyone grief, I have enough that I can't even deal with on my own. But it will be okay when I'm gone, because there is still plenty of joy in this world for you. Look after your baby nieces and nephews after I'm gone, and just make sure they're okay. Make a point to talk to them, and try to understand what they're going through. See if they need help, try to see what kind of trouble they're getting into and make sure it isn't anything bad. Don't just shower them with gifts, because they will still be lonely. And that's what causes them to seek out things in their lives, and in that process they can seek out something evil on accident..
