who caresI just moved to a new town and I'm all alone and my partner is mad at me for the millionth fucking time over nothing, I am all alone and I just want to end it tonight, I am not calling some fucking service so he can hear me whining on the phone and its to late to crisis chat, nobody cares anyway I wish i could just end it but i feel like i should at least try for my birds and so he doesnt have to findme dead in the wardrobe in a few hours or whatever not that he fucking cares
