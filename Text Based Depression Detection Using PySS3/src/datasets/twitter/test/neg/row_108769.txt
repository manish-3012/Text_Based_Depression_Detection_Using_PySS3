i canâ€™t shake the urge to try to kill myselfthings in my life right now arenâ€™t actually too bad but if anything it just feels like a sign that everything is about to start spiralling downwards again and i just canâ€™t get the thoughts of suicide out of my head and iâ€™m currently at a friends place right now but i feel almost completely certain that when i get home iâ€™m going to make another attempt and somehow it makes me feel calm that maybe i donâ€™t have to continue with the mundane daily activities i occupy myself with anymore
