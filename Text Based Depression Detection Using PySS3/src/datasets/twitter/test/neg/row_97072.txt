I can't do it anymoreI just can't. I've been married for 10 years and we have 2 children together. Things haven't always been roses and sunshine but they were alright. She decided it's over. And to cement her decision she cheated on me. Not only did she cheat on me but she denied it until I had evidence. Then she denied she had his contact information. Until I had his number from her iPad. Then I found out she initiated it and not him, she said he did. I just can't take the pain anymore. I've been diagnoses with a depression disorder and an anxiety disorder prior to all of this. I just can't do it anymore. There's a loaded gun in my room and I've started cutting/burning myself to feel something. But I still feel nothing. The Zoloft and Xanax aren't working. I just want to end it. I don't want to feel anything and I don't want to be here anymore. I really can't find a reason to stay. I love her. But she obviously doesn't love me. I can't be here anymore. I just can't.
