All the people in my life have turned their backs on me, whats the point anymore?Two weeks ago i had my gf of a year (whom i was in love with) leave me for my bestfriend/roommate, who in turn kicks me out of our own apartment because i never signed the lease with him. They did all of this with smiles on their faces. I haven't gone to work in the past two weeks, ive just gotten back from a 4 day coke binge, ive maybe slept a total of one day within these past two weeks, the few hours that i do sleep i can't handle because i get angry and depressed when I wake up. I hate being awake, I can't stay sober, im drinking nonstop to cope with everything... 
I'm about to be 21 in a couple of days and i get to be alone for my birthday. All the people in my life are gone, whats the point in living? I haven't been able to find it. If I had a gun i would've off'd myself a few days ago. Life really fucked me this time. Whats the point?
