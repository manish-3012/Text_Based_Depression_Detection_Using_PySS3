I tried to kill myself. I failed just like at everything else in my lifeI'm not the person who's sad and who cant talk to girls and who everyone else doesnt understand. I'm sad though but I'm also drunk and terrified. I tried swallowing all my fucking ssris which I knew would do shit especially cause I'm drunk. I told my ex who told my family who are now looking after me. But first chance I get I'm gonna duck on them and drive to Indiana where they have more relaxed gun laws and buy a shotgun and blow my brains out. It's not worth it staying this sick and hurting people. Its not worth being emotionally and mentally abusive to my partners. It's not worth weighing down on my family how depressed I am. Say what you will but I dont deserve this. I'm gonna try again next chance i get.
