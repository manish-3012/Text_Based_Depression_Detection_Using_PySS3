I need help .. I feel so lostI need help.. I don't know where to seek for help. I am on the edge of taking my life. The worst thing that happened to me was to be born to a Muslim family. As a girl I was forced to live a life that is not meant for me. Until two years I was a fully convinced Muslim, everything made sense and therefore I accepted everything and thought to myself what my mum does is not because of religious purposes but because of the traditional lifestyle she was raised to. Wish is true, she it's not religious at all, she never prays actually, but still she always tried violently to make us follow Islamic orders, like wearing hijab, not talking to boys, not going out with others, not having a bf and so one. She was a very violent mum, even authorities took us away from her as very little children. But they brought us back to her. And I hate them for this . But now where she is old and with no physical power I feel sometimes pity for her, and sometimes she tells me about her hard life as a child and wife and I start forgiving her everything.

But yeah still if she knew that I don't believe in God anymore and want to take the hijab off, she would probably kill me , if she had the possibility to do it. But the hijab is not my problem, I have planned to take it off after getting my master degree. My real problem is that I lost hope.. I was looking forward to leave my family I was totally excited about it but now I don't know why I am living, what's the purpose of my life. I feel so lonely , friends that I had, are avoiding me now , since I started talking critically about Islam. 

I want to quit my study , I don't know what I am learning for... I feel unhappy and lost everywhere and my biggest fear is that I know exactly if I ran away , that I will be lonelier since it is really hard for me to make new friends and that I will destroy my whole family . I don't see any point in living I am constantly thinking of committing suicide and the thing is I don't even have the courage to go for it ... 

I don't know what to do .. Please excuse my English and I don't believe most of the thing that I wrote made sense...
