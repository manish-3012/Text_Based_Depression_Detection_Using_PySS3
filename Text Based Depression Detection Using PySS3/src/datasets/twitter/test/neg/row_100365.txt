I feel like I would if my boyfriend was in the next room. I don't think he loves me anymore, says I'm too complicated. Am I really feeling this way over a guy? What am I, some dumbass teenager? But fuck if he isn't all I've got. He isn't wrong, though. It's exhausting trying to understand me from the outside, but even more so trying to live here in my head. Day in and out, it gets tiring being on edge all the time. I feel like I'll never be satisfied. I can't believe I'm dreading the future. I'm just so fixated on holding onto this moment, in case it all gets worse.
