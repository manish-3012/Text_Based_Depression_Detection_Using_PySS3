Please read thisSo ive had suicidal thoughts since i was young af and never told anyone... ive been talking to a stranger online and he says i should tell my friends that i feel this way but im too scared that i will scare them away or they will make fun of me or tell me im even more worthless then i am or maybe even tell other people im depressed aswell. I know its the right thing to do tho... the healthy thing... but im too anxious

Can someone just please tell me i should talk to the people around me?

I know that im a stranger and you dont know if they will make fun of me but idk i think it will help ahhhh fuck im so fucked up rn
