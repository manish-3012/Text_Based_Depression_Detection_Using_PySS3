Don't know how to copeNearly my whole life, I've been misdiagnosed as rapid cycling bipolar. Finally, a psychiatrist was working with me and I stumbled on a Facebook group of primarily young women with BPD and I realized I was exactly like these people. I talked to my psychiatrist and he immediately agreed that that diagnosis made a lot more sense for my symptoms. I thought that things would get better from there. Then I made the mistake of reading online about my symptoms, and finding out that there's basically no cure for my psychotic episodes or mood swings, and that therapists hate working with people like me because they know they can't help. To make matters worse, my SO and I want to try for children soon, and I read that there's over a 50% chance that my children could be as batshit crazy and unstable as I am. I want to die, because now I know that things aren't ever going to get better. Is there even a reason to keep going?
