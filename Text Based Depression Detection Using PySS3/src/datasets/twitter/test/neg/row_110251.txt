Need help with changing mindset about self-harmHi. Iâ€™m new to this sub so i apologize if i inadvertently break any rules (iâ€™ve read them but there may be unspoken ones iâ€™m not aware of).

I...am passively suicidal. I am generally ok but i have a problem. I romanticize self harm and occasionally indulge in it.

When i do it itâ€™s not with the intention to kill myself. I *like* the pain, and i donâ€™t know how to stop myself from liking it. I mainly do it when iâ€™m extremely frustrated with myself because the pain is a form of release + punishment for myself. 

I want to ask, for those who have successfully stopped or are in the process of doing so, how do you go about changing your attraction to harming yourself? Rationally i am well aware self harm does nothing helpful. But psychologically i canâ€™t let it go.

Thank you for reading.

Additional info: i have been on treatment for depression and anxiety for over 4 years.
