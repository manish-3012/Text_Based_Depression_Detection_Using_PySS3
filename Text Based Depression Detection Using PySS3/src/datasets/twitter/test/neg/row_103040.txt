Overbearing thoughts, no courage.Iâ€™ve (28)f struggled with thoughts of suicide since I was about 9 years old. Today I feel really low with my thoughts running ramped on ways to end my life. Iâ€™ve been laying on my bathroom floor for an hour, crying trying to calm my thoughts but also because I know Iâ€™m too scared to do it because of fear of whatâ€™s beyond this. The thoughts are so intense and it feels like the world would be better off.
