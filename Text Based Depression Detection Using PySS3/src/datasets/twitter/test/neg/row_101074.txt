LifeSo i guess itâ€™s just the holidays getting me but 2020 has been terrible.. 

I was suppose to graduate this year basically and never went to college due to health problems.

My life fell apart 3 months ago due to my mom choosing my heroin addict of a brother over me and her getting mad that we spoke up about her not raising him and choosing his father over him and during all this  my ex of 4 years left me.

My nephews in foster care so heâ€™s missing all the holidays with us i just wonder what heâ€™s thinking..

Thereâ€™s really no thanksgiving my familyâ€™s just not together anymore.

My friends are just the couple of people Iâ€™ve met at my new job literally like 2. 

Idk life really wants me to give up but Iâ€™m just to weak and tired to even give up or do anything so i just sleep and wake up and let my body choose what to do.

I honestly donâ€™t even want to see what lifeâ€™s going to be like anymore. But Iâ€™m here.

Happy thanksgiving you all.
