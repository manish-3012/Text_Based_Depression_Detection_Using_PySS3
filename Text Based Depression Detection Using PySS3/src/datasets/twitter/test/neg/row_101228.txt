This pandemic is giving me dark thoughtsI'm 27 and recently became a lawyer then this pandemic came and ruined everything. Now I'm an unemployed lawyer whose title isn't worth anything, still lives in his parents' house, and now my parents are pressuring me to find a job, as it was easy to find one especially with this shitty economy. My girlfriend of 8 years is hoping that we get married this year. I don't know if I can survive 2020 anymore. From "2020 should just end" my thoughts are now "my life should just end". I...it sucks...I've never felt so worthless...I worked hard to become a lawyer then this happens...now what? Just kill me...please...anyone do it...just do it...
