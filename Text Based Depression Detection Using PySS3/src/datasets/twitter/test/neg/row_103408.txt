Can't even cut myself properlyI've been clean from cutting for about two years now, but last night I did it again. 
And I failed. 
Couldn't cut as deep as I wanted, no matter how hard I tried. 
Now I really don't know which makes me sadder, knowing that my depression has reached again the point of me being suicidal and a danger to myself, or that I can't even fucking hurt myself the way I want to. 
Could I be anymore of a failure?
