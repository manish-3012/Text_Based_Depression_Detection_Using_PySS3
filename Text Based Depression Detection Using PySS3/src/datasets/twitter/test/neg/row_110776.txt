Im Currently Holding a Full Bottle of 300mg Lithium...i want so badly for things to just be over. i'm a twenty year old female from pennsylvania &amp; ive never felt so trapped in my entire life. i dont even want to leave a note for anyone because i've tried to reach out to so many people for as long as i can remember &amp; no one has cared. i just needed somewhere to put, in writing, that im doing it. im sorry.
