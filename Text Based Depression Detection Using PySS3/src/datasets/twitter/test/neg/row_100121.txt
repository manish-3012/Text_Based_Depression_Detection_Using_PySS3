So low on lifeSo lonely, so regretful and want a social life/love life that I canâ€™t see in the foreseeable future.

Can someone just tell me itâ€™s get better, Iâ€™m in online highschool working full time missing out on everything Iâ€™m supposed to experience, I see my ex-close friends living life with no worries and truly just think about ending it or doing something truly unstable.


My brains on fire and itâ€™s intentions arenâ€™t good, Iâ€™m loosing my grip
