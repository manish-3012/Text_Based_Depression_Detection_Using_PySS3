Hypochondria ??I'm not depressed, sometimes I get sad but thats normal so I'm totally okay with it. I'm somewhat of a hypochondriac but I'm wondering if that extends to worrying about future mental illness aswell as future physical illness. I just read an article about some guy killing himself at age 29. He was described as having an addictive personality. I think I do too but thats the hypochondriac in me talking. Anyway, the point of this post is to say.. even though I'm not depressed sometimes I cant help shake the feeling that my life will end in tragedy and that I'll end up killing myself. I don't have the desire to kill myself but I worry that something will happen in my life or I'll realize something and become suicidal. I know this is absurd but it really scares me.. Anyone gone through something similar ?
