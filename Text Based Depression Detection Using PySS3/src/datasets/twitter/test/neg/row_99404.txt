Just some thoughts...I never thought Iâ€™d ever truly understand how someone could want to end their life. Well, I get it now.  

I survived a lot of childhood trauma, a deployment with the Army and 10 years working as a paramedic and while I went through some bouts of depression I never truly felt like ending my life nor could I understand how someone would.   

The past five years of my life have been by far the best. I have so many amazing friends who support me and Iâ€™ve experienced success financially and with my career. Iâ€™ve been truly happy for the first time ever. 

Then about 9 months ago, I had a severe panic attack for no reason that has led to a crippling cycle of anxiety and panic. Countless ER visits, multiple primary care providers, specialists to rule out medical conditions, countless antidepressants/anxiety meds that just make everything worse for me and counselors...all who canâ€™t or wonâ€™t help me. The common answer is â€œitâ€™s just anxiety.â€ 

This has of course caused so much depression and hopelessness. I have been on leave from work multiple times, canâ€™t hardly drive anywhere, canâ€™t enjoy time with friends and Iâ€™m so sick of trying to hold in my panic and pretend like everything is okay. Itâ€™s exhausting. 

I have so much support. People care about me and depend on me. I definitely do not feel worthless but I am beyond miserable and do not want to live like this anymore. Each and every day, the option of not living starts to look like the best and/or only option. I fought so hard my entire life and made it through so much yet this is unbearable. Why would I want to continue living while being so miserable and unhappy? Like whatâ€™s the point? I want to live and I want to live happy, free of worry and anxiety but hopelessness is an awful feeling. 

Itâ€™s amazing how alone I feel while not being alone at all. All these people who love me, care for me and support me yet Iâ€™m so very alone. 

Iâ€™m definitely not actively suicidal. Iâ€™m just thinking out loud here...I completely understand what it feels like to not want to live and itâ€™s awful. 

Anyway, I hope today is a â€œgood dayâ€ and I hope itâ€™s a good day for yâ€™all as well. Letâ€™s all keep fighting and try to live another day. If not for ourselves but for those who love us.
