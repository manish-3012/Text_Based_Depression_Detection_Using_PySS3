Prednisone from lupus flare-up is making me very unstable.I have a great life. I love myself. I have a really caring boyfriend.

But the emotional pain that the prednisone is bringing up is overwhelming.

I'm at no risk of completing the event, just posting this will probably make me feel better.

I just got asked to assist in a LGBTQ panel in my city. I have a great guy who cares about me.

I don't know what to do. I think I might just go sleep/cry for a while.

Prednisone sucks.
