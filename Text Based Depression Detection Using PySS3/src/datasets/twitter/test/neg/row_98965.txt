Is it time?I don't know how much longer I can suffer until I die. This doesn't seem right. What is wrong with me? Why can't I fit into society? I feel like throwing up everything that is left of me. I am disgusted and ashamed of myself. I want to die. I should have died a long time ago. I'm a parasite. I'm a disgrace. I hate myself. I don't deserve love. I don't deserve camaraderie. I wish that I had killed myself long ago. This world is madness. Even if I could I wouldn't want to fit in. I'd rather die. Maybe I should. Maybe I will. I'm more alone now than I ever have been. Maybe it's a sign. It's time.
