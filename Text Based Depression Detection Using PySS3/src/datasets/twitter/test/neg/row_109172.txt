I was supposed to be a computer programmerI finished college, got my B.A. in computer information systems, but because of social anxiety disorder and PTSD I never passed any interviews for a programming position. I had a job in IT I hated for 4 years then started going back to college for a second degree in Japanese with the goal of teaching English abroad, but I failed those interviews too because you need to be happy and friendly to do that (Plus as an IT guy I've been relying on spelling and grammar check for a decade now, which doesn't cut it). Haven't finished the second degree yet. My family is asking about all the "coding bootcamps" that seem to make people successful, but trying to code again just reminds me that it doesn't matter if they don't like you in the first interview and all the time I wasted on it. If I had gotten a programming job, I would probably have enough experience to go to Japan doing that by now, but it all seems hopeless. Life is a competition of being likable that I will always lose. I guess I'll just live below my potential working at some restaurant forever.
