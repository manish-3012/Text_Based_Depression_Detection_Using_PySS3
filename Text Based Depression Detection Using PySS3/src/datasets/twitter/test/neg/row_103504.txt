No one will help me get out of here and I am not willing to be here anymore.Been depressed since childhood, failed college because of it, and now I'm stuck living at home in the place that did this to me. Family cares little about how depressed I am. I want to move to Chicago or the west coast but I can't afford a place to stay. I've begged family and Reddit for help but no one will. I am not willing to let go of my hate for this place, I'm not willing to be here anymore, and if I can't leave immediately then I'm going to do it.
