Can't live in a world like this anymoreApparently it's okay to be openly and proudly sexist as long as it's towards men. I'm so fucking tired of being treated like shit and being put down because I'm a guy. But I'm a man and I'm supposed to just take it, right? Equality is never going to fucking exist anywhere. Fuck this world. 

Only one reason out of probably a thousand as to why I hate being alive on this planet.
