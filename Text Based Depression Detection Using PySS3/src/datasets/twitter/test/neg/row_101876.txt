Today was hardIâ€™ve never had serious thoughts of killing myself. 
Until today. 
It wasnâ€™t some crazy extraordinary story. It was just a hard day on top of exasperating circumstances. 
I dropped out of school and moved to a new city. With that I gave up a mentally depleting but well paying job to work at a better environment but worse paying one. Pretty much, I make crap money. Because of that my boyfriend has had the unfortunate experience of taking everything on himself. We got into a fight, nothing toxic or crazy was said, he was mentally struggling and felt that I wasnâ€™t doing my part. 
Which is true. Iâ€™ve put off getting a second or better job for selfish reasons. 
But this fight just pushed me over. I sat there taking in the truth, that my selfish choices have put a strain on him and our relationship. And with that I sat in my kitchen no longer feeling enough to cry but simply overwhelmed with the need to end my burden on him. I sat there for the first time, even with my fear of death, and wanted to end my life. 

Today was hard.
