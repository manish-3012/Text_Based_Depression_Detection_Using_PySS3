My love and life is going away...I know you think it is not interesting story...You're not a princess his isn't your prince. But...

All of my life was hard...When I was young it was an everyday abuse from my parents and at school. They said I'm fat stubid, horrible and much more. At home a have the same and beating from my father.

School is done. They said I would be an machine tool operator (I dont understand this proffession...I'm a painter and musician) and they filled out a documents for colledge without me. 

So...I'm here. First new friends, beautiful life...And HE IS...

My only one love.And me..His beautiful princess.

All my love is for him. 

Everything been fine. Another life.Without those horrors...

One year...Two Years...

Done.

His bad girlfriend and i'm alone. Because of her meaning about me.

I'm alone for a 6 mounth...

In two days we have a date...

My birthday...Christmas...Without him...I want to die...

I seing him everyday because of colledge. I tryed to take my documents from colledge away but they (not only my parents. I talking about head teacher) do not allow to do it. 

I had a love, care, tenderness only from him...The only one person who thought i'm good and was proud for me. The only one who loved me...He said I'm an Angel so i have a wing tattoo on my wrist...

I don't have any friends...I don't have anyone... He is mocking me now sometimes...

I'm tired because of all life horrors...

I hoped it was the end of my old life...But it is not...

One day I goed to psychiatrist but he is only said "go away" for me...it's not a joke...After it I cryed in hospital for a 4 hours...

I have no choose.

I want to go away from here, from this life...I have no money for it, i have no job(there is no job in my town)...I do not want to see him...I just want to die...
