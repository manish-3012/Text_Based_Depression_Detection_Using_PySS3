I want to kil myselfI donâ€™t want to exist.

And Iâ€™m hoping that by typing this out

Iâ€™ll gain some perspective that will stop me from feeling that way

But all I have is a brick wall that Iâ€™ve erected

That prevents me from feeling the truth

Because it scares me so much

It hurts me so much

Fuck existence

Itâ€™s so overrated

And everyone wants to claim it over everyone else

Thereâ€™s no room in my mind for everyone and everything

I just have this scared little kid running away

Giving me tunnel vision

Surviving when I no longer need to

Relax.

Relax.

Breathe.

Itâ€™s not your fault.

Itâ€™s chemistry,
