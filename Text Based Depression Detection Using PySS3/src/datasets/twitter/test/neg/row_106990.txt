QuestionI juste came out of a long period of depression, i went to psychologist for 6 month, now i feel a lot better but i keep being so obsessed with sadness, i love being sad but i don't feel depressed it's like i am not depressed but deeply sad for no reason. Why do i love sadnesse so badly ? (Sorry for my english by the way)
