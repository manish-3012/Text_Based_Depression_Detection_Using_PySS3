My Sister Wants to Kill HerselfHey, I need help. My sister has been pulled out of college by my parents because she was drinking a lot and my parents are Christian. They love her, but she doesn't see it. She continues to sneak around and drink and do drugs at home and when she goes out with friends. She was caught a few weeks ago and sent to the hospital and a psych ward because she was saying she wanted to kill herself. Last night she went out and was caught again when she got home, and now she is talking about killing herself again. I don't know what else to do, and I don't even know if this is the right sub for this, I don't even know if this story makes sense. I need help, she isn't getting better, she doesn't take her medication, and she is almost always drunk or high but my parents somehow don't even notice. I don't know what to do or how to help, I am so scared of losing her. She knows I love her, that's one of the few coherent things that comes out of her mouth when she's screaming about how she wants to die and begging for me to let her go. I'm 17, she's 21. I don't know if this makes sense, or if I am following the rules, I just really need some help, please.
