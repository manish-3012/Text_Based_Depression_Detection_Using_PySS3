Grades are worsening my suicidal thoughtsI have been a straight A student for as long as I can remember but this year due to my suicidality and depression being so bad I have a C and a B+. Itâ€™s killing me inside even though I know I can probably bring them back up to Aâ€™s if I try. I have been trying to get better but this start off to the school year has not helped in the slightest. Does anyone else struggle with not getting high enough grades for their own perfectionism?
