Is This Really All there is....Hello first reddit post, I am 22 years old and as long as I can remember I have been struggling with Anxiety and Depression, and life hasent been going the greatest either. Im thinking about ending it because im tired of all the pain I experiance and deal with on a Daily basis. Basically every relationship I have been in I have been cheated on and lied to all my friends expect for one lie to me and don't really care about anything but themselfs. Im tired of living and dealing with the constant thought of not being enough or ever good enough for myself or anyone. When I look in the mirror I just see a walking corpse with a fake smile on it. It hurts to try and hide the pain and fake the happiness just to be a fuctional member of sociaty. Im tired so, so very tired and ready for all of it to end. My current relationship isvery complicated but I love them with all my heart yet I always feel like I have been fucking up and can't do anything right. The constant urge to cut has cost me my job due to the scars and I am currently in debt. I just don't know anymore. For so many years I have held on for some reason I have yet to understand but my grasp is loostening every second I breathe. I have tried therapy and medication yet nothing helps. I don't know Im done with it all, death seems like the only break I can catch in life so thats why I am here trying to figure out if theres something I can do to help it other then just suffering. Im probably not going to be alive for much longer and Im sorry for roping any of you into this sad story but I thought I should say something before I die.
