Feeling like it's not worth itI've been dealing with chronic back pain (on top of other pain like arthritis) yesterday (despite being pretty sure they wouldn't help me) I went to urgent care. As I was leaving after them not doing anything to help I called my mom to tell her what was up and I was so upset I was sobbing while talking to her, she was worried i might do something and insisted i take a taxi so i'd get home sooner and safely.  I told her i was already at the bus stop and i'd see her in a few minutes.  Today she's decided i have had a shitty attitude for the last few days and she wishes i'd do something about it because she's tired of it...gee thanks it's a shame no one is willing to help me, maybe i just end everyone's suffering.  I mean no one will miss me.
