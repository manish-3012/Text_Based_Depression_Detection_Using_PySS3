31, fourth "love of my life" breaks up with me after I teach her how to love herselfI'm just tired, you know? So tired. I'm worthless, no degree, no job. Surely that had something to do with it, but whatever. 

I gave this one last shot, and once again, it failed. I now have a 4th scar..to-be on my arm. I'll learn one day. 

I'd rather just find oblivion, though, and leave this cursed place.
