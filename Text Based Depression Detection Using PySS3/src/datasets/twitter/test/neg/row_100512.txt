Do this before you suicide364 days 11 hours and 17 minutes, Iâ€™ll do whatever it takes to change my life to the best, and if it doesnâ€™t and the countdown reaches 0 Iâ€™ll end my life.


I think itâ€™s a nice and motivating idea, i considered suicide (again) yesterday and now that i made a countdown i simply stopped thinking about suicide that much and now focusing on making my life better.


I think you should try it, give yourself 1 year time frame and do whatever it takes to make your life better, if it nothing happened in 1 year then you can say that you at least tried until the end.

But on the bright side, your life might and will change, you might have a better life and feel proud of yourself because you made it, my idea is go for it and give it a shot, thereâ€™s nothing to lose since youâ€™re already in the process of giving up on life. So why not fight until the very end.



Finally, hereâ€™s a quote that i like :


â€œ If youâ€™ve got time to fantasize about a beautiful death, why not live beautifully until the end? â€œ
