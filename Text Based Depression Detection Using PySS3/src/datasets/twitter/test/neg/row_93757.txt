Do I need to go to hospital? I attempted suicide and nobody knows.I just attempted suicide a few hours ago. I was overdosing on pills, and stopped myself part way and threw them all up (I counted them all except three, sorry I know that's gross). I then started to beat myself up for chickening out, so I started putting loads of pills in my mouth, but I couldn't swallow them, so just spat them out. I then slit my wrist, bandaged it up and drove home. 

Should I tell anyone about this? Should I go to the hospital? I definitely got rid of all the pills so I'm not worried about my liver, but I'm not really feeling better mentally. 
I was planning to tell my partner when I got home, but she started having a bit of a go at me for something my family did that was making her anxious, so I decided it wasn't a good time :(.
