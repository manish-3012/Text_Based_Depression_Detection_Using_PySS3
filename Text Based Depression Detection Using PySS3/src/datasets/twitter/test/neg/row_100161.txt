Help. I'm a freshman in college and I suffer from a nervous system disorder called RSD. Its essentially chronic pain with other symptoms and I've had it for a year and a bit. It affects my right foot so I am always on crutches. I've been getting nerve blocks that give temporary relief, the average has been 2 months but the last two haven't worked. 

I don't want to live my whole life in crippling pain or under the influence of heavy medication. It's not really living if you can't think.

I don't know what to do.
