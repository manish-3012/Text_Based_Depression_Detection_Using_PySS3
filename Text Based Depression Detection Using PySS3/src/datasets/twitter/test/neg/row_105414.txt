Just ventingIve thought about killing myself everyday for the last 12 years. Im honestly shocked ive made it this far, but recently the feeling has been getting to be too much. I dont want to hurt anyone with my suicide but I think eventually the ideation will surpass that. I need a good cry but I can't. I feel like I need to talk, but I don't know what to say. It's a burden being myself. I'm not sleeping much these days. Last night I spent 2 hours watching videos of people shooting themselves in the head on repeat. There was one video with 12million views. The comments were like "nothing of value lost here" and "faggot shouldve done it sooner". I know that's not everyone in the world, but knowing there are people like that out there made me really sad. My SSRIs arent working anymore. I feel like I want someone to give me permission to die. Not sure what else to say. Thanks for reading.
