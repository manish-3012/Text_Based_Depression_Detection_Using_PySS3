I think I'm ready to die.For context, I am a 20 year old female. I still live with my parents because I attend community college and am currently unemployed.

I have multiple issues that, over the years, have escalated to a breaking point. It seems like the only way out of a constant barrage of steaming hot bullshit is to end it. I'll try to keep things short and only go over the main points. 

-I think about food constantly. I love food. Especially that unhealthy, greasy, salty nastiness that everyone says you should cut out of your life forever. Being a typical female, I am horrified of becoming fat, which I'm probably well on my way to being. I'm not even chubby yet, but I'm definitely not bikini material- Just average. However, this absolutely plagues me. The more I think about food, and how I should diet [or make a 'lifestyle choice'], the more I want to eat. However, I'm afraid to eat, because I'm already big enough. Which leads to me doing the worst possible thing- binging. I don't throw up after or take laxatives, although I admit both of those things I have given substantial thought to. I even frequently google pro-ana websites for tips on how not to be such a fatty. I have little to no self control over what I eat. I've kept food journals, tried to get others to help me make better eating decisions, tried to get my parents not to buy nasty crap for me to eat. None of it works. And what's worse is I can cook really well- fuck no I don't want broccoli, I want cheesy hashbrowns! Load up the fat please, *I apparently don't have enough of it around my waist*. 

-I was raped when I was 16. He was my boyfriend for a brief period of time. My fear of him led me to not take the SAT/ACT because he was at the same testing site as I was- I was signed up and ready to go until I saw him there. I fled to the bathroom to call my parents to pick me up. They yelled at me, and did eventually come get me. I know I could have signed up on another day, but I was stricken with absolute terror every time I thought about it. Hence, why I currently attend community college. 

-I love my parents. But they do not understand the concept of TLC. They are more adept to 'tough love', whether or not the situation calls for it. I have gotten yelled at for being raped, being afraid of going to my rapist's workplace, his mother's workplace, and other areas he frequented, I have gotten yelled at for being insecure, for eating, for not eating, for eating at the wrong time of day, and disagreeing with my parents, just to name a few. We also have the 'arbitrary bullshit' arguments that everyone has with their parents. However, mine get blown out of proportion. They will not listen to my side, they call names, criticize me, and lie to get their way and win the argument. They placed me in therapy after I blew up at them and told them to stop doing such things because it was not respectful. I understand the concept of **my house my rules**, but it gets ridiculous. My dad is also a self-proclaimed sexist. He's very respectful to other women, he's not a pig or anything, but it absolutely shames him that I enjoy video games, desire to ride a motorcycle, and do other typically masculine things.

-My last boyfriend [not the rape guy] fucked up my social life two years ago. All the friends I've made in twenty years now strongly dislike me. Verbal harassment is common, being told I'm a bitch or a whore, [For the record, I would be a virgin were it not for the rape.] just knowing that sometimes people will come into town and ask about gossip for me. I'm *that* girl. I don't even go into town anymore. I stay inside, and with what new friends I do have, I don't even go out with them. I don't get close to them for fear of losing them. He also cheated on me right after we got back together. He is still dating the girl, she enjoys making shit up about me to the people who love hearing gossip. Her sister is famous, and her parents basically own the town I live in. One of my old best friends had a crush on me- he told her I cheated on my then-boyfriend with him, which was absolutely not true. She told everyone. She also now attends my school which I am not in this semester. 

-I worked at a Walgreen's for a while last year. I was a pretty excellent employee. Ended up getting canned when someone told the boss they saw me 'out and about' on a day I called in sick. I had food poisoning that day. Never got the chance to explain myself. The next job I got was at a law office. I got laid off after two weeks, 'we never should have hired you. we just don't have enough business.' A week later, they call me back. 'We have business now, come work for us again.' Two weeks later, I get laid off again. 'You aren't a good worker, your work ethic sucks, you never do what you're told, you make too many mistakes, also we don't have enough business.' I was an excellent worker. I know for a fact I didn't make mistakes, and my work ethic ruled- I was always busy, and when I had a lull in my work, I helped other people. But it doesn't matter, because if I apply for a new job, they aren't going to believe me. They're going to believe my former employer. So, can't use that on my resume either. That's two out of three black marks on my record at only 20 years of age. The other job is fine, I have excellent references from them. But two out of three is not promising. The second time I got laid off has also instilled even more self-doubt in me; did I really make that many mistakes? Am I still making mistakes? No other job would want me if I can't even do the basic crap from that law office. Also, my aunt just applied for my old job. Not a terrible thing to do, but I almost feel as if I should be more offended... it seems rude, in a way.

-Current boyfriend is in treatment for brain tumors. When he's not having brain surgery, he is getting some form of radiation. The last time I saw him, he had holes in his head and was bleeding profusely. I can't really go on about this, but it stresses me out. I don't want to leave him because I love him, but I can't fix him either, and I just feel useless.

-Aforementioned current friends- about 10 total. I have no best friend. The 10 are my boyfriend's friends. I have none of my own. They are nice enough to include me because I am their friend's girlfriend. 

-Sometimes I feel like sobbing, but I can't. I hallucinate- and no, I'm not on any drugs, and I don't do drugs recreationally, either. I'm unemployed, and probably won't get a job because of my resume. I don't have any connections, and I don't have any money. I have an idea for an invention, but I'm sure if I tried to get it patented and sold, I'd end up screwed over. Plus, I wouldn't even know where to start- I have no money with which to help myself along. 

So my plan is this: Wait a week. Try to notice nice things about life. Think about how badly it would hurt people if I killed myself. Try to want to live. If nothing changes, swallow some pills or something.

To be honest, I'm mocking myself right now- not too many people would be upset if I died. It would be another thing to gossip about. Probably it would be misconstrued as a heroin overdose or something. My parents would be better off not supporting a fully grown child. My boyfriend would probably have less stress too, but he'd be sad for a little while. Once it sunk in that he didn't have to care for me anymore, maybe he'd even get better, which would lead to good news for his parents. 

As I see it, my death is a pretty beneficial thing.

EDIT: I should also add that I have no hobbies or passions. Nothing is really enjoyable any more, and hasn't been for years. I can't lose myself in anything because I'm not interested in anything.
