Reddit, I survived a suicide attempt 2 months agoA few months ago my wife asked me for a divorce. When I finally got around to talking to her about it I realized that I had treated her poorly. This really messed me up. I wanted to make things right with her but she had already moved on and didn't want to try. The only other option I felt I had was to atone for what I had done.

My wife is an amazing person, and there's no excuse for the way I treated her. I felt the only appropriate punishment was death (I am rather hard on myself). I took a 3 inch knife and stabbed myself in the chest.

I missed my heart (I was aiming for my heart) but I did puncture my lung. It was going to take about an hour but I would've died from the punctured lung and other complications.

[Here](http://imgur.com/WHqB9) (warning, hairy man chest) is a picture of me right now.  The knife wound is in the upper middle portion of the picture.  The scar on the left side is from where they inserted a chest tube to vacuum out my chest cavity to re-inflate my lung (and suck out stray blood).

My wife had called the police and they found me shortly after I stabbed myself and was drifting in and out of consciousness. I was taken to a hospital where they patched me up and sent me to inpatient psych.

I'm on some medications now that really help. Of course I'm doing a lot of therapy as well. Two months later and I'm feeling ok that I'm still here. I will have to forgive myself for how I acted in my marriage before I can feel good about being around.

The thing I want people to take away from this is that if you're in a crisis get help and get on some medication. I was resistant to drugs at first but they literally took me out of the pit of despair I was in and make my therapy more effective.
