Just want it to endEveryday is the same. I wake up feeling optimistic, thinking that today is another day, I slog through work and come home with zero motivation to do anything but waste away in bed. 

Iâ€™ve dealt with depression for most of my teens. It usually comes in short bursts. Itâ€™s hard, but it gets better. I taught myself to be patient and optimistic, because there was always a silver lining. But I donâ€™t have that feeling anymore. I canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s been weeks or months. It feels like an eternity. I try my best to deal with it with humour and optimism, but i just canâ€™t do it anymore. All of my hobbies, my escapes from the world, just feel pointless. I have no enjoyment from games, music, being social. I have no enjoyment in general. Iâ€™m trying my best but I just donâ€™t see the point anymore. Every time, I go through the charade again and again and again and for what? Iâ€™ve spent so long trying to fit in with everyone else that I wasted my teens with no one by my side. Iâ€™ve always been an outcast. All Iâ€™ve ever wanted was to be looked to as an equal, but all anyone cares about is Iâ€™m on the spectrum. They treat me like Iâ€™m lesser than them because of a stupid title that I never asked for and frankly donâ€™t understand flat out. 

Iâ€™m just so alone. I feel like I have no one and nothing anymore. Iâ€™m trying so hard to please everyone but end up pleasing nobody. I want to explain whatâ€™s going on but they either donâ€™t listen or donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I just want it to end. I canâ€™t keep going anymore.
