I feel so hopelessAs much as I'd like to try and make myself think that I am worth something, am good at something, worth of love and validation, I just know I am lying to myself. I have been having suicidal thoughts for over 4 years now. Although I do admit that sometimes I thought it got better only to drop down into a mental bottomless pit of self-loathing, dissapointments, and thoughts of hurting myself in one way or another. So much bad, traumatizing, ans other hurtful stuff has happened into my life so far. No matter how much of a good person I try to be, I keep getting hurt. I rarely lie, I am trying to be the friend I wish I'd had, the lover I need, and even try to be my own parent... i'm just never good enough. I know my parents never wanted me into this world. I know they aren't proud of me no matter how much I try. I have lost so many good friends because they have mistreated me, abandoned me for someone better, or had no interest in me. I am never good at something and I don't believe I ever will be. No matter how much I try to excel at whatever I do, I always will be average. I am not pretty, have a nice body, nice hair, or anything like that. I have been bullied so so much in my youth. I have been cheated on, lied to, and abused by people I loved and would take a bullet for... i have so many traumas from many more events then these. I am always expecting someone has bad intentions with me and if they don't I just know I will lose them soon enough because I'm just so replacable and disposable. I am so tired of crying so much, being afraid, sad, and angry for all these years. And whenever I enjoy myself, it never lasts and I always feel like I do not deserve it. 
The way this is going I do not feel like it'll ever get better. I've been on medicine for a while, I've been to all kinds of therapists for years, and trying to get out of this tired me so much... i just want to stop being a bother to the world, or wish to know what I have done to live like this. 
I wish I wasn't too scared to just take my own life. Because I know how much work it'll actually requires. I can't just hang myself in my house, I do not want people to see me like that. 
First, I will donate any valuable stuff I have to friends, or charities. Then I'd need my family to hate me enough to be kicked out of their lives, dissapear from the internet, be forgotten by friends and my dog who I love so so much. Then I'll travel far away, change my appearance if I can and overdose on drugs, hopefully to be never found again.
I will miss my dog so much, I'll miss my parents and friends so much and tell them how sorry I am for everything. I wish I could tell that now as well, but I'm scared they'll get mad at me. 
I wish I could change, or that something turns my life upside down for the better. I'm so tired, so full of guilt, pain, self-pity, self-loathing, sadness, anxiety and anger. I wish it would stop.
I'm so sorry for this large text and rant, but I don't know where else to go right now. It's been so bad lately. I have reasons to live too, but there are only more and more bad reasons adding up.
