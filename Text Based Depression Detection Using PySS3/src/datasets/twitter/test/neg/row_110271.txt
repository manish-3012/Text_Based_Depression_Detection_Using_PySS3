Need to ventDamn I sure love going from feeling stable to depressed and suicidal over and over and over again with no end in sight other than, inevitably, death.

Every time it starts to get better everything crashes again. It's like trying to keep water in a sieve. I hate it so much but I can't stop it and come out alive. Idk what to feel anymore

Sorry for wasting your time
