I don't want to live anymoreI just realized that I truly don't want to be alive anymore, I don't want to get better anymore and I don't want anything to do with living more in this hell
I've been seeing a psychologist for 7 months now and I don't feel any better I actually feel worse because these sessions reminded me of many bad memories and I realized that I never been happy even when I was a kid! I'm just wasting my time and my money when I go there
My suicidal thoughts are getting stronger every single day and it's so overwhelming I used to challenge these thoughts and brush them off but now I'm not gonna do that anymore I'll let them engulf my mind and hopefully I'll come up with a good plan to kill myself and be away from this hell. I don't give a fuck about how my family will react and I don't give a fuck if God will get angry and throw me in hell
Fuck all that, bro
