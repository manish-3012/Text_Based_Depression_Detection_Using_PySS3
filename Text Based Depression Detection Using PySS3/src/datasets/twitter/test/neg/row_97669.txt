Any depression hotline I can call for free?I know this question doesn't really fit the group but I don't know where else to ask. I've always felt disconnected and empty from the world. I had been doing better though. I started college and had a sense of purpose. However my mom who is the most important person in the world to me broke down recently. She screamed and cried so hard about how she wanted to die. She's said she's experienced zero joy this year and has no one. I'm completely broken. I feel as though I've complete failed as a person. My mother is the only person I have in my life. The only person I'm living for is my mother. And she wants to take her life from me. I cry myself to sleep every night. I need someone to help me. Is there any depression hotline that I can call for free? I really can't afford it.
