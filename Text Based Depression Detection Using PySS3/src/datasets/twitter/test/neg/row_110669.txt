My gaming addiction has gotten out of hand, and I really don't have any other options.Some of you may have seen that video of that fat prick who played CoD by himself at his friends house for &lt;3 hours and then acted really insane when they tried to take it from him.

Although I'm not a prick, I am just as much as a shut-in as he is. 
I have friends, I just don't see them as much as I used to. Today I played roughly 8 and a half hours of Gmod, starcraft and a few other things. My parents tell me that I should be embarrassed that I do it so much. 

And, frankly, I kind of am.

You know, I had dreams from years ago that I still have today. Start a charity, or run for senate, do some cool stuff. That really sounds like what a smart-ass would say, now that I think about it.

But I can't find the incentive to leave my fucking chair. But when i do,

I use my phone the whole time I walk the dog.
I am on my phone at lunch.
I can barely get out of my seat to meet my dying grandmother.
I have done the "timer thing" that some people try to use, and I don't have the willpower to do ANYTHING.

It has even been seeping into my little brother. Yeah. I fucked him up too. He is in the same boat that I was only two years ago.
Each time, it gets worse and worse. My parents, good people by the way, have learned to "deal with it"

I am not really worried about myself as much now. I am worried about my future.

I am doing well enough to get into a decent college, but I feel like I am going to be "that guy" who does nothing all semester without parents to bug him into doing stuff, then fails school, then fails life.

Every effort I made to change myself failed. The problem with this addiction is that electronics are everywhere, and I don't think I can regulate myself.

Is it worth it?
