I wish I could go to sleep and never wake upMy anxiety is so bad itâ€™s killing me. Sometimes I try not to care about what other people are thinking but it just all comes back to me. Constantly I canâ€™t stop thinking about what others think about me. When I feel suicidal, I think â€œhey why not just not give a fuck for a bit while Iâ€™m still hereâ€ but then I pussy out and donâ€™t want to commit suicide then these feelings of anxiety just come back.

I was really thinking about blowing all the money that I have in the city that I love but I donâ€™t even know how or where I would even kill myself. I just want to disappear from the world....or just run away from my family. I canâ€™t just run away though
