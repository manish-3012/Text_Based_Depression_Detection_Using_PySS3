I bought a new knife. I want to hurt myself so bad..I'm tired of being treated bad. 

I'm sorry I am still alive .. I have wanted to die since I was 11 (I'm 30 now) I tried to kill myself so many times but I was failed. 

But this time I think I can be gone. This world wants me to die . Things just make me feel bad and worthless. 

I'm sorry my son. He supposed to be born to good parents who is rich, kind and normal.. 

I'm tired of everything. 
Every day is so hard to live . 

I wish I could knew why I was born in this world, If there was reason ...
