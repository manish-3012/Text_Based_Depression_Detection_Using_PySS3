I'm a freakI don't know why I am alive. I have hated myself for so long. I had a great life and I threw it all away. House. Wife. Kids. Property. The American dream and I ruined it all because I thought they all deserved better. Now I sit here alone. Still wanting to die every day. I threw it all away. Please Don't be like me
