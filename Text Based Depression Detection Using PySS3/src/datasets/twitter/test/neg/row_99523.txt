Will, life insurance, what to do about loose ends?I'm at the stage now to where I'm pretty sure I've made my mind up.  The funny thing is I never thought I would ever get here.  As in, never even considered killing myself, ever.  I was never clinically depressed, always optimistic, not unhappy...

But here I am.  I don't really want to get into why I've come to this conclusion yet, but it was a rational one.  I just don't see the point anymore.  And as each day goes by, I think about it more and more.

I need to know what to do about a will.  I have a bit of savings and some possessions (like a nice car) that I don't know what to do with.  I see that I don't need to contact a lawyer in order to have a will, but however will it hold up in court if it's not 'official'?

I know when I was very young I heard my mother talking about having taken out life insurance on me.  I know that suicides basically null any life insurance policies but I was wondering where I could find out more info about this?  I also know some insurance policies say suicides null them if within two years of taking out or paying out, so trying to figure out how to go about finding out what her policy on me is.  She wasn't a good mother but I at least feel like she should be taken care of, I suppose that feeling of seeking approval never really goes away, does it?

Perhaps this isn't allowed, like a discussion of methods isn't allowed, in that case, I'm sorry.
