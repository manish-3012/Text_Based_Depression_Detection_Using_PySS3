Lock down has made me realise that if all my family members were gone, I'd rather be gone too.It's been a massive upheaval for everyone, I think. The way I do my job has changed completely. I used to enjoy work, but now I no longer enjoy it at all. It's so hard to get out of bed every single day, and I'm not even interested in my hobbies anymore. My boyfriend is tired of being emotional support, which he's been for 3 years without any changes, and he's probably about to break up with me. If my family members were dead, I think that would be the last barrier. I'd rather be gone, too.
