Need help killing myself.I have been considering suicide for a while now and just really want to die. But I don't know what to do to successfully do it. I thought about overdosing on pills, but all I have is 46 ibuprofen pills, some arthritis pain pills with Tylenol in it, and other random pills. Would overdosing on that kill me?
