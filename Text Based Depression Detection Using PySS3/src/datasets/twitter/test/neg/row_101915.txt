Things are getting better but Iâ€™m having more suicidal thoughtsIâ€™ve been training at a new job for over a week. Found an adorable abandoned kitten outside that Iâ€™m now fostering. And yet all I can think about all day is just going to buy some 9mm and just being done with it. 

Get some alcohol weed and the gun go up into the mountains watch the sunrise then blamo. Of course bring the kitten to a shelter first. Idk Iâ€™m so tired. I just donâ€™t want this life
