I'm exhausted of myself talking about how exhausted I amI don't want to talk. Talking never helps, it just makes me even more exhausted to talk about my woes. At this point I don't want to talk to anyone. Is it too bad to just go? You will miss me for a month or two but eventually I'll fade. It's going to be better for both of us. I just worry about my mother. Wish I could just cease to exist and doing so erasing all the memories everyone holds of me.
Just another night wide awake wrapped in the arms of ideation.
