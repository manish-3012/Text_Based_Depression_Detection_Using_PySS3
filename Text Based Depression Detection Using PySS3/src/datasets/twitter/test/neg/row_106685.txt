Do you guys ever feel like theres a legitimate, non-medical reason for someone to end their life? A circumstance, feeling, emotion or mind-set that can be seen as reasonable or understandable?Alot of people always say that things get better, or that they always regretted attempting the act if they survived. Medically\-assisted suicide is commonly accepted now, but do you guys think there are any other reasons that you think, even to the slightest degree, can be justified? Please no bias or BS, i want some honest un\-filtered opinions. If you genuinely think things can get better, please explain why or tell us your experience, otherwise what do you guys think?
