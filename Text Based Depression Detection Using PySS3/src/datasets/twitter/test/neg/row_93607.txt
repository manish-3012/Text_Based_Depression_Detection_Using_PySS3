i don't see a futurethe one thing that used to keep me from attempting again was the fantasy of a happy and beautiful future. i'm so lost in my self hatred that i can't find anything to live for anymore. i cant imagine anything that could make my life better, or life without my mental illnesses. everything i do is just an unhealthy coping mechanism to procrastinate death.
