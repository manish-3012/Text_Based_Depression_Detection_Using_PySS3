Suicidal person on my hands keeps talking about taking her life and have no idea what to do or where she lives now - the fuck do I do?I'm trying to help her through this, but if it gets too far there's no way to point people in her direction. All I have is a name anymore. 

She's an ex and I still give a fuck about her as do a lot of other people. She's borderlining crisis and I don't want her to step over that line. 

What the fuck do I do? How do I help without making it worse?
