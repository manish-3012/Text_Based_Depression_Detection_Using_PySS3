Can't find work, and I want to kill myself.Over the years I've been looking I must have sent out thousands of applications, and have gotten a handful of interviews. I've been hired at my local community college as a student worker, but since leaving it I haven't had any luck landing a job. 

I had to move back in with my parents, and I feel like such a drain on them and everyone around me. Surely it would be better if I just hung myself, right?
