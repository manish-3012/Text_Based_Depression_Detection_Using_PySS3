I almost died last nightI have been dealing with bipolar depression and high anxiety for at least 10 years. Last night I felt like there was no hope left. All the medications Iâ€™ve tried, all the therapy sessions, even stayed at a hospital for a few days. I left my house last night to go for a walk, telling my fiancÃ© I love him. After about 10 minutes, I texted him how sorry I am and that I canâ€™t be there for him like he needs. I planned to go to a highway near my home and walk into the middle of it. My fiancÃ© got worried after that text and drove and found me leaving our neighborhood. He brought me home, gave me my medicine and told me to go to bed early and have a full nights sleep. I woke up feeling no better. I found this forum by chance and thought why not post. Maybe itâ€™s attention seeking or a cry for help, I donâ€™t know.
