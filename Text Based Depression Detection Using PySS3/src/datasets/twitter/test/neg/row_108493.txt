i cant bring myself to do iti cant kill myself. i either pussy out when trying to shove a handful of pills down my throat, or i pussy out when i try tying a belt around my throat. i am a problem to everyone, couldnt even be there for my father today, i dont know why i am still here, and ive never known why im here. every day feels like a waste of time, a repeated cycle, i cant even talk to my therapist about this because she'll probably tell my parents or something worse, and i cant talk to anyone about it, noone would get it because they all act the fucking same when i do tell them about something bothering me why am i so fucking stupid
