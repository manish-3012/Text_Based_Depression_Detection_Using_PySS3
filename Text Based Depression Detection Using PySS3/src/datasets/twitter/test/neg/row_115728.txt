Please help.I graduated from college at the beginning of May and the day after my Mom told me she was diagnosed with breast cancer. I've had to move home because I don't have enough to move out, and that along with personal issues (boyfriend broke up with me, history of depression and anxiety) is making it so difficult to cope that I literally have no idea how to make it through. To top it all off, I'm not allowed to express my feelings to my mom because she says that she doesn't want to hear it. Also, I don't have any friends here because my mom moved from my hometown while I was in college.

tldr; finished school, have crippling student debt, no job yet, mom has cancer, no friends in hometown, boyfriend broke up with me.
