Planning to kill myself tonightIt is been a shitty year so far for me, lately I've been thinking about suicide almost on a daily basis but nothing further that, I guess I was scared or didn't want to hurt the few people that care about me.

I am a really shy person so I don't talk much with most of my family, not even my siblings, the only people I'm close with are my parents and my grandma, I've never had a girlfriend nor do I know how it feels to love someone that way.

As I previously said 2020 was being a rough a year for me, I kept thinking that things were eventually going to get better, but with all that is happening right now in the world I just feel I can't go on anymore.

I just needed to get this off my chest; I plan on hanging myself since it is pretty much the most efficient/quick method I have available, whether I succeed or not is unknown, however everyday I feel a lot of pain and I can't take it anymore.
