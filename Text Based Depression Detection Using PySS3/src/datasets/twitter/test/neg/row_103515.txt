I just ruined a marriageI have never wanted to just not exist so much in my life. I have pretty bad anxiety and have had suicidal thoughts before, but that's always just been background noise. Mostly anxiety. 

I started getting involved with someone I shouldn't have, was so innocent (as it always fkin is). He is married with a 3 year old and a pregnant wife. He just text me and told me she knows everything, and now our whole community is going to find out and I don't know how to deal with it. How am I meant to face that and be like oh yeah btw guys I'm literally the shittest homewrecking cunt on the planet. What's good. I am aware how selfish suicide is and not trying to excuse my actions or anything like that. I just need help. I need clarity. Why are humans shit.
