Why should I live?You were born without your permission.

Now, in order not to starve, die, or live in incredible pain, you have to work.

So you devote at least 40 hours of your time every week + commute + all other forms of work to be able to continue living.

So you continue living for what exactly? Oh yeah, to continue working.

You lose precious sleep, you suffer health consequences, you are too tired to do anything meaningful in your life.

What is the point, this world will probably die in a 100-200 years.

Why do we suffer so much for basic neccessities?
