VentI had posted here a couple weeks back, or whenever it was. I never went through with my plan for some reason, I guess because, like I said, Iâ€™m too much a whimp. 

Iâ€™ve been hoarding pills and razors and hoping Iâ€™ll just man up and do it, I guess. It feels dumb talking about it but I just feel the need to say all of this.

I never really knew what people meant when they said everything was gray, or bland. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in early middle school, so itâ€™s nothing new to be suicidal/paranoid, but for the past couple months the lack of anything is just so weird. I donâ€™t crave food. I donâ€™t feel hungry. I donâ€™t like to eat, and when I do finally get around to eating, food is just tasteless. Even sweets that I used to love arenâ€™t appealing to me anymore. Every breath seems like physical work. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m trying to inhale with somebody sitting on my chest. Iâ€™m easily irritable and angry at everything (which has lost me the very few people I knew in this town), my migraines have gotten noticeably stronger and more persistent. Everything is going so slow, taking so long, just passing by in some sort of surreal way. Anxiety constantly tears apart all relationships I dare have, whether they be friendly or romantic. 


I constantly just feel far away from conversations, contemplating the Suicide Iâ€™ll possibly never commit, or maybe not in the near future at all. At work, at home, with people, itâ€™s all I can think about. What if? What if I just sped this car up and went straight into that wall? What if I just took all my meds at once? What if I just slit my wrist, or hung myself, or any of the other options? What if I failed?
