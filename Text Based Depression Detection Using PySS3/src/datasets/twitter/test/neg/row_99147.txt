Bored of life.Life is so irritable, so boring, and as i go on, and think about my future. I wonder if im going to bother going on. Its like, when i was 10 i knew what i wanted to do and I was passionate about it, but now im just so bored i have tried a many of things. But i feel like I dont want to do life anymore im not sad just life feels pointless, sleep, eat, do random things, and then repeat. I dont think I want to do that for the rest of my existence, so i have decided that i want to die, to dissapear, so I tried, i made an attempt at my life (overdose) and then I woke up in a hospital, got sent to a mental hospital, forced to go therapy, and now i have the weight of my family, they were so sad and telling me to never do it again. My brother even said if i killed myself that he would follow suite. So now i dont what I can do. How can i just end it without anyone being hurt?
