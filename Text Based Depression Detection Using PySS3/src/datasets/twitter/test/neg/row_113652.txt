I'm planning it so meticulouslyI'm planning my suicide so meticulously for today. I have the drugs that I need. I know what to say to certain people as my last things. I know when I'm doing it. I know everything I'm doing right before: go to doctors and get narcan (give my body a fighting chance if anybody finds me), spend a last hour with my dog on a a walk, say goodbye to the person I love, send scheduled messages that will tell them what I've done without allowing them to stop me.

What is the point of staying on anymore? I've got an unfixable mental illness that tortures me every single day, and I've got ideals for my life that are incompatible with those of my partner or the real world. I resent my life, and the only person that I do care about is pushing me towards suicide anyway.

This isn't to get anybody to try to stop me, believe me if there was a way to do that my boyfriend would've done it by now. I just want a little record, somewhere, to say "I was here, I existed and I made this decision". Thank you for all the help you give plenty of people here on /r/SuicideWatch, you're doing a good thing.
