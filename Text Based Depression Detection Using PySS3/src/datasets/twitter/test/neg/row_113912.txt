I'm haunted by my past and I want to end it because my life doesnt feel like its getting any better. How can I live a life when my passion dies, everyone else is succeeding, and my relationships are superficial?I feel so lost and empty. I'm always sad because I dont have anything that makes me happy. Either someone is making my life hell or Im lacking the drive/inspiration to work on my hobbies. 

I wish I could move out and be able to finish my degree without debt. I wish my crush would love me back. I wish I had the passion to create art for hours without my family's shame pounding in my head. And I wish the world wasnt filled with so many terrible people. All of these childhood dreams dont feel like theyre coming true. No matter how hard I try, I have to drag through 1 more semesters before I can leave my abusive home and experience other cities. But it doesnt even seem people are welcoming or kind. I've never had a supportive friend who has understood my pain.

24 years of hell and I feel dead. I went to school for a degree that I dont love. My parents have been so awful. Its my first week of school and Im so sad. I wont make it this semester. I want to end my life this weekend but fear fucking up and ending up worse. Jumping is my only option.
