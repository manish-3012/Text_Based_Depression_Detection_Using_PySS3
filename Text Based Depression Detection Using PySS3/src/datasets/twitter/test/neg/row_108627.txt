Abusive dad and money issues. I can't handle it.My dad is and has always been verbally and physically abusive. My mom lives with him and enables his behavior because she has no choice, he is the one who makes money. He has never had any close friends since I've been alive. If someone ever came to the house when I was growing up, he would run and hide to avoid. He still does this, even if it's the pizza delivery guy coming to the door. At work, he is very quiet and everyone there thinks he is just mild-mannered polite guy. As soon as he gets home, he is a different person. Because of this, I have NO witnesses that could see his behavior. I've always suspected he has something like Borderline Personality Disorder. My family would never admit to something like this as they live in denial about everything.

Last week, I was in a pinch and had to borrow a couple hundred dollars. This is NOT something that happens regularly, or ever at all. It made me sick to ask and I felt terrible, but let me be clear he has PLENTY of money and this is not hurting him by any means. Asking made me humiliated and he made sure to let me know how bad I should feel. Since I haven't been able to pay it back yet, he called me yesterday screaming and throwing a fit and sent me a bunch of horrible messages about how awful I am. This is nothing new as he has always been known to have complete freak outs over little issues and blow everything out of proportion.

I have some serious bills piling up and cannot make the payments plus the rent I need for this month. I am working full-time but everything is just too much. I desperately want to take out a loan but I haven't established my credit for long enough. The only thing I can do is go stay with them.

I am so scared of having to go stay with him and have my dog and myself get abused. The last time we visited, my puppy gets very excited to see people, and he had a meltdown from the dog resting his chin next to him on the couch. He started hitting my freaking puppy over it!! Over just wanting attention/to be petted. It was horrifying. It's so hard to explain his personality because everything is like, "How could you do that?" He has serious rage issues that he's never been able to control and he flips out over tiny things. Then afterwards, he would act like nothing happened. It's coming down to my only option of having to stay with him and I've been up for days crying about it. For anyone who's lived with mental/physical abusers, you know that just being around these people deteriorates your mental health and causes permanent damage.

If I didn't have my dog, I would 100% commit suicide. After a lifetime of dealing with abuse, and the stress of money issues, I can't take it anymore.
