I'm deathly scared of my mental health I feel like I'm going insaneA few hours ago today I started getting this episode and it lasted until maybe 10 minutes ago. 

I have really bad concentration problems I've missed many busses because I keep daydreaming while I'm waiting at the bus stop. Reading books is nearly impossible for me because I can't concentrate no matter what I do. 

It's usually manageable but for the 2nd time in my entire life for a few hours it felt like I was going insane. I kept getting stuck in my thoughts no matter what I did always repeating the same thoughts about going to the therapist as an emergency talking about the episode I'm having. It felt like I wasn't even awake and almost having a sleep paralysis while awake. When I had to start doing stuff I had a hard time as if I was drunk and I was using way more force than I had to for example accidentally slamming the car door shut really hard. 

At school I usually start dreaming the instant I have to listen without doing anything. I miss up so much stuff each class.

This is happening 24/7 but this is the 2nd time when it was insanely bad for a few hours.
