I promised my therapist two weeksI opened up deeper than I ever have before to my therapist today. I admitted  twice this week I had almost ended it all. She asked me why. I replied that I needed control. Self harm had been my control but I had to chose between cutting and my boyfriend. Letâ€™s just say we are celebrating six months next week. Now the only control I feel is choosing to live or die. It is the fundamental choice that is mine alone. My therapist asked meâ€ Can you stay safe these next two weeks?â€ I said maybe. She replied. â€œI want to see you at our next appointment. I look forward to hearing how things are with your job and boyfriend. I look forward to it. So can you promise me you will be here to tell me about it?â€ I said yes. She asked me to say the promise out loud. I said â€œI promise to stay aliveâ€, then I broke down crying. She started crying as well. For the first time giving up that control felt like a release. I never thought promising someone to stay alive would bring me to such a state of tears and vulnerability. My therapist has helped me become so much more open. She has helped keep me alive. For that I am thankful.
