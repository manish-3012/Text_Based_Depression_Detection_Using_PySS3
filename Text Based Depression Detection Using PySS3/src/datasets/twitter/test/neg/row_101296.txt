Today's not a good day...I gave in to my urge to start cutting again... up to 15 and I don't really plan on stopping any time soon (on a related note, does anyone know how deep a cut/gash needs to be before it needs stitches?)... the alternative actions don't work and I don't want to stop because this is as close as I can get to killing myself without breaking my one year promise.

I don't want help, I just want someone to know that I've taken another step down into my hole and started hurting myself again. I can't put any of my friends through that again...
