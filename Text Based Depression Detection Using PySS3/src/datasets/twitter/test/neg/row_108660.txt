if i diedI just realized that if i killed myself in my room right now it would probably take over a week for anyone to notice that I wasn't alive, and probably 2 weeks for anyone to find the body. That just kind of fucks me up that literally no one even gives a fuck about me. As long as I left the windows open it's enough to stop my body from smelling, so that my neighbors wouldn't know. i really miss having friends
