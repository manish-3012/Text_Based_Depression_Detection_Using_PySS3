Why shouldn't i end my lifeWell.. i am currently in a state of perplexed confusion right now as what to do with my life. I hope to begin to explain my predicament in hope someone has a reasonable solution as the steps i can take to be better i guess for a lack of a better word. So first of all, my life is terrible. always has and looks like it always will be, first of all i have a condition called trimethylaminuria which is essentially a a chronic body odour chugging genetic condition which allows for ridicule and humiliation on an everyday bases as the condition forces me to smell like a hot steaming pile of garbage regardless of showers or baths, i have had this condition for almost 2 years and have lost friends of 10+ years because of it and has forced me to become a troll like figure hiding away in my room from the world. oh and it is extremely rare and uncurable. This would be enough for suicide for some people but unfortunately my misfortunes sadly don't end there as i also have a condition called pectus carinatum which is a chest deformity which causes the sternum to be pushed out in a very visible way, which has done a great deal to my self esteem i can assure you since the age of 13/14. These conditions both howether pale in  the suffering caused by this third curse, in which i have obtained huge TERRIBLE looking scars that i have ever seen even with the searching on the internet which cover at least 55% of my penis from  the base to the tip in which i have absolutely no recollection of its emergence into my life which is a nice mystery for me to investigate in my spare time. Along with a lifetime of bullying in school for my race,body,shoes,wealth and name by children and certain teachers alike i have also been persecuted all my life by my mother who also had blamed me for the abandonment of my father at the age of 7 directly to my face, A memory i would like to forget if possible, and of course my gambling addiction had manifested itself in order to perhaps accumulate wealth in order to try plaster the abyss known as my self worth bu unfortunately has only concluded in a loss of thousands of pounds and has not been as helpful as i had once thought. I am also 19 years of age btw and i apologise for the wording and structure of this writing as im kinda not okayy.
