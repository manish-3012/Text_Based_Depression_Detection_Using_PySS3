I donâ€™t understand...I am 28 yrs old, I had my bachelors degree completed when I was 25 (history teacher). For some reason that didnâ€™t make me feel completed, so I began to complete the process to enter law school but when I was accepted, bam!, my girlfriend got pregnant, so that was the first slap of reality. Having that in mind , I decided to accept a job as a teacher (public system of Puerto Rico), donâ€™t need to say that is an underpaid and stressful job. When I gave the news to my family and friends, they only had bad response to both of them, and that was when I started to retreat my self from any social contact, because I felt I was less for not achieve what I wanted and talked all my life. Once my daughter was born, I had a drug problem, in privet, no one of my family nor friends had an idea of what I was doing to my self with different types of pills (percs, xanax, tramadol, vicodin) and a heavy alcohol use. 
When my daughter got to her 1st yr, I was starting to feel as a mediocre person, a thought that was constantly running in my head 24/7 and that gave pathway to suicidal thoughts and indeed I try to hang myself from the roof of my house (the electrical extension got pealed by my weight and friction between the metal edge of the house) so I thought to find some pro help and work for some time and now I have started to get the same numbness feeling and suicidal thoughts, I think Iâ€™m just a half inch of jumping for a second time...but i have a feeling that makes me sure this time i will not fail, and that scares me to the point I donâ€™t want to be alone for a second.

Sorry if I sound like a dumb person, is just that my first language is spanish.
