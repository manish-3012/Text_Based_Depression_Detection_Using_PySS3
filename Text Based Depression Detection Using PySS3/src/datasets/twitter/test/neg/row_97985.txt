I cant handle it anymoreI need to type out my feelings about how my family that I love is pushing me to kill myself. Its going to be a long a story.

I was suicidal from middle school and all through high school. I couldn't handle the pressure of studying and helping the family's business and working a part- time job. One time, I wrote out my feelings on my iPod that I had in middle school because I couldn't keep holding in my feelings anymore. My dad decided to break in on my iPod and read all my notes I typed. He decided to scold me and yell about how suicide isnt the answer and to grow up. Since then, Ive kept my feelings in. Ive tried killing myself three times already and failed, of course. Now that I graduated hs, I decided to put a hold on college. Im afraid that I might actually kill myself while in school. So far, Ive been happy and content. My parents weren't happy. Of course I understand, I just wish they could understand me as well. 

Today, Ive reached my breaking point

I haven't hung out with my friends for two months because my dad said that since Im a girl I should stay inside. I decided to respect his wishes. But today, we had some relatives from Mexico over and my dad suddenly decided to act macho in front of them. He yelled at me for something so petty that even my family were surprised about how he acted. I was cool the whole time. But I was kinda pissed so I told my parents that I was going to the park to walk. After the walk, I went to barnes and nobles to get some books. Now, let me just tell you that I don't use my phone while driving. Ive seen too many people die because they were using their phones. So, it was a twenty minute drive from the store to my house. I also had the radio on high volume. Went I pulled up to the drive way, I could hear my phone buzzing. I had twenty missed calls from my dad and my brothers. They  just went crazy. When I went inside the house, they were saying that I should tell them where I am at every moment that I can because Im a girl. All in front of my relatives, my family decided to embarrass me. I was only out for about 2-3 hours. It was still daytime. 
My family wants to keep me inside the house thinking thats going to protect me from harm, when in reality they are the ones who are pushing me to kill myself. I cant deal with the pressure of helping out in the family business while working 7 hrs shift at my job that actually pays me and while looking for a college to go to in spring . And yeah, I don't get paid at all at my family's business. Am I in the wrong? Is this normal for girls to go through with their families? I just dont know anymore. 

Thanks for letting me vent, but I don't know how much I can handle this anymore. Im just tired of living.
