I need to vent 3Went to the doctor today and this one genuinely seemed to care about me. Kind of a relief but now I am on anti depressants, anti acids, anti inflammatory and pain killer meds... what a cocktail. Also I have to stop smoking weed cause it cancels out the effects of my painkillers. Everytime I smoke, my back hurts like hell. This is hard...
It hit me just now that I've finally got some kind of help (yay...), but its scary thought to think I might need to take those anti depressants for life (nay...). Still got no money for physiotherapy... Why is this shit not covered by universal healthcare?

Not looking for particular answers. 
Just venting, for those who care. Overall day rating 4/10.
