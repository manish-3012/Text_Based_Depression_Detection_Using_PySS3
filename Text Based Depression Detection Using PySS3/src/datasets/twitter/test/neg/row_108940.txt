I am tired (and drunk a bit)Currently I'm sitting in my chair, listening to music, drinking, but I just can't get drunk. What has my life become? Drinking alcohol whenever there is a chance.

I don't think I will kill myslef, I just don't want to feel anything. It's just these emotions that I can't get rid of, alcohol is just a temporary solution, but when it's not enough, what should I do? Drugs? Suicide is probably better solution than drugs...

I don't even remember what I wanted to say, thank you for reading I guess.
