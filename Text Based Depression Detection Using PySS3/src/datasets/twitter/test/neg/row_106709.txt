I can't think of anything that will make you read my stupid useless life story.Hi. This is the second post I've made on here, and  i will explain why i am using a different account in a short while.

   **Let me organize myself, i guess.** I'm going to be dead within 72 hours. I know you might think this is a cold way to talk about my supposed deep emotional anguish but the fact of the matter is just that, that it's a fact. I'm in my teens. Late teens, about. The facts: I'm still in high school. I feel as if i've been through more than is healthy at this age, if i can be so selfish.

   My depression started when I was 10 and a half or so. I'd been bullied at 8 but never let it affect me. My depression started because i began to feel a sense of apathy and isolation, even though i had lots of friends. It started off cyclothemic/dysthymic, but by the age of 12 it was full blown. I didn't contemplate suicide until I was 14 and it's all I've thought about since then. I only began medication recently, in April. Strange thing, since my father's entire family consists of therapist and my mom interned at a psychiatrist hospital and marketed for antidepressants. So of all people , they should recognize.  I do not blame them. No one wants to admit it.
  
  My mother is borderline- every single woman in her family (since it is somewhat of a matriarchy and out of her 8 cousins 2 are men) has borderline. Her sister is the worst, on medication for psychotic manic depressive episodes. This manifested all the way back in the 1940s. My great grandmother left her 8 children and husband to be with a business man. This is the type of irrational, manic behaviour my family history consists of. Her daughter is my grandmother, who is surprisingly not as  bad as her sisters but she is depressive. 
 
     In addition, My mother's father was an alcoholic, using it as a coping skill for his crippling anxiety. His brother was addicted to pills for the same reason. Both of them are recovered, but still are nervous wrecks.  Their hands constantly shake and they are always on the "go."  The point i'm trying to make is that mental illness has always been a part of my family. 

      It's just how it's always been. My father's family are very calm people, Pennsylvania Dutch, deeply pious. I only wish I had inherited that. Maybe if i'd grown up in the midwest with them my life would've been different. But I grew up surrounded by my maternal family. By god, i love them, but it is so incredibly toxic. Of the 8 cousins, two have had relationships. My mother and her cousin. And these people are all in their late 30s to late 40s. They have the distinction of being from a second world *hispanic* country, which we all know is not a shining example of mental illness being destigmatized. So none of them ever got help. Except my mother's sister who is on medication. Well, was. She never takes it.

    I only laid down that road to express how wrought my life has been with chemical imbalances, an undergrown amygdala, faulty neurotransmitters... whatever it is that causes these things, I have never been able to avoid it. Mental illness was a part of my upbringing. I was never abused but I saw tens of horrible self coping mechanisms every day until I moved to the United States.

   I never thought about killing myself until I was 12. I remember the winter quarter of 7th grade walking to science class thinking about what i would write in my note. I couldn't answer my question. I didn't know the reason. I just knew I wanted out.

   I continued in a state of numbness, my self hatred grew. (I have a really exaggerated hourglass figure and it was, and still is, the bane of my existence.) Until I was 15, recently turned actually. I met a boy who became my first boyfriend. We had a good run, but (s)he proved to be increasingly emotionally abusive in the sense (s)he was just... never there, emotionally i guess. Or mentally. Looking back on it (s)he suffered from a severe case of gender dysphoria. I just wish she'd realise how badly it messed me up. She went to college and would ignore me for days on end, and then she just decided to leave. Because the 'distance' was too much. And then she drove 6 hours to fuck some girl i was vaguely friends with.

  I never really had feelings for her honestly. Romantic feelings or not, it hurts like a bitch when someone does that. Every friend I asked for advice honestly could't give me a reason why this happened to me. It was the first official relationship i'd had, but guys i'd dated (as in hung out with) had given me the same reasons. So as you would imagine, my self esteem was not a shining beacon of contentedness. 

  So I did the only logical thing (in my mind.) I rebounded. With a guy from my school, two grades above me, star lacrosse champ, popular, everyone loved him. He wasn't too harsh on the eyes either. Every girl loved him. I never quite knew why he chose *me* to this day. Maybe because I was so eager to hang out with him. 

  Anyways, he raped me.

   I struggle with this a lot. Two weeks after the horrible blow to my self esteem and this happened. I wasn't even halfway done with high school at this point. I had to get plan b. I couldn't drive so I had to call someone (details would give me away i think) who I wasn't exactly on good terms with. The drive was humiliating and quiet, the only sound the quiet rolling of rocks underneath the german engineered car they drove. 

  I went home, took the pill and didn't eat for three weeks. The fourth week I had a psychotic break. I believed the devil told me to and so I cut off all of my hair and walked to the forest behind my house and wrote down every single thing that I wanted him to change for me, to protect me from. I fully believed that since God didn't help protect me, maybe another force would.

  It went downhill from there. I hung out with a generally unsavory, but well meaning group of people. I did percocet (behind their backs, they wouldn't encourage this.) to dumb myself down. It got to the worst of the worst when I went to a party and someone laced my blunt with Xanax. I was absolutely smacked and got taken advantage of. I don't remember the specifics but I knew i was violated.

  My life was horrible at this point and i really did have a reason to kill myself. But in March I met someone who seemed like the absolute epitome of a great person, if that makes sense. We started dating in April and i must admit he helped me get over my fear of men.  He is possibly the only man that's ever made me feel safe. Every time i lost it when we did stuff he'd help me. He never ONCE overstepped his boundaries. He's been everything but bad.

  Unfortunately this only registered with my brain for a couple of months. 

  The night of this past Mischief night i went to a Halloween party with said previously mentioned group of friends. I went way overboard and drank. A lot. If i had to guess i'd say about 3 cups of jungle juice, 2 shots of vodka, and 3 shots of malibu. The whole night I was a mess. I'd never drank before either. Slurring "yeeesss shotsss!! comeon!!!" is definitely not who i am. My boyfriend knew this: we got into an argument. With good reason too because I was being an asshole. A guy groped me and this reminded me of my rape (s). In that over emotional state you get when you're drunk, I ran upstairs, threw up, and called my boyfriend. 
  
  He's pretty depressed and I know he'll get mad at me for saying that. He was at a halloween party too and at some point he was so upset his friend took the phone and asked me "What's going on?" I later figured out that I had a psychotic break brought on by alcohol and medications i take. At 5am I tried to hang myself. I felt like a horrible person. (who am i kidding, i always do. I'm a piece of shit.) I held a belt close to my heart and began to walk to my wooded backyard. My father grabbed me and I was then hospitalized.

   Never in my life have i experienced anything so miserable. Words cannot describe the dehumanization, overly cautious patronization and feeling of restraint I felt in those horrendous four days. It isn't that I was treated inhumanely but I looked around me: schizophrenics and girls who had trouble with the law. I didn't see myself above them but i knew this was not the level of care I required. I felt like a freak who'd been reduced to a hospital armband.

  The diagnoses: Bipolar type I, psychotic tendencies. Borderline Disorder.

  Making me go made me feel worse. I've lost alot of my friends due to my desire to isolate myself. The prompting event for me writing this is that the person I love most in the world, and I rarely feel, tells me we need to take a break. (Not breaking up, he stresses. I don't know if i believe that.) This is my fault. The past month i've been absolutely explosive. Every single thing sets me off. I am self aware. I KNOW i'm being irrational but my psyche tells me if i don't react something will happen to me. It's always vague like that. So i cry, I pinch myself, I punch myself in the face like a lunatic. Because I can't open a jar or someone hasn't replied to me in 40 minutes.

 I know this is abusive behavior towards others. I know i am a manipulator. This is what upsets me so much. I go to therapy but coping mechanisms don't work. The intense urge to react irrationally is like an itch or a sneeze. I can't help it. And I feel like shit for it. 

 I've essentially lost the only thing that's really made me feel better about the recent stuff that's happened to me. It's my fault. This just makes me hate myself more.  I can't help it. We were going to spend the holidays together now he tells me he's not sure when he'll see me again. I care but i'm so used to avoiding things and desensitizing myself I force myself to dissasociate. 

And besides, I deserve all of this.
