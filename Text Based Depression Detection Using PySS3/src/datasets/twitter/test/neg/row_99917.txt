Iâ€™m going to kill myself tonightI told myself I would do it. At this time. On this day. If things didnâ€™t get better, Iâ€™d do it. Things got worse. 
I donâ€™t want to do it. I want things to get better. But Iâ€™ve wanted things to get better for years now. Iâ€™ve been actively and enthusiastically trying to make things better. They havenâ€™t gotten better. Not even a little. Theyâ€™ve gotten worse.
This existence has been difficult for me. I donâ€™t relate to other people. I feel like the world is sick, but Iâ€™m also sick. I have so many emotions right now, most of which have been more eloquently summarized by many other people on here. 
My face hurts from crying, and I feel guilty for writing this. I hate that my only option besides killing myself is calling a hotline and getting myself trapped in a sterile room for the next 72 hours. 
I want there to be another option, but Iâ€™ve run through them all countless times in my head. I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m sorry.
