Hate the feelings of lifeI can't really ever seem to be social. I try to make friends and all seems to be going great every time I do. Then they either just stop talking to me or get really distant. I'm not here to really complain or have someone tell me it will get better. I just want to say it and know that I actually can and did. I always think about just killing myself but I highly doubt I would ever do it. I cant stand the thought of not being able to be there if someone ever did want me or need me.
