I need advice.Lately I've been trying so fucking hard to surface and get over my suicidal thoughts. It's like I run in circles I'm an ex drug addict. I just started to take medication about a few weeks ago it helps but doesn't if that makes sense(prozac for anxiety). Anyways I'll try to keep this short. Lately I've felt like I'm slipping again I started cutting about a week or so ago and I was self harm free since I was 16 (im 18 now). I have had a past of being hospitalized due to mental health issues and I hate going there but It may be like that soon I feel like im hitting Rock bottom again and I lost all my friends since I quit doing drugs it's fucked up. I'm just trying to get my highschool done but I'm afraid if I try to stay strong for too long that I will end up there again. Basically my question is should I self admit myself and try to get help? Sometimes it feels like there's no helping me like I said previously I keep running in circles.
