COVID will probably ruin me financially. There's no reason to live anymore for meMy life has fallen almost totally apart in the past 4 years - the **only** good thing I had left in my life was my small business which was finally starting to be profitable.  But now coronavirus forced me to close, and if this goes on much longer I will be financially ruined. 

I am drinking to numb the pain it but it's still getting worse every day. I will probably end it all soon unless things turn around quickly and I am able to reopen. 

I do not need to be told not to end it. No one but me knows the horrible pain I have been in these past 4 years, and how much worse this situation makes everything else. This is the final straw for me.  If  you were in my situation you'd want it all to just end too. 

There is only so much hurt, anxiety, depression, fear, shame and hopelessness  one person can live with. I don't know how I"m going to get through one more day with these horrible feelings gnawing at me all day. 

The pain of having your only hope for your future ruined before you eyes is  indescribable
