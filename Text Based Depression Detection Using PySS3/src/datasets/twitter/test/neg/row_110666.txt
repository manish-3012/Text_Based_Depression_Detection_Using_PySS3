Anyone else wish something like a robbery would happen so they could intervene and hopefully die?Since I was in my teens I wanted some devastating accident to happen like this so I could die without family knowing I wanted too. This is not normal right? The main thing holding me back is the fact that I know some people may as well die wit me if they knew I off'd myself.
