.People finding out about my depression, just hurts even more? My whole family knows that I have depression now and I feel like I just burdened them even more now. They try to comfort me but their words hurt me even more. â€˜Other people have it worse than meâ€™. Of course I know that. Do you think Iâ€™m fucking dumb? That just makes me want to kill myself even more because Iâ€™m so fucking weak. I canâ€™t take anything. Iâ€™m just gonna act like my depression  magically disappeared cos I fucking prayed like they asked me to. Yeah itâ€™s better that way. I tried getting help but itâ€™s just making me feel even worse.
