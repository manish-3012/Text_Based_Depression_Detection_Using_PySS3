I feel torn apart by my failures and lonelinessIn a dead end job... Very few family members left... Sexless relationship. Impossible to connect with others. Every decision made out of fear and with lingering uncertainty. Worthless as a woman, daughter, coworker. Went to a therapist who didn't seem to care at all and was entirely unequipped to perform her job with professionalism. I hate being a woman.

More and more I've fantasized of running away... Disappear in the mountains or in another country. I'm so afraid to die but so much of my waking hours are spent in despondence or melancholy just wishing to die. It'll never stop and in the past six months it's gotten worse. I'm starting to feel like I don't know who or what I am anymore. I don't want to be a woman, friend or partner anymore. I want it to stop... I want to be strong enough to choose to die. I can only hope that someone who dreams of it as much as I do eventually finds the courage to die.
