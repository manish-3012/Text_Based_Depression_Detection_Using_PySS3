I have nothingEverything I have done in my life is to make others happy. Im tired. I have no control of my life and my parents have ran it all since I was born. They force me to play sports I hate, and live their failed dreams through me.
The sports stress and depress me! I cant do the things i like. I cant quit, its to late. My life has been wasted on doing the things i hate... They have good intentions, but I just cant handle all the pressure and expectations they have for me. I have no friends or a social life. I hate it. At the age of 21 I have never been out with friends, all I know is sports and dieting. My body hurts, my head hurts, my heart hurts. They dont take my feelings into consideration

Somebody PLEASE tell me why I should stay here. Maybe death isn't such a bad option afterall. Eternal rest.
