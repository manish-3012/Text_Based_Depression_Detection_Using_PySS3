I don't want to feel any more painI can't take it anymore. I am so fucking tired of this. It's been an eternity since I felt right. I am so done. 
If only I had a little bit of energy left to just do it. 
I don't want to die in pain. I don't want to spend my last moments on this planet in agonizing pain. I don't need anymore pain.
Please I can't take I anymore. I just want it to be over. I want to die peacefully. Why Is there just no way to kill yourself without pain.
