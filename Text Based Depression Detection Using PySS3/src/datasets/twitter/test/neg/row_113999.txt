I'm thinking more and more about harming myself. What's wrong with meSince i was young when i felt like crying i would pinching myself so it will hurt less. I grew up with divorced parents but my mum kicked out my dad because she couldn't handle his mental illness. I don't know what my dad suffered off but I remember he would lock himself in the bathroom for days or months. He would leave at night and not comeback for few days. He was paranoid. He wrote nasty letters about my mum to all our family and friends. I remember my very first panic attack was when i was 10 years old. Because my dad came to my school and i was so scared he will behave weirdly in front of my friends. My mum will also ban my sister and me from calling him dad and will force us as children to call him the nut job.

Because of this I felt so much growing up. I have never said to anyone ever that my dad was mentally ill. I will always praise him and say he was a great man, which he was but then I will just say my dad is living abroad.

When i became a teenager i started to hit myself to feel better. In my twenties i started to hit my face and now in my thirties i want to cut myself. I try so hard to stop myself but i keep thinking of getting a knife and cut myself to feel better.

I searched for answers on internet why i want to self cut and a all of the results talked about teenagers. So why do i want to cut myself now? My dad never showed any mental illness until he was 35. So maybe it s the same thing to why i feel so much pain for things that doesn't even affect me.

I had few bad years, i have moved to a different country, i was in a toxic workplace and I got married and our first year was rough.

I don't even know what i really want from posting this but i am trying so hard to stop myself from cutting or ending it. I'm too religious to end it and my life is very stable so i feel so guilty for feeling this way. I didn't sleep for 3 days and i have been crying because i found out about two innocent people going to prison. Somehow i don't know why is this causing me so much pain.

Sorry for the long post
