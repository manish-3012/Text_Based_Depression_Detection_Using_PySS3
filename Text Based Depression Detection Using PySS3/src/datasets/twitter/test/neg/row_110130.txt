All most took my own lifeI almost took my own life today, following the death of someone close to me, I have completely stopped doing schoolwork, I donâ€™t have the energy to dig myself out of this one, I went and visited friends today and that didnâ€™t even help. Iâ€™m starting to feel like Iâ€™m a lost cause.
