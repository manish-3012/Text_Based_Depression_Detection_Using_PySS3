why couldnâ€™t things be easiereverything in my life keeps going more and more downhill. iâ€™ve isolated myself from my friends and no one seems to care or noticed. reached out to a good friend about me feeling down and they just made a joke about how iâ€™m not suicidal iâ€™m probably just hungry.... iâ€™m just so done, i can tell i wonâ€™t go far career wise so college is pointless now. I just want to drink a whole bottle to myself and never wake up again. itâ€™s tempting but i donâ€™t know if itâ€™ll let me sleep forever
