When will I run out of excuses?
Iâ€™ve been contemplating suicide since I was around 13. I had horrible ocd that went untreated for months. Going on and off antidepressants destroyed my psyche. The only reason I didnâ€™t go through with my plan to commit suicide was the thought of my familyâ€™s reaction. I guess this is pretty common for kids my age. 

I realized recently that I donâ€™t really care about how my family would feel anymore. Recently I came out as bisexual to my family, and they have all been cold to me except for my father. My brother calls me a fag â€œjokinglyâ€ now (heâ€™s 37) and my mother has been making me really uncomfortable with homophobic remarks. 

I know they would probably be upset if I went through with it, but honestly this has made me kind of not give a shit about how they feel. Iâ€™m generally an empathetic person, but the more I think about it, the more I realize how much of a personal experience it is and that they shouldnâ€™t influence my decision. 

My father is the only one who I worry about. He has expressed to me multiple times that he would kill himself if I ever chose to do so. This was obviously a way of guilt tripping me out of a suicidal episode a few years ago, and it worked. It feels as if it would be unfair to him if my decision ruins his life. I donâ€™t want to be responsible for killing somebody besides myself. 

Iâ€™m only sixteen, and Iâ€™ve considered that maybe my contemplation of suicide is only a side effect of growing older, but Iâ€™ve been confident in my desire for years. Iâ€™ve just recently realized that there is only one excuse anymore, and Iâ€™m wondering when this one will too fade. I almost look foreword to it.

I guess Iâ€™m wondering if any of you share a similar experience?
