I feel like this every nightI am tired from being a useless fuck.

I have no real problems in life, but I am still a worthless piece of shit that cannot do anything he is supposed to do. I do not love anyone, don't accept the affection of others nor do I even like myself.

I've been supposed to be doing some useless reports since 1 PM, but my incredibly stupid self found ways to not do shit all day long. It's not that they actually matter, but I find it bothering that I cannot do the simplest of tasks.

I barely get 2 hours of sleep on any given day, and all I enjoy in life is to drink or smoke marijuana but in this society I am stuck in, because there is no way to not be a part of it, everyone is an ignorant ass that believe they know how to run your life and everyone else's, simply because they grew up with some sheltered belief, and only know about that one belief.

There is no God and humans are naturally evil.

Give me a reason not to kill myself.
