You Ever Wish You Had A Reset Button?I've thought about it for as long as I can remember.

When I was young I thought about it because of embarrassing stuff I said or did.

Now its because I just feel like I missed a step somewhere. Like I need to start over and reread the directions the right way this time. 

I know "fake it til you make it" is the way most people roll, but how are you supposed to fake it when you don't even know where to start. 

For me words just don't come easy. Conversations are one of the hardest things in the world to me. What are you supposed to talk about? Small talk I can mostly grasp and just come off as a little akward, but anything past that and I'm lost. When I talk about things I'm passionate about, words just kind of gush out but there's never any real structure to them, no coherent story, and I'll either dumb it down to the point of sounding stupid, or over complicate it to the point of them losing interest. 

When I finally have a full thought and try to get them out, I jumble them, stutter, mutter, or some other fuckup that makes them near incomprehensible.
