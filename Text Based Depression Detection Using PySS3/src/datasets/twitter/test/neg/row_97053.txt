19 years ago tonightI tried to kill myself 19 years ago tonight. Obviously, I survived. I experienced incredible pain- mentally and physically, but I basically turned my life around-  I have a degree, a job, money in the bank, and a decent home, a family, pets, and a few good friends... I am exhausted. 
I am lonely, I feel unloved and worthless. I feel old and ugly, and honestly, I just want to go to sleep and wake up somewhere or someone different.
