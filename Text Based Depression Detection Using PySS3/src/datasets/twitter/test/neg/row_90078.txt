I'm ready to go. I don't want to do life anymore. I don't want to go to work, I don't want to make new friends and I don't want to sit here anymore. I don't like being around people. I don't care about the negative impact my death would have although it would be minimal because I don't have any family left alive. I can also be easily replaced at work.

I just don't like being a human being. I don't want to be here anymore.
