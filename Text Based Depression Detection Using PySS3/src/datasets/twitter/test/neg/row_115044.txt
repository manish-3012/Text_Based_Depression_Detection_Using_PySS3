It's overI'm sorry mum and dad. You taught me that I could be who I want and do everything I was willing to work for. I've come to realize that having great parents like you is a privilege, and I understand why you used to think i had potential. Somehow, I've managed to throw it all away; I could be happy, if I just didn't fuck things up all the time. I could make other people happy too, if I wasn't a lazy piece of shit. I wasn't even dealt a bad hand, life has been very kind to me. I just don't think I was made for this. I feel like I'm in another dimension whenever I try to act human, I don't know myself anymore, and if i try to do anything else than remaining passive I hurt everyone.

You will all be better off without you, whether you know it or not. Just know that this isn't your fault. The hurt I am feeling inside is self inflicted, and the reason I don't have friends over or go out anymore is because I push everyone away and no one wants to be with me.

I've come to peace with this; it is the only solution. I am sorry, because I know it will hurt to begin with, but it will get better. It always gets better, like everyone says. I've just come to find out that even if it will get better, I don't want this anymore.

I wish you, A- and F- the best.
