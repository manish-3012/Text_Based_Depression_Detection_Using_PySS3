My internet friend is suicidal, please helpI've noticed that something was off about 3 months ago, he was talking kind of off and I think he was giving me hints, I've noticed them and thought he was depressed so I was there for him and tried to give him love and affection, I don't think it worked because he just said "I don't feel like existing anymore" so I'm scared and worried for him, what should I do? How should I help him, I don't want him to die, I love him and don't want him to hurt? I'm confused how to help and confused about him too, please help me
