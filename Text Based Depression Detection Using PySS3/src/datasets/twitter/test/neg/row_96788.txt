Itâ€™s all my faultI tried. I did my best. I loved him with all my heart and soul. But it wasnâ€™t enough. I canâ€™t live through another heartbreak. I chose not to. I have nothing left. I am hollow. He was my happiness. My joy in life. My soulmate. My heart is shattered into a million pieces. I canâ€™t do this without him.
