I've made my plan and everythingSo, I turned 21 last month and, despite my initial hopes that I'd go out and have a good time, I ended up going to a bar by myself where I just sat and had dinner with a few beers alone. While I was sitting there, I finally realized that I've been depressed for years and years, trying to pretend that things would get better. Things haven't changed for the better, and I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that they never will. I came to college (and went through most of high school) believing that, out of all the new people, there might be even one who I thought I could say I loved. Constant disappointment has shown me the error of my ways, and I'm just going to leave before I have the chance to learn the same lessons in increasingly harder ways. I'm not going to stick around to see whether or not I become the reclusive and lonely old man living in the house at the end of the block. So I've got a plan. I'm going to jump, which is regrettable, because I would rather have gone out with something more... instant and painless, like a bullet. But, as I'm limited by money, the option that is the cheapest and somewhat instant will have to do. Someone told me that, to feel the relief that I'm seeking, I'd have to be alive to experience it but, at this point, I'm far more comfortable with nonexistence. Even if I have to stop feeling anything and cease to be, it will be a massive load off my shoulders, and that's honestly what I want right now.
