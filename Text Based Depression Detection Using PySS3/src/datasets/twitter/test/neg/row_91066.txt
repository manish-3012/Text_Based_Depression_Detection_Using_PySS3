It all depends on next week.Next week I'll get my exam results. If I fail any of them, I'm gonna get kicked out of college, which will trigger a chain of events leading to any hope for a decent future being ruined. So, yeah, if I don't pass those exams, I gotta do it. Finishing this uni is my only hope for a good life, so without it, I have virtually no reasons to live. 

Don't know yet how I'm gonna do it if I have to do it(I still hope it won't be the case, but heaven knows). I pretty much hate myself and my life so far, but I got this opportunity to make things better, which I might or might not manage.

You might think it's an extreme measure for just some exams. It's not. If I fail, I'll have to go back to my shithole of a country, the place I fucking hate, the place I've been waiting for years to leave. I just can't conceive living there again. I really don't want to die, but what can I do about it? Wish me luck, guys, maybe it won't be the case.
