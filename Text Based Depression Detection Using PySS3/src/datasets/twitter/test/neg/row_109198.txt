Looking for some supportHi all

Ive been feeling really down lately, ive suffered from mental health problems since childhood, my life has always been a fuck up, thanks to a useless mother and a shitty life, i have achieved nothing and i cant even focus on work, i have worked twice in my life and both ended horribly, after that the doctors got involved and got me help related to sickness benefits, my doctor is SUPERB he has always been by my side and i honestly feel like hes a friend not a doctor. I am now on disability benefit and out of work sickness benefit (not sure if you have such things in the US) 

My main mental health issue is depression but the OCD is the worst bit, its a fucking night mare. I keep getting obsessional thoughts about my dad passing away and about how as soon as it happens i will have to kill myself, it started about 18 months ago but in the last 3-5 months, my mind has come up with serious in detail plans, deep down i really dont want to, but im so scared of what happens when my dad passes away, hes not ill or close to passing, hes in his 70's but hes probably healthier than i am, seriously hes not a 70 year you would imagine, he walks miles, plays on his PlayStation, the lot! but hes the only family i have and he cares for me with my issues (cooking, washing, medication, etc)

Sorry about the grammar mistakes and the swearing, as you can imagine, im not too fussed about it at the moment.
