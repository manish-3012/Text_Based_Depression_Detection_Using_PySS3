Family worriesIâ€™ve wanted to die for over a decade now. The only thing that keeps me from doing the deed myself is that I know my friends and family would blame themselves. Which to me is shitty. I want to die for me. It has nothing to do with anyone else. So I sit here praying everyday to be taken out by some illness or tragedy simply so my family doesnâ€™t think that my death has anything to do with them.
