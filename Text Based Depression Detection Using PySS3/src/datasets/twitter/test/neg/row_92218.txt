my suicide notei'm sorry to everyone who tried to care, and everyone i pushed away.  i'm sorry that i was never good enough. i'm sorry for everything. i'm just sorry. this is gonna be short because i don't have much to say, and i'm not gonna waste anybodies time. i just wasn't made to deal with today's society, and that's ok. all of you people who are strong enough to keep fighting, you're doing amazing. even if you mess up sometimes, it's ok. good luck to all of you, i wish i was that strong. goodbye everyone. best of luck to you all.
