I think my psychiatrist didn't believe meWhen I told him my bullying story (and some similar conflicts at college), he first asked me if someone else could confirm my stories, because he said they sounded a bit exaggerated and extravagant.

I told him I was saying the truth, and he said that I was saying my version of the truth, which was a bit subjective. My mom confirmed some of my stories, and when I asked if he could give me a diagnosis, he said I had paranoid and schizotypal traits (found out about the depressed schizoaffective when going to the psychologist).

Did he maybe misunderstood some of the things I said and that's why he diagnosed me as having schizotypal traits, should I tell him that I don't agree with that diagnosis next time I see him?

Won't lie, it made me feel bad when he didn't believe me, I wasn't lying...
