I'm feeling down and I'm giving up.Hello. My name is Alexander. I go by Nexplosion on most forms of social media. I'm 13 years old, I live in New York City, and I'm a mess. I'm posting here because I want help in turning myself around. I've got a ton of issues, and I'm going to explain everything. But before, I want to say a few things about myself. 

I'm beyond sensitive. Even the small things that people say can ruin my day. It's not fun but these events have made me into someone who has trouble finding a good laugh. 

I'm demisexual. What this means is that I am straight, but will not go into sexual relations with a partner until I feel extremely close to them. Due to this, I do not masturbate, but it's completely okay to.

I am a agnostic atheist. I do not believe in a higher power without solid, clear evidence. I do respect your religions if you are Christian, or Jewish, or Muslim, or whatever you think. As long as you don't slam me for not being exactly like you, it's completely okay. 

I cannot get angry. No joke. I feel like I am a asshole if I was to yell or scream at someone. I just bottle it up. I've been doing this for 2 years, and I'm almost broken.

I have almost no self esteem. I don't feel as if I am that much of a amazing person. I'm just me, and nothing extraordinary. People always praise themselves and say they are the best person in the world. I know for a fact that's not true about me. Or anyone I know.

If someone I knew was going to die if I didn't sacrifice myself, I would probably do it. I believe that others have it a lot better than me. And I want to save them and let them live a long happy life instead of me wallowing in despair for eternity.

I think that's it.

It all started when I was in the 3rd grade. Things were good. My parents were great people, and I had a good chunk of friends. I enjoyed life, but I was oblivious to the real world. That day, the announcement came. My parents were splitting up. I was heartbroken. I cried all that night, and through it too. I didn't sleep at all for days on end. My emotions became unpredictable, and I was heartbroken.

Me, my brother, and my mom moved a few blocks from there, and my dad went far uptown. She became bi-polar, and screamed at us almost every day. I felt useless. I felt like I was always doing the wrong thing.

In 5th grade, near the end of the year, my best friend told me about this game called Realm of the Mad God. It was so incredibly fun. Though my mom didnt allow "online account games", I still made the account and played whenever she was out of the house. 

Skipping to 6th grade, I ended up going to a school that my parents forced me to. The education is one of the best in the city, but I knew no one. I felt isolated. Lost. Alone. I became even closer to the RotMG community. I was 12 at the time, and when my mom started working, it was my favorite thing to do. I talked with the community about everything that bothered me (no personal info was given) I even became attached to the forums. But then, one time a user needed help in the game, I clicked a link that he/she posted for his "items" and before my eyes was tentacle furry porn. I cried my fucking eyes out. The image still haunts me to this day, and typing these words is giving me a migraine.

Then, my brother stumbled upon something heartbreaking. The reason of the divorce was when my dad cheated on my mother. He found a written document by my mom that she was going to send to the Divorce Court. Not only did he break the sacred rules of marriage, but he is now refusing to help pay for my moms side. It's painful. The man I thought was my role model is a horrible person. And I still can't tell him about it. 

In 7th grade (2013-2014) things took a turn for the worse. I had a crush on this girl. She was so nice to everyone, bubbly attitude, and always smiled. I thought that if we could get to know each other a little more, I could feel a lot better. On Halloween, I asked her out, and she said no, because her parents don't let her. It didn't bother me at all, and I thought it was still okay if we could still be friends. But that wasn't the case. After 1 and a half months of ignoring, I went up to her on the last day before Christmas break (2013). She said that "I've been really busy" and "we can still talk". That was a lie. Still now, we haven't talked in a year, she talks shit about me (friend tells me) and I told a friend of hers to tell her to apologize for me, and she did it. I saw the two of them laughing after. I was sunk.

When I feel this low, I turn on some music and chill. I enjoy many of the songs on the Monstercat label (yeah it's electronic, but it's good stuff) but I also have a diverse taste ranging from Pop to Rock and even some Rap. A song that always lifts my spirits is Vance Joy - Riptide (FlicFlac Remix) and I always end up smiling by the third repeat. Sadly, the magic is gone. I feel barren. Lost. 

Around this time, I got a therapist. She and I really talked a lot. We met on Mondays and Wednesdays, and I told her everything (except the furry porn thing I saw) and she helped me a whole lot. She had to move to New Jersey last year though. I never saw her again.

Now, that was a bad time for me. But it got a fuckton worse. 

My mom started dating a guy. He isn't bad at all, but the problem was that he lived in New Jersey, so I saw him rarely. Whenever my mom isn't with him, the smallest things make her so angry. She shakes me and curses and yells. I'm scared she's going to develop into abuse.

My dad is also very bipolar.  But he's also masturbating a LOT. On his laptop, I found a ton of porn. So many saved and bookmarked sides to smut, nudes, and porn. (This is not meant to be a joke) He has been acting very unusual, and doesn't let me or my brother go near it. When I want to, he instantly blocks me. He gets us out of the house fast, and doesn't pick up his phone when we call for the night. He is extremely overprotective of said phone too. 

Lastly, my brother is a stoner. He goes to tons of parties, and admitted to smoking weed on numerous occasions. He even tried to get me on it too. He also came home drunk at 2 am one time. His actions worry me a lot. But if I was to tell my mother, he would hate me. And the family would fall apart. 

I have also started seeing a new therapist, who I tell so much to.

Starting about a month ago, my mom made a announcement that our house lease expired 6 months early, and that we had to move out in 7 days. I knew the real reason was because my mom couldn't pay the bills. Ever since then, we have been moving from family friends houses. We are practically homeless.

Staying at my dads is never fun. He has no patience. I went up to get some water at midnight, and he yelled "GOD FUCKING DAMMIT ALEXANDER YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO BED" He is starting to scare me. On top of that, he's also very touchy. Like in a sexual way. Lots of hugs and rubbing, and I don't like to be near him anymore. I'm speculating that he might be a pedophile. 

The house that we stayed at during Christmas was a family friend who was rich. He and his husband (yes they are gay, I'm not homophobic) own 3 houses (apartment in NY, house upstate, and a big house in California) and own a ton of fragile, valuable items. It was hard to move around and not break anything, and this made my mom paranoid and beyond. A small wood piece of his bookshelf was broken, and my mom went berserk at us, thinking we did something horrible. Turns out it wasn't any of us, but the person who's house we are staying at. The mental scar of her yelling didn't disappear though. 

My mom got out of the house a lot. And came back drunk a lot. It really showed that she tried to escape from reality with wine. And that made me sad. 

My social situation isn't good either. People talk shit about me all the time, and I've been feeling at the bottom. The clearest time this was felt was on December 23rd. Secret Santa day. I was about to open my gift and I saw people looking around and snickering. I opened it to get a roll of macaroni and cheese duct tape. It would have been fine if people weren't bursting out laughing at me. I went back to my seat with a small "thanks" and put my head down. People came over to me and called me a jerk, and that I was being unappreciative, and that I am a stingy person who can't be pleased. Everyone yelling at me. I ran out of the classroom and hid for half a hour. My eyes were dark red and I cried and I took what they said to be true. I was a jerk. I was unappreciative. I was a asshole. The security guards found me and took me to the counselor until the end of the day to talk about it. My friend came down and got me my stuff. The person who got me the gift turned out to not have meant it to be a gag at all, and that the other children were just being horrible. She drew me something that I will never forget. [Ever.](http://imgur.com/kSHcEFk) That moment still made me feel really bad.

Since all these events have been horrible, I fled to the Internet. I've been socializing okay with Internet groups, but due to the traumatic event I was faced with at my youth, I have been getting a ton of hate everywhere. It's real that you can insult anything about someone. But if you insult their porn, you're a dead man. I've been getting tons of down votes all across reddit, you can click my profile if you want, but it's not pretty. Especially /r/furry (those guys stalk my profile now and I'm scared, probably reading this now)

Without my other escape, I turn to music. I usually listen to music as much as possible, and it's a sure-fire way to lift the spirits. Mostly. These past few days have hooked me and sunk me to the depths of the ocean of life. And I'm chained down by my problems. 

Sometimes, I just feel like I could help people with my suicide. It sounds sick, but I'm so deep down I've considered committing on many occasions. Help me...
