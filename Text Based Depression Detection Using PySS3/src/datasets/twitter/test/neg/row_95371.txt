This girl isn't interested in me. I thought she would be my escape from my self loathing, and that I'd finally found a reason to give myself a second chance.I was bullied in high school, got called ugly a lot in high school by other guys and that really shot my self confidence. No one wanted to associate with anyone who couldn't find the voice to stand up to bullies. So that caused me to isolate myself , develop social anxiety, and hate myself.

I've already tried to commit suicide two times back in high school. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my little sister saving me from suffocating myself.

Nearly everyday I feel like I'm not good enough to be any woman's romantic interest. I see attractive people in relationships , and it makes me mad because I want what they have, but it makes me feel like I'm meant to be alone.

I thought my previous girlfriend was great, I was extremely attracted to her, we really clicked , but she lost interest.

Ever since 2012 I've been working on trying to rebuild my self-confidence. I finally built up the courage to verbally flirt with this girl ( something I've been trying to do since 5th grade) and we hd a date , and even kissed , but then she tells me she's not interested anymore. I might've been a little shy, but besides that I have no idea what I did wrong, I'm left to assume it was because of my looks, and lack of self-confidence.


I don't ever want to feel like this again.

And I'm also tired of how much consumerism affects my life.

I wish that I didn't want money, or to be attractive , or to have a relationship.

I need someone or something to take my mind of how much I hate myself , but if I were dead none of this would matter.
