Just keep drinking.I don't know if this will reach anyone. I don't even know when to start, or where.  
I am hurt, I am in pain and I don't know how long I can last. Every part of my fiber is screaming out to do something, to somehow hold on. So. Here I am? Last desperate ditch I guess.  


While not diagnosed, recovering alcoholic, back on the juice for the night. It's just as bad as I remember but it's different so I will take it.  


For various reasons which I don't want to type out right now me and my dearest friend are having a bumpy period, which is compounded by my depression being really relentless this month. However, whenever there is a fault in the way she has acted that has gone against our accords, I end up being the bad one somehow and punished, not cause it's her goal. It's just how I end up feeling.  


All of this turmoil has nearly at my rope. The only other friend that I have is incapable of understanding my condition and therefore can't help.  


Would rather you not judge them, cause I really do love them their faults and all and we are a bit of an odd dynamic.  


Help tho? I don't know what to do anymore.  


PS: No putting the drink down is not an option.
