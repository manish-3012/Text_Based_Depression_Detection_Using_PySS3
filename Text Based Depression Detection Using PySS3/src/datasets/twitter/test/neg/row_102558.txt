A gentle reminder that nothing I do mattersNot sure where to start. 

To summarize I have always struggled in work, career, etc. I have worked long and hard to achieve a specific kind of job, and finally three years ago I gave up on it and started working towards being debt free. I started to recover from my depression a bit and decided I'd give school one last try, only this time I would pick something in demand and useful. Something that explicitly appeared in many, many job advertisements. I have done so, added it to my linked in, I have done pretty well(?) in the program. Well, one of the people who do my dream job at my place of work noticed my LinkedIn account, and that there listed was an advanced degree in my field and a second advanced degree in a related field underway. 

She reached out and asked me if I wanted to come work in her department. To make a long story short, it was looking really good, and that finally, something would work out. 

Then the government shutdown came. Of course the field I want to work in is heavy in government workers, and the office that the job is in is in Washington DC and I am not. Any federal worker worth anything should logically be heading for the door. It will make far more sense to hire one of these people than it will be to hire me. 

A gentle reminder: nothing you do matters.
