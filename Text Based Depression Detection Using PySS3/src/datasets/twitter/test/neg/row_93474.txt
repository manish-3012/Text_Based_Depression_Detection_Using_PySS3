A toxic relationship and suicidal thoughts in the aftermath. idk what to do.I dont usually speak out about whats going on in my life or really go online to tell anyone anything personal about myself, im usually very reclusive and try to just let life continue. but lately, ive felt like im in a very, very dark place and ive been told that opening up in a forum can help, if at the very least, help me by opening up about how i feel. something to read over i guess? well..

Heres the big one.   
Ive never been honest with myself, my entire life i have battled with my sexuality. Am I gay? am i straight? am i Bisexual? ive bounced around my entire life and ive never had a chance to explore myself and gain comfort with who i might be, ive always been in a relationship with what felt like the wrong gender. years ago, i found the Furry fandom. very accepting people, i felt at home for a very short while until it started causes gaps in my life. friends looking at me weird, family asking questions. To be clear, i never opened up about being a furry in anyway, but i didn't hide it when directed at me. but it wasn't like a sexuality, or a lifestyle. it was a hobby with people i could relate too, that slowly faded away because i didn't want friends and family calling me the "weirdo". so i hid it, i still look at a lot of the art and use it to help me find comfort with who i might be.  


Where to even begin with the start of all this.. I have a 10 year long relationship, my partner is FtM, but very early in the process. no hormones or anything yet. but we started dating when He was still going by (we'll say Lindsey). at first we were in love, nothing stopped us from doing what we wanted to do together. puppy dog stage at its strongest, but after awhile it fell apart. my partner struggled with faithfulness a lot in this relationship, primarily with internet friends. they were also a furry, so the internet was a big part of both of our lives, but that means internet friendships play a big part. and well.. they had a hard time remembering that we were in a private/closed relationship. this was within the first 2 years, after the 4th and 5th year, i began to make my own internet relationships. making my own mistakes, fueled mostly by spite, but also begging for attention, from anyone.   


After the 6th year we took a break. we both currently lived in Washington (I was taking care of my sick mother) and he decided to return to California. the first week we stopped talking until one day he sent me a message about something forgotten with me, and we kept talking after that. I began to breakdown emotionally from my mother falling ill and the loneliness of a sudden change in lifestyle after a 7 year relationship, and began to regret our choices. we talked about things and in the end it he asked if we could try again, at a distance. try fixing things with distance between us, and test the waters for things to come. i agreed, and we began talking day and night, calls, and intimate videos shared. we still felt a strong love between each other, (as a 7 year relationship will do to you).   


It seemed like things were getting better.. slowly.. it was only 4 months before I eventually moved to California to be with them after my mother was in the care of more equipped family. it was hard at first, but we managed. However, we never really talked about what we did during the 4 months we were apart. and even though we talked often, a lot of days went without a text, or a call, And if i asked i usually was told they were with family, or busy with something. Eventually, the refusal to talk about what happen in that time drew a rift between us. One day when they were in the shower, I decided to pick up her phone and browse chat histories from that time period, and look at messages and social media accounts. I went ultimate snoop, and found everything i could..   
In that 4 month time.. She sent nudes to countless men.. them she couldn't stand me and wanted to have fun for once.. she lied to me multiple times and had sex with another man countless times, all while texting me in-between hours together. im sick just writing it.. remembering it. but, this has haunted me for years. After i found out, we fought for days. nonstop. you'd think this would mark the end of this relationship right? well, no. she justified it by saying she did it because i hurt her from our break, and she just wanted to get back at me for breaking up with her.. and.. like an idiot.. i agreed with her.. i took the blame. i convinced myself that she had sex with that man, because of me. that i deserved that abuse because I forced us to take a break. 

Ive struggled with depression my entire life. Ive never had more than a few months at a time without feeling it creep its way into my life. but usually its triggered by something, anything. could be big, could be small. you never really know, it just happens. and I fought that feeling for two years, having peroidic episodes, or accusing my Lindsey because i was terrified she would cheat on me again. idk why she stayed, other than guilt.  


fast forward 2 years, we've now been together 10 years in total. I hate myself. everything about me. I annoy the ones i care about because i cant stop talking, idk why, excitement? eagerness? ive never really known, but i get carried away. some people tell me i can be a jerk, taking lighthearted teasing too far without realizing it and feeling embarrassed for hours after because i didn't even notice i was being an ass. My attitude towards life has soured, im often irritable and upset with my roommates unreasonably. I dont have much good to say about anything anymore, and ive gotten bad enough that not only me but the people around me speak out about it.   


I used to be attractive. I cared about my appearance and was excited to show myself off. but, ive gained a lot of weight in the last year (nearly 100 pounds nearing 300 pounds even) and ive never been more disgusted with myself. i have a problem where when im upset, i eat.. its been a habit forever and for a lot of people im sure, but i couldn't stop, and now im paying for it. I stopped wearing my favorite clothes, stopped taking my shirt off in public and stopped making video calls because i cant stand how i might look. 

Im constantly paranoid she'll cheat again. i ask questions, i go silent.. i ruin entire days from frustration at what she did. And every fight she would "break up" to get the upper-hand, but it was never true. maybe 1-2 days of the week we spend together with a laugh or two. but over all its miserable. we both know it, but we both cant let go.   


Corona-virus has locked my in my home for the last 2 months straight. Ive left a handful of times for supplies, but overall ive been to anxious to leave my house. not because im scared of getting sick, because ive been depressed from my relationship. I lost my job, live on unemployment and sit around waiting for the next day. Shes picked up social media again, talking to people for hours.. now she plays Apex Legends every single day with someone she met online.. someone she talks to for hours and hours.. in bed.. when we have dinner.. everywhere. She never explains anything.. just tells me she wants a social life again. it stays this was for almost a year. I lost my friends from my bad attitude, family who learned im questioning my sexuality (I dont know how) have cut me out entirely, i spend most of my time waking up at 7am. smoking weed every 30 minutes, sitting in my bedroom until 11pm.. and taking sleep aide to fall asleep, ive suffered nightmares regularly for the last year.   


I dont know what to do anymore. ive lost all feeling, im nub to everything. i just feel like a husk on autopilot thats here just to breath air. ive lost touch with myself. ive felt my mental health suffer but i dont know how, i cant even describe whats happening to me anymore. 3 weeks ago i sat in my car and wondered how i could use it to kill myself without hurting others, because i dont own a gun. Lindsey came out to the garage wanting to smoke weed when she seen me sitting in the car in a trance. focused on the dashboard, staring into nothing. I told her the truth without meaning too. it slipped out by accident from coming out of whatever i was stuck in, but her response was.. passive. she didn't encourage me.. but, she didnt do anything to help me at the time either. I laid in bed for hours thinking about how little it seemed too mean to her, how little I seemed to mean to her, and everyone.

I dont even know why I wrote all this. I had hoped that maybe by saying it to myself, and typing it out.. maybe I could stop myself. but i feel like its inevitable eventually.. today we broke up again, did they mean it? idk. but ive been sitting by myself in my box for 2 days wondering if they're gone for good this time, left on read or ignored entirely. I dont know what to do anymore. i feel like the only control i have is in taking my own life. i dont want to fight anymore, i dont want too suffer. i dont want to keep going when everything is so ugly in life. race wars, virus scares, gays being hated again, conservatives rioting against a sexuality i never got to experience in 27 years.   


whats the point in continuing when my life never even had a start? why did I write my entire story for attention on a forum for people with real problems? Im sorry if this post shouldn't even be here. i didn't know where else to post this, and im desperate for advice.. anything.
