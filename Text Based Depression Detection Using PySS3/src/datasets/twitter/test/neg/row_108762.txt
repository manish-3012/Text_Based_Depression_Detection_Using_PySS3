My biological family is abusive towards me... I feel like I cannot be happy in this world. Is suicide the only way outMy biological family, esp. mother, is very abusive to me (mostly verbal and emotional). As a kid she would often starve me and ask me to kill myself. Sometimes she would hit me. My father and brother are verbal abusers saying things like "kill yourself", "you are a sl\*t/c\*nt" etc. My family would purposely over pamper my brother and abuse me.  I realize most of this is because I am an unplanned baby and they didn't have the option of abortion here.

I am 21 now, and a woman. I have a job that pays fairly well for me if it matters. I was wondering whether it's worth living any more... nobody really cares about an average, abused woman. I see no point/purpose. I do NOT intend to "do good for other victims", simply because even reading anything relating to abuse triggers bad memories for me and makes me self harm (I do donate to a few charities).

I have a crush on a guy but he is too perfect for me. I mean, why would anyone want to marry me when I don't even have a biological family... they would be embarrassed AF when someone asked about my family to them. I don't want him to get hurt or embarrassed and he'd probably rather be happy with a normal girl.

I bond really well with dogs and cats. I had actually cared for a kitten and intended to keep her because that'd give some purpose in life, but my mental health is pretty bad and I do not want to have a negative impact on her. She deserves better - its not her fault that my life is like this. In short, I gave the kitten to my friend when she was 8 weeks old.

I can't seem to find a single reason and it really hurts me that EVERY ONE else seems to have at least ONE loving family member... I remember most people showed up with loving parents at University graduation (except me even though I had been a top performing student.. fcking embarrassing). NO happy and successful person seems to be in a situation like me, they ALL have at least a good parent or sibling or grandparent.. I have NO ONE. I feel like my friends shouldn't have to deal with me because depression/negativity spreads. There's only 2 of them left any ways, and one will get married soon and not be as friendly eventually.

SORRY for the rant. I guess i just wanted to let it all out. I hope I feel suicidal tonight..There is no point in life any more..
