I have no futureI just lost my volunteer position today because I was not â€œup to standardsâ€ with my work. I guess it makes sense since I have been falling behind due to my illnesses, but I wasnâ€™t expecting it at all today so it feels like a bomb was dropped on me. I really liked this position because it would help me with my future and on my resume too. I also put in so much work in the past and that was work to the best of my ability, so I feel used. 

 So now I feel like absolute shit and I want to kill myself. I have no reason to live anymore. I donâ€™t like my major in school and I donâ€™t want to continue with school. My dream of being a psychiatrist is not really that enticing. I donâ€™t have much to live for anymore. I can keep going but for what? There is nothing anymore. There is no future for me. Please help me.
