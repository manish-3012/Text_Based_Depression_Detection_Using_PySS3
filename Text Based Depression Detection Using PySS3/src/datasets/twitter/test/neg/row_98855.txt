I'm tired. I'm tired of always being betrayed. Always being forgotten. Always being so quickly replaced. I'm hurting all over physically and emotionally. I don't want to keep going.It's unfair. I never got the choice to be put into this life. Why am I not allowed to make the choice to leave it? Why is it so wrong. I'm easily forgotten and all that shit about family and friends is nothing because their pain will last months tops, where as mine has lasted years. 

What reason is there? What reason is there to keep going? The thought of anything causes a literal throng of pain to shoot into my chest. Too much.

I'm going to bed now and I'm hoping to not wake up, but I know I will. I hate it. So what's the reason? Why can't I end it? Because lord knows I want to but im afraid. I'm not sure of what since I desperately wish to have my existence wiped off the face of the earth, but I'm too cowardly to do it alone. 

But each passing day just a tad bit more of courage passes into me. So what's the reason to keep going when everything hurts so badly and has been hurting so badly for so long. Why won't the suffering just end? What purpose is there in this insanity? Why do I need to deal with it each and every waking moment?
