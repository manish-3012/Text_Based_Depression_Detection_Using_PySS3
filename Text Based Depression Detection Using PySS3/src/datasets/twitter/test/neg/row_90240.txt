Why live ?Recently Iâ€™ve been looking at my life and Iâ€™ve noticed I donâ€™t have much motivation to do much and everything is a hassle to do even eat sometimes. Iâ€™m very different than most people my age because I have no hobbies nor find joy anything. Most people I talk to enjoy exercising while I hate it and find it painful. I donâ€™t have many relatives left so now Iâ€™m wondering why should I stay alive? I mean why canâ€™t I kill myself thereâ€™s nothing left for me here.
