I just want to feel nothingIâ€™m so mentally drained and exhausted, Iâ€™m so sick of feeling the same pain over and over again my life is going no where Iâ€™m stuck in a prison of my own mind. I have no one and no one cares or will ever care I constantly feel sick and never feel enough all I do is make mistake after mistake Iâ€™m in so much pain I just want to die. I  want to get up and clean my room and go out and enjoy the sun but I canâ€™t even move death is just the easiest option at this point I just want this constant torment to end.
