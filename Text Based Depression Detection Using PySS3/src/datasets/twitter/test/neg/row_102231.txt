why are people just so awful to each other?Lately, I am just so depressed at hearing about how awful people are.   It just seems like we live in a world where people want to be racist and awful...that doing the right thing and being kind is seen as weird and racism and sexism are good and even funny.   i just don't feel like doing anything anymore......I hate dealing with people and I hate being myself....I honestly think people would be better off without me anyway.
