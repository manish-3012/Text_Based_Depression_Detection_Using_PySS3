Suicidal thoughts increasing day by dayI suppose this is the first time I'm not totally apathetic towards asking for help. Honestly I don't know what's wrong with me. I know it's not normal to feel like this. It's a number of things I suppose - feeling worthless, no purpose, no direction. I know if I kill myself my family will be destroyed but I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I feel like such a pussy cos people have it much worse than me. I just passed by a homeless guy on my way home from work. Dude doesn't even have a home and yet I'm the one wanting to suicide myself. I used to be extremely active. I did intense exercise every day. But now I just don't have the energy. Does depression cause low energy? Cos I just have nothing in me anymore. I apologise for this post. I've always been against medication, but now I'm thinking about getting a prescription for something, cos I'm desperate to get myself out of this. I'm worried that because I'm sinking further and further every day about where I'll be in a month. Sorry again
