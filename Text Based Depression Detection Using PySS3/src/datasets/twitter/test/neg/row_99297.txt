I want to kill myself so badly...I fucked up big... I even wrote about it today in relationship advice. I'm 25 and a female, I have been dating this guy for 5 years now. At one point in our relationship he cheated on me and we broke up, I dated this guy I'm friends with, that didn't work out and I went back to the man I'm with now. 2 years ago he asked me to marry him and I said yes. Then this year while trying to stay friends with my ex I was stupid and ended up cheating on my fiance multiple times with this guy. I am disgusted in myself...how could I ever do this to the man I am with... I have a brand new razor blade and all day I have been thinking of carving the word "worthless" on my body because that's what I am... I don't deserve to be alive... he deserves so much better than me and I know once I tell him he's going to be in so much pain.. I just want to end it so badly... whatever it takes...

UPDATE OF THE LAST COUPLE DAYS (7/22/16)

Tuesday (7/19/16) 
I had a complete meltdown due to my guilt, I cried the whole day until I no longer felt anything, being depressed I honestly just wanted to feel something and ended up using that razor blade on my leg. this was the first time I have ever done something like that and it hurt so much even for it just being pretty much more of a scratch. That night I did that because I wanted to feel something and see how much it truly hurt, I was thinking of taking my life that night but it must have been the pain of it all that made me back down. I decided I would go over to my fiance's house the next day and come clean because I rather lose him than see hurt him by my lies.

Wednesday (7/20/16)
I got out of work at noon and he picked me up from work, the whole time I was quiet because it was hard for me to even speak. When we got to his place we got in his bed and laid next to each other, the whole time I thought to myself "this will probably be the last time I get to see him, the last time I get to lay beside him, to have him hold me in his arms.." I tried to open my mouth but every time I tried it was like I couldn't speak. He ended up falling asleep with his arm around me, I rolled over on my side and hold onto his hands with mine and cried quietly trying not to wake him up. I wanted to tell him but I was so afraid, eventually he woke up and he told me to turn around so he could hold me and saw I had been crying and the moment he asked "what's wrong" I started balling my eyes out and he just held me so tightly... I was crying so hard that when I would try to talk he couldn't understand what I was saying, I was hyperventilating so badly. I ended up pulling the long shirt I was wearing up so he could see the small cut marks on me and he held me asking me about them. He had to ask me "did the dog do this? the cat? did you scratch yourself on something?" and I just shook my head then he asked if I did that to myself and I nodded and he asked me why I would do that to myself. I cried some more and tried to calm myself down, I told him how I was just feeling so numb that day I did it and was thinking of killing myself... I felt like such a coward for not being able to speak clearly and stop crying... when he asked me why I would ever want to do something like that I eventually was able to get out the words "because I lied to you..." which wasn't much help because I started crying hard again and he asked me what I had lied to him about and again I was able to make out "what you asked me Sunday" (last weekend my ex came over when I was at my fiance's house and all 3 of us hung out and after he left my fiance asked me if anything was going on between the two of us because I guess we were just being so relaxed around each other) so he kept holding me and got a little quiet thinking about what he asked me and then said "did something happen between you two?" and I nodded, trying to keep my shit together so that I could tell him and before I spoke he asked "like full on penetration?" and I nodded again and he just held me trying to calm me down. I said I was sorry, I tried really hard to explain what all happened, he held me the whole time and told me he was upset about it and that he forgave me. He said I completely lost his trust and that it's going to take some time for him to trust me again, he told me that he was glad I told him about it and that I'm human, things are going to happen. He then went on to saying that he's spent the last 5 years with me because he loves me and can't see himself being with anyone else and that he wants to make it work. We have a lot of talking to do and are going to try and make it work. I still feel really horrible about what I did and I don't know how I ended up with someone who cares this much for me to be able to look past this and move forward but I am grateful. 

Thank you everyone for being here for me and talking to me, for trying to help me through this and also for not bashing me for what I did.
