I don't know how much longer I can take itI'm sorry if this is the wrong sub to post since I haven't really made a plan yet. 

I need to die before this next school year starts. I can't handle it all again. I can't make goals anymore because I don't believe I will live long enough to achieve them. I never even thought I would make it to the age I am now. I'm a lazy fuck too so I never get anything done. This sounds stupid, but this past school year was the first year I fell asleep in class and came to school late and that really fucked with my head. I told myself that I would fix everything that happened last year over the summer and start the year off great! But I can't do it.

All my friends are at their summer programs right now. I waited too long and I missed a bunch of deadlines and got rejected from the ones I did apply for. While I am happy for them, it's still a constant reminder of how much of a failure I am. I can't find the energy to do productive things or things I used to be able to do.

I'm just a terrible person. No one around me deserves this. I hate seeing how much distress and anger I cause my parents. The friends around me are genuinely nice and I'm just an asshole. 

On top of that, I am trans and I feel like a freak. I don't want to feel this way and I just wish I was normal.
