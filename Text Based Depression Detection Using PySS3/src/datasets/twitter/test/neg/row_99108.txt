I think I'm going through with itI just feel like there is literally no hope anywhere anymore. I know it will cause my loved ones pain, but I cause more pain by being alive. I'm such drama...i don't want to tell anyone because it will cause drama and I don't want people to think I'm doing it for attention. It's bad timing...I've pretty much made up my mind and making a plan. I talked to a counselor which was no help, been on different meds and none worked, I've done this for years and now I know I have no family that cares and my friends are always going to be distant...it's like who am I fooling about what I'm living for rn?
