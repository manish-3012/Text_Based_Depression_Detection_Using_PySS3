Life isn't good, and I feel nothing but apathy towards it.I've been stuck for a while now with diagnosed depression and stuff, and it's been affecting my life extremely negatively for at least 5-6 years. Most of the help I've sought hasn't done much. Sure, it's gotten me out of a rut every now and then, and maybe lifted me up for a few weeks or even a couple months, but I always fall back into bleak and hopeless thoughts.

Where I work, I occasionally have to cross a fairly busy street, and there's a railing inside the building that would definitely severely injure me if I fell. I'm not entirely sure that I want to die, but I feel like I might. At the very least, I know that I really wouldn't mind if I did slip off of that railing or if a car happened to run me down as the driver fails to see me cross. It's a very apathy-driven mentality, and it doesn't scare me anymore. At one point, I would have been worried, but now I just feel blank in a way.

I'm coming here because I know that I need help, even though I don't feel like I want it or need it. There's still a sensible part of me that understands objectively how the way that I think isn't healthy, but subjectively, from my point of view, I really just want things to end.

Sorry for any wall of text stuff, but I didn't know where else to go.
