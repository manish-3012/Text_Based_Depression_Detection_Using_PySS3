Help please.Trigger warning. I was raped...or not...Iâ€™m not sure...by my ex boyfriend. This may sound crazy to some people, but I canâ€™t accept what happened because I canâ€™t decide if it was rape or not. Other bad things happened, abusive things, but how can I feel bad when other women have been through worse? Iâ€™m depressed all the time, triggered at least once a day, Iâ€™ve started just feeling numb. I canâ€™t get past the first step of trauma healing because I canâ€™t accept that it wasnâ€™t my fault. It was my fault. I didnâ€™t stop him sometimes. It was my fault and Iâ€™m gross. Iâ€™ve never felt this way with any partner, but I felt like I couldnâ€™t say no and sometimes I literally couldnâ€™t because it was so intense I couldnâ€™t say anything. He would never ever think he raped me, and thatâ€™s what gets me. I didnâ€™t do enough to stop him. I tried to talk to him, I tried to reason with him after sessions, I tried to...find a way to change things. He never saw it my way. He would say â€œIâ€™d stop if you said the safewordâ€ but it doesnâ€™t feel that simple. Help please. Tonight is just awful. Iâ€™m awful.
