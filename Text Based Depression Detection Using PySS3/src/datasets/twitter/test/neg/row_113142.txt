Hit like a ton of bricksIts funny how I can just be going through with my life and the thought hits me. It's a thought that hits me all too often. I can go sometimes up to a few weeks but it always hits me. The thoughts can just be out of nowhere. I was at work today and a few happened and that's all it takes. Now I feel this way and don't know how long it will last. Will this be the final time? It's been going on for years.
