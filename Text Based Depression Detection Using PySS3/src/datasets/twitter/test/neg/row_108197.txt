the party   Recently, I was incited to a party thrown by a friend of mine. I know he really wants me to come, and I almost never pass up an invitation to a party, but I just don't feel motivated to do anything after that. I threw together a plan to commit suicide the night following the party; it's tomorrow, and he'll have anywhere from one to three days of blissful unawareness before it finally dons on him that I finally followed through with the suicide I've been planning. I always found things less devastating when I find out about them on my own, instead of having someone inform me. I don't plan to tell anyone at the party of course, and I'm feeling pretty confident about this plan. What do you think?
