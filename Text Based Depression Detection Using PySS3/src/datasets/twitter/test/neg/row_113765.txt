Pushed Away the Only Thing That Matters and Now I Canâ€™t LiveIâ€™ve always been scared of love and finally put myself out there with a girl who was absolutely amazing. We dated for nearly two years, but I was scared as I kept falling harder and harder for her and self sabotaged and ultimately broke up with her. I left for a month on the road and we talked every day, I couldnâ€™t get her off my mind and still am madly in love but came back to finding out sheâ€™s sleeping with someone else and doesnâ€™t know what she wants anymore. Weâ€™ve been talking and trying to figure things out but last night I rashly decided to buy flowers to bring over to hers. She kept saying it was okay but just seemed so distant the entire time. The whole exchange ended up with us kissing and it felt distant again, with her not seeming to care at all for me anymore. I went home after to open a bottle of pills and swing it down with rum but my roommate came upstairs to find me and stopped me. At this point I donâ€™t know what to do, I know itâ€™s cliche being so fucked up over a girl but since leaving her nothing has felt the same. My friends, my hobbies, my every day life all feel hollow and like Iâ€™m passing thru the motions without any real purpose anymore. She was the one thing that distracted me from my depression and anxieties ever in my life but now that I think sheâ€™s gone and happy with someone else I just donâ€™t care to be here anymore... itâ€™s selfish and dumb but I want to die without her in every physical sense.
