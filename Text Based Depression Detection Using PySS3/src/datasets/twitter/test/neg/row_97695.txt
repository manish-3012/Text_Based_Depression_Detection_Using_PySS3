Why live if my parents are going to act this way?I am 16M. My parents are making my life hell, and I just feel like I should commit suicide.

- Parents won't let me get a job
- Parents say they will kick me out as soon as I become 18
- All attempts at negotiation with them have failed
- No friends or family in the area

This all adds up to me being kicked out as soon as I become 18, with $0 and no work experience. I also live in a rural town area, which isn't desirable. I won't even be able to finish high school, since I become 18 the summer before my senior year. So I was thinking I may as well just commit suicide, but perhaps there's something I can do.
