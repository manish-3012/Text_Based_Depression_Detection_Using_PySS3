I can't take it anymore. I'm out.It's been over 8 months since my girlfriend left me after our time together where she constantly abused me mentally and physically, i still love her despite all of that. After she left she made some new friends and either they brainwashed her or she brainwashed them because now i'm the bad guy.

All i want is for her to come back because she was the love of my life and i know she was ill and that's why she acted like she did, but that will never happen so i will keep suffering like i have been. So i'm just gonna end it all because it's not worth it. If i can't be with her, i rather die.
