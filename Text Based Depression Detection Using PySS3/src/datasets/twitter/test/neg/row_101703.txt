Like many days everything I want &amp; need is completely out of reachIâ€™m a theater major in Los Angeles &amp; I discoveredq earlier this year that SAG AFTRA quietly in the last year or so told all the producers in Los Angeles to STOP submitting Taft Hartley waivers on low budget productions.
The only fuckers in this greedy as shit town who will give a nobody like me a Taft Hartley is if I agree to copy/credit/meal.

That is NOT FUCKING RIGHT!


Stranger Things doesnt want me.......Iâ€™ve tried applying for â€œlegitimateâ€ work &amp; NOONE will give me a break with a SAG Principal Taft Hartley waiver.


I landed one back in 2016......SAG AFTRA REJECTED IT because it was a low budget production that was poorly arranged.I agreed to copy/credit/meal &amp; â€œthey decided in their discretionâ€ to refuse to accept it.


I sued them in civil court in December of 2017 one day after Christmas.

They got so scared......in March of this year they begged me to go down to the Hollywood branch on Wilshire Blvd &amp; were â€œso grateful I agreed to drop the lawsuitâ€ after threatening me that SAG would â€œfight this suit with all of our resourcesâ€.

As a meeting between both parties was required I was â€œinvitedâ€ to the Penthouse level of the Hollywood branch.....overlooking Park La Brea &amp; places no working artist could ever afford to live in.They even gave me a tour beforehand!They were so nice.........ðŸ¤¨


Just little ol me.....no lawyer......no knowledge of the law but I have extensive knowledge of SAG AFTRA rules etc was able to being them to their knees &amp; make them very nervous.......kind of.You take the victories you can get in this life.

Now its impossible for me to get a SAG Principal Taft Hartley because in January of 2018 SAG AFTRA posted on their website that they told all low budget producers to â€œnot even tryâ€ to submit any Taft Hartley waivers for non union actors if its â€œlow budgetâ€.How ths FUCK do you think anyone who is NOT Matthew McConaughey gets into this damn industry?!!!!

The joke is on them.......because as a result of their ignorance &amp; eagerness to get ME to drop it.......I dropped the suit myself â€œWITHOUT prejudiceâ€.Which means if my next Taft Hartley is rejected due to â€œtheir discretionâ€............

Noone will give me a chance so now I dont even say Iâ€™m N/U for fear of them automatically ignoring me if I say the accursed phrase â€œtaft hartley waiverâ€.Cast Clearance told me they really cant do this........:theyâ€™re DOING IT......over &amp; over&amp; over &amp; over &amp; over &amp; over........

This means more to me than life.If I had other options I wouldnt be doing this.I just really â¤ï¸  the Theater.Dont you have something you really love?


So this is from my â¤ï¸ to the â€œGoverning Bodyâ€ of SAG AFTRA that is currently FUCKING OVER all the non union actors in the United States (......well,California mostly) trying to become SAG eligible by rejecting most if not all Taft Hartley waivers from low budget productions:

FUCK YOU SAG AFTRA!!!!!!!!

Do you know how hard it is to say FUCK YOU to something that you love?You know......even while writing this I feel so sad &amp; shaken on the inside.Like such anger that shakes you on the inside you dont know what to do.I dont know why Iâ€™m still alive.I dont want any attention from this post.These guys think they have beaten me......but they are wrong.If anyone is helped by this then great.Iâ€™m not sure if you can feel my anger through this but writing this.....I am so angry.And YES Iâ€™m also on that scam of a site called â€œLA Castingâ€.......ðŸ’µ
