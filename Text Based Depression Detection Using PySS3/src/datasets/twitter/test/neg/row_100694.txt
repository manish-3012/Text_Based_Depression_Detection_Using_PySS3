Resources and moving forward.edit: skip to the second to last paragraph, the one starting with the word "first" if you wish to help but don't want to read the rest of my rant.

Just fucking failed my second calc exam, Acing every other class no problem, but this one is preventing me from doing anything. I may even have to drop to class to not destroy my GPA. My parents are going to freak out on me.

But I have 2 exams and a lab report due tomorrow.

The thing is that this only applies to the classes I'm taking now, the classes I took last semester were reading and writing intensive. I do poorly (by my own standards). I can't seem to focus to be able to read through an assignment, sometimes finding a video lecture helps, but that isn't always an option. Sometimes the material Is to in depth and specific for what I'm trying to get out of it (like trying to do Calc-based physics and only finding videos pertaining to algebraic physics) 

An internet Addiction doesn't help much either.

I really want to be a doctor,  or PA at the least. Also considering engineering (but with calculus fucking me over, fat chance.) I don't have that great of grades due to a bad first semester. Right now I do some low level work in emergency medicine, working on becoming an EMT. I absolutely love volunteering for that stuff.

My parents are some of the smartest idiots I know. I know they really care about me and want what is best for me, but sometimes what is best for me is just really fucked up. I can recall one time that (so my parents knew, but wasn't really the case) that I hadn't had a girlfriend in a while. My best friend at the time was dating this girl. She tried cheating on him with me, my parents found out and thought I should go for it, she even sent me nudes. Needless to say I didn't go for it, and I told him about it. Their advice has meant little to me ever since.

I am lucky enough despite being 5'5" and 250lbs (this one doesn't bother me that much) to find myself an attractive girlfriend. The only problem is that we are on such different intellectual levels. During our senior years of highschool I was 5 years ahead of her math wise. We have little common interest. The thing about this that pisses me off the most is that the crowd she hangs out with an I do. Sometimes I'll ask her to do something and she will flat out refuse. When her friends ask she goes for it and then invites me. Kind of pisses me off that they have more pull than me. She also kind of sort of cheated on me. My friends and I just finished the movie smiley, Which for some reason prompted her to get on omegle, she started talking to a guy on skype. She left herself logged in on my phone, he sent her a message. I went through the history and she referred to me ask her ex. This was on the 4th of July I found out, One year exactly since I met her and 2 days before out 1 year. (fortunatly or not, I couldn't get time off work from McDonalds Night shift so I told her I found out and left for my 10 hour shift.) My parents told me she didn't *really* cheat since it was just some random guy she met online and she didn't do anything physically, and said I should stay with her, well I did. I haven't cared about our relationship much since. I sometimes feel like the only thing driving our relationship is sex. We've been together for 1 year and 8 months.

Now that I am in College, I have few friends, We rarely have time to see eachother (well I'm free, they're not) I went most of my first semester friendless, and now my friends just have no time for me. Being generally socially awkward doesn't help much either. I recently tried going to my schools anime club, just to find out I wasn't as into it as they are.

This semester I have a room to myself, but last semester I had a roomate. Because I had no friends I knew no one was knocking for me. Nothing pissed me off more than when he wasn't in the room and someone knocked on the door. Every time I said he's not here without opening the door rage soured through me. I had little problem with the experience of having no friends, It was being reminded that hurt. It also doesn't help that I quit playing online video games with my friends because I was too much of a cheap bastard to bother buying a membership. 

When I got back to my room, I started doing some violent things to myself, I realize or at least hope I can cut my losses and make it through.

I would like some help with resources and have various questions on the matter.

First, I see that there are plenty of places to call, but I personally loathe phone calls. Is there anything text based resources wise. Some website I can go to, to get paired with a counciler?

Second, I found my insurance card, I know my university accepts my insurance, my question is how can I make as little a paper trail to follow as possible, If my parents find out It will only make things worse. (someone once called the cops to do a wellness check on me when I was 13. The result of that was 6 trips to the psychologist and 4 trips to the psychiatrist. Psychologist and I got no where, for the psychiatrist my mother was always in the room and it felt as though he was just prescribing things at her will based on what she thought I had. Despite Good grades in high school one of the first things I got put on was ADHD medication. It only made me upset, my mother wanted me to stay on it because it was supposed to aid in weightloss. Then antidepressents, they made me lack the ability to feel any emotion, it was kind of nice looking back as I was more productive on them. Then the psychiatrist gave me a prescription that was $1000 a bottle, At this point my parents said he was a quack, and that was the end of getting psychological help.) 

I'm sorry for rambling. The resources are what I really want, the rest was just getting stuff off my chest.
