My thoughts have gone from I want to kill myself to I'm going to kill myselfI've been feeling like shit for a long time, but the past few months have been extra dark. 

I'm suffering from depression and anxiety, both of which cause a great deal of mental pain. Most of the time I sit in my room because I'm too anxious to get out. I am on medication, but it's not doing anything for me.

I just want this pain to end, and I've gone from considering suicide as an option to actively making plans for it.

I don't really know what I want to achieve by posting this, but I felt the need to ventilate my feelings.
