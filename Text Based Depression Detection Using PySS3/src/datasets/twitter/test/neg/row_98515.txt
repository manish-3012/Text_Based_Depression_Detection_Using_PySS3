i want to feel cared abouti almost killed myself last night. i was so fucking close but instead i just passed out after crying for a couple hours. people im close to know this but they dont care, or at least show that they care. no one cares until it actually happens. i feel so unloved and unwanted, and i feel weak. im scared because i dont know whats going to push me over the edge. i want help so bad but i dont have any resources and i dont have anyone who wants to talk about it. no one lets me vent to them so i bottle everything up until the slightest inconvenience happens and i just snap. im so sick i just want help and i want affection and i want hugs i ruin everythjng good thats ever happened to me
