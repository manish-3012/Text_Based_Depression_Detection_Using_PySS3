I feel like there's something wrong with me and I feel like a loserI feel like such a loser and I also feel really stupid sometimes. I'm sorry that I'm really pathetic and that I'm basically a jobless loser right now. There's something wrong with me because everything I do seems to just be really stupid and everyone looks down upon me. I'm sorry that I can't do anything right. I don't deserve to be cared for. I sort of want to die right now. I feel like there's something wrong with me. That there's something very wrong and it makes me not want to live anymore.
