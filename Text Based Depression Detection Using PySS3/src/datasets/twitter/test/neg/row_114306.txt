I can't do another year of this.The pandemic has pushed me to the brink of literal insanity. I can't eat, sleep, or even function in public anymore without having a full on mental breakdown. As we're all isolated, my mother is the only familiar person I see anymore. No more friends or other family members. I have a sensory processing disorder that basically makes wearing masks comparable to psychological torture. I cannot and will not survive another year of lockdowns and masks and all this other crap. I'm convinced I will end up killing myself before that point.
