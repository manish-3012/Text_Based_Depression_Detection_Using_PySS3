My life is perfect but I don't care.I'm a 21 y/o male with an excellent life. I'm doing great in college, living at home with a good income from a couple of jobs that I love and absolutely no expenses. I have friends and a loving family.
 Everyone who knows me thinks that I have tons of potential and are all so encouraging...
but it doesn't matter. I wouldn't say that I was depressed- I see beauty all around me and appreciate the little things in life. I take good care of myself.
But it all just seems so pointless. I have no dreams or ambitions- I don't care. I don't really have feelings either- I just am. I exist. I can't seem to change this and right now I think that I might not in a while. 
If life is so gray why not end it red?
It's like this
Friday night I was riding the bus home from college (I have a car but driving myself is too much trouble) and a cute girl kept making eye contact with me. I switched buses and she did too, so I sat down next to her and introduced myself. After some talk we exchanged contact info. Tonight she messaged me on facebook but I told her I was busy. I'm single and lonely but I don't want to talk to another human because it's effort and I don't have any to spare. Now I am conflicted and angry.
If I was dead I wouldn't have feelings and I think I would like that.
