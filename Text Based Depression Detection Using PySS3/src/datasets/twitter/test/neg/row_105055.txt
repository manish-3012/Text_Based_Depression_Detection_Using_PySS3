What is bad about death?Other people says that killing yourself it bad. I say my life is just as bad. Because it's fucking terrible in my eyes. I can't focus on anything, I am failing at everything in my crazy hard high school, and my parents keep yelling at me for the stupidest crap. I slit my wrists before, but that doesn't do shit, just hurts and makes me want to die to get rid of the pain. I have no motivation. I just can't do anything without being sidetracked about how I'm behind in school or not pleasing my parents or realizing I've never had a girlfriend nor anything close. I can't even socialize seriously with a girl. And i'm a fucking freshman in highschool. It would take one shot to my head, and I wouldn't have to be dealing with any of that. I'm crying right now. I have no idea what I'm doing or what to do.

Edit: I will wait until summer to make a decision. I just don't have any time to have fun anymore, so that may be it. I'll see this summer, but if not, I'm sorry.
