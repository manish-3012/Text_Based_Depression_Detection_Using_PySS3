Overcame suicidal thoughts, but still feeling its effectsIn my senior year of high school, I was at my lowest point when it came to my thoughts about suicide. I had moved from just thinking about it, to actively planning it. The idea I had was to go off to college, major in something that I could make a successful career out of, save up as much as I could, give it to my family, and then jump off a bridge somewhere. It's a weird, drawn-out plan, but I figured if I was going to go out, I might as well leave something behind for my family who have never been well-off financially. 

Jump forward to now, I'm in my third year of college, majoring in what I had planned to for my suicide. I haven't been actively suicidal for about a year and a half now. Thoughts of it still come to mind, but I'm no longer planning it, and don't have any plans to in the future. I feel pretty lost though. I don't have much of a passion for what I'm studying, but  there's no alternatives that I'd be any more enthusiastic about. My family has sort of split apart. Parents got divorced last year, and my sister and I haven't been on speaking terms for a while now. Around the time of the divorce, I started experiencing an existential crisis that left me in an extremely panicked state, and even now, about a year later, I still haven't fully recovered from that.

I really just wanted to put my feelings out there, I haven't been able to talk to anyone about what's going through my mind. I wish I knew where to go from here. In an ideal situation, I'd switch my major to something I'm super passionate about and pursue my dreams, but I don't really have any. All I've been focused on is finding reasons to live. It's mostly been little things, like taking walks at night, the smell of the air, and listening to new types of music. I'd like to try talking to a therapist at some point, but with the way my family is, it would only cause more trouble if I started doing it while still living with them. I guess this is the "it gets better" part of my life, but even though the feelings of suicide aren't in my head 24/7, things haven't really gotten better. Maybe they will in the future, but it feels like it's out of reach right now.
