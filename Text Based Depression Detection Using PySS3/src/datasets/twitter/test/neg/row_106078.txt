Happy Turkey daySo its thanksgiving but apparently my actions have canceled it at my house. I'm a 23year old loser still at home, living rent free because human garbage like me is incapable of getting a second job to pay for rent. No matter how many interviews i get I never get the job. I have years of experience with food and cash registers, I'm polite but quiet and i never stand out. So now im stuck here.

My younger brother has a full time job and still lives at home. But he's barely here. He blows all his money on edm concerts, hotels, and trips. But because he has a full time job and I don't, its become my responsibility to clean up after him and my parents. I try to refuse and i get yelled at. Its gotten to the point where I just try to only sleep when I'm at home so i won't have to clean up after them.

Last week my mom bought a few different things for thanksgiving and got home when I was leaving for work. When i got home from work, she had left a bag of vegetables on the counter top. Things that needed to be refrigerated. They had been out for over 9 hours, so I threw it away. Only now theyve noticed that its gone. They realized it was me and woke me up from a few hours of sleep with their yelling in the living room. "Neither of them do anything. Theyre not even helping with the food. They dont clean up after themselves, they never do". So I got up to go explain why i threw out the food. It was expired and theyre feeding my grandparents who are almost 80, theyre immune systems are so bad and so is mine from medical problems. I went to school for food prep. I know what I'm talking about. All I get is, "I dont care if it was left out, I paid for that and you just threw away my stuff". So I said," Grandma and grandpa are old, they can get really sick from spoiled food. People already die from food poisoning, but theyre old. Their chances are higher. Do you want them to die?". She said "don't touch my things". And then started ignoring me.

So now my parents stopped cooking, they canceled dinner. My grandparents arent coming now. I haven't seem them in months because of my job. I was supposed to see them at the begining of the month for my birthday but we just never did anything for it because my mom decided last minute to have a 2 week trip to New York. I miss my grandma so much.

I'm just a maid in my own home. I stopped cleaning while my mom was gone, for a few days, just to see how much of what was being done was my work. My brother and dad literally don't clean up after themselves at all. There were dishes in the sink for 4 or 5 days, all over the counter tops of the kitchen, all over the living room there were beer bottles, dishes and trash, until I couldnt take anymore and just cleaned it. 

I share a room with my brother. He has 2 dressers to fit all his clothes into because my dad refused to throw away the second dresser. My brother refuses to use this second dresser. Its completely empty. There are clothes just spilling onto the floor from the dresser he uses. He had a 3ft pile of clothes on the floor for a few months. He doesnt organize anything he literally throws clothes into random drawers and shoves them shut. Everytime I bring this up with my parents they tell me to shut up. I literally brought the problem up again on Monday. I got so fed up that i grabbed some of his clothes from the floor and started piling them in the hall because i couldnt look at it anymore. Hes a foot taller than me, and he reacted by coming into the hallway and throwing me to the floor. My mom saw and just stared. Then her and my dad both said it was my fault for complaining and being a bitch and to stop crying. 

My life doesnt matter. I usually just sleep a lot when in depressed. For the last 2 weeks ive juat been sleeping for maybe 3 or 4 hours a day. In just awake all night thinking about this waste of time that is my life. The waste of space that i am. 

I dropped out of school years ago for a boy and I never went back. I got accepted to an art school in another state but I didnt go, because of this boy. What did i get from staying, from being with him for 3 years? Him fucking my childhood friend behind my back for months without me knowing. I had things i wanted to do with my life, I was going to be something. That something is now a suicidal shitshow. God this is what my life has become. Being a fucking maid, wasting away in a fucking hellhole of a home. My boyfriend cares about me but for how long. All I seem to do is complain about my life and at some point he'll get tired of it. I dont know. I'm just spiraling out. I just needed to rant a little I guess.
