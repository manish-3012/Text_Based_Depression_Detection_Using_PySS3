Hmmm, helloI had been depressed but got over it, I thought about killing myself but I think I didnt it just for my parents I dont think they could luve without me also I dont have the courage to do it, i dont know why, today im feeling really shy, i started crying with no reason maybe it is because I'm feeling lonely, I have "friends" butthey alwaya have something to do  maybe I dont really have any friends I dont know... 

And I started thinking about me and life, this hass to be asked frequently but why should I keep living? I know i wont do anything because i do t have the balls, this is starting to sound crazy, just my thoughts, i dont know know what im even doing here this is so depresing i cant sleep fucking error 504 goddanmit

edit more info about me:

I just turned 19, this year I'll be doing the 2nd year in college, and well I'm from Spain. My family is just anormal family, with normal problems, my sister is just stayin' at home the whole day because she doesnt have any friends, I hope things get better for her, actually I have some friends but not in the city I live, but where I study right now, the problem is they are on vacations somewhere.
Soomy mother loves me so much, and well my father tries it as hard as he can I think, not sure, sometimes I feel like I'm just something that spends the money he gets.


I was doing okay for the last month or so, I met a girl we started dating and we broke up, it hurt, but not a problem at all, the problem is I think I was pretty depressed before meeting this girl, I started going to a therapist for a month or so, she made me feel better, actually the only thing she did, was to view the things in another perspective, and things weren't that bad, and yeah before I thought about suicide but were just random thoughts, dont think I could have ever done that but I wish I had honestly.

Idon't want to tell my parents how I feel because they always give me the same stupid advice, things wil get better, they told me that at high schol, and things didn't get better, they got bettter when I moved to study in another city.

thanks for reading that, it makes me feel better
