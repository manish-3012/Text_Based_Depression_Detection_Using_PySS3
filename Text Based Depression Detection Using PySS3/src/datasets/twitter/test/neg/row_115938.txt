Can't wait any longer for this illness to kill meI don't know how to begin I just feel so desperate I'm ready to die now I can't stay trapped here anymore. I've been diagnosed bulimic/anorexic for a few years now and hospitalised twice because of my weight and I'm so terrified I think I'll be like this always. I have nothing now and no one. I used to have a fair amount of friends, but people move on and I can't talk to them anymore. They talk about what they're doing with their lives: their jobs or courses at uni and the new things they're doing and the lives their living and they ask about me and there's nothing I can say, I've spent the last couple of years alone at my parents, eating and vomiting over and over again. I'm being discharged from out patients soon where I receive therapy, they said I'm making no progress, it's pointless, there's no where else they can refer me. 

I can't describe this feeling, it's overwhelming. I'm terrified. I overdosed before and collapsed and spent a night in hospital and I can't do that again, it was embarrassing and painful.  I need to end this properly, I'm stuck and I want it to stop I want to die so so much but I'm scared. It's so painful, everyone is moving on but I can't get past this. I'm just a burden on my family, all I do is upset them and it pains me everyday I think it'd hurt them at first if I died but surely that's better than going on and on like this. 

Sorry, this is rushed
