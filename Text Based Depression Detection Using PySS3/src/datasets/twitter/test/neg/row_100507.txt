i miss who my mom was and i miss my great grandma MMShe used to be vibrant and independent â€“ a tennis player, volleyball player, dancer, swimmerâ€¦ First grade teacher. Put her entire heart into her job. 

Sheâ€™s had epilepsy for a few years now and doctors found matter on her brain. Her epilepsy medicine combined with the lack of independence (she canâ€™t drive, swim, etc. while at risk of having seizures) has changed her. Sheâ€™s depressed and talks about killing herself or not wanting to live. 

Iâ€™m so scared and depressed. 

Mostly feeling like a failure, maybe she would want to live more if I was somehow a better daughter/sister/person than I actually am. I wish that my siblings and I were enough of a reason to keep her striving for a life. 

My great grandma MM died a little over ten years ago and I'd give anything to have her around right now. She'd know what to do and say. She taught me how to sew and we had tea parties all the time.
