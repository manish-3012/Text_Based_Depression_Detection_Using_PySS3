I don't know what's wrong with meI've been giving away all my money and things. I dont want or need them anymore. I already got a place and method. I want it to look like an accident so nobody can blame themselves. I'm cutting off my friends. I dont want them worrying about me or anything. They were great and kind people, but nobody can help me. I was just made the wrong way, I wasn't meant to live this long anyways. I just wasn't.
