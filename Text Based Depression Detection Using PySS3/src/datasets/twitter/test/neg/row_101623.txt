I am a fuck upI am a straight fuck up. Everything I do, even its its a good thing, backfires and makes me feel like the biggest screw up. I cannot achieve good grades in school because of my ADHD and my parents don't get it. I try my absolute hardest and it still isn't good enough. They always have comments to make to me even if I get a nearly perfect grade and they constantly makes me feel like shit because of their degrading comments towards me for no apparent reason, like when I'm just listening to music my mother will come into my room and tell me to "shut your shitty music off". I know others have it harder but to me it's hard as hell. I've tried to kill myself 3 times before and each attempt failed. It's been a year since my last attempt and I feel some darkness coming my way. 

I'm a 17 year old male in high school.

Sorry for the waste of time. Bye.
