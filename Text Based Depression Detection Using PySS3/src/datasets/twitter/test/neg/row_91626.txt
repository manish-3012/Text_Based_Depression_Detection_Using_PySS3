I realized today that I can't get better.I've been fighting against depression, social anxiety, and separation anxiety for over five years.
I transferred universities and it's been worse than ever. I don't have friends. I literally don't. So now I'm doing it alone, trying to survive. I relapsed and cut today, and three weeks ago. Before then I hadn't done it in three years.
The other day I saw my father cry, which I had never seen before. I came out of my house where my mother was drunk and he asked me if I was mad. I told him yes. That she wasn't my mom when she was drinking. That she was someone I didn't like. He told me he'd like it if she stopped drinking too. He hugged me and cried and told me he loved me, even though he didn't see me often and we didn't do much together, he loved me *so* much.  I have never seen my father cry, and I am still shaken.

We went out to lunch yesterday, and it was nice, and it gave me something to look forward to all week. But now that it's behind me, I'm back to thinking my life is falling apart. I have no friends, No one to talk to, my medicine has stopped working and I can't find a psychiatrist to call me back. School work is getting harder and harder and today I lost a friend. Because no one can stand being around me. Because I am depressed. But I can't help it, Id do anything to be happy.

I realized today that I can't get better. The world has deemed it so. It's been five long years and I can't do it anymore. The only reason I'm still here is that I thought I could get better. I thought I could be happy again, but now I know I can't. I don't want to live like this anymore. I don't want to fight anymore. I'm so tired. I want my parents to let me go. They're the last ones who love me, and I just want to go. I just want to pain to stop. It's crushing me. It's eating me from the inside out. I can't do it anymore. I'm not strong enough.
