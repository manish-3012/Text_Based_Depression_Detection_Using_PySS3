My ways of preventing suicide.I think about suicide almost every second. I'm not dead yet because I have created certain rituals to sustain myself. The first ritual is called breathing. I breathe and focus on the rate of my respiration. This ritual is largely useless, but it slows my heartbeat. 

The second ritual is called "Orange mystification." I imagine orange entities crying over my corpse. They could be anthropomorphic or objects of any kind. The commonality is their hue. So they stand or hover above my dead body and cry for me. This usually makes me aware of the grief my suicide may cause. 

The third ritual, which also has a name, is called "Mantra-Contention." I basically just repeat stock motivational phrases to myself for inspiration. This ritual is usually ineffective, but sometimes it works very well. Common stock phrases include: "permanent solution to temporary problem," "One day at a time," and so forth. 

The fourth ritual has no name but it can be broadly called "distraction." I usually distract myself with drugs or mindless entertainment to prevent my suicidal ideation from swelling. Sometimes I may choose more creative distractions such as writing, but most of the time I slowly commit intellectual suicide to avoid committing actual suicide. 

I have a ton of other rituals too, but they are too personalized and weird for broad use. None of my rituals will help you guys, most likely, but maybe they will inspire you to cultivate your own rituals.
