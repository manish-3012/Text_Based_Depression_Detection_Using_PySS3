Whose idea was this ðŸ˜­ I donâ€™t think I can believe in god anymore. Why would God let us hurt. Why would God make that existAfter everything Iâ€™ve been through to build a relationship with God Iâ€™m back to doubting again. Iâ€™m not a blinded child anymore. If I turn my back itâ€™s a wine decision. I feel awful for even considering breaking off. But why would he hurt us. I canâ€™t. I donâ€™t think I can believe it anymore. Itâ€™s like the biggest betrayal could ever experience. I donâ€™t believe in it being for the greater good. Why couldnâ€™t it just all be good. I canâ€™t focus on it anymore. I want nothing but to stop existing. I donâ€™t know if I my soul will ever be able to rest
