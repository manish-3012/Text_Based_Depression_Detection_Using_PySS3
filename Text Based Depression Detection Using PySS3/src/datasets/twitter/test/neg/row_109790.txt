Why does everyone think they are entitled to controlling what I want?
What if I genuinely, truly am tired of a life of shit and sadness: a life of disappointment and failure? Sure, it's not always so bad but what if I'm completely exhausted? What if I'm just tired and I want to lay forever? 


All I ever want anymore is for someone to say "for your own good, do it". It might seem like a dick move but it really isn't, especially not when I really want it. Why can't one person, just one person abandon their morality and their ethical responsibility and realize that perhaps it truly is better for me to die? 


Why do you people say "You can't kill yourself! etc. etc. etc." Oh yeah? And why the fuck not? Because you told me so? 


I'm tired of everyone's support, it means fuck all to me. I would trade all of my friends, all of my belongings to get acceptance from someone. I confide in these very few people because I hope for someone to grant me permission. Not that I need it, but in the event of my death I want to leave behind at least one person who is able to comfortably say "I'm glad, his life is a lot better now" or something like that. 


So please, why do you people believe that you are all right despite my most sincere wishes? I'm just curious.
