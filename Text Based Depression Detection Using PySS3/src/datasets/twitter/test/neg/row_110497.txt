Well, that didnâ€™t go as plannedSo, I was going to make my attempt today, but I overestimated my stomach. Only got about a Â¼ of the way through when I had to call it quits because I was getting to nauseous. I figure it would be better to not vomit..  not to mention the awful aftertaste when that happens. Maybe Iâ€™ll get lucky and not wake up, but that is doubtful.
