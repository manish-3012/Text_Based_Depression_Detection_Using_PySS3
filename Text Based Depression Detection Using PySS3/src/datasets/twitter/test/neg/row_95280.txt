Why I'm in therapy making progress but still feel suicidal?I started therapy for social anxiety and depressive episodes with a service offered by my university. I feel I'm making progress on my anxiety, my therapist uses CBT and it helps, plus I like her, she is professional, supportive, gentle... But somedays i still feel suicidal. 
Yesterday I had a session, I told my T "I feel better with therapy, I don't think about suicide so much, only when I feel sad\depressed for reasons". She asked me "do you have a plan\methods?". I said "In the past I had a method, and it hasn't changed, but right now I don't think about it". But it isn't true! There are days (like today) when I feel depressed, even for stupid reasons. for example today I started to think about my future, I have the fear of not being able to study, to do well, to have a work that suits me, and I was anxious and then depressed. I started to think "you know, I could kill myself if I don't succeed, in fact it's so easy to do. I could kill myself even now, or even this afternoon, and I'm sure I wouldn't survive (with my method). When I'm gone, who cares of the consequences? I won't be in this world anymore. Maybe I'll wake up in another reality". 
So why I think like this, even by being in therapy? I'm glad therapy is working, but now that i'm writing this I think that maybe me and my T haven't worked so much on my depressive episodes. The main focus was my social anxiety, which cause me a lot of distress. So in therapy we talked a lot about anxiety, coping methods, exposure exercises...but very little about depression, suicide. But I think my suicidal thoughts arrive on its own! I think I will have them forever...they come and go...
