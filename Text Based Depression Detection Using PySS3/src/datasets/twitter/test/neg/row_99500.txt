I hate lifeThis is my first post on Reddit but I've read other posts. Anyways I have not been feeling too great about life lately. I feel like life is just getting worse as I get older. I'm 24 and married but we have been going through some rough patches. 

I am working on my bachelor's but have been doing it part time for 5 years in September now. Everyone tells me I need to move on but I don't have the finances to be in school full time. I do have a diploma from before and everyone thinks I should be done school. 

I have no direction. I tried running a business and now in a bunch of debt. I used the money my nan left behind when she died plus loans. 

I now work 2 shitty jobs and barely make ends meet. I've been looking for a better job but no one has hired me. 

I hate life right now and the way society treats each other and animals. I just want to be done with life and be in peace.
