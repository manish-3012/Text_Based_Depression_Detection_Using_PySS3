I don't think I'm suicidal cause of rage, I'm suicidal cause of anger.I'm angry because of humanity. I'm angry because of what we are, what we do. I am sickened by what we've become. We can hurt each other for all i care. But not when we destroy the planet and its nature.  And that's why i will never be happy. Not because of sadness or I hate myself. But because I hate our existence and my own. If I hate the very existence of our nature. Then how the fuck am I gonna be happy. 

My brother called me immature cause I want humanity to be wiped out. But I say he is the blind one for not seeing what I see. I have lost empathy for our species. I lack remorse for the things i do. I am neither happy nor sad. Im just full of anger and hate. Empathy is a stupid feeling and should he eradicated. I hate caring for people. People who do kill themselves, I wish i had the guts like you do. Cause I could finally be happy and be at peace .
