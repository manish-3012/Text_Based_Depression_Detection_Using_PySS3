Seriously suicidal...Dated a girl for a little over 2 years through high school, she was the first person to bring me out of my shell and the first person who I have ever truly â€œlovedâ€, in October I found messages between her and another guy saying she had feelings for him, they have been best friends since they were kids and he is taller has more money and has so many things I canâ€™t give her, the breakup is okay but I am having trouble coming to terms with myself, I saw the world in this person and am having trouble finding value in myself after being discarded so quickly as if I was nothing, I donâ€™t know what to do and have found myself seriously considering suicide
