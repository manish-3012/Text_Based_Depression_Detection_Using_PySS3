Let's look at the facts:I'm 28.

I'm unemployed.

I have no vocational training and can't afford to get any right now.

Because of my eyesight, I can't pass a driving test or join the army.

CUSO (Canadian equivalent of peace corps) has my resume on file and will, supposedly, get in touch with me should any opportunities open up that I might be qualified for, but I'm not holding my breath.

I am unable to apply for welfare because someone stole my identity last year to do some sort of deal, and for a few months 'I' had a six-figure net worth and didn't even know it. (this is getting sorted out....slowly)

Over the last nine years I have seen three therapists for major depression and been on six antidepressants. None of them have slowed the decline.

I know there's a solution to my problems that doesn't involve killing myself, but I can't think of it right now.
