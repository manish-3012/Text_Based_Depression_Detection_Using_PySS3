Everything sucks and I think im going crazyI feel like I'm going utterly insane. I think that the world revolves around sex and I fucking hate it. I find it disgusting and it makes me want to hurt people that encourage this or promote sex. I have had trouble with sexual abuse in the past and have self-harmed and contemplated suicide many times. Though these thoughts are becoming more regular and I've had strong thoughts of it several times in the past 2 weeks. I don't know what to do because now I'm getting thoughts of hurting other people. It makes me feel sick and I'm just tired of being alive anymore. My boyfriend used to sleep around and I found out that he slept with 6 people last year in 5 months and I feel so sick thinking about it and I know that's a jealousy problem, but it triggers me to cut and have these thoughts. I can't watch anything or see anything that involves sex because I immediately think of him with other girls. I see him being a better person than me in every aspect: he has more friends, he's more sociable and confident, he's told me he thinks he can get any girl, he is so much cleverer than me and I'm just here being me and doing nothing with my life because I am a pathetic piece of shit who deserves to be sexually abused.I'm a fucking loser compared to everyone else and that will never change. I'm supposed to be going to the doctors soon, but I don't know if I can hold on any longer and I want to find a way out. I don't deserve to live anymore and I don't want to live in the world like this. I forget to eat now and I've lost a stone in the past week. I'm very underweight and I really couldn't give a fuck anymore.
