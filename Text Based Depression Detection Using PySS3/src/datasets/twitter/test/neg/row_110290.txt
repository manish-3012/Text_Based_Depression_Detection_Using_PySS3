Tears. Aloneness. Hurting. Ache.Your tears begin to melt the armor around your heart. 

It is understood how much hurting you have done.

The stony cold aloneness you have felt. 

The wordless ache of longing. 

The sting of regret. 

The disappointment of interrupted dreams.

The pain is understood.

Breathtakingly intense at one moment, heavy and dull the next. 

It is understood, all the fear, the anger and the pain.
