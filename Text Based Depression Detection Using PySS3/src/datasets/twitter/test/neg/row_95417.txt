How fucking annoyingThe odds of me being the sperm that fertilised the egg. The odds of me fertilising that particular egg. The odds of my parents meeting in the first place. The odds of humanity even existing. All of those tiny little chances that never should've happened happened. How unlucky is that. The odds of me never existing were so gargantuan. And they didn't pass. The tiny off chance that never should've happened ended up happening. I don't want to kill myself because it'll be extremely painful and it would tear holes in my family. But if I hadn't been born I wouldn't have had to make the decision. I fucking hate life. I fucking hate the world and if there's a God, fuck him too
