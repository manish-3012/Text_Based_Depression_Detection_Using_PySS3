A reason?usually people want to live, people want to get a work, a family, Have childrens, maybe a dog, a car, money, a boyfriend, and more bullshit... I mean, that really make you happy?, that is really What life is about?, thats all?...
I don't Like to live, everyday is a fucking "battle", even the most insignificant problem, seems like a mountain, i have no friends, I've never had a relationship, I have no brothers to talk to, and I can not talk to my parents (they have their own problems and... They dont hear me). I hate society, i hate the people, i dont understand the people... Why everyone hate, or Insult, or etc...

I dont like anything, i hate my carreer, i hate music, i hate movies, i hate the sun, the moon, i hate animals, i hate the noise, i hate live, i hate eat, i hate all... Really i hate everything i can think right now... Nothing gives me pleasure or makes me feel good... Everything seems empty and meaningless.

I have nothing to achieve, i have no dreams, no future... I dont want a house, a dog and a perfect Fitted kitchen... That means nothing to me...

I have 21 years and i feel old, i had cut myself, i have been in theraphy, and right now i only want to find a rope, made a knot and... Well... The end

So why continue? There's something like happiness? A reason?
(Sorry)
