Have I reached a point of no return?I've been suffering from depression for so long I can't even remember how it started. Ever since childhood I began to notice that every few years (for different triggers), I enter depressive cycles where I become literally useless, devoid of all motivation and willpower to the point of sabotaging my life consciously as some sortf of sick and inevitable impulse I can only compare with addiction (sorry, it's all I can think of rn). 

Today I am 24 years old and it's been a year since i entered the worst depressive spiral of my life.

4 months ago I was fired from my job as a copy writer FROM HOME because I let down my ex-boss too many times (therefore I'm broke), broke up with my boyfriend who kicked me and my dog â€‹â€‹out after getting tired of trying to help me and sustain me.

My only and best friend isn't speaking to me so I have no one to talk to (I've also turned into a pathological liar this year and lied too many times about trying to get better and working for speaking out to be an option anymore).
I'm currently 7 days away from becoming homeless because I cannot pay rent or buy food, seek help or turn to relatives since I live outside of my home ountry.
I have no degree or practical knowledge, I only know how to write and I haven't been able to land another job, not even as a waiter.
At this point you would think that my survival instinct would jump out and motivate me but all I can think about is committing suicide. I don't want to live my crappy life, and even for that I'm too coward and conscious of how my death would affect my loved ones. I write this because I'm embarrased of who I become and want to talk to someone and ask for advice in case anyone has gone through the same thing. There was a time where I had hope and will to live but now it all seems pointless and like such a waste. 
Should I give up on life (definitely) and just stop breathing? I would call a suicide prevention line but I have no credit on my phone. I know, I'm pathetic.

*Sorry for the typos, I'm doing my best to write in english. And I also know I don't have real problems like having terminal cancer, schizophrenia (not judging) or something like that. 
My brain is just wired backwards I guess.
