I officially give up.I fucked up at work and got fired; my fiancÃ©e left me in disgust; a drunk driver totaled my car and insurance refuses to pay for it; my wallet, credit cards, and identity got stolen; my checking and savings accounts are **EMPTY**; I just heard the news from my doctor that I'm diabetic; **AND** my ex is pregnant.  I officially give up.

All of this happened in the span of ten days, for the record.  

I'm officially done.  I had a chance at a good life and threw it away.  My plan is to just curl up in a ball until I starve to death, go into diabetic shock, or work up the balls to kill myself more violently.  I'll be able to respond as long as my phone still has a charge, but I warn you I won't have anything interesting to say; I'm just another stupid, stupid asshole.

EDIT: I should also add, I'm about to be disbarred and sued for malpractice, so there went any hope for being able to work in my field again.

DOUBLE-EDIT: And I can't even spell "asshole" right.
