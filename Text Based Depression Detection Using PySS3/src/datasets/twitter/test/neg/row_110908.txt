i'm almost certain that this is the only way to freedomMy father has an undiagnosed mental illness. I'm a 20 year old male who can't leave the house without my father screaming, cursing at me and accusing me of being a good for nothing. I can't even move out into my own house because the thought of leaving my mother alone with my father sickens me. We come from a seemingly devout Catholic family but recently thanks to my fathers actions i've lost all hope in there being a loving God who truly looks out for us. We are all alone in this world and no Longer am I going to start question God why he's let such occurrences happen in my life - God doesn't control anything, hell if he could I wouldn't be sitting here wondering if slitting my wrists would even be that painful of a way to go
But i can't 
I can't because the pain my mother and sister would endure if they found me dead in the morning would torture them for the rest of their lives
But yet I want to so fucking bad I really want to because I can't see any other fucking alternative. What am I supposed wait around till my dad's around 90 and dies  to start living my life or something? 
Maybe if I leave home my mum will have no choice but to just divorce my dad, which in my opinion would be amazing because then even she can live a happy life without an insane man going ape shit over nothing every third day. 

one day at a time i guess
