Got to a stage where i don't want help anymore because i dont careYeh, been suffering in silence with depression for 2 years. Went to the doctor, she said that she couldnt help me because of the wait for a councellor or therapist. I asked for medication and she said she wouldnt be willing to issue it. She told me to go away and talk to my family even though i said to her that i cant talk about these things.

I've got to a stage where i just give up, maybe this is just what i deserve and what I've ben giving in this shit life. I don't even want help anymore, im just accepting that happiness is not an option anymore. I accept that i won't be truly happy again and have forgotten what it feels like.

I've started smoking in order to shorten my life so i die earlier. I can't stand my life, other people are happy and then theres me. shitty me sat pushed into the fucking corner who no one gives a shit about. I'm always to blame for everything and its always my fault. I truly give up reddit. I love all of you people on here who try and help, even though i dont know you in real life and never will i really respect all your help..

But unfortunately im lost, there is nothing more for me now. I give up, people will be sad i go but maybe itll make them realise that they should have had their eyes open and looked out rather than in all the fucking time.

thanks all
