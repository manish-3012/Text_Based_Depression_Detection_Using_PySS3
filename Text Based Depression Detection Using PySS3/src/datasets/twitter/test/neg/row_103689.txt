Feel like I'm slowly losing itIn my mind I know that slowly, yet surely, my willpower and sanity is slipping away. I try meditation every night and it just doesn't seem to help enough. I don't trust my friends to help because none of them can, and I don't have a significant other...what do I do? I know I need to act now before it's too late.
