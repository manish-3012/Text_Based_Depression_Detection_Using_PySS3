I don't feel anything anymore.I don't make connections with people anymore. I'm quick to temper sometimes, but otherwise solemn. I never feel happy. Sometimes I laugh at things, but I don't have other emotions anymore. I feel nothing. I've been like this for literally years now. I thought it would change back at some point.


I used to be the most outgoing person with unlimited energy. I had a wide social circle and loved spending time with people. Now there is nothing. I just don't care about anything. Hedonism was a distraction for a while but I don't feel that stuff anymore either.
