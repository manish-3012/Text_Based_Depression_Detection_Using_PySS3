M15 I fucking can't anymore. It's too much.I fucking hate this, people really don't give a fuck, after two suicide attempts, been feeling the same shit for over three years and nobody still gives a fuck.. But when you are dead? oh yeah that's when you get attention. It's kinda funny to look at my dad's facebook page and him saying "My son Ola, you are just like your dad, always does what feels best for you. I love you" when he vandalized my moms car on my 8th birthday on a Sunday, and I went back to my dad (my parents are divorced since 2009) and then he lied about it, he didn't even want to fucking admit it.. And this fucking social worker that I now have to speak to because my grandma told me to, and my psychiatrist doesn't understand shit either. My psychiatrist literally says "I can't relate" and can really not see the pain in my eyes or voice. Nobody gives a fuck. It's true, I'm not here to tell you to commit suicide, but people will only start caring once you get rid of your pain = by commiting suicide. 

I fucking hate humans, our world is literally burning, there's an ongoing holocaust in China as were speaking, protests, war, kids dying, suicide rates is increasing for younger people, racism is still a thing.. Why did I get brought here? Fuck.. same people that say "It will get better, you need to wake up, you need to wash your hair, you need to get new clothes, you can't just be lazy, stop crying in your bed like a baby, you aren't thankful for shit, you are just like your dad. And compares me to my brother and sister" are the same ones that's going to be on my funeral, but I tell you this.. On my funeral they won't say the truth I can just picture the priest asking my mom "Did you know about Ola's issues?" and I'm sure we all know the fucking answer "oh yes, always, I always tried helping" etc.. But that's not all, everyone included people working in the society and are supposed to help people that want to commit suicide, wouldn't give a fuck either. This world is all about fucking money, ahh I gotta love back in 6th grade and 5th grade when I actually got help from my counselor and then my teacher said "hes a drama queen, hes just attention seeking" and nobody reacted, nobody gave a fuck. And I don't even want anyone to care cause I know at the end of the day, nobody gives a fuck anyways. WHY did I get brought here, there was no fucking reason to, and no one's voice included myself will ever get heard. I saw a tweet and it said "nobody notices how sad you are until it turns into anger.... now you crazy and help" this is exactly how it is.. you can't do shit.. Nah, fuck everything, it's too much. Thanks social workers for not giving a fuck when I was younger, every fucking meeting I said how I wanted it to be and I still had to live with my dad. I hate everything, I understand my uncle, he committed suicide when he was around 30 and I feel the same as him, fuck this world, fuck everything. 

But.. the truth will always be that nobody gives a fuck, until you are dead... I hate humanity and I hate this fucking world, just fucking take me please, I pray that I'll die in my sleep every time.. Can I please just not? or should I risk my life of an OD or Jumping of the roof and possibly surving, nah just fucking let me click a button to end this terrible fucking journey.
