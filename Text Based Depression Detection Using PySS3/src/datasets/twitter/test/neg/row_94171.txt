Getting Close to the EndI bitch and moan too much here but only because I have no one to tell these thoughts to.

Man I'm really, seriously thinking about ending my life soon. You can't live your life alone, but that's exactly what I'm doing. This isn't even my choice. I fucking hate that I literally have zero friends. The only people who care are my family, pretty much because they have to. But that doesn't mean any if them are my friends. I am alone. I have never had anyone tell me they cared about me. Not one person. Not one time where someone was legitimately sad that we were parting. Not one time has anyone ever been interested in getting together with me. Not one person texts me a single thing. Not one person calls to see how I'm doing. Not one person legitimately has respect for who I am. Not one person cares. 

And you know what? It's all my fault. I have had social anxiety for as long as I can remember. I'm emotionally distant from everyone I meet because I can't get out of my own head. I'm too socially inept to actually connect with anyone. I never actually enjoy a social Interaction. It's always a fucking chore. I can't ever fucking do or say the right thing. It's always awkward. I know exactly how I need to change my body language, but I fucking can't  because being self-conscious and insecure make me feel like I look like a damn fool. Mix the suicidal depression in, and I can't even FAKE a laugh or a smile for anyone who wishes to talk to me. This makes me look like a loser, an asshole. No, it makes me an asshole loser because not only can 99% of 21 year olds do this no sweat, I can't even muster the fucking CURTESY to do so.  It's fucking rude and awkward when someone asks you what's wrong and you don't have the confidence or emotional control to conversate with them, instead tellin them essentially to leave you alone. I did this at fucking work. It makes you look immature. It makes you look like a jerk. I don't even have a sense if humor anymore. Nothing makes me laugh. To add to the social problems, I can't fucking BE funny. Most people can. Most people have some senblence of confidence about what is funny. I don't. 
You have to be a friend to have a friend, but it's impossible for me to be a real friend. Check the low self esteem, socially anxiety, and lack of confidence + social sklls to understand why. 

I don't know how I got to be this way. I am the result of 21 years of my life. Pathetic. I think about when I used to be happy, and I fucking sob. I will NEVER be happy like I used to be. I will ALWAYS be cognizant of my severe mental issues, which I did not ask for or see coming, but have nonetheless. It would take literal years to even maybe change. I don't want to have to COPE for the rest of my life, that's for fucking sure. That brings me to suicide. It's sad to think that my life is what it is, but I think that's all it ever will be. If I killed myself, I'd cause a lot of pain. Frankly, that's the idea. No one cares about me because I suck at being a person, but they'd fucking care if I killed myself. At least for a little I would be in someone's spotlight, this time without trying so hard. At least this time I wouldn't fail.

Edit: Thank you for the responses guys. No confidence here so I think that probably came off as sarcastic so  I want to clarify that it definitely isn't. The responses are the reason I posted in general, to just feel connected to someone in some way. Though we don't actually know each other, knowing some of you can actually relate to these issues does in fact provide a deep level of connection, despite the anonymity.
