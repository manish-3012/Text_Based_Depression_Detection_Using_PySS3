Before committing to the act of ending one's life..Should I write a letter? Leave some sort of "last will" or some sort?

Even though, the fact, that I've now given up everything that I lived for- I can't give up the fact that I've always put others before me. 

If I'm ending it all, then I might as well mitigate the other's pain..?
