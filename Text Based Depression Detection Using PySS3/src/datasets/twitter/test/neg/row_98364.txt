25, no job, very depressed, high anxiety. Been this way for most of my life. Maybe I'll have better luck in the next life.Hi,

I'm 25. I've been severely depressed for most of my life with severe panic attacks occurring almost weekly. I've tried medication (fluoxetine, sertraline, wellbutrin, adderall), no luck. I'm constantly tired. Everything is monotone until I get a panic attack. I would've ended everything much sooner, but my suicide would devastate my parents. I wish I was happy.
