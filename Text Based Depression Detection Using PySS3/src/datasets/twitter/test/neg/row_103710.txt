I donâ€™t know what to doThursday night my mom called 911 because I had been upset , crying and screaming and banging my head/body against the wall. I didnâ€™t want to be admitted to the hospital again so I ran out the house and had my uncle pick me up a few blocks away . 20 minutes after I got back to his house my mom sent the cops and ambulance to my aunt and uncles house . They didnâ€™t take me because my dad (my uncle is my dads brother) showed up and said since heâ€™s my parent too he agreed for me to stay there and not go to the hospital. He checked on me and I was fine and that was sufficient for the police that night. Tonight I called my mom and even though we fought she agreed I could come home as long as I stay calm and donâ€™t hurt myself she wonâ€™t call for the ambulance/police again . I love my aunt and uncle but they have 4 younger kids and this just isnâ€™t my home. I appreciate everything theyâ€™ve done by keeping me out of the hospital, because last time my uncle actually assisted my parents in admitting me but since them everyoneâ€™s realized that was a big mistake that only made my situation way worse . I just want to be in my home with my sister in my bed where all my stuff is . Not that I totally forgive my mom but my life is there . When I just told my aunt and uncle this they seem disappointed that I decided to go back. They said â€œitâ€™s on meâ€ if I go back and my mom decides to call the cops again. Now I feel like next time Iâ€™m in trouble I wonâ€™t be able to call them for help. I can feel the tension between us. Iâ€™m not trying to seem disrespectful but I just want to be home. Now Iâ€™m feel even worse that I have my mom threatening me to put me away and my aunt and uncle are mad at me and itâ€™s all my fault . Iâ€™m tempted to slit my wrists in their basement bathroom right now. Iâ€™m just a disappointment to everyone. I canâ€™t please anyone . I hate the thought of people I love and who Iâ€™m close with being mad at me and feeling Iâ€™ve taken advantage of them .
