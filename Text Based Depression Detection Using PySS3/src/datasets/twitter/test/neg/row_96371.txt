Thinking of killing myselfI'm going through a really rough phase right now. I'm Bipolar I, just started treatment, it's not working. I don't know what to do. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow, I don't even want to bother anymore. I'm so done. I just feel like jumping off my balcony.
