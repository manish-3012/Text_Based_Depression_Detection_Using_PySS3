How do you stop yourself from cutting yourself?I self harmed about 3 1/2 weeks ago and the scars are healing. I never want to do it again. But now today I feel so fucking depressed I want to pull the trigger and just so it again. I feel worthless and like everyone hates me. Nobody ever talks to me, asks me how Iâ€™m doing but Iâ€™m always there for others. Sometimes I feel like the world wouldnâ€™t mind if I just ended it all but I canâ€™t. I just donâ€™t know what to do right now. I hate myself. What can I do to not want to self harm? I have literally no worth, so whatâ€™s the point right? I donâ€™t feel like anyone would care if I did it
