TerminalIt is a relief feeling to the sick and suicial, knowing you don't have long to live one way or the other. They just can't give you a date only an approximation.  Your book is then defined with a final chapter whether written by you or not. No epilogue. No continued illnesses. No more pills or doctors or tests. Oh the gagging of 21 pills a night! The things I will not miss. I only wish the afterlife was real. I'd like to see my children. Heavenly, Faron and Houston. They had names. No one ever asks but they did. 
In end it will be severe pulmonary hypertension that gets written down. Not lupus or sjogrens after all. How funny. Not a candidate for transplants as I smoked for so long. It is what it is. 
I made my arrangements months ago. 
I find terminal such a word. To terminate. To end. I think of the busy place in an airport where everyone meets or parts from one another. I am at the end of the journey not the beginning. And I must part from you all.
