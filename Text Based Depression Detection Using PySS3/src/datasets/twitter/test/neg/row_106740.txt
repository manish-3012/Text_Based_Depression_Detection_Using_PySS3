I cant do this anymore at all. I ruined everythingI cant even begin to believe what had just happened within the past three days. I Went to my girlfriends junior prom, and i apparently said to a girl that i liked that i would break up with her to be with her. I now realize the damage that i have done, and it cant even be fixed.

Love is a extremely dangerous thing and i make people's life's a living hell...I just deserve to die at this point in life. I cant do anything anymore. If someone truly believes that my life has a meaningful purpose, then please tell me now. I have a shotgun next to me and im just waiting for something to happen...help
