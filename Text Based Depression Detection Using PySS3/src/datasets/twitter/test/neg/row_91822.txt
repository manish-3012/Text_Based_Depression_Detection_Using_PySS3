There is no reason for me to live. I just want to end it all.Iâ€™ve been depressed since i was 15. Iâ€™ve never been happy or sad. Existing is painful. Iâ€™ve tried waiting for better times but it never comes. No matter how much i try to further myself i end up worse.

Iâ€™m 19 now, turning 20. I have no future. I donâ€™t understand why i havenâ€™t already killed myself. It feels like people have been lying to me all this time.

Why live? I see no other option than suicide.
