I want to but I canâ€™tEverything I do it gets massively and royally fucked, everywhere I go the people I meet and get close to leaves, because of my stupid mistakes. I want to end it but I donâ€™t have the stomach for it, Iâ€™ll be leaving too much behind, Iâ€™ll hurt people, but if I stay Iâ€™ll continue to hurt more people. Iâ€™ve finally started cutting myself after just putting the blade on my legs, itâ€™s the only thing that allows me to get punished for all the shit Iâ€™ve done, I donâ€™t like it but I feel like I have to, thereâ€™s nothing for me, Iâ€™m all alone and I feel like this is who Iâ€™m going to be for the rest of my life, alone and scared and mad at myself, I just want it to go away, I want to leave, I want to be lost, I want to sleep and never wake up, I hope then when I do leave everything will be better for everyone, I donâ€™t deserve to be happy, I donâ€™t deserve love, Iâ€™m a mistake and a failure, no one wants me around, so whatâ€™s the point, what do I do
