I don't know what to do.I'm 21 years old and I don't want to live anymore. I've been depressed and anxious since childhood. I was in and out of the psych ward for self harm as a teenager, and I missed so much school I almost didn't graduate. I've tried so many different medications. I've tried therapy for years. Nothing helps. Nothing at all. 

I can't afford college and I don't even know what I'd want to do anyway. I suck at everything. I've had like 6 jobs and I think the longest I've lasted at one is 6 months before quitting. I hate working. It turns me into a zombie, where I do nothing beyond eating and sleeping. It makes me suicidal. I also have a bad habit of getting overwhelmed and just not showing up to work anymore because I'm so anxious and I feel horrible calling out. The only hobbies I have are reading and painting but every time I sit down to paint my mind goes blank. I thought maybe I could sell art but I'm not good anyway. I predict I'll be homeless (or dead) in a few years when my boyfriend decides he no longer wants me and kicks me out. I quit my last job a few weeks ago and I've been mostly sleeping all day since then because I'm literally ALWAYS exhausted. Anyway life sucks and I don't want to be here. I have nothing to look forward to.
