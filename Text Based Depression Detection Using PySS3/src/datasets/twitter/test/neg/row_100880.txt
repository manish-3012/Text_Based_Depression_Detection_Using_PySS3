I'm so close to giving upWhen I'm with my "friends" I feel nothing. When I'm with my family I feel nothing. When I'm doing something I used to enjoy I feel nothing. I just realized how little I care about my friends, they don't give a shit about me, why should I give a shit about them, I'm hardly even close to them the only reason I talk to them is because I'm desperate to just talk to someone even if I don't connect in any real way. I love my family and I realize how much they care about me....but I still feel nothing. I haven't had a single good day in about a year. A day hasn't ended where I felt in my mind that, that was a good day. I I've realized just how little the person on the inside of you really is unless you can express it to other people in a meaningful way. I've realized just how much being shy, anxious, and silent really is in this life. You can't connect with people, you can't make people like you, and you can't have someone ever really know you. You can be an utter piece of dirt on the inside but Hey!, if you are funny or impressionable other people like you. This isn't even me trying to be cynical I have just accepted that my anxiety bars me from having the life I want. This is me throwing in the towel I just don't care anymore, I romantasize everything in my life wanting some great perfect life that I can never put in the work to get. The worst part is, is when I get to my lowest point and want everything to change and improve my life I just let things go back to the same shitty normal. I just can't take it anymore.
