I'm angry at my brother for dying before me.First off, I love my brother. He was always so tall and strong when I was a kid and I remember wishing I was just like him. He came back into our lives for about a year after disappearing, and it was fun for a while. Eventually he moved away. Not long after, he was shot and killed.

After that, I had to beg my girlfriend for emotional support. After a while we broke up and she wrongly accused me of cheating, resulting in me losing every friend I had, including my best friend who had previously kept me from attempting again for so long.

That was two years ago. My depression hasn't stopped since I was seven, but none of these things made it any better. And it isn't better for my family either. I have wanted to attempt again for the last two years but my mom can't lose another son. My sister can't lose another brother. I want to destroy myself, but I don't want to destroy the last people who support me.

I can't kill myself because my brother has blocked that road for me. My family members aren't immune to depression and where it can take them. I believe I have the right to die, but what am I supposed to do? I can't leave this world and it's all his fault.
