Iâ€™m so fuckin doneI vented on social media about my several issues I have right now and people came to my support saying â€œyou can talk to me at anytime.â€  Like thatâ€™s great but I barely know most of em I donâ€™t even want to talk to my friends.  I donâ€™t wanna talk to anyone but I feel like I need to be heard and itâ€™s so ducking selfish I hate it.  I hate myself.  I lie to my therapist and my family Iâ€™m so fucking hurt inside and I donâ€™t what to do.  I donâ€™t get the point of living at this point and nothing I can do can seem to convince my subconscious otherwise.  I canâ€™t bring myself to do it but I donâ€™t value my life and Iâ€™m stuck.  Sorry this post is just a cluster fuck of emotions and if you read to the end thanks I guess.
