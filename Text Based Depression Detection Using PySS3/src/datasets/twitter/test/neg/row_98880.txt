My family is controlling and unsympathetic I canâ€™t take it anymore.Everytime I go to make my own decisions they lead me to believe thatâ€™s ok. But when I actually make my own choices oh suddenly itâ€™s WWIII! Oh how dare you make your own choices, you donâ€™t know what your doing. I know whatâ€™s best for you just let me run your life for you. Well Iâ€™m so sick of it! I canâ€™t even be my own person anymore. In fact when have I ever been able to be my own person? It feels like Iâ€™m powerless and Iâ€™m being treated like a child even though Iâ€™m 22. None of them realize that the reason Iâ€™m in the position Iâ€™m in is because of my very dangerously poor mental health. They donâ€™t understand that either! They all have this thing they want me to be and I hate it. 

Ever since Iâ€™ve been forced to live with my overly religious and pushy/ judgy grandmother Iâ€™ve picked up some very dangerous habits and Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself three times. Iâ€™m thinking of killing myself finally because I canâ€™t take it anymore. And everyone is trying to push me towards what they want me to do. It doesnâ€™t matter if I had plans or that Iâ€™m supposed to be an individual. They always criticize and put down my dreams because they think they are stupid and that I wonâ€™t ever get anywhere with it. Well great. Whatâ€™s the point then? 

So yeah Iâ€™m planning on killing myself. Things havenâ€™t ever gotten better. And nobody believes in me anyway.
