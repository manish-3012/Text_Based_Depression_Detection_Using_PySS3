I don't know if it's comming back or if I'm just being dramatic.Around a year ago I almost killed myself. I had a gun to my head and couldn't do it because of one person in my life. About 2 months ago I got over my depression but now I feel like it's comming back. The only thing I can think of is my dog just died but I should just be sad not depressed. I'm afraid I'm stuck in a loop with depression and thus will keep happening my whole life.
