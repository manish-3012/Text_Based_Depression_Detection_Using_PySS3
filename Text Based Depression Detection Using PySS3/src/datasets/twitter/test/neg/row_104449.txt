What's the point just staying here if fate wants me to suffer without a job, without a friend, and possibly without a home?Ever since finishing campus in South Africa, life has been so tough. 1 and a half years of job hunting and unsuccessful interviews and no luck in the accounting field. Now I can't get anything, and I'm applying everywhere. At the rate what is the point of carrying on?

Also another cause for my depression is because, I STARTED SCHOOL WITH NO FRIENDS, LEFT SCHOOL WITH NO FRIENDS. Bullied, abused and hopeless. I was on the brink of suicide in 2014 until the end of school (I can only think of Childish Gambino's This is America Ending as a prime example of the hell I had to run away from after finishing school). Last day, I actually ran away because my grandfather died, but no one took me seriously and prepared to throw eggs and flour all over me, and at that moment, I nearly jump of my balcony. But when I got to campus, I made brand new friends and all seemed great, but after finishing campus, we barely talk, and now when I try to speak they are ignoring me. And again, what's the point of trying to have friends if they pretty much use you?

Because of my sitting at home being unable to get a job despite trying, my father has tried to encourage me, but it has come off as a threat. I just left campus and suddenly he says I have to cover up for my sister's college fund when she finish high school. And because of that if I don't get a job, I must relocate out of the province and not come back home until I have a job. After this so called encouragement from my father, what's the point of living under a roof anymore?

WHAT IS THE POINT IN ME EXISTING ANYMORE? I'VE SERVED MY PURPOSE AS A MOBILE TOOL WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR THE HARD WORK I DO! BY THE NEXT FEW MONTHS I MAY NEVER EVER COME BACK! I'D RATHER LET MAGGOTS FEED OF MY CORPSE! I'D RATHER DIE THAN TO SUFFER MORE!
