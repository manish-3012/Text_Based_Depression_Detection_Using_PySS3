21f I wish I didnâ€™t have so much pride...If only I didnâ€™t have so much pride.
If only I could JUST FUCKING DO IT. 
But, nah.
I couldnâ€™t possibly just â€œLET EVERYONE WIN,â€ as I say.
I will â€œNOT be the fucking loser.â€
I stare at my about 15+ bottles of pills I have in my cabinet quite often.
sometimes I have them right in front of me.
I have done this about 20+ times before...
why the fuck canâ€™t I fucking attempt anymore?
I couldnâ€™t even hardly self harm today when I did...
why the fuck am I such a fucking coward?
I want to fucking die.
nobody will remember me. 
nobody will be effected.

maybe I donâ€™t kill myself because I know no one would think even the slightest different about how I was/how they treated me. theyâ€™d continue living and being happy and fine and I would have....lost...

I donâ€™t wanna lose just to have never been seen in the battle to begin with...Iâ€™ve just gotta accept my life means nothing, never has, and never will. 

please, god. PLEASE. Iâ€™M BEGGING YOU. JUST PUSH ME OVER THE EDGE ALREADY!!! WHY IS IT TAKING SO GOD DAMN MUCH? 

Iâ€™m already toes off the edge. 
something just seems to remain the glue under my feet and I wish I knew what.
