Hanging Advice-RopeI've been doing some research on how to hang myself. I can make a hangman's noose quite fine but my issue is that my local store doesn't sell rope that is 3/4 in. or more. Do you think it would be as effective for me to braid three small pieces of rope to create a larger one? Or should I just order it by the mail? My concern is that if I try braiding them together it is more prone to break since about 180 lbs of pressure might be too much if there is a nick or breakage in the rope, which is most likely since the rope is smaller. I've also thought about different types of braiding to ensure it doesn't break, but I don't know if it would work. Thoughts on this?
