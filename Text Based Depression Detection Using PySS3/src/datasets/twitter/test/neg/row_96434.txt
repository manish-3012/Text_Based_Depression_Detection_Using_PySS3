LifeIâ€™m 20 &amp; I feel like I missed out on life. My days just bring my sadness. For many years, Iâ€™ve tried to suppress these suicidal thoughts with laughter and fake smile. I just canâ€™t do it anymore. My school experienced was something to never look back on. My medical problems ruined my elementary years &amp; I was never able to experienced the joys of being a teen. Somedays I wish I went to my prom. However, due to my homosexuality, I am happy I didnâ€™t go. I hate what I am so much and If there was a 100%  cure Iâ€™d take it. Conversion therapy is bullshit and Iâ€™m done praying. I feel like a joke even having to do this. If I was born normal, this wouldnâ€™t have to happen. I just want to cry everyday to feel pain. I think of self harm but donâ€™t want someone to see my scars once I donit. Its not like anybody would get close enough to see but Iâ€™m still scared I might cut an artery with my luck. I wanâ€™t to feel anything, just a touch( I know it sounds weird). Iâ€™ve been alone and loathing myself for too long. If I wasnâ€™t bound to Hell, I would cut my throat to stop this pain on Earth. If I knew that everyone around me was wrong and that there is nothing at the end, I wouldâ€™ve killed myself. My anxiety is through the roof and I just so pathetic.I feel so empty and repulsed by my desires and loneliness. Itâ€™s a constant feeling of seeing others being normal and being loved that makes me want to die.
