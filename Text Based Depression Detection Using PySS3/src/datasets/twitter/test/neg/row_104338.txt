I will go, sooner or laterHey guys, it's been a while.   
I really thought I was doing better. Like, doing better as in trying to live, trying to find happiness. Two weeks ago my boyfriend broke up with me. We're back together after speaking but I'm not really okay. Furthermore I wrote my exams the next week and guess what, I didn't pass them. It was my third attempt, I still have one left but I'm just so done. I'm emotionally done with trying to fight. I've given up on myself a long time ago, lived for the sake of others in order to live at all, but this. I'm so done. I've been trying, trying to fix myself, but I just can't. Depression got the best of me, I can barely remember what I did 10 Minutes ago, yet alone concentrate enough to study for the next upcoming exam. 

I think if I fail this one as well, which is 99% coming true I'm gonna go and leave for good. I'm so done with everything, I just want this pain, this stress to disappear and honestly I wanna disappear myself.
