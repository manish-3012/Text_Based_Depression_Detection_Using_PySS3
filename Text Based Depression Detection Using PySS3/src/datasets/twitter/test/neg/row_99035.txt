I can't deal with this.My mom just told me that she thinks that I won't be able to graduate. She it calmly as if she didn't care. Even though it seems like the only thing she cares about these days are the letters and numbers in the gradebook. I told her I putting a (clearly) much higher priority in trying to stay alive but she told me I'm just saying the same "excuse". I asked her if she loved me and she sighed in disappointment. I told her about how my depression has been lately and she said it's all in my head. I don't understand. Why say that and still pay for therapy? Why not let me die? It seems like the only thing that gets through to her is my being on the verge of killing myself so here we are. 

I guess she's right though. I am lazy, gross, I can't take care of myself, I can't do a single fucking assignment. I don't wanna be here anymore. This hurts. It hurts too much. I can't do it. It's too much. I need help. Get me out of here. Please. I'm not faking it.
