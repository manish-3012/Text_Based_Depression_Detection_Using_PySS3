It's meaninglessEven if I post something here, even if I get replies, they will all be empty. This post will get like two replies (if any) before getting lost forever. And whatever anyone replies will be completely empty, because you don't know me, and we're just random people on the internet that will prob not interact with each other ever again.
So what is the point? All this text won't stop the physical pain I feel through my entire body, it won't stop it from getting more intense everytime I realize how lonely I am, it won't stop me from being a huge loser who isn't even good at killing themselves, it won't stop me from hating everything I do.
