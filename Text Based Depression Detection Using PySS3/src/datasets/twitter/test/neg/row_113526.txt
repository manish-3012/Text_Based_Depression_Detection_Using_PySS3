im so ugly, i want to diei always wanted to be cute and feel loved but im ridiculously ugly. all my friends are good looking but im like a monster from a horror movie in comparison. people say looks dont matter but they do to me. i wish id been born cute and pretty but i wasnt so whats the point. ive started gaining weight lately too and im so depressed i dont have motivation to do anything about it. im planning to commit suicide later this week but its scary so i guess this is my last attempt at reaching out..
