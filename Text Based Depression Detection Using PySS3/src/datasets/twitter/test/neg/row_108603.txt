I almost shot myselfI held a loaded gun to my head with my finger on the trigger. Iâ€™ve done it before, the first time I was scared about it possibly hurting, but now Iâ€™m not scared. I know itâ€™s probably going to hurt when I pull the trigger and Iâ€™ve accepted it. I feel incredibly suicidal, Iâ€™ve felt this way for awhile.  All I do is fantasize about throwing myself off of an overpass or jumping off a bridge. I have friends that I think love me. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m just depressed or maybe thereâ€™s something more going on. I cut myself a lot as a coping mechanism, but itâ€™s not really that effective anymore. Iâ€™m going to be leaving state soon on a trip and I think thatâ€™s when Iâ€™ll do it.
