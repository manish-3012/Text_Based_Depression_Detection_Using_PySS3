I feel like a disappointment, especially to my mom.My mom really just insults me alot. Weather she doesn't like what I'm wearing, doesn't like my hair, or my friends. Cause of Covid, im doing online school. And thats the issue. I hate it. I hate it so much. I cant focus, its hard to read, I'm taking longer to do it than it actually would if I was at school. However she thinks its best that I'm at home. Even though my falling grades, and piles of missing assignments are proof thats its really hard for me. She calls me really mean things, and it really hurts me. I'm not allowed to leave my desk, until their finished, I go to bed late, wake up early. I'm just really confused on what I need to do right now, and how to catch up. Am I being dumb? Am I the one who is being mean?  I feel like im just a burden, an inconvenience to everyone around me. If I left, would that be better for everyone? Less pain for them?
