Hahaha :/
I don't know whether to cry or laugh, maybe both. I've been dealing with many issues for some time now, one of them being my depression. And right now I'm at a point I know very well. I've entered into the whole "fuck everything" mindset, where I'm too tired to care but at the same time all I do is care. I realise it doesn't make much sense, but I guess that's how it is. All I want to do is curl up into a ball and cry my eyes out without being bothered by all my problems. Listen to music and have someone hold me and take care of me. However, none of that can happen so I laugh it out. I laugh at myself for being so weak and pathetic. For wanting what I can't have. Because life goes on and it won't wait for you to heal. If I could just take a break... I wouldnâ€™t have all those thoughts, like how the world would be a better place and I could rest in peace if I disappeared.
