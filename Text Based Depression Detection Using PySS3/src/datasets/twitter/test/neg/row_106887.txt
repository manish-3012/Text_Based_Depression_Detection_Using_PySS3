I don't know what to do and I don't know what is wrong with meI really don't know what to do, I should be happy but nothing in my head is letting me enjoy it. I'm dating a girl, and it isn't super serious yet but I am already afraid and overthinking everything. I am struggling in college and I don't feel like doing any work. I don't enjoy anything at all. I am so sick of life, I don't know why forcing myself to smile is the closest I get to really being happy. I just can't take it anymore, if I can't enjoy life there is no reason to keep fighting through my problems. If I give up, I won't have to endure day after day of agony.
