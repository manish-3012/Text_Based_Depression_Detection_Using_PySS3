Woke up almost cryingI had a dream where I was arguing with people and threatening to kill myself and I got angry and started crying and I woke up almost crying. I have a lot of angry thoughts when I'm awake and it always leads to thoughts of suicide. I've woke up yelling before but this time I woke up almost crying. I just have these dreams sometimes where I'm fighting with people and it kinda stresses me out.
