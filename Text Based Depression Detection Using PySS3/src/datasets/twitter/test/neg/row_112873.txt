Iâ€™m Going Through Hell, In Need of Kind Words &amp; SupportBuckle up kiddos, this is one helluva ride.

This mostly started back in September â€˜18. I got an apartment with a girl I met through work. We were basically joined at the hip ever since we met and became close friends very quickly. I was in a bad living situation (mentally abusive *now ex* bf,) and she was homeless, so I suggested we find a place together since we got along so well.

Fast forward a bit to December â€˜18. I started really eating it with bills, because Iâ€™d been covering a pretty large portion of her rent/utilities/etc. on top of my portion. I mentioned it to her several times, and even gave an ultimatum of me signing my name off the lease. She begged me not to, and said sheâ€™d improve- so I didnâ€™t.


Right before Christmas, my bank account was met with a lot of fraudulent activities. I lost $5k that I didnâ€™t have to begin with. Bank told me to call the police, police said the bank should handle it. So I now owe my bank $5k.


Right after Christmas I lost my job, and since I was an independent contractor I couldnâ€™t claim unemployment. While I was frantically looking for a new job, my roommate would just stay home from work, or take my car without asking to drive 30-45 mins one way to her job, and back. She never helped with gas/car payments/insurance. We started falling out and talking a lot less, she avoided talking about finances at all.


In the beginning of February, we got evicted. Sheâ€™d attempted suicide 2 days before we were supposed to move out. And her parents were too busy with their trip to Hawaii to come help out. So I ended up packing all of her stuff and cleaning up the mess from her attempt. (She slit her throat in bed.) While packing her things I noticed a lot of my things tucked away under her things. Stuff that I thought Iâ€™d misplaced or maybe sold to Platoâ€™s Closet and forgot about. I never mentioned it to her, but that hurts, because we were so close at one point. She literally could have asked me for any of what she stole and I probably would have said yes.


We still owe that complex $2k. And I canâ€™t fathom her being responsible enough to even confess to me that she canâ€™t make the payment let alone make payments to them.


I ended up moving back in with my mom, and got myself a job shortly after. However, this isnâ€™t a good living situation for me either, as my mom and I have a very strained relationship. And most 12 year olds these days have more freedom than I do. So Iâ€™ve been desperately trying to save up to move out &amp; in with my current bf (22M.)


Last Wednesday (2/27/19) I crashed my car on my way to work due to snow and the roads being icy. Thankfully I had full coverage and my dad is letting me borrow his car, but my deductible is $2k. And the day after I got a letter from my bank, with notice of default/intent to repo. my car, if I canâ€™t pay $615 before 3/19/19.


I started speaking with a lawyer about filing to claim bankruptcy, because Iâ€™m in so deep at this point Iâ€™d rather have that on my credit report than have my credit keep plummeting like it has been. The fees for this total out to roughly $1.6k, which to me is definitely worth the $10kâ€™s of debt Iâ€™m drowning in.


My depression hasnâ€™t been this bad in years, and my anxiety is at its all time high. Iâ€™ve had more suicidal thoughts than I can count, and I just feel so overwhelmed and helpless. I donâ€™t want pity, Iâ€™m mainly just venting, because this has been the hardest few months of my life Iâ€™ve ever experienced. 


I really just need kind words, because it seems all my friends have to say is â€œThat sucks, Iâ€™m sorry. Hang in there.â€ And I really need more than that right now. I feel so alone, and tired of life. I feel like Iâ€™m taking hit after hit after hit, and I desperately just want to catch a break. Iâ€™m on antidepressants and anti anxiety medications, but they only help so much. And Iâ€™ve consulted with my doctor about this, she doesnâ€™t seem to take me too seriously.


So thereâ€™s my rant, any kind words/words of advice would be greatly appreciated.  


I sincerely hope youâ€™re all doing well, thanks for reading.


Also- Iâ€™m not going to hurt myself, Iâ€™m well past that. The thoughts just are there. Thereâ€™s a line between thinking and planning.
