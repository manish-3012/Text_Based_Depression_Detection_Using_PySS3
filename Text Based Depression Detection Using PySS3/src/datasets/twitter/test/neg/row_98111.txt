I feel inferiorI seem to have a big inferiority complex

Today in class we were doing little clay figures that represented something to us, while everyone else's looked beautiful and detailed, mine was all desfigured and ugly, while everyone's had a meaning behind them, mine was "hurr duuurr i like octopus" 

Why cant i be the best in something for once??

I felt so embarrassdd when it was my turn to talk about my model, all i wanted to do was say "sorry teacher but im a talentless piece of shit" 

Im petty, im pathetic, i dont want to be but i cant help but feel this way
