I cut contact with my mother today. Her boyfriend is texting me begging me "not to give up on her".If you take a look at my post history, you will see some text messages that my mother sent today that caused me to go no-contact. Her boyfriend is a great person and he is texting me begging me not to give up on her. I'm exhausted. I'm so tired of being the parent and the relationship. I've been taking care of her since I was a small child. I can't take care of myself, because I'm setting myself on fire to keep her warm. I've been distracting myself with her issues; ignoring mine. 

I feel like a terrible daughter. I feel like I'm turning my back on her.
