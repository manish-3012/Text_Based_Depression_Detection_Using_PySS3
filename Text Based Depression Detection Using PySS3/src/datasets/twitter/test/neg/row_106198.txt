One dayI feel like I'm going to kill myself in the next couple of months. I have untreated depression, and I am in complete despair. I want to go to some kind of support group, but I can't go to one because I don't have a car. I am very lonely, and I just really want some people to talk to, but I'm very shy. I absolutely hate myself, but I don't want to live anymore. I wish I could just sleep forever, but that's impossible.
