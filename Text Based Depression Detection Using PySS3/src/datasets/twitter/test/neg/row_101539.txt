20 years old, blowing all my savings on a vacation and then killing myselfItâ€™s something thatâ€™s been on my mind for a while, Iâ€™m only 20 yet I feel so worn out of life, the sad part is I know I shouldnâ€™t be but I just am. 

Both my parents are very caring and work extremely hard and honestly it makes me feel even worse when I think about how easy theyâ€™ve made my life.

My dads a commercial fisherman and it is a very lucrative job, needless to say the last 3 months Iâ€™ve been working him full time Iâ€™ve saved over 50k.

Iâ€™m going to leave a note and 30k to my parents apologizing for what Iâ€™m about to do but itâ€™s my choice and I want to let them know Iâ€™ve been able to live such a good life thanks to them and I love them so much, but at the same time I feel like Iâ€™m nearing the end and just want to stop playing the game of life.
