Paranoid for justifiable reasons in my view. The resulting strain makes me feel suicidal.Some unpleasant people in the past tried to destroy me (and almost managed it). The result is I feel paranoid all the time. The doorbell rings, I worry it is the police, a letter arrives I worry it is a bad letter.

I am quite a vulnerable person and people try to take advantage of me because of that (I know this to be the case because my sibling is not a vulnerable person and no one ever tries to mess with him, no it is me they try to take advantage of). 

It has made me constantly panic and feel sick so that I am always wary and feel suicidal a lot.
