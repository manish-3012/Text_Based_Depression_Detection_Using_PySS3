Just getting my feelings outI mostly feel dead and empty. The only emotion I ever feel is annoyance and anxiousness. I have been resisting the urge to drink. I somehow made it through the weekend, but it was hard. I kept justifying reasons in my mind why I should drink. I saw a guy walking holding a six pack of beer and I was jealous of him. I felt that if it was okay for him, then it was okay for me. I still did not drink though, but not because I didn't want to, just because I didn't want the judgement from my SO.

Still the fantasy of killing myself is strong. The image of tying a belt around my neck plays over and over in my head. I'm just afraid of the pain, I'm afraid of what people will think, and I'm just not sure if I can do it yet. I don't think there is anything for me here. I just don't see the point and I don't have the strength to make the effort.
