I need to fucking dieI can't handle being alive anymore, I need to die, I need to finish, I fucking quit.  I don't remember my last time being content, it's not just going to pass over, I'm going to die and I'm going to make sure that happens as soon as possible. I have no idea why I feel like this but I don't want to breath anymore, there's nothing to talk about I just need to fucking die
