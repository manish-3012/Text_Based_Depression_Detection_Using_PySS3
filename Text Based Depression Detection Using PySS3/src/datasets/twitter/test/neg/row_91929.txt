I want to die. Duhf/18. 

Iâ€™m anorexic with borderline personality disorder. Everything is fucking painful and having no impulse control/ amplified emotions is frustrating as hell. I rarely take it out on others. My mom constantly tries to drag me down and just adds to my feelings of worthlessness. 

My boyfriend tries but he doesnâ€™t get it (neurotypical) 
My best friend only hangs around me when itâ€™s convienent for her. And sheâ€™s now claiming she has an eating disorder which is super triggering for me to be around. 

Iâ€™m trying to move out and get as far away from my family as possible but Iâ€™m a broke 18 year old and thatâ€™s going to take some time. 

I have strong urges to kill myself but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d be successful in the time frame I have. Most of my suicide attempts have been on impulse and not planned (no suicide note) and thatâ€™s what worries me. I feel like one day I will have just had enough and Iâ€™ll end up in an angry dissociative state and go through with it. 

Despite the high high death rates for both anorexia and bpd- if I use the term mentally ill around my mom she gets upset. Iâ€™ve been through plenty of treatment but my mom will not acknowledge that Iâ€™m mentally ill, and thatâ€™s hard. 

Until the day my impulsive suicide urge comes along Iâ€™m just done letting people give me shit. Iâ€™m going to start living like Iâ€™m dying tomorrow- because with the way my life is going who knows lol
