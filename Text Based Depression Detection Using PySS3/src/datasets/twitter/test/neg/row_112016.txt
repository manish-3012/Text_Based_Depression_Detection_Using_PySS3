I want to kill myself because Iâ€™m ugly.Please somebody reply and help me.

Iâ€™m 16 and Iâ€™m a female. Iâ€™m 5â€™7 and Iâ€™m chubby-ish (even though people say Iâ€™m not chubby) and I have short black hair which is dyed, so my eyebrows are blond and I have to fill them in everyday.

This is the main cause of my suicidal thoughts or whatever. Iâ€™ve been suicidal in the past because of my mental problems and my stupid fucking trauma and home life but Iâ€™ve been getting better.

I was doing so well, so so well. I had good friends, I had an okay home life and I was doing well in school. 

On New Years my friend at the time sexually assaulted me or whatever and that ruined me and my self confidence. Iâ€™ve gained weight and I feel as if Iâ€™m uglier than ever. Itâ€™s fucking destroying me and I see no point of living because Iâ€™m ugly fat and disgusting.

Iâ€™m so fucking pathetic I want to shoot myself in the head so badly right now. I cant live like this or look like this. Itâ€™s embarrassing.

Nobody will ever love me or think Iâ€™m beautiful. I hate myself and I cant wait to die. Holy fuck.
