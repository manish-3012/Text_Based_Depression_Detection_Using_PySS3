I have nothing interesting to sayI'm dead inside and have been for years. 

My best friend said she wants nothing to do with me.

I've got no one in my life and nothing to live for, and the reality is that things are going to get much, much worse.

I'm obsessing over how to leave this planet as quickly and painlessly as possible. All I want is a comfortable escape.
