I'm exhausted.I tried. I tried so fucking hard to be the best friend, the best daughter, the best person I could be, and it wasn't enough. I spent so much time and money on trying to keep my friends, so many nights ignoring sleep to keep them company in their darkest hours, to hand whip whipped cream and to tweak my recipies because my best friend doesn't like vanilla, so much time and care and effort into something as simple as gift wrap, and for what? To be blocked with no explanation? I called her my wife and she pretends like she doesn't even know who I am. I just want to know what I did so wrong to fuck up our friendship. Myo own mother hates me. I can only hear about how much of a bitch I am so many times until it breaks me. I can only have my money taken so many times until I realize she doesn't respect me. All I want is love man. A hug from my mom, a friend who will appreciate how much I truly care. I'm so done with extending myself and getting spit in my face. Nothig but me and the bottle now. I had so much love I wanted to give but y'all broke me. I'm so tired of getting hurt.
