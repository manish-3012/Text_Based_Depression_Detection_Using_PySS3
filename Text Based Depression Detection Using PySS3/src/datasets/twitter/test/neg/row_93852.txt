I realized I'm back to being suicidal, tho I thought I "healed" from that state.Before, I was suicidal. Thinking about events to end my life. Possible ways to not put the blame on anyone.

Then I focused on my studies. It was kind of a good distraction that my family requires me to get good grades.

But just the past week, I got a small notebook, and I started writing there quotes about life, death, humanity, etc. Then the quotes eventually started becoming one-line suicide pleas.

I don't wanna get rid of that notebook. I like it. But as days pass, I feel like the more I write in that notebook, the deeper I fall back to where I started. Before I "healed."

I realized there really isn't a way out of this mentality. You actually never escape. You actually never become happy. It's just that you forget about it. Or you end up in situations a bit better than before, but still not good. Or the heavy feeling lies low for a moment. Then back up raging to you brain. It's annoying and disappointing.

I wish I never hoped to heal.
