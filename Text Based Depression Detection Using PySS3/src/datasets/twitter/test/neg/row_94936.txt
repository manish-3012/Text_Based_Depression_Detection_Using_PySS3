Midnight.1am. I don't like 1am. I hate it just as much as 2am, 3am, 4am. Probably even more. At 1am the bottle cracks and it all comes rushing out and I can't stop it. At 2am I can't breathe, I can't move, and I can't think. At 3am I think too much, to an uncomfortable level. I think about things I don't want to think about, but I can't stop. 4am is lonely. 4am is tiring. 4am is when I finish crying and I start breathing again and I can move, I can see, but I can't feel. 4am is lying on my side, cheeks damp and eyes bloodshot and raw, stained with red lines and my knuckles stained with purple and blue flowers that ache when you press down on them too hard. It's feeling not much but everything at the same time, it's realising that I really am nothing. It's understanding that my life and every other reject is meaningless, that when I love, laugh, FEEL; it doesn't account to anything. It's waking up and realising that I am truly alone in this life and more to come. Feeling dead in a cold room with no one around for miles, having to pick up my own pieces and haphazardly glue them back together. The whirring of the fan and the blurry eyes that come from staring at the one spot on the wall, because I can't move. I wonder what I did to make this happen to me. Why do you hate me so much? Why me? I haven't done anything wrong. So why do I deserve this? 

But 5am is coming. 5am brings salvation this morning, brings the scratchy feel of rope around my scarlet stained neck and the bitter taste of pills on my tongue. I'm not scared anymore. I don't know what I am now. I can't breathe. I can't do anything. And so I sit watching the clock, the same old ticking noise is too loud and my breathing is erratic. My nails dig into my arms and drag up the nauseating blue flowers and strikingly red stalks. Red. Too much red. All I can see is red and everything is too hot, it's all closing in on me and I can't goddamn breathe.



Clatter.





Then it's nothing. 


I'm waiting for 5am, I can sleep at 5am.
