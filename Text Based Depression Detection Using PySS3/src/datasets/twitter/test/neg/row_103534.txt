When all the psychiatric care doesn't work, what will work?I've been in and out of psychiatric care since I was 12 years old. The past 2 years I've spent a large percentage of it visiting psychiatric hospitals, getting CBT therapy, WRAP therapy, Occupational Therapy, Psychiatric outpatient departments, weekly psychiatry visits, been on strattera, fluoxetine, valdoxan, lamictal.

Nothing improves me. I feel like I'm going more and more insane as the weeks progress.

I've always felt like this, all my life.

I'm angry and agitated. Even though I have a lot of hobbies, and things to keep me occupied idk. 

Suicide seems like the only actual option open to me the past 6 months. I've already faked an attempt once by lingering around a bridge, hoping the police would notice but nobody did so I went home.

Next time I might crash my car into a wall, not too fast though, just to show them im fucking serious this time. 

there's absolutely nothing that works, and social support is non existant and never will be. I'm inept and it's not going to happen no matter how much people give me advice. I've read it all a million times before.
