I've reached my limitHi there,

I've been great for a couple of months I felt good about myself but this week I've been reaching my limit I've had my finals for my night school been working for 3 years to get my education over with I've failed a couple of exams and work is not going well no matter how hard I tried, I work as a repair technician mostly I devices and laptops and such I'm also a sales person at my job but I can't seem to repair or sell anything it's been almost 2 months that I've been failing at doing my job correctly

I'm tiered of failing at everything I do I'm not stupid or anything I learn from my mistakes still shit goes worng I don't believe in any kind of God but if he exists he is makingy life a living hell I know it sounds super dumb that I'm so worked up about school and work not going well but I can't help it i always give 100% yet I'm failing at everything single thing I do, I feel sick I feel worthless, the only reason I'm not dead yet is because I have a loving family, and great friends, I really don't know what to do i wanna end it but then all my friends and family will be sad, I don't wanna go to a stupid psychiatrist they don't help in my opinion I've been at this point before went to one she only made it worse, possibly she was not great at here job but still, the only one who can make you feel better is yourself, but i don't know if i can get over this it's to fucked up in my head right now i just wanna stop exciting, others will be sad but I will finally get some peace in my head notting to worry about nobody to please or satisfie, no. More presuer from society to be the best you you can be,

Hopefully this will be my last post here, either because I'm dead or because I've found a way to be happy or at least content with the life I'm having

Goodbye
