Iâ€™m sick of the emotional roller coaster.Something is severely wrong with my emotions. Small arguments with my wife send my head way out of control. Every single time these arguments escalate (and itâ€™s always because I canâ€™t help myself), I at least think about suicide. I want to drive my car into a tree, I want to fucking cut my stupid veins open, I want to take some pills and fade away into nothing.

Then the next day or the next time I feel good about something, I wonder how I could have ever thought such a thing.

This happens to me at least 3 times a week. Itâ€™s exhausting, and I donâ€™t know how long I will last. Iâ€™m either going to die from a stress related illness or at my own hands. I just know that whatever happens, if I had the opportunity to look back, I know that I would regret it - and that part scares me the most.
