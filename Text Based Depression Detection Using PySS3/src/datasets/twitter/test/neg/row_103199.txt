My friend is saying suicidal things and i'm worried for himI know his irl name (only the one he says is his), but ik nothing else.
He blames me for going to pc instead of staying on xbox his reason but i think there might be more and i'm worried for him. Please someone tell me what i should do, i don't want to call the police as idk if he's serious or what.
Some of his msg's becuz steam doesn't lemme see his other ones for some reason:
