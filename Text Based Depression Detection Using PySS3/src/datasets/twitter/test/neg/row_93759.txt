I'm so tiredI have social anxiety.. with intense self-doubt and feelings of worthlessness. I also recently relapsed after months of doing well with my almost 11-year long battle with bulimia and self-harm, so I was really emotionally unstable.. Something happened today that made me feel those feelings of worthlessness again. I posted for the first time on a subreddit called "Off My Chest" looking for support because the "About Community" said: "A mutually supportive community where deeply emotional things you can't tell people you know can be told. Whether it's long-standing baggage, happy thoughts, or recent trauma, posting it here may provide some relief. We'll listen, and if you want, we'll talk. We aim to keep this a safe space."

I got one reply and it said: "Generation of cry babies."

It got upvoted.

I just-- I don't want to feel anything anymore. Why do I even try to look for support? Why are people so cruel? Please I've heard enough of "It's just the internet don't take it to heart", where else am I supposed to look for support. I am tired of trying. This is too hard and I'm too weak and naive to keep fighting
