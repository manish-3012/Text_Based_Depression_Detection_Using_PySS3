My[22/F] brother[31/M] tried to have sex with me few timesI'm not sure how to say this, haven't told anyone. We are half brothers, only from one parent. But we are good friends, hang out all the time...He's one of my few close people. We were partying one night and then i was really high and drunk, so he hit on me, and we kissed and touched. Felt terrible afterwards. Felt like punching him but i was too wasted. The other day, i tried to forgive myself for it. The point is...I tried to be again open and confident with him, but i started attack him and be very defensive... Felt like i didn't trust him, because afterwards he started hitting on me AGAIN or make sexual jokes..and i felt uncomfortable. When i stayed at his place few more times after we went out, or if i needed someone to talk to, he tried again to sleep with me, and i stopped him(stopped his hand from caressing me in bed). A few weeks later, again, woke up in the middle of the night with him caressing me. Felt so anxious, woke up soon, left his place...on the way to my place, i had a panic attack, and when i got home i cried on the bedroom floor...and felt like shit. I don't know what to do, how to approach this. He doesn't seem like he wants to talk about it, but i just want everything to go back to normal. I Considered removing him from my life and started making plans for it, because i DON'T TRUST HIM anymore, and felt like he was a profound dissapointment... but i m worried about what my parents would think, they would notice and ask questions about why we're not talking anymore... I can't really avoid him because he's my brother, but that's what i intend to. It really depressed me and i feel like a shitty human being, having suicidal thoughs... What should i do?
