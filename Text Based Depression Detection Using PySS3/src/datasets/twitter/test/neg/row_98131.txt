I can't do it anymore.I've been dragging myself out for too long. There is officially no way this will ever get better again. It's one thing after the next and it's over. I don't even have anyone to talk to anymore. My boyfriend of 10 years who I thought I could trust with my life told his "best friend" a girl he has known 3 months every personal and embarrassing thing I've told him. I used to think of ways to kill myself but tell myself I really didn't want to die. Now I do. I don't care anymore. I want to be done.
