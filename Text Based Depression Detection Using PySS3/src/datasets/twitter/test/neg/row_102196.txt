I wonder what would happen..If I ate all my antidepressants? Probably nothing much. Damn you lousy modern antidepressants! Can't even properly overdose on you! I suppose I could try to OD on booze, but my liver is made from steel. Or caffeine, but that's a horror trip I don't wanna go down.  I suppose I could do what all the cool kids do and eat a laundry pod. But that's just so yesterday. I want to go out with style. I think I might do the glue thing. You know, where you get some piano wire, make a noose from it, put your head in, super glue your hands to your head, and jump off a building.. That way it looks like you ripped your own head off! 

Sorry for the gallows humor. I guess I use it to cope. If that makes sense.
