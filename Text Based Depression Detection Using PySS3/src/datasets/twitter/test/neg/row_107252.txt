Howdy, I have returned.I tried to kill myself two months ago, via carbon monoxide poisoning. I have been in the pysch ward for two months. It was ok. It was highly routine. The nurses were really nice.

It was of value because it gave me a huge amount of time to think but it didn't have much of an effect on me. I feel that I'm still weak and eventually I will be suicidal again.

But for the time being I am excited about a plan to pay off debt and then return to school to become an engineer or someone who works with robots. I'll be 33/35 when I return. I was wondering what people thought of that.

But anyways I will be hanging out here and /r/depression again. It might be a couple days because I have to do some getting life in order. But I look forward to talking to you guys again and hope to be a source of support again, in addition to occasionally needing it.
