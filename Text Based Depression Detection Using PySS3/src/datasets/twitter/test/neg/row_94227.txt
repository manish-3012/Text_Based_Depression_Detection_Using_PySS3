Thinking about killing myself but don't want to dieToo sum it up. I am 25 years old. I recently graduated from a reputable university with a degree in Film TV and new media. I can not seem to land a job for the life of me. I apply to atleast 2 jobs a day, based in CT here, mostly NY postings. LA has more postings/ offerings but i do not have the money to move out. I live with my parents and stupidly broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years who is dooing rather well in the same industry. We speak occasionally but she knows im  a total loser. I've pretty  much told myself if i cant do anything by 30 years of age im going to off myself. yet somehowe the feeling seems like it will come sooner. I cant find a job, my parents hate that i live at home, I cant find a "significant other" outisde of the girl ive foolishly dumped. I am an attractive dude and have no problems with women or tinder hook ups and can get laid constantly but none of this appeals to me. ideallly id love to get back together with my ex but she wants no part of it. I try looking for work in my field and have even started a youtube channel for gaming and memes in my spare time but not having a job no matter how hard i try, and not having interest in a single female other then what i feel is my soul mate really discourages me. I know that there are millions of people and im bound to meet someone new or find a job that will work out given the odds. and yet nothing seems to ever go my way. I have recently started waiting tables to offeset the debt i am accumulating. I cant afford to go out as most of my friends swipe mommie and daddies credit cards. my parents hate having me live here, yes they put a roof over my head but everyday we talk about wtf am i doing and what my plan is and when can i gtfo. My question or whatever really is wtf can I do differently?  How can i actually be happy or land a job? my thoughts are if I at least has a solid job, which im shooting for a video editing gig (i graduated with BA in  fIlm and have had 2 internships but cant land a paying gig and money is extremely tight. Like i really dont want to kill myself but have already set a date in motion as my 30th birthday and this seems to dwindle as time goes one. I have been out of work for about 1 year now even though i apply to 2-5 jobs a day and get interviews about once or twice  a month. I cant comprehend it. I cant even seeem to land an unpaid internship. I know if i just stfu up and grinded unpaid gigs hard for a year or two it would lead to something, and yet no one seems to want to hire me. I dont know wtf im doing wrong and Im smarter then your average bear. any advice would be greatly appreciated. especially from those in the film industry.
