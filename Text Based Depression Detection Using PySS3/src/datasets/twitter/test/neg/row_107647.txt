I feel like Iâ€™m not capable of fully making it through life. At one point Iâ€™m just going to end it all. I feel like I was never meant to be part of this world.Thatâ€™s all I have to say. Living is just really painful and I donâ€™t think I can handle this pain forever. I feel selfish for wishing people didnâ€™t care about me, but I really wish nobody did so I could just leave without hurting anyone. Existing is painful. I just wanna go.
