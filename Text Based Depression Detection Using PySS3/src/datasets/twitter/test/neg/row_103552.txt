Old demons are coming backI've struggled with depression for years and I almost killed myself 5 years ago. I got better and was doing well, but now the same feelings are coming back.

I feel worthless. I feel like a scum of the Earth, like I'll never amount to anything and that I'm not doing anybody any good by being alive. I never thought I would have these thoughts again but here they are and here I am.
