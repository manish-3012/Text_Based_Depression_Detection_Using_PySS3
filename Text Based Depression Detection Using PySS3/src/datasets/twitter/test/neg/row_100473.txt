Fu*k This Planet.I feel that by continuing to live I'm effectively pissing into an ocean of piss. I'm a 34-year-old father, multiple-time college dropout and chronically depressed welfare case now living with parents in the middle of absolute nowhere. I'm forced to look back at my twenties and early thirties which were spent in a sort of sort of "haze" of mental health issues, alcohol abuse, wasted opportunities and self-destructive tendencies. My credit is shot as a result of my tendency to disappear into thin air and cocoon myself against worldly responsibilities, my student loans having long been delinquent. I can't keep a job because of my anxiety, lack of credentials, inability to get along with others and an unmovably shitty attitude towards everything ever. There's likely enough wrong with me to fill volumes, the above being a decent rundown, but being by no means exhaustive. I'm just a huge piece of shit kept alive by the goodwill of family and a generous social safety net.

My only real reason for remaining alive is my daughter. I'm not *technically* a deadbeat dad, but besides babysitting every two weeks or so, I'm hardly much of a parent, and even less of a provider. What's worse is that I actually enjoy being a father and would love to have more kids, if only I had the means to do so. But given the advance of age and the apparent hopelessness of my situation, it appears to be a rapidly fading prospect. I'm also forced to contend with the worsening global economic, social and environmental situation, which brings me to the title of this post, and makes me feel almost reckless for bringing another life into this world.

I'm fucking disgusted by planet earth. I'm sick of the fucked up religious psychos who seem to be breeding like rabbits. I'm sick of the politicalization of everything under the fucking sun. I'm made sick by both the left and right, not only in my country, but in the United States as well. I'm fucking SICK of biased media in general. I'm fucking SICK of television. I'm SICK of politicians. I'm SICK of this species which seems to be destined to self-destruction despite possessing the ability to literally land on other planets. I'm sick of great power rivalries. 

All in all, it feels as though a perfect storm of shit is converging upon me. On my last highway drive, something alarming occurred to me. There were no bug guts on the windshield despite the 45 minutes or so we had spent on the road. Reflecting back as I am prone to do, it occurred to me that in earlier years the windshield would have been totally covered in guts. Even fucking insects are dying off in droves. This planet is fucked.

It's bloody tempting to hang myself. There seems to be a bright light emanating from inside of the bottom loop. Life sucks and it's only going to get worse. I certainly don't feel as though I can survive this new reality, anyways.
