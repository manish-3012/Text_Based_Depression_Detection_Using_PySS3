Sick of being meSorry if this post makes less sense than my usual posts I have broken my hand, I can literally do nothing for myself except use my phone with one hand I'm usually on my playstation or laptop but I can't be on either because of my hand, my boyfriend saved my life because I fell in the bath and split my head open and broke my hand I moved in with him a while ago after living with my mum and step dad for 28 years, right now i am really missing living with her, my depression is through the roof every second of the day suicide is on my mind my only escape is sleep but when I sleep I have nightmares, I don't know how much more I can take, yesterday morning I was awake at 4am and the only thing that stopped me from commuting suicide was the fact that the dog was laid on my legs so I couldn't move
