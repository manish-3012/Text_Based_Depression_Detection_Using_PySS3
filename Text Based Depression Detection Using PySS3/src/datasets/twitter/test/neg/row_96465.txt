Iâ€™ve packed my camelback with drugs to kill myself with. I have a duffel bag with two beers, sparklers, and just anything else I might need tonight. Iâ€™m going to hike to my off trail spot and post up my hammock, and Iâ€™m going to die tonight.3k in credit card debt. Found out I have a student loan I didnâ€™t fucking know about. 
I work a shitty part time job now after getting laid off a full time job last year, since then fell into a shitty pyramid scheme and accumulated the debt because I couldnâ€™t stand asking my parents for help. 

The guy I fell in love with wonâ€™t love me back because Iâ€™m transgender, and fuck it Iâ€™m done with his shit. My friends only care now because theyâ€™re scared of losing me. 

I give and give and give myself 
And this is what I am 
A worthless person. Iâ€™ve disappointed my parents. I canâ€™t do shit right. My little brother is fucking married in a house with a dog and a solid life, and what do I have? 

I pour shitty Frappuccinos for unappreciative assholes for 9 dollars an hour. Iâ€™m behind on rent. Iâ€™m barely surfing. This life is just meant to fuck us over and Iâ€™m fucking done. 

Iâ€™m fucking done and Iâ€™m terrified.
