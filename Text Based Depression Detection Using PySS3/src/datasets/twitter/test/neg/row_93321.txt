I Think It's Time For Me to Go.Hello everyone. I've created this account.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a little... scattered in the head right now. I hope you can understand what I've typed.

There is some triggering content near the beginning. Please skip it if you have dealt with sexual assault. When you see the paragraphs again, it's finished.

I (26F) am considering suicide tonight. It's not sudden. I have been thinking of it for a while. I have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety, and PTSD for about seven years now. I believe I've had it longer than that.

I don't like being alive. Every day is a struggle. It's easier when I'm talking to others, but when I am alone, I get stuck in my head. And... and my head isn't a very nice place to be. I don't think others realize how much I'm struggling. I wear this happy mask so seamlessly that it seems to be my face.

It isn't my face.

I was sexually assaulted in my youth, and in my late teens. I feel broken. I feel worthless. I feel like nothing I does matters. I have three close friends, yet I don't feel like I belong. I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I'm waiting for that moment where I screw up so badly that the friendship is over. I feel that I'm always going to be second best to everyone. I don't have a romantic relationship, the only one I've ever had was abusive. 

I have this pathological urge to be perfect--I have to be perfect, I have to make everything better, I have to be better. Because it was my father who raped me, and I kept silent about it. When he molested me, I told my mom and she believed me. My brothers didn't. Police came and picked him up, and soon, it was up to me to know if he could come home. I said yes. I was twelve.

What a stupid fuck I was. 

Fast forward two years. I stop going to school because I'm tired of being bullied. I'm tired of pretending to be okay. I'm tired of the cruelty of children. My father gives me some of his medication to help me sleep. 

I wake up and he's hurting me.

I think it's a dream, and I stay home again.

He does it again. 

This is not a dream.

He asks me if he can do this to me every day.

I tell him no.

The look on his face makes me feel like I took back something from him. I feel strong. I feel scared, too.

I'm smarter this time. He gives me the pills, and I pretend to take them.

He lays down for a nap. Gets up later and asks me why I'm not asleep.

I counter with "Why should I be?"

I realize he wouldn't stop if I stayed home again.

I didn't sleep that night. Afraid he'd hurt me when mom was asleep.

I go back to school. The taunts are more tolerable in comparison with the possibility of facing that again.

I can't tell my mom. I think it's my fault.

That was in the past, and I'm in therapy now. I'm still that child, because we all still live in the same house. And I still try to keep everything together. I always thought if I got better, if I went to therapy, then things would be better. It's not better. I was so stupid to think that I could change things. I hate that the decision fell on me. I love my mom, and I hate that she had me decide. I wanted to make her happy. I wanted to make sure that she wasn't overwhelmed. Therapy just reminds me of how immature and stupid I am. Medications don't help.

I'm such a mess.

Recently, I was interested in someone... and I thought it would go somewhere. I felt so happy just being near them, my heart would beat faster, and I always was excited at the thought of seeing them. And the most shocking part? They seemed interested, too! I was filled with hope, with joy, with amazement, that maybe,just maybe, my therapist is right. That I am worthy of love, and that people do like me.

Such sweet lies I've swallowed.

I believe I am too much, or, paradoxically, I'm not enough because now I realize I was so stupid. Maybe it's my warped depression lenses and maybe it isn't, but I do know now that it was all in my head. There was someone else. Just seeing their expressions is a give away. There's always someone else, and I'm never enough. I don't want to hope and think it's nothing. You don't look at each other like that and say it's nothing. I'm not letting you lie to me. I'm not letting you hurt me. I'm not letting you use me as an ego boost, or lead me on.

I'm in college and I hate it. I hate being around my former crush. I want to confront them, and tell them to give me a straight answer so I can stop having these lingering feelings. I hate the fact that no one sees me when I'm not smiling, or if they do, they ignore it. I hate that when my mom sees me sad, she gives me hugs and I know that I'm just going to keep hurting her. I hate that no one seems to care, even though I like to see them smile each day. I hate that I feel so...

Empty.

I don't think I can do this anymore. Day in and day out, it's the same thing. Maybe this will change things. For my family. I just cause trouble for them. I made my mom keep my father in the house. My brothers don't drive and they depend on him for transportation. They don't know he drugged me and raped me. I heard her tell my aunt (her sister) that her anniversary is just another day. She's not happy. I'm not happy. All because my dad fucked up, and I fucked up. Every time she tells me not to do something because he's around, it reminds me of what happened.

I'm tired of feeling responsible, when I know it isn't my fault. I'm tired of thinking I have to keep the family together. Maybe it's time for it to fall apart. I'm tired of therapy, calling for coaching, using skills. I'm wasting their time. I'm so worthless. I can't do anything right. They won't miss me. They'll probably be relieved that I'm gone. 

No more me asking peers if they'd like a hug today. No more offering them food. No more annoying them with stupid questions. No more moronic me. No more mom worrying about me being in the house alone with my father. No more uncertainty. No more painful hope.

No more.

This is the first time in a long time that I'm starting to feel... content. Euphoric even.

I must wait though. I won't let them see my body. I will leave them a note.

I hope they understand.

I need this. I need this. I need to do this. I need to do this for me. I need to do this for them. So this is me making things right, trying to make things right for them and for me. I've been dead for a long time. It's time to make it right.

Thank you for reading this. I love you. And I'm sorry. I hope I can make things better.
