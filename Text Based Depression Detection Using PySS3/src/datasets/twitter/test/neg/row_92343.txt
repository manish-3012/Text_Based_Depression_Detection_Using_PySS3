Holding on by a threadThe past year I've been having suicidal thoughts, I haven't told anyone, lied to my doctor when asked and am one bad day away from just ending things.

I don't want to die, but life holds nothing for me. I'm not a good person , hardly even a nice one really. I have little reason to feel the way I do, all my needs are met and I am secure, I have no traumatic history or disability. 

The only reasons I'm not dead is that my family would be heartbroken (even if better off in the long run), my friend might feel a little sad for a day or two and I am scared of the actual process of dying.

The world doesn't need a person like me and would be better off without, yet I can't bring myself to finish it.

Not sure why im typing this, maybe a cry for help or attention, maybe nobody will read it, maybe im just somewhat crazy. Who knows?

If anyone that reads this is able to find my identity and/or location please do not contact my family or the emergency services. I value my family's opinion of me higher than my life at this point and I'd rather keep that intact at least until im not here to see the result
