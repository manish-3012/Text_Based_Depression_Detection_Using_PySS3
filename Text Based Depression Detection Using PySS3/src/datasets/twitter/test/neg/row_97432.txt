Depression makes you selfishHaving depression and being suicidal is honestly so selfish. Like my mind just wants all the attention of everybody around to look at me and make sure iâ€™m okay, even though i show no outward signs of depression.

But itâ€™s not just that. Lately, Iâ€™ve been passively wishing for my mom to die. Itâ€™s not that I hate her, in fact I love her more than anything. I donâ€™t want her to feel the pain of her son committing suicide. Iâ€™ve thought hard about my suicide and I feel like sheâ€™s the only one that it will affect significantly, so my mind just goes to not wanting to hurt her while still being able to achieve what I want.

I feel like Iâ€™m a terrible person. Itâ€™s just that I know for a fact that if I die, itâ€™ll be suicide. Unless some freak accident kills me, I will not live past 30. I just donâ€™t want to hurt the one person that loves me more than anything...
