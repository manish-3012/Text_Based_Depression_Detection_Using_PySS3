Confused and lostI donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for about 4 years, and am actively planning on killing myself in 3. Recently, I found a long distance girlfriend who I wonâ€™t be able to see for a while. Itâ€™s an odd feeling. I know she loves me, but I also wish sheâ€™d give up on me, since Iâ€™ve almost completely given up on myself. I know what the right thing to do is (stay with her and keep living), but Iâ€™m just not sure if I can do it. I need help but Iâ€™m not sure where to go or what to do. 



P.S. (to my girlfriend): I know you use reddit, and Iâ€™m sorry if you see this, but itâ€™s just something I had to get off of my chest. Iâ€™m sorry.
