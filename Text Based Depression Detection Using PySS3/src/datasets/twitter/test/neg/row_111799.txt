If you have time......It's a pretty standard heart break story: boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, girl cheats on him repeatedly. I can't blame anyone but myself-but it's such a disappointment that people can be so horrible, and while you give them all the chances in the world to better themselves, they don't. I was never brought up to think the human spirit is content or limited. I was always taught that anybody can do anything, but when you watch someone constantly disappoint the people around them, it hurts. My heart hurts. My body hurts. I still love her. I can't just walk away...I'm not suicidal, but I'm praying for that brain aneurysm. A friend, who's lost her father to suicide, once told me: my father didn't kill himself because he was sad, he killed himself because he was apathetic. That's where I'm at-I'm apathetic. I don't care...
