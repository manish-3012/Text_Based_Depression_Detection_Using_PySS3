I want to die, but I don't want to kill myselfI'm in my late teens.

I've had so-called depressive thoughts. I wouldn't say they're consistent but every moment I have them, I feel like I'm living in a pit-less Hell. I find myself (most nights) crying myself to sleep. I'll give a few reasons why (if you care, and please give me advice.)

1. For as long as I've known it, my mother's side of family actively hates me. I'm not going to go to deep into it, but we had to cut off ties with her parents, siblings and cousins due to their active verbal and constant mental manipulation with me and how saying I am the 'Devil's child.' I've always felt as if my mother had hated me for it - for my existence. She treats me different to my brother, not so noticeably, but I always feel as if I'm on a lower pedestal compared to my older sibling. She speaks to me all the time like I'm far too young to understand, immature or assuming that I plainly don't care. On multiple occasions she's called me a 'c\*\*\*', 'b\*\*\*\*', etc. I would go to my room crying - I usually did nothing wrong. Then a few minutes later to an hour she would come in crying and playing the sympathy card - justifying her actions to that she's on her period, had a bad day etc. 

It just makes me feel like crap all the time when she knows she's in the wrong, and I always forgive her.

2. I'm lesbian. I've liked girls for as long as I've known. I've only told my two best friends around the start of 2018, and my father near the end of last year. I told him not to tell my mum because she has the biggest mouth known to man kind. (They are not homophobic, it's just hard I guess to defy 'social norms.') He ended up explaining to her that I was very, very sad when telling him, bawling my eyes out, but he accepts me and that I want her to accept me too.

&amp;#x200B;

When she ended up approaching me, she was completely understanding. But she ended up cursing me because I didn't tell her first, I told my friends. She wanted to be the first one to know.

\- she also brings up on multiple occasions about myself being gay. I feel like I'm some-sort of bragging trophy that she can show around saying "Hey! I support the LGBTQ+! Look, I even have a gay daughter!". Every moment on TV, she asks if I think some chick looks hot. I feel so awkward and just laugh, looking away. But over all, I feel like I'm on some pedestal and I have to stay gay forever because it shows she's a supportive mother or something. I know things can change, and that worries me. I might be gay today, and tomorrow have the biggest crush on a boy at my school. (Doubtful, but still hovering the back of my mind to that my sexuality could change at any moment.)

3. So, we had a relative's party recently. Mid-way I had a large (what I would call) panic attack and couldn't focus. I started crying, murmuring to myself that - 'I'm such a f\*\*k up.' and I curled up onto a ball and just started begging for my life. I don't know if that is normal or what not. It happens to me occasionally. I ended up getting dropped home, and my parents left me and returned to the party.

&amp;#x200B;

\- that night, I vomited several times in the toilet. I also have a habit, when in moods like this, to bite my wrist and grind my finger nails into my skin. I am so, so scared of knives and would never do anything like that. I want to die all the time. I just don't want to kill myself.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I don't know what to do. Amongst the things I've written above, there is a novel series I could write about circumstances in my life that made me want to die. I cry myself to sleep most nights and listen to depressive songs, videos that glorify suicide. I feel like I'm convincing myself to commit death, but I don't want to self harm because I'm scared of pain. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to see a therapist, anyone. But I'm terrified of telling my parents. I'm a pretty 'happy child' seen by my parents. I usually tell jokes, talk a lot (depending on the situation.) And I feel like if I tell them anything that actually happens inside me would be like a joke for attention to them as usually I don't act all mopey near them, only when I'm alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want them knowing I'm depressed. I've tried online councillors before, but none ended up actually helping me. One even admitted to just wanting to hear about more drama within my life and that made me cry even more.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone has any ideas or thoughts about this, please, please help. I don't know how much longer I can take it. I almost wish to myself each night to get hit by a bus (or anything) for it to end. 

I don't think of myself being suicidal, I just want to die and have sickening thoughts. I feel gross all the time, and as if everyone hates me. 

Even if you have ideas on music that could change my mood. I'm not into subminals, so please do not have anything with hidden messages in it.
