In a week I will do itHi everyone. Next weekend, after one of my best friends leaves my house, I'm going to kill myself. This is non-negotiable, and the reason why I'm writing this is because I need to vent a little before making up the plans. I'm killing myself for a bunch of different reasons. I am excruciatingly ugly. I am very stupid. I don't have many friends. I can't go to the doctor. I can't receive treatment for my depression. I don't know why the fuck I would continue living. What's the point? I absolutely fucking hate myself. I'm trying to get better, but I'm not. I'll always be ugly, and I'll always be stupid. Not only that, but I feel completely apathetic. I just don't care about trying to find a solution that isn't suicide. Sure, I could think of a plethora of different solutions, but my hatred towards myself exceeds my desire to get help. I just really **Really** want to die, and I just want whoever is reading this to understand.
