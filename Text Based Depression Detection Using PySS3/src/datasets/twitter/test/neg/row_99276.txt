I am a failure.......I do not know where to start, but i'll try....

I never wanted much from life.  I never wanted all the money or power in the world.  I wanted the dream of a career, wife, kids and house white picket fence.   The only thing I got was a loving wife.....

I took alot of bad advice from high school faculty and college career faculty.  In high school, I was told just to pass, while working full-time at a grocery store.  That was enough.  Things will be good.

I joined the Army in 1994 after high school.  I tried my darnedest to do well in the Army, but I wanted to move on, go to college and pursue my dream.  I got out in 1998 after my four years were up.   I then worked and started going to school while I worked.  I got my two year degree in 2002, and despite the little slump, things were on the up-and-up.

I continued to work my ass off while taken part-time course and sometimes full-time courses.  I did not work for one year and that was to take more than a full load.  The career counselor at my alma matar openly expressed that he did not like me.  I never knew why.  He always acted like I killed his dog or something.  He actually refused to help me find an internship, saying that my previous experiences were good enough.  I finally graduated college with business and marketing degree with no internship.

This was December 2007.  Yea, you can see where this is going now.

I took a job three months after that out-of-state.  I tried to help engineers find jobs in their fields.  The company I worked for all-but-folded when Lehman collapsed.  They went from 70 employees to five.  I lost my career, at no fault of my own.  I had to move with my girlfriend from college but I lost it all.  Thus, I had to take a $7.25 job at a fast food restaurant because I had bills to pay.  Then two years later, I got a job with a software company as tech support and hat is what started me going in the accounting field.  People were screaming for accountants two years ago, but not now.  I miss all the good parties.

I have only one class until I qualify to take the CPA exams, but I cannot get a job to save my life.  I would even take a job at a firm making $7.25 just to start my career in accounting, and still no one wants me.  If the job required me to work 70 hours a week, I would still take it in a heartbeat and love every moment of it.  I have been told though that the reason why I am unemployable is because i will leave when the next best thing comes along.

I got my second revocation of a job offer today.  I am so angry and depressed right now I don't know if I will make it.  I am 37 years old, two, close to three degrees, great work history, never done drugs in my life, no criminal record and no career.

I DID EVERYTHING I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO, AND I STILL LOSE!!!!

WHAT DID I DO SO WRONG?  HAVE I BEEN TRANSPORTED TO A PARALLEL UNIVERSE WHERE EVERYTHING IS BACKWARDS?!?!?!  THIS CANNOT BE RIGHT!!  

Was I a serial killer in a past life?

I DIDN'T WANT A HANDOUT.  I WANT TO WORK!!!  I WANT A REWARDING CAREER AND I CANNOT CATCH ONE FUCKING BREAK!  YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I AM UPSET ALL THE TIME?   BECAUSE NOT ONE PROFESSIONAL GAVE ME A FUCKING CHANCE!!!

I am tired.  I have been rejected so many times, that I am slipping away.

Someone.  Please.  

Help me.
