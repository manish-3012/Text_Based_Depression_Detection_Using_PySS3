We broke up after 6 years, having really bad thoughts about killing myselfAround 3 months ago my ex-girlfriend (26F) and I (26M) broke up because due to circumstances on both our parts (I don't want to go too much in detail for anonimity) we cannot live together physically anymore (we were living together) for the next few years and she doesn't want to have a LDR despite still saying she loves me and her feelings haven't changed. She wants to try having a normal life and not a boyfriend who is xxxx km away, especially after such an intensive 6 years and living together. She said it would just break her. 

And since we broke up I'm just feeling utterly terrible. I lost my partner, lover, best friend, girlfriend. We were going to start a family together. Now it's all gone and I'm trying to put myself out there with friends and meeting new people. I'm doing social activities so that I don't stay inside. But every night when I come home alone to our old flat with furniture we picked out together long time ago and lie in our bed, I just feel the weight on my shoulders. 6 years. I love her more than anything or anyone. Now we're turning into strangers for each other. I am hurting all the time.

I don't know how much longer I can take this. I really don't know. Please help me.
