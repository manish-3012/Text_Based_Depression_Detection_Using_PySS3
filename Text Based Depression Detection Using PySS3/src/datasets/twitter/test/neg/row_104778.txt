A very big city in red and orange, very big. Some school with a ginger girl and a tree alley. I miss these places so much, even if I've never been there. It's the only thing I can think about. There's also THEM. My IMAGINARY? friendsss??? I love them so much and the thought that all of these is not real makes me want to cease from existence, they're everything I've got. I don't want other people, I want THEM. I'm having a panick attack as I'm writing this.
