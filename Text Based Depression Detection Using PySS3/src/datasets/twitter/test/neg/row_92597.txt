I wish I could kill myselfGod sometimes everything gets to be so much and just piles on top of me until Iâ€™m drowning and wish to just end the misery by killing myself. I just wanna be dead but at the same time Iâ€™m too scared to do it. Idk why but I am. Iâ€™ve thought since elementary school that one day life will get better for me. My lifeâ€™s always been pretty shit. Once one problem is gone another one soon comes. But Iâ€™m at the point now where Iâ€™m just like maybe it wonâ€™t get better Iâ€™m 20 and it hasnâ€™t gotten any better yet. I just wish I had the guts to kill myself.
