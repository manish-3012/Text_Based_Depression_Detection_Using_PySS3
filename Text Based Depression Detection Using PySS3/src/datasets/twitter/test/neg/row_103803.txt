a locked note in my phone.i cant fucking do this anymore

my mind is left in bits and pieces. my heart is simply just pumping blood to my body. i have nothing and nobody. i never had anybody or anything. i canâ€™t sustain myself any longer. the more time i spend by myself, the more i feel myself slip into depression. and i want to fucking kill myself. i hate my life. i hate everything thats happened to me thus far. i can go one week without feeling suicidal. five fucking years of torture and pain and i cant fucking do it anymore. im so tired. iM SO TIRED AND I DONT WANT TO DO THIS. PLEASE SOMEONE SAVE ME PLEASE. I NEED HELP AND I CANT DO THIS I CANT DO THIS. IM ALONE EVERY DAY. IVE NEVER HAD SUSTAINED HAPPINESS. I TRY SO HARD TO BE A GOOD PERSON BUT I KEEP FEELING THIS AND I CANT. 

i cant do it anymore. 
im so tired of being
left
and now
im alone. 

they never try and work things out with me

they always leave


and who am i to blame them
for leaving
the shittiest
human being
on the planet. 


i wish someone would shoot me already. 
i was put on this earth to die. 
that is my only purpose

and i 
think its my time
to fulfill it.
