My friend is going through something serious and itâ€™s affecting meone of my friends is suicidal and recently heâ€™s been making posts that have been scaring me. he constantly posts about how nobodyâ€™s ever there for him and nobody thinks about him, but heâ€™s all i ever think about. heâ€™s always on my mind and iâ€™ve told him that and iâ€™ve been there for him time and time again. heâ€™s not very good at communicating. we havenâ€™t talked in a few days. heâ€™s shutting down again and iâ€™ve been giving him space because i feel like he needs time to recuperate. during this time heâ€™s been posting here and on other subs about how he feels like he is a waste and I just need him to know that he is cared about.

if you see this, know i love you and if there was some way to fix you i will, i just need some help.

and for anyone else struggling with self worth or feeling like nobodyâ€™s out there for you, there is. there are always people on your side. they may just be in my position now: worried and with no idea how to help.
