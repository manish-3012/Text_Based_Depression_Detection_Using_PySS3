Save me Romeo        Itâ€™s getting worse, it keeps getting worse, why? Why? Why? My parents found out Iâ€™m still trans ( pre-transition), and they found out Iâ€™m still gay. Iâ€™m 14 and Iâ€™m living in jordan, I hate my life. I had a big fight with my therapist at conversion therapy and my mother is going to switch me to a new therapist. Everyone tells me Iâ€™m going to regret transitioning but I get angry at the thought of staying a male. My (former) therapist last offered me to tell my parents to let me transition, last afternoon I told him I accept his offer and he didnâ€™t comply and we ended up fighting and I keep arguing with my parents. I hate my life, if only My unrequited love was bi ( and not straight) and reciprocated my feelings, we would be together and I would have left conversion therapy long ago and no one would know and I would have the patience to wait till Iâ€™m 18 to transition (more info on my heartbreak in my last post). Today has been one of the worst days of my life, for the past 6 weeks I have been at my lowest: heartbroken, unaccepted, lonely , friendless , numb and dangerously depressed. I want to kill myself but I fucked up in my last 11 suicide attempts since August 2017. I also cut myself today, now my wrists are  filled with plasters. Iâ€™m not crazy, am I? I have been suicidal since 2015,  since then I have went from â€œI will be happy and I will save myselfâ€ to â€œSave me Romeoâ€. I really wish Romeo will come to save me soon. There is no way out, I hate myself. Iâ€™m sorry. Someone answer me please.
