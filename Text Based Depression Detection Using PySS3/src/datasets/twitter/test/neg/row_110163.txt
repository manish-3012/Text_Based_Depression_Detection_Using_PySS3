I failed at killing myself yesterdayI swallowed a bunch of morphine pills and cut a lot. I felt guilty and called my mental health specialist who called an ambulance.

My ex broke up with me yesterday morning. It was awful. I was and still am in love with him. He simply didnâ€™t care enough for me. Iâ€™m sick of people always putting me through pain and not giving a shit about me.

Anyway, todayâ€™s my birthday. I just felt like ranting. All my pills have been taking away so no more attempt.
