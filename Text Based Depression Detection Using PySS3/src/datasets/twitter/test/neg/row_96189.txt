Giving myself a few weeksAs the title says, I'm giving a few weeks. I'm home for spring break from college this week. I can't do anything. But after my first week back, if nothing starts going up, I'm going to jump off the side of the parking garage. I'll make sure I go head first. I just can't stand how much of a burden I am on people. I keep ruining people's lives. I just need to stop. Sure it will hurt for those close to me for what, a week? Then everything will be normal... heck better than normal, because I'll be gone. No more money or time wasted. No more annoying people by being around them. No more anything. But I'm giving it a few weeks.
