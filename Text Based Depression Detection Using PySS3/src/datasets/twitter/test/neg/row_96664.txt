It keeps getting worseI have been depressed for longer than I can remember.  Overall, during the day it can be enough to distract me but when night hits... god.. its unbelievable.  I think I am getting worse and worse.  This year started off normally like any other one but as it progresses I swear to god it feels like death is inevitable. 

My mind doesn't ever want to stop telling me of everything that's wrong with me.  The voice in my head does make a hell of a valid point though: what does even make me worth it?  What am I contributing? I am slowly losing all my friends because I can't handle it anymore, so not that.  I am just slowly moving through college with a 3.0 GPA barely, so it's surely not my academics.  My family is really the only reason I am alive, but I wish they hated me so I could just end it.

I'm pushing the one girl that cares about me out of my life, I don't really know why.  And any other girls I meet are interested in me for a few months and get bored and move on to someone else.  No one knows who I really am inside.  I am positive no one knows I feel like this, and that all I really feel now is numbness. Yet, I can't reach out for help from anyone.  I can never put myself out like that.. there is something left in me that doesn't want to scare or hurt the people I love.

I pray that one of these days I will just be walking to class and get hit by a bus.  I am too cowardly to end it on my own.. I could never do that to my family.  Please anyone out there.. just kill me.
