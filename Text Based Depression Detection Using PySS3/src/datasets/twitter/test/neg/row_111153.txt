What counts as "suicidal thoughts"?Lately I've been thinking (emphasis on just thinking) about suicide more and more. I think more often about what would happen if I actually did it. I've never been suicidal or attempted suicide and I doubt I even have the balls to do it anyways. However, I'm scared that if one or more major things go wrong in my life I'll take a turn for the worst. 

I've been really stressed lately:

\- Finances: My dad is my only working parent since my mom's arthritis and shoulder (due to an accident) are too bad to work any sort of job. My brother and I often have to pitch in to help with car repairs or general finances. I'm running low on money myself (about $2500) and have to buy a new phone and pay for school. My dad works a manual labor job and with the coming economic crisis from this fucking virus, I'm terrified that he'll lose his job. He's an immigrant and has no real employable skills and is too old (with a bad back) to go into construction or anything. We'd be completely and utterly fucked if he lost his job. 

\-  College: I hate my major but it's too late to change. I'm majoring in biology and got destroyed in first year. I wanted to switch majors because I fucking hated biology and wasn't good at it. I would have switched to history or criminology or some other social science and gotten really good marks but I didn't want to deal with my mom's shit so I just stuck with bio and doing poorly. I'd basically be graduating with my dick in my hands since I doubt I can do well enough in fourth year to get into a grad school. 

\- Self-esteem: I've been gaining a ton of weight recently. I've resumed going to the gym, but I've noticed that I've been stress eating a disgusting amount at night and I've gained like 20 pounds over the last few months. 

\- Girlfriend: I love my girlfriend and things are going great between us. However, I'm scared that if I lose her I'll sink into a funk that'll only exacerbate the stress from everything else going on. 

Should I be concerned? I don't want to talk to my parents or brother about this because my parents are difficult to talk to and I don't want to burden my younger brother with my bullshit. I have a lot of close friends but I don't know how much they can possibly help with my situation. What should I do?
