I get no pleasure out of life.Not gonna bother with a long post about my problems im dealing with. Just got dealt shit almost every hand in the game of life. Sprinkle in a few dumb decisions and voile! Severe depression, suicidal thoughts daily for years even though ive made a very real effort to "look on the bright side." Probably nothing that hasnt been on this sub plenty of times before.

So this is my first time ever really even talking to anyone about this other than my mom, and here is my main concern. WHAT DO I HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO IN LIFE, IF I DONT ENJOY ANYTHING ABOUT LIFE?

Thats right, nothing. I have no hobbies or interests that bring me joy. Nothing in life that im passionate about. I feel like im just on autopilot all the time. I go to work, come home, eat, masturbate to taboo shit that makes me feel even worse about myself, sleep, wake up repeat. Every day, never changes. Days off work are just more time to think about how much i hate life and other people.

Anti-depressants? No thanks, ive seen others go down that road before. Id rather just kill myself before spending years riding the rollercoaster of FDA approved "happiness" drugs. The only thing that use to help a bit was smoking weed. I thought maybe that was just making the problem worse so i quit a few months ago. No improvement so far.

So any advice? Whats the point of living if my consciousness will just end up in a void of nothingness anyways?
