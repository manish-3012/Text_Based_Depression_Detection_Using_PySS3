Broke up with girlfriendLong story short, I went through her phone just before Halloween last year. I found her texting another guy "I want dick." And I lost it. 

She was mortified and accused me of "fucking her to sleep so I vould snoop."

While i feel bad about it, I had reason to be suspicious and those suspicions turned out to be true.

We tried to carry on because we were heavily involved in the relationship, but it just wasn't going away. We broke up last night.

I'm a wreck, and its not just because of her. I lost everything in this relationship. My car got caught in a flood DD'ing her sister to the bar when I didnt want to do it. I lost my confidence and swager to insecurity and suspicion because she was acting suspicious. 

I'm just broken. I turn 29 in a couple weeks and I'm sick anf tired of having to restart my life. I could move on to something else but Id be starting from thr bottom again. Im just totally burnt out and want to give up.
