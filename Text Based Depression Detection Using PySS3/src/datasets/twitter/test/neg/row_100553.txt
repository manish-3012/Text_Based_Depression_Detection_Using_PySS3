I might do it tomorrowIâ€™m so tired of living an existence that I feel only happens because of other people. I donâ€™t enjoy my own existence and the only reason Iâ€™m alive is because other people want me to be. Itâ€™s been ten years since my sister killed herself and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve been able to feel like a complete person since then. My childhood was shattered and Iâ€™ve never been able to reclaim myself. It feels like everything I do is just trying to become a person again. It has become so tiring and I am so tired of putting so much effort into just getting by. Iâ€™m a gay man who grew up in a small town and has never felt accepted for who he is. Iâ€™m tired of chasing things that I feel like might bring me happiness and always ending up hurt and in the same spot I began. I try so hard to just grow as a person and yet I always end up in the same miserable spot. I am so tired of dealing with my mental illness and I just want it to be done with. My parents donâ€™t put in the effort or care that parents should and I just feel fucked from birth. I ruin everything good in my life and I donâ€™t think I deserve anymore time on this planet. This may all just be bullshit ranting and self pity but I just donâ€™t feel like I can take it any longer. Nothing ever feels okay and Iâ€™ve tried so hard to be okay
