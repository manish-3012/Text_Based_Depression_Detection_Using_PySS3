I just tried to killmyselfI just had a severe attack of depression, and I see no end to this, I have no one in my life, I made a lot of wrong choices, the thing that I like they don't get me anymore I've been crying for 10 mins and I feel patetic, I can't no longer see what wrong or whst is right, I just tried to kill myself with my own belt, but I couldn't do it, I'm afraid that I could do it again, I don't want to but I want this pain to end
