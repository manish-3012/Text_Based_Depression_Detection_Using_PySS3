Slowly preparing - maybe next Sunday gonna be my last day. I wish so, at least.I was thinking a lot for last months, tried to find motivations to live further, for some reasons. They don't seem to exist - I do not fit into modern world, nog gonna be its part, and found no ways how can I cnahge part of it to be more suitable for me (or find such more suitable parts in my extensive traveling abroad).

Death is a better choice; I have no resources to fight with all the world for what I love and appreciate.
