PillsI just took bunch of sleeping pills, anti anxiety pills, and 5 edible 10 THC edible gummies. My mom is being super annoying and lazy during this quarantine. She wonâ€™t clean her bathroom, or pick up afterwards. Note, she was $4000 in debt, I cleaned it up and she now has potential to have $35k in bank by end of year, but she refuses to me Motivated to anything on her own in her house.

I have no where else to go, for now. I may cash out my retirement to move out. (Longer story I was laid off in Feb, moved in temporarily with her. Virus hit. Stick here)

Hopefully I donâ€™t wake up tomorrow. Bye.
