(Long-term depression) I don't want to live anymore.I consider myself very lucky because my parents was able to send me to the best school in my country and I even got a chance to come to the UK for university despite my family comes from a third world country. However I felt like they did so because they want me to make returns for them, they treat me like their investment. I didn't get to choose my favorite course to stury in uni and I feel like I'm doing it for my selfish parents to keep them happy.

I had depression since high school (almost 8 years now) because my mom and dad fought over money all the times even until now. A few years ago, they decided not to live together anymore but technically they are still married. I'm on my third year in uni now and I can't even concentrate on my study because my parents have been always on cold war. They don't talk to each others anymore but if there is anything in my family going bad, my mom would call me harrassing and blaming my dad and my dad would do the same to my mom. Yet they still expect me to get good grades at Uni. I don't even know if they even care about my feeling anymore.

It's really strange that though I had depression for such a long time but I still managed to have many friends and have been always an outgoing kid. Going out to skateboard was an escape for me and it was the only thing I cared about. But now I just find it meaningless and not fun anymore. 

I have tried to seek helps from my friends but they all seemed like they either couldn't understand my situation or didn't even want to help me. They always ended up with "Everything is gonna be alright", but it actually never gets better, never will... I feel like they said that to push me away and not have to deal with my bullshit. I don't even know what to do with my life anymore. I don't even do good at uni and I'm scared that I will even dissapoint my parents even more. 

I have thought of comming suicide several times but I always ended up not being to able to do it. I don't even know if I want to commit suicide to escape all the mental pain I bear or just to revenge for what my parents did to me. Cus Perhaps they will understand what I've been through once I'm gone. I love my parents but I don't want to die because that will make them sad but at the same time I feel like my I have nothing to live for.

Goodbye.
