Coming upWell, guys. I am really considering doing it. At this very christmas. Everything in my life went to hell. College, private life, dreams, hobbies, family stuff... Everything. I've always been a good guy to everybody but i never had anything in return, always helped everybody but never heard a single and sincere "thanks". And now i am sitting there, basically frustrated at everybody and mostly at myself for being such an idiot and a goddamn bum throughout my whole life. I just don't know what else to do, guys. Would anybody kindly PM me? I would really appreciate it...
