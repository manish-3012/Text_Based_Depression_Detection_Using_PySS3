Might end it soon
Was considering texting my supervisor and asking him to let me do one on ones more often but idk if Iâ€™d wanna tell him itâ€™s cause of my anxiety. Doing bed checks is easy but I get overwhelmed with all the bright lights and talking to the few people who are there at night. Itâ€™s making me sick. And I have to go again tonight :( The job is very easy and I would consider it good for most people with social anxiety but not me. Gonna end it all soon.
