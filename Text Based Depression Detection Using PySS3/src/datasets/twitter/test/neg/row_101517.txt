I dont knowI feel like the only way out is to kms. My parents say their lives were better with out me. My extended family hates me. I dont have any friends. I try to use art, music and playing games with people to cope but my parents broke my headphones, burned my sketch book and ruined my computer that I use to game and to do school work. Now i cant finish finals for college and I'm probably  going to fail because if it and I am in to much debt to afford an apartment.
