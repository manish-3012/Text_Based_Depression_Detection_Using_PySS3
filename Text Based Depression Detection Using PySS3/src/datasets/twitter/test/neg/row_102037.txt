How do I get rid of depression?I know this sub reddit must get a lot people like me. xD

But I'm looking for a way to break free from this mental illness of mine. I don't have many reasons to be depressed. But most of them relate to my social life. People call me very awkward and spread rumours about me all the time. I used to call these people my friends but I don't have much reason to call them friends anymore.

I have a very hard time meeting new people and making friends. I know you just have to try hard to come out of your shell, but I somehow can't seem to do that.

To me, suicide is a way out. But I'd rather still live, but I have very little reason too if any. Not sure what to do.

Not looking for sympathy or anything. Just lookin for some advice. Thanks.
