hii am 14. diagnosed with depression &amp; anxiety. i self harm too &amp; my mom knows. my mother is mentally abusive and has traumatized me to the point where sometimes i get flashbacks to my suicide attempt where she was chasing after me with a belt right after i tried to kill myself screaming â€œyou wanna hurt yourself, huh?â€ i tried to close the door shut but sheâ€™s stronger then me so she opened it and i fell and she beat me and i just wanted to fucking die i hate myself i hate my life. she wonders why i push her away ????? she always says â€œsorry iâ€™ll do betterâ€ after she yells at me but she never does. a reoccurring thing is iâ€™ll tell her everything sheâ€™s been doing to me sheâ€™ll cry and say sheâ€™s sorry and then does it again. nothing works. recently iâ€™ve been failing 3 of my classes (badly) and she says sheâ€™s going to beat me so hard iâ€™ll regret failing my grade. i want to kill myself before that happens. we have a pill cabinet because my house is filled with old people. if i can find my old antidepressants iâ€™ll just overdose on those then. i donâ€™t want to live on an earth where nobody is on my side, not even my therapist. i just want to go to sleep and never wake up.
