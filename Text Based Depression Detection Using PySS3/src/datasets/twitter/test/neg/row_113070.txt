Being evicted, I donâ€™t want to do it again.Iâ€™ve fallen down many times before, figuratively. And have always gotten back up. But since the last time, Iâ€™ve always told myself, if it happens again, Iâ€™m done. That I donâ€™t want to try again. 

I was given an eviction notice today. I have reduced hours because of Covid. And my apartment has started doing late fees again and not accepting payment plans. The past couple of months I was able to use my next paycheck to pay off the remainder and no late fees. But now, even if I could pay it on X date, theyâ€™re not doing that, not only that, with the late fees itâ€™ll be more than I can pay.

Iâ€™m scared of death, Iâ€™m not going to lie, I think most people are. But Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m exhausted of trying my very hardest and just being screwed. 

I canâ€™t do it again. I canâ€™t lose my place to live again. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore.
