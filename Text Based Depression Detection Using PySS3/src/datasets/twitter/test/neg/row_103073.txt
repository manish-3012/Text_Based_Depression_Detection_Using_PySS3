Am I the only one?I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be able to come to take my own life because..1) I donâ€™t think I could actually do it 2) I feel extremely selfish 
However. I do sometimes find myself just wishing something terrible would happen and take the responsibility/blame out of my hands....it never does.
