SuicideI am a part time faculty instructor at a college.  I have spend the better part of my life trying to move day by day and push through depression, which I have had since I was a teenager, and have come to a crossroads.  I do not know if I want to continue living in this way for the rest of my life.  I have been on medication before, and it has helped, however temporarily, and am currently not on medication.  I try to exercise as much as possible, and actually really enjoy doing so, but I do not think that working out every day is enough to keep me living.  I am also an introvert, and I think that maybe this job is not really coinciding with my inner self.  At this point in my life, I have no job security (my job can go from be having four classes a semester to none the next), no pension to speak of, no health care, and it seems absurd that I spent so much money to even be able to have this job and not be able to even afford my loan payment.  I am on food-stamps, even though I work the equivalent of a full load, and really have no job security to speak of.  At this point, I really do not know how I can keep on going.  If I have to wake up everyday, force myself to interact with people when I'm depressed and fake being happy, and not know whether or not I can even afford to pay my rent the next semester, I don't think that I am made for this world.  I would expect to have some sort of job security after acquiring my graduate degree would not be too much to ask for, but alas, it is.  I'm dead inside, and I do not think I can live for 50+ more years if my life will continue to be this way.  Can anyone help?

Sincerely,
Lost
