I'm not sure when, but I'm going to kill myself as soon as I can.Hey guys and girls, sorry to waste your time with my whinny bull shit, but as the title states, I'm in a bit of a mental pickle. Okay, more like a mental shit storm. I'm sure my problems are stupid to anyone reading them, but then again, I never really expected anyone to read this anyway.
I've wasted enough of your time already, let me cut to the chase...

For the past few years Ive had a developing case of depression. I was never diagnosed, but it's pretty obvious you're depressed when you feel like killing yourself will bring a bright day to anyone unfortunate enough to have met you. As time went on shit got worse and worse. To add on to my depression I was "blessed" with a rather...unappealing...guise. Basically, I'm ugly. Like, ape ugly. With acne. This, along with my depressing attitude, has lead to a non existent love life. Now, when I say non existent, I mean wont even be my friend, let alone my SO. Believe it or not, I envy those who get friend-zoned, at least they have something to go on. I have only been romantically involved with one girl, this went on for two weeks. During this time, I was cheated on and dumped. Great boost to my confidence, right? This kind of goes hand in hand with the fact that I have no friends. This is my own damn fault, because I isolate myself because I'm afraid that no one will accept me. To be fair, every attempt I have made toward making friends have ended horribly. I can't remember the last time someone and i have ever mutually considered each other friends. Well anyway, on top of that, I'm stupid. Really, really, painfully stupid. I can hardly read, I have difficulty processing things of little difficulty, I suck the big one when it comes to anything involving numbers, and I can't memorize anything to save my life. Being surrounded by normal kids makes me feel like I have a serious mental problem. The painful part is, I don't. If I did, then at least I would have some sort of excuse for not knowing anything, but I dont have one. Besides, kids with downs syndrome are actually doing better than I am. They not only get better grades than I do, but they are placed in higher classes while I struggle for D's in the low level classes. Just to give you some perspective of my stupidity. It just wrecks me inside because the world is slowly requiring more and more from the people academically, and I will be lucky to finish high school, let alone make it into a half decent college/university. But being stupid isn't the only reason for this, I also fear moving onto college because of the costs to go. My family can't afford it at all. We're definitely impoverished, literally everyday is a struggle to avoid foreclosure. Which leads me to another reason I want to kill myself, one less mouth to feed. I'll make sure my body stays in good shape after I do it and I will write a note saying that I want my body to be donated to science. This way, my family wont have to shell out a lot for a funeral, and for once in my life, I will be good for something, despite the fact that I wont be alive to see it. It would literally be my largest accomplishment if it worked out that way. At least someone would be able to benefit from my presence. I'm going to stop now, the more I write, the more I find wrong with myself, and the more I want to go through with it.

Sorry again for wasting your time (assuming anyone read this). If it's any consolation, I wont be around much longer, so I'll get whats coming to me for wasting your time.

Edit: ....Wow, thanks guys and girls, I haven't made up my mind yet but you all have really given me something to think about... I really didn't expect all of this, but it has really helped me keep on going for a little while longer, thanks again guys!
