I donâ€™t want to be here anymore, but Iâ€™m scared of dyingHi... as the title says, I want to die, Iâ€™m just absolutely terrified of taking my own life. A lot of shitâ€™s been going on in my life, and I feel like a complete loser. My girlfriend who I loved more than anything else left me, I donâ€™t have many friends at all, I donâ€™t speak to my family (my decision, as they hurt me physically and emotionally for years), my education is going nowhere, I have nothing, and I have no one. Iâ€™m so lonely, all the time. The only time I really speak to anyone else is when I work. Iâ€™m very seriously considering ending everything in the next week or two
