Scarred by former girlfriendI'm not sure how to begin writing something like this. It all seems so much easier before you actually do it.

I'll start with this then. I have social anxiety disorder, this kinda makes life a bit difficult with it usually involving other people haha.
I was too scared and embarrassed to call the suicide hotline, so here I am, afraid that I'm going to hurt myself.

I used to think that I had everything I needed, a future, a relationship with my best friend *(side note: It's a long distance relationship)*, and enthusiasm for basically everything.
Until my best friend broke up with me, more than once. The first time she broke up with me wrecked me emotionally. I threw up, I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, and I was alone. The reason she broke up with me was because she couldn't handle being in a relationship that made her happy (a bit more on that later). So she blocked me on every messaging platform. We weren't **that** serious back then, we never even said "I love you" to each other.

So a month went by and I tried to deal with the breakup, which I wasn't doing very well. And suddenly I get this message from her. Nothing special, but it fills me with a bit of hope. Lo and behold, this message turns into us getting into a relationship again. Only this time more serious. We didn't FaceTime before because of my social anxiety, but I slowly started to make an exception. We felt comfortable, everything was going great. We talked about everything, and we both supported each other.

The reason she broke up with me because of that is because of her issues. She has some family issues that messed with her psychological and emotional development, which means that the 'best' way for her to deal with things in her eyes is to push everything away.

I started to get used to her 'breaking up' with me all the time, she apologized after her episodes, and we moved on. But only after she blocked me a million times. I think the way she did it and kept saying "goodbye" scarred me for life.

We started saying "I love you" too each other. It was the best feeling I've ever felt, looking into her beautiful eyes (even if it's through FaceTime) and telling her that I love her (and of course her saying it back). Plans were made, dates were set. The long distance part hurt, but it was all going to be okay. A plane ticket costs basically nothing and when I turned 18, we would be able to live together.

This was of course all ruined by my now former drug addict friend. He's still a drug addict.

He kept fueling my now ex about how bad I am and how she should break up with me. This of course were the drugs talking, but she didn't know that and thought "he actually knows him so it much be true". This combined with her issues didn't end well for us. She trashed me, called me every bad word in and out of the dictionary, and pretended that everything was okay while wreaking havoc on everything around her. So she broke up with me, blocked me, and immediately moved in with some loser. But only after pretending to say I love you to manipulate me into saying something to her.

This was half a year ago. My former friend has since then apologized for his behavior (after denying everything) before returning back to his drugs.

My dad tells me that she will eventually realize that she's unhappy with the loser she moved in with and go back to me. 99% of the things he says are true. I can't live without her. Everything I do feels useless without her and I miss her so much. Sometimes she still texts me to say that she's depressed, asking for help, saying that she misses me. She also tells me to fuck off after that.

The pain only increases the more time goes by. My dad keeps saying that everything will be okay and that I just have to wait for her, but it's been half a year. I'm going crazy here.

There was also something about being semi-engaged to her, but I honestly don't know where to put that now.

We met in 2015 and I instantly thought she was cool. I don't know what to do without her.

That's about 1/3 of it. Phew, venting kinda made me feel a little better.
If you've read this post. Thank you for your time, it really means a lot. I didn't expect to write this much. Also, I probably need a better title.

Edit: Apparently I can't change the title. I'm such a noob lol.
