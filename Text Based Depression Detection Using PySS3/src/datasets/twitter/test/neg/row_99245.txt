Everyone hates meOkay...I give my mom hints by talking down about myself (I'm an idiot, what if I died; what would my family do if I died) and always talk about ways to kill myself. I nearly confessed that I hated myself for everything. But everytime I try to tell someone about; two things are stopping me. One: The fact that I am an introverted person (Kinda a tsundere) and I can't open up to people I know very well. Two: MY MOM WON'T LISTEN!!! She told me I can talk to her about anything....but if it is not of any importance to her, then she'd just wave me off. I tried venting to her, but then I turn and see her on the phone. It's like she doesn't care her teenager is suicidal and wants to die by killing herself. She just doesn't listen, it's like she doesn't want to hear my voice or see me again.

My siblings are like that too. But we hear each other out, and agree with what the other says. It's like someone started to listen. But a while ago, I heard all three of them (all boys) talking trash about me. One even came to my face and told me: "You should just die." Me right now: "If I am such a bugger, how about I kill myself? Would you'd be satisfied you don't have a sister to worry about anymore? Of course you would. No one listens."

I don't miss any of the good times I've had with my family. They all just had fake smiles on their faces, while I yap away like I'm a mental person. I can't crack jokes like any of them can, I can't speak to anyone like they can, I can't bring the courage to even vent to anyone.

Maybe I should kill myself so everyone can have a real smile on their face.
