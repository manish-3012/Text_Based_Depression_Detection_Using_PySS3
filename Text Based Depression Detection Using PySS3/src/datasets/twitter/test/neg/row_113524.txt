Getting tired of my suicidal friendI know that iâ€™m an asshole but itâ€™s becoming more than overwhelming. Through this fucking life all i did was taking care of others and not giving a damn about myself. i feel more stressed now especially with my suicidal friend. She tried to kill herself multiple times but was saved either by me or her family, i offered her help and company the best i could, i tried to make changes in her life and making her enjoy it but to no use, i tried to take her to a Psychiatrist but she aggressively refused .she keeps taking drugs and hanging out with fake friends who do nothing but harm her and when it hit her she twist it all and blames it on me and keep threatening to kill herself. Lately i gave her money for the Psychiatrist i forced her to see but i found out sheâ€™s not seeing him and instead spending it on drugs and cigarettes and I confronted her and she said that all i care about is the money and that iâ€™m a fake bitch. I tried for years to help her but she refuse. I also suffer from depression, anxiety,panic attacks and suicidal tendencies. I wanna leave her but i donâ€™t want her to die. Iâ€™m tired too
