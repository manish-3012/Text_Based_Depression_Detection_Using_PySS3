Iâ€™m honestly done,6th of March is when Iâ€™ll be gone.Ah, a friend suggested this subreddit and I realised my reasons are so minuscule they might as well not be reasons or even exist in the first place. 

Anyways, off I go on the longest ramble in history.  

When I was 6 I had made a promise that I would kill myself by time I was 18 and in a couple of weeks I will be, so I need to hurry up. I honestly donâ€™t know why I wanted to do that but eh; I was 6, letâ€™s hope I was joking. I thought of the cliche thing to do it on Friday the 13th in April but thatâ€™s a week to my birthday and I donâ€™t need that pressure. As for the other reasons I want to ahem kick the bucket; lately everyone has been pressuring me to hurry up and get some sort of place in a university quickly before I loose the chance. I would have 2 years before I would have to attend and besides we all know I wonâ€™t last that long. I canâ€™t remember the last time where I was happy and wasnâ€™t on medication. I can remember plenty when I was on quite a lot of medication but none naturally. Lastly, Iâ€™m just generally done. Iâ€™ll grab my box thatâ€™s full of blades, grab my pill bottle, grab the note Iâ€™ve been writing since I was 12 and honestly itâ€™s more like a book or short story because of everything Iâ€™ve put in it. And letâ€™s hope, letâ€™s hope that I donâ€™t survive. Iâ€™ve survived too many times.
