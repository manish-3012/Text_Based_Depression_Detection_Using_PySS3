16 y/o, don't see myself making it past 25I first started to notice something wasn't right with me when I was around 10, always felt really awkward in social situations, terrible with confrontation, only had a couple friends and lacked a lot of self motivation and confidence. Wrote it off as just something that I had issues with and needed to work on, but things have only been getting worse. I really, genuinely hate myself more than anything, I don't think a day has gone by where I'm not thinking about suicide. Ironic as it is, my life is probably the best it can be right now. I've got a great group of friends, I'm getting in shape, and I'm dating the girl of my dreams. I've got plenty of food and a comfy bed. I don't think I deserve any of it though. There is always something telling me that I'm inferior, that I don't deserve to be with my girlfriend, that my friends are just faking it, and that no matter what I do I will end up killing myself full of sadness and hatred. It used to be that I had moments where I felt like the depression was gone, that I was gonna be okay. But now even when I don't feel particularly bad like right now I'm thinking about death and how much I hate myself. It's a cycle at this point, one that's slightly moving downward. My normals are getting worse, and my lows even more so. I've just been playing a game with myself, waiting until I hit a low enough point that I actually work up the guts to do it. I'm so tired of everything. I've tried multiple types of pills, tried therapy, tried meditation, tried picking up some hobbies, but I'm never actually improving my mental health. Deep deep down, I don't want to die, just like everyone else. I want to live a happy life, but I'm so tired. I'm not even an adult yet but it has felt like an eternity these past couple years. I'm so tired of these voices in my head telling me I don't mean shit. I'm so tired of feeling like I'm being watched when I'm in public. I'm tired of looking myself in the mirror and wanting to rip my eyes out. I'm tired of living in this fucked up world full of people who don't care about anyone but themselves. I'm tired of waking up every day and immediately wishing I didn't. And most of all I'm tired of my emotions and those who love me holding me back. If I could make myself numb enough to forget about everyone around me I'd do it in an instant. It is the only reason I'm alive right now. I feel like I am in a prison. Built up by myself and those around me. I don't feel hope for the future. I really genuinely do feel like it's a waiting game and I will do it one day. The only reason I'm posting this is because my mental state is relatively stable and I feel the slightest bit of hope that I can find some advice to help me.
