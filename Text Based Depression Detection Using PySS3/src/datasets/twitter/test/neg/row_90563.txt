My fiancÃ© broke up with me (again)I thought we were stronger than ever. Iâ€™ve been getting help and started taking meds. Iâ€™ve been more in control of my anxiety and depression than ever before. Yesterday my fiancÃ© and I (he lives in Oregon, I live in Texas) were supposed to watch Netflix together online, but he had a bad day, and he made me feel like crap. I expressed to him how many times he did this, and then he told me he doesnâ€™t want to be with me anymore. I feel like I canâ€™t do anything right. I feel like my depression and anxiety will always push people away. Iâ€™ve been happier than ever before, but now I feel so stupid for letting him hurt me again
