I canâ€™t escape.My friends dropped me a month ago. The whole group of them. I lost my insurance and couldnâ€™t get my meds, but things with them had been seemingly normal. They all pounced when I asked for help at a really low point. Called me selfish, unhealthy and accused me of trying to guilt them during quarantine when everyone is having a hard time (aside: so do i not have permission to also have a hard time...?).

I realized they had misread the intention on part of what I wrote, so I apologized right away for poor phrasing and clarified what I meant. They never replied when I reached out the next week to talk things over, the only thing I got from one of them is â€œthis is a pattern in your relationshipsâ€.

I was â€œabandonedâ€ by a friend only once before â€” a friend/roommate in college who turned out to be narcissistic and abusive. She screamed at me, made me feel worthless, mocked me for going to therapy and meddled with my other relationships. I knew the relationship was ugly. I sought distance; she had a different idea and blocked me on all channels. 

But that she took the more aggressive action doesnâ€™t mean I did something to deserve abandonment? Iâ€™d literally reached out once a few weeks after graduation with a a generic â€˜how are you?â€™. My friends used my abandonment as justification to abandon me. A plan they made together, without ever having the humanity to say they had an issue. I canâ€™t escape. I have no friends. No mentally stable family. 

The only thing I have going for me is my job â€” really the first place Iâ€™ve been where people behave with respect and empathy. I have friends there, great mentors, itâ€™s changed my life. But Iâ€™m getting strong signs I may be laid off due to COVID. 

If that happens, what is even the point of being alive?
