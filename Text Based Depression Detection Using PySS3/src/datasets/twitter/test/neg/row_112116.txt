Dont fall in love. Its better to die alone than live with a liar.Ive been burned out enough times by lying and scheming women. Cheaters and unreliable people. Dont fall in love. Fuck them if you have to but throw them away afterwards before they do that to you. 'Soulmates' until its no longer convenient. Just live and improve yourself, disregard other people they dont matter. Nobody matters, just yourself. Be courageous and dont ever waver. Remember if youre in a relationship its only a game of who hurts who first. So fuck them, cheat if you have to. Dont fall for anyone asking for 'breaks' its just another term for a prolonged dump. Remember you dont need anyone, and if anybody tries to get with you hurt them before they hurt you.
