My friend just OD'd. I dont have her address. Help.Her boyfriend just broke up with her and she is stuck with the idea that her boyfriend is the only one worth living for. Her life sucks right now, but I dont have an address for her as she recently moved and I have no one to call that knows. What do I say to her?
