Life is not what it used to beSo, I decided to post about my problem and see if people are interested/have anything to say in the matter. I am verry depressed. It's gotten worse and worse since i started feeling it and I honestly don't see myself continuing on like this for very long. 

What makes me depressed is my whole life, who I am, what iv'e done, how friends and colleges pity me and feel sry for me. My family, my upbringing, stuff i've said, stuff i've done. Before I was oblivious to all these things but i've been made aware of all this. This has made me lose my shit. I dropped out of university, I stoped hanging out with my friends. My plan was to just deplet all my cash on food and alcohol and then commit suicide. 

When my money was almost depleted a friend linked me a jobb advertisent, I applied for it and got it. So now I have a temporary job and I get an income. I'm posting this because I seriously doubt talking with people or counseling would cure me. I don't want to take any meds becasue I h eard a lot of them that work usually make u gain a lot of weight. And I don't feel like adding more shit to be depressed about then I already have.
