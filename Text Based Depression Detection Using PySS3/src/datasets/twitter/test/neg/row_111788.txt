I don't know what I'm doing.I'm a teenager, and for some reason I feel like my life gets more shitty at every turn. My depression has just caused me pain. I feel like I'm literally catching fire from the inside out, and I think of myself as a fuck up who has only made it worse for myself. I keep asking "Do I deserve this?" I have no idea. I dont even know what I'm doing. All I know is that something is slowly eating at me and won't stop until I'm dead. I feel like I cant talk to anyone about it, so its been bottled up for so long. I really just want to quit. To lay down, cry and just slip away. I think im going insane.
