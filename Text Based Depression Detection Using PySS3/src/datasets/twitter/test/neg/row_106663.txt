I'm so tired of being a failureIf there's anything I ever do right in my life, it will be ending it. I'm done getting pushed around and told what to do and how to live. I'm done. I don't care about these people that are supposed to be my family, let them clean up and pay for the mess, they're the ones that caused it. I'll be free when I'm gone, that'll be my freedom.
