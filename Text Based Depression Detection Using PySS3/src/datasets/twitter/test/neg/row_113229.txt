What do you say in your note / what would you want to hear? [Parent/Child]There's no talking me out of it, so don't bother.  

If someone you loved killed themselves, what would you want from them before they go?  Would it be easier if they picked fights and distanced themselves from you?  Would it be easier if they told you how much they loved you, spent all the time they could stand to, and left behind a series of notes reminding that person why they mattered to you and why this isn't their fault?  

I suppose specifically - anyone who has lost a parent to suicide.

Will it be harder on her if she knows it's coming or if it just happens?  I don't want her to be sad, and I know there's no way of protecting that completely.  I've fought so hard.  I've looked for help in so many place.  I just can't anymore.  I feel guilty enough, so don't specifically go out of your way to guilt trip me.  

Please, genuine advice on what may ease her pain a little?  Do I write letters to her to be read later in life?  Would that make a special day better or just remind her of something maybe she had been lucky enough to forget?  

I know no one has the right answer...  but just for you - what would you want?  The suicide is non-negotiable... how it happens and what's left behind isn't.
