My internet friend is suicidal.My internet friend has depression, and I'm very worried about them. I want to help them, but as I said, they are over the internet, in another country. I don't know what to do, and I'm very worried about their well-being. I hope I can help them, but I've tried and tried, with no success... what should I do? I can't really access police/etc. for this, so I feel kinda stuck. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
