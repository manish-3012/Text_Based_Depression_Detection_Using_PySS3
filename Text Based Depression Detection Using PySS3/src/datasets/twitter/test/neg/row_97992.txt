I wrote my suicide note todayI'm just tired life kicking my butt.  The last two years have been really hard.  The last week has been very hard.  I have no friends, and only a couple family members. (and they wouldn't care if I was gone) 

And I feel that if I die it would make my boyfriends life easier.  I'd be one less burden in his life.

Problem is I'm what I've been calling myself "too stupid for suicide" meaning I have no idea how to do it.   I'm just tired of crying myself to sleep at night.  (When I'm able to sleep that is) and crying again when I wake up.   I'm barely eating. (Been over 24 hours) and at this point I'm barely drinking water.  I'm just giving up.

I don't know if anything I wrote will even make sense. I know it's very rambled.
