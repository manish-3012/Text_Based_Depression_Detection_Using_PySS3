Do people careI donâ€™t know if people care about me or not, and when I go to ask people I stop myself because I canâ€™t tell if they donâ€™t like me and are just going to snake me over and show the messages I sent them to people. Iâ€™m really just done with everything in life and the only thing stopping me from going through with suicide is my family, they overreact to everything so what would happen if I killed myself. My â€œfriendsâ€ all make plans about parties they and lots of other people are going to without me, in fact currently they are talking about one of their parties that theyâ€™re all going to in a group chat for my birthday that I made. And when they asked who was going to their party the host was typing I showed up in the chat and they stopped. I think he made a new chat without me as if I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on.
