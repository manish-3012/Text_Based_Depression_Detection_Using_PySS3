I'm tired of losing people i love,i can't take this anymore.Recently i lost a very deep friendship. I was friends with this person for 18 years,we grew up together,became adults together,lived together until he made a mistake and slept with a girl i was dating. I was never able to forgive him since i had an history of being cheated on and ut eventually killed our friendship. 

In dating i've always had this problem where my relationships never last longer than 3-4 months. I don't know why but the past 10 or so relationships ended that way. Most people i dated said i was good as is so i didn't need to change anything but something has to be wrong with me. 

Now,couple weeks ago my SO broke up with me,after about 3 months. And now i'm just tired of everything. 

I'm tired of losing people i love. I don't deal with loss very well,i'm losing friends and lovers all the time and i'm tired. I give everything i have at my job only to be paid the absolute minimum. I suck at what i want to be good at. I don't even want to do what i like anymore i just want to die.

I'm tired.
