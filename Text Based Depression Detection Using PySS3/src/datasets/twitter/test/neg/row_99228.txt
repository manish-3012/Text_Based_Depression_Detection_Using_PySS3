I just don't wan't to be here anymore..I recently came out to my friends and family about being a homosexual male, They are very religious and I over heard them yelling about sending me to a transitional camp for gay males. I'm so scared I never thought life would be like this just because of my sexuality. i tried to run away but they caught me, I'm gonna just end it. I don't know why im writing this i've made up my mind.
