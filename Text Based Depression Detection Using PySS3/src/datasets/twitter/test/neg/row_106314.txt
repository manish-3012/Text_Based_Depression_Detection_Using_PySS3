suicidal but can't get to hospital and too afraid to call hotlineSo, I apologize for the lack of details, but I'm just wondering what I should do in this situation. I've been feeling an increasing amount of suicidal thoughts and fear this might be it for me. I cannot call the hotline without my family overhearing me and I live too far away from the hospital (and without car) to go myself. I cannot afford an ambulance ride, even with insurance and then my family will know for sure how fucked up I feel; I don't want to worry or bother them anymore than I already do. Is there any alternative or do I just have to ride this one out? 

Thanks,
J
