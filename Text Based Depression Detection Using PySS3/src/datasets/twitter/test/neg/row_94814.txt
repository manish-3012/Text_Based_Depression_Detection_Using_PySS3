Run down on what to expect from putting urself in a psych wardHi I'm 21 and trans ftm, I wanna put myself in a psych ward bc I've been very depressed for years and I'm too depressed to seek out a therapist or do anything to change my meds.

My sister went into one a couple years ago when she tried to kill herself, but it was a child's one so obviously my experience would be different. I have state insurance so it wouldn't cost anything (I assume?) 

But I was wondering a few things. One is if they give you a cavity search, I've never been to an obgyn and wouldn't consent to any medical personal touching me like that. Second is what would they do about me being trans, would I be stuck isolated away from other people? Idk if psych wards are co-ed or not but I assume they wouldn't be when it comes to bedrooms and such.

That's about it, that and some general stuff like what they actually do and how long I'd be in there. I'm in western washington for anyone wondering.
