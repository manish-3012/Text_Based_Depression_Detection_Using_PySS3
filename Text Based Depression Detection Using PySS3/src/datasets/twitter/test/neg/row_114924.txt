tonight may be it for meDon't know what to say really, this is my first post here. I awoke from a cult 1 year ago, pretty much everyone I know is still in it including most my family. They won't talk or associate with me, I'm currently alone at a bar. I'm planning on calling a suicide hotline when I leave also for first time. When I get home I plan on letting my dog out and possibly killing myself if I cannot find reason to go on. I already have a plan. I wanna be happy and go on but don't see a point. Please help me
