I just want to fucking dieI'm so tired of always having to keep everything together. I'm tired of never having any money. I'm tired of being the rock in my relationship, when I have to hold him and tell him the voices aren't real and I have to fight back tears so he doesn't get more scared. I'm tired of putting my issues on the back burner. I'm already dead. I always feel used. I tell people everything will be okay when I can't even believe it myself. I'm tired of staring at the mold on my ceiling. I'm tired of the broken box spring leaned up against the wall. Our mattress is on the floor. He tries to make it better by saying it reminds him of his childhood. It reminds him of his Vietnamese friend's playroom. It was the traditional bedroom with the pallette on the floor. The people that he spent so much time with. The people that are the reason he can give a damn good manicure. All we do is sleep anymore. Can I go now? I'm too fucked up to be anything but a hole to anyone but him. If I failed, everything would be over. He would leave. Everyone would know. I'd be back in a cycle. Cut, attempt suicide, hospital, get fucked up. Rinse and repeat.
