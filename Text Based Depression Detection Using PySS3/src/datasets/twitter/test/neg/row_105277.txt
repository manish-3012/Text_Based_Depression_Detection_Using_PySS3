i think i have had these thought for years now, god knows when i had my back fractures i've said it aloud a few times (repost from /r/offmychest/) - this is my life... and it's not worth too muchi came to USA in 1994 from Russia, where i was born in 1983. i have been sick and disabled since i was 3 and over the years it compounded mainly due to human incompetence or indifference. i run a tiny youtube channel, and made a [commentary about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lhr35qLawsQ) because i got fed the fuck up with asshats from youtube throwing their smart ass disgusting comments around! this is what i am, and you can fuck off, sincerely, youtube user Crawlerz2468.

as far as my life goes, it's been pretty hard. i haven't been to a lot of doctors, but the ones i've been to seem to be completely lost or incompetent. my family hasn't been much help, mostly they're indifferent. over the 18 years i live in this damn house, i've gotten not a one convenience to help me in my daily life! (funny story actually, when i had that cyst cut out of me a few years ago, see video, i found a rehab contractor guy (in the hospital, not on a street, mind you) that does custom medical equipment. well we met 2 or 3 times, he "ordered" equipment, and then disappeared off the face of the earth. i think he scammed my insurance for the cost of said equipment before he disappeared.)
when i had my spinal fractures, my mother was close (physically, not mentally, or help-wise-ally), did exactly nothing, while i was laid up for over a year, then when i sit up, she went off to dental school (studying about 20+hrs every day not coming up for air) and i was stuck (w/me granny who now came from Russia too for the occasion) raising my 2 newborn siblings. one good thing came out of them having no contact w/their mother - they grew up into good people. they're 13&amp;15 but still - they show potential. i admit i was suicidal when i was laid up, and the only reason i'm still here is because i was too weak to even move, or was screaming from pain.
my father who was at work most of my waking life, hasn't done one single thing to make my life better or easier besides steal my SSI paycheck every month. but hey at least i don't have to worry about what to buy right? actually it's my understanding that SHE stole the money, he's just a yes man she got by the gonads. she is without a doubt the worst and ugliest (inside i mean, i don't give a shit about outside) people i've ever seen. she screams and lectured (grinding in with her disgusting claws) all day every day and i thank fuck every second she is out of the house. when i was recovering from my back problems, she once yelled at me: "when you will be dying in your own shit and vomit, i will not come help you". that's her to a T. actually over the years it has occurred to me multiple times that she's bipolar. well enough about the evil bitch, this is my post.
listen to the video, try to see where i'm coming from, and have a look at other stuff on there too...
