I can't do this anymoreI feel like I'm drowning. I'm 16M my end of school exams start next week. I know that I'm going to fail them. I'm so stupid I'm a failure and disappointment to my parents and it hurts so much. I want to die so badly but I'm too much of a coward to actually commit suicide. I'm pathetic. My friends never invite me anywhere and if I don't start the conversation then it never starts. Sometimes I wonder if anyone would actually notice if I were dead. The only girlfriend I've ever had was only with me because she felt sorry for me. I'm so pathetic I have really bad urges to self harm. I don't want to do this anymore
