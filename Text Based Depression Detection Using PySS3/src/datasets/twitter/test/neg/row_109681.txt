I'm not okay, but i can't say it l.okay soo i know what is wrong with me. i fake. i fake being happy.
see i don't think its okay to not be okay. i dont want anyone to know im not okay. i don't anyone to see im weak, but this  this doesn't make me stronger it makes me weaker and broken.

like for the bass few week I've been going through a breakdown and ive been in bed for more than 24 hours not being able to move. and who ever try to talk to me i put a smile and talk, I'd fake a laugh... and after all that i have to listen to their problems why? bcz im fine.

like as if a can handle one more thing
