still hereTook a tab of benzo and some good ol Jack yesterday night. It was a good night to die. Calm...still... had my notes written

Somehow a friend of mine sented something going on and warned my father who called the 112. He came to pick me up and now I'm resting with a coffee beneath his fireplace.

I wish I had died
