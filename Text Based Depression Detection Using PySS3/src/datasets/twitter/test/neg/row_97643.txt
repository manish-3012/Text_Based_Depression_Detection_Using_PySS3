Should I tell about my depression and thoughts of suicide?Iâ€™ve had them for a long time but Iâ€™m not sure if I should tell my mom. She is in a bad relationship that she wants to get out of and is trying to make money to get out of it. I feel like if I tell her it will be more problems on her plate and I donâ€™t want to bother her.
