I think suicide is the only answer.Well, I think it's the end of the road for me. Depression surely packs a punch, especially if nobody bothers tp give a shit about me. My girlfriend tried to cheat on me, but I had to cry my heart out to beg her to stay. Now that she's back, I thought things would get better. Instead, she misunderstands me half of the time, making me look like the asshole. All of my friends say that I'm a big dummy, but I love her more than myself. When I try to share what I feel, she turns the situation around. And I think she's right. I think I'm a good for nothing person. Since God is so generous, my family always blames me for all the problems that they have, evem though I'm the one busting my ass out to help them. There are no words to describe what I feel. Earlier, I told my gf that everyone in my life is only there to make me feel like shit. Again, she misunderstood me, saying how dare I say that she made me feel like shit, because she just wants me to be happy. She told me that this is the most painful thing that I said to her... I just want to die. I have no hope left.
