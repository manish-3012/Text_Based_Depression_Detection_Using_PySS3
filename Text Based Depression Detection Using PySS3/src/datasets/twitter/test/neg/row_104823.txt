Why live if all life is loss and pain?I don't know why I choose to keep living, I have lost everything that matters to me: my girlfriend, my cat, my closest friends. I don't want the only thing that brings me happiness to be money, but it is. I just want to be happy but I can't anymore. I don't have a plan but I just want my life to be over. I want a restart button or something like that. I just want it to be over.
