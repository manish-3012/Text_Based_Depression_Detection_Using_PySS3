I don't know what to do with my lifeI live with my mother and my grandma, both of them always call me useless even when I try to help them at something, I don't know many things that I should already know considering my age, I'm poor and I don't have any talent or somenthing that warranties me a future. I don't know what to do with my life. I have considered suicide many times, but I just can't do it. I am a religious person, and I have thought that If I suicide I'll go to hell, which I don't want to and that's the only reason that has prevented me from suiciding, since I don't wanna go to a nightmarish place, I just want to finally rest in peace.
