I'm stuckFor a while now I've been wanting to die. I don't want to kill myself, I just want to die. I love my family and life. I can't explain it. I just feel "done with my life". Also, if I get help, my career will be over and can't have that happen. I feel like I'm stuck here, just faking a smile and a good mood to hide it. I'm known for "always having a smile on my face" but this smile is heavy and hiding more than I can possibly explain or even understand.
