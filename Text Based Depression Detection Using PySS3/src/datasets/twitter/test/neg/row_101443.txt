How to leave without hurting anybodyIt's going to be almost one month since my ex-boyfriend dumped me. Out of the blue. I cannot blame  or fault him for this. He was unhappy. He wanted to date other women. I was not enough. The break-up honestly solidified what I suspected all along: That I am unworthy of love and kindness, and that I should stop pretending to be otherwise.

After the break-up, I lashed out and said things to my ex that made him entertain thoughts of harming himself. It was not my intention to do so, and now I feel extremely terrible about it. He told me I used my training (I'm a clinical psych grad student) to drive him over the edge. I'm a terrible person. Never did I see myself capable of doing this to another person. Not only did I hurt him, but I must have hurt his loved ones too. 

I have been entertaining thoughts about killing myself months before the break-up, but now that I have nothing to lose, it seems like the perfect opportunity. I feel my death will do everyone a favor. But my mom insists she will never get over my death. I told her it will get easier as the day goes by. Honestly, I just want to leave without making anyone feel hurt and betrayed, but they want me alive. 

Judging by my actions, I feel like I don't deserve to be alive. I am afraid I will only keep hurting people. And if I die, I will continue to hurt people. I know I should not care anymore, but I just want my mom and my sister to accept that I just want to be at peace. Or free from the emotional hell I've been in for the longest time.
