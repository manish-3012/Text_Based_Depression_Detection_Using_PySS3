Is it worth it?Hiya. My name is Mizuki, but it's not my given name... I was born a male named Kyle... about 9 months ago I came out as transgender, and got a lot of support. I used to have a massive friend group of about 30-35 people I could count on. Within a month, I was down to 3. Those people who were left were my girlfriend, and my 2 best friends. A month or so after that, one of my best friends decided to rape me, and I was down to 2... My other best friend just sort of drifted away, and the only person I could talk to was my girlfriend... She left me weeks later. I thought, "Well, I guess I don't really need them anyway! I'll just be me." And then my family members started to leave me. It started with cousins and people I didn't care about as much, but now even my own mother is avoiding me. I'm contemplating suicide... They don't want me here anyway, right? I don't see why I should have to continue to suffer. I'm going to wait a few more days, most likely until thursday or so when I get my prescriptions filled up again, but at that point I will overdose. I'm just so scared of death... I don't know what to do, or how to do it, or when or where or anything I should know. I just don't know anything.
