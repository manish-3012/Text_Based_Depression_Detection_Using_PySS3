Today I put aside my suicide plan and got some (official, medical-type) drugs instead.Mirtazapine? Never heard of it. I hope it doesn't make things worse (please let me know if it will, I haven't taken a pill yet).

The sadder I get, the more people notice that I am sad, and the more I have to keep promising them that I will try a solution (other than the obvious solution). So here I am, home from the pharmacy with a bottle of pills, trying to make sure that I don't just flush them all down my throat tonight in one sitting.
