A friend is contemplating suicide, and i think she's really serious about that (Cross post from r/depression)I have this girl who i've been talking to a daily basis since 2-3 months. I don't love her. She doesn't love me either (at least she says so), and she has a boyfriend. But somehow we have grown a mutual dependence for each other (which is pretty bad for the moment). But there is a slight difference between us: I know that i have to talk about my dark thoughts, and i talk to her about them a lot. But if i ask her about hers, she gets offended, which i totally understand, because it's her problem, and i try to respect this decision, yet somehow i still managed to make her spill her heart out. I feel a bit guilty about that.
Basically her story is this: She wants to study Japanese culture and linguistics. She went on a really hard way to improve her grades and became an excellent student. But still somehow she got overexcited on her finals and ended up coming out crying, and her finals were bad so the university rejected her apply. She couldn't move out of her bed for two weeks, even so she could go on to another university (where we met). She felt like she was disappointing everyone, and after the hard work that she put in it she also disappointed herself. She got very depressed, i don't want to go in the details, she feels like she's annoying everyone, she's afraid that her boyfriend will leave her because of the lack of motivation she showed last year, she's just completely feels like she's a complete failure, and can't take care of herself, and this is why she wants to end it. She's redoing her finals if she can improve her results, but she said if they reject her once again she won't feel like there's anything left to live for.
I tried to be as supportive as i could, and tried not to freak out (somehow i was successful at these) but it still scares me how serious she is about it. She told me how she will do it. She told me that she won't leave a note. She told me not to try to stop her. I tried to give her some positive vibes (No, not the "It gets better" cliche stuff), which i don't know if helped or not. I told her how my mom died of lung cancer and she told me "I can't believe that we met.", because hers died the same way. But this is still not enough. I didn't tell her that my mom might have had attempted a suicide (I was really young, and my brothers didn't tell me anything about her mysterious broken leg), but i don't want to end up like this again. I completely understand what she's going through. I've been there myself. But there are people who care about me and will love me no matter how many times i fuck up. And this is what i tried to make her understand,
Anyway, we agreed that we'll drop this topic until she gets the results for her application. That'll happen in the middle of July. What could i say to someone who is completely disgusted with herself? Is there something i can do?
