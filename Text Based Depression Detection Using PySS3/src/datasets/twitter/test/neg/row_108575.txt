Saving myself a way outI have recently told my family about my mental state including suicidal thoughts, but have assured them over and over that I wont do anything crazy. 
I told them I didn't know where the key to our gun safe was but I do, the ammunition isnt even locked up. I feel like I could never muster the strength to actually pull the trigger, but every day I'm reminded that I've got a sure way out if I wanted to. I do not wish that grief upon my family but why should I have to wake up miserable just *because*?
