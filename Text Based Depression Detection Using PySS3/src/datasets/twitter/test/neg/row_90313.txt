Should I feel bad about myself?Sexually active parents who are sex negative towards their children are mean hypocrites.

Five to seven days ago, I woke up and started to cry because I felt emotional pain physically in my chest between my breasts and then I felt my vaginal muscles clamp down inside of me. It hurt. I felt so awful. It was like my heart and vagina were both broken.

I still carry shame, pain, rage, and guilt from looking at the passcode to my phoneâ€™s parental code and then looking at porn (the shaming and guilt-tripping that followed from my mom made everything a million times worse.) She was mad at me about it.

I feel so enraged about just the act of intercourse. I just feel so mad that THAT is considered the only way to have sex. Men can be/are sometimes so repulsive and disgusting to me. People even say that you canâ€™t be real lovers or partners if you donâ€™t do that. And I feel horrified and dreadful and disgusted by the act in and of itself: I just feel enraged and scared and it seems so unfair to me that men want women to be â€œtightâ€ down there when I know the suffering and agony that being tight is - the pinching, stabbing, sharp pain inside of me. And I think itâ€™s so unfair and sad that people with vaginas should try to keep tense to make they donâ€™t get too relaxed so that they donâ€™t become too aroused so that their vaginas will stay tight/tense. Do any other people with vaginas feel this way?

Iâ€™ve heard that women are supposed to enjoy being tight but Iâ€™m not :( Whatâ€™s wrong with me? I feel so jealous of women who enjoy sex, please their male partners, are loved, are happy, and manage to enjoy having a tight vagina.

Even just the mechanics of the act scare me: The tightness means they have to force themselves in and it forces it open. And they like â€œresistanceâ€ I guess meaning the feeling they get when they push it open and they feel it trying to close up or push them out. And in this post: /r/sex/comments/e1mafw/what_do_women_do_after_being_ejaculated_into/

People say that it just dribbles out for the day after and I feel like that would be a reminder of the painful and the sadness and shame and guilt and rage. They also says it ruins their underwear.

The pain I felt occurred when nothing was in my vagina. It was like an aching and/or stabbing pain (primarily stabbing sensation) inside of me.

Also, my mom is a good person but she always points out every negative flaw or bad thing about me. She has yelled at me a lot lately. She always tells me that I stress her out and/or exhaust her. Iâ€™m thinking about not talking to her more than I need to. I feel like Iâ€™ve ruined her life but at the same time I feel rage towards her for making me feel bad. She has even told me that â€œYou were badâ€ referring to me looking at the passcode when I was 12 to look at porn.

My questions are:

What should I do in regards to my relationship with my mom? How do I let go of the pain and guilt and rage? How can I make my vagina tight enough and good enough? How tight does a vagina have to be to please the man? Does tight mean the width of the vagina? Do men want a vagina to squeeze and clamp down? The vagina is made of highly elastic tissue, supported by a series of mostly horizontal muscles in the pelvic floor. The length and width of the non-muscular vaginal canal varies slightly person-to-person. Are men saying that the vagina isnâ€™t stretching during or that the muscles are tense and clamped down? Or that the vagina is short and narrow? Is my extremely short, narrow, tense, tight, and painful vagina good for a partner? Also, whatâ€™s wrong with me? Why canâ€™t I enjoy what Iâ€™m supposed to enjoy? It seems like all men love tense/tight vaginas and clamping.
