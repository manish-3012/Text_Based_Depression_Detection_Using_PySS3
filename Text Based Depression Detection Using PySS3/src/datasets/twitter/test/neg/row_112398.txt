Having horrible meltdown from sexual trauma. Need helpi have severe ocd and anxiety and depression. today i hit a new low and started screaming and crying at the top of my lungs. i almost got myself committed to hospital. i need to talk to someone.

in my very early teens, i got into multiple horrible situations with older men where i had lied about my age. they acted extremely sexually with me, and made me send images i didn't want to send them, among other things. i was very hypersexual afterward, often lying about sexual fetishes to be edgy. i feel full of guilt, horror, and shame after the events. i can barely think about sex without feeling my stomach churn. 

i have ocd and i cant stop worrying about if i was secretly sexually abused as a child and thats why i acted out. i have no recollection of any sexual events. please someone tell me i am overreacting about the following... 

as a toddler i was afraid of men, but i dont think it was trauma, it was just them being loud and scary (plus, my dad was probably yelling at my mom) 

when i was a kid, i had unsupervised access to the internet, and i think i may have accessed news articles or something about rape and i would often go online on rp chats and roleplay as a rape victim character because i didn't understand the consequences and what that was and i thought it was something dramatic i could make a sad story about. i started to read graphic yaoi fanfiction, and ended up reading about sexualised noncon. i dont think this was necessarily a sign of abuse as much as me having too much access to the internet and not knowing much about what rape was and how serious it is.

i cant stop overthinking these events. i have horrified my family with my meltdown. i think one day i am genuinely going to snap and break down and do something horrible. help me
