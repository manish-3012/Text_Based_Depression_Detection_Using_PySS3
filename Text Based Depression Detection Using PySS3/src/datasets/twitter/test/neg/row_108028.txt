My friend is seeming really suicidal.Hi everyone, recently my friend has been getting more and more gloomy and depressed and its really starting to worry me. He is saying, "we all die at one point, why not now" and saying how every day is a struggle for him. We are middle school friends but since then he's moved to cali so I see him rarely. 

I told him not to do anything drastic but he said he could do whatever he wants and that theirs no point. I also told him to tell somebody else or a professional but he's still negative about it and won't listen to me.

Please somebody tell me what to do I don't want something bad to happen to my friend but I don't know what to do!
