i just need someone to talk to (18F)hello all. i am 18 and a girl. I am three months into college and well, as you can tell by the subreddit, I get suicidal. I am failing my class and if I dont get a C+ I am kicked out my major and have to basically restart. I have always felt an enormous pressure to do well academically by my parents and family in general. I just have lost all faith in myself and I have struggled with these suicidal thoughts in the past (junior year if high school) and I fear they are returning and I hate myself even more for it. I have three days until my final exam and despite me studying for five hours today for it, I am still nervous I will nit do well. I am just in a very dark place and would like to just talk to someone. I'm too afraid to talk to parents, friends or my brothers about it. Thank you and I wish you all happy holidays.
