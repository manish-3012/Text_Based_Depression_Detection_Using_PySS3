In a lifetime full of mistakes, why shouldn't I jump in front a fucking train tomorrow?Call it yet another mistake, I don't give a fuck, my life is a miserable lonely mess, only weed makes me happy and I can't get it for three months, and everything that could've made my life better I swatted away in stupidity. If I owned a gun, I'd take it and blow my brains out right now, just, fuck my life.
