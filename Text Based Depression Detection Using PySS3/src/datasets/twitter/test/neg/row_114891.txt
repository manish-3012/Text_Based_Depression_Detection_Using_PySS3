Crazy how a factory worker in 50s had a better life than a young professional does right nowBack then a 40 hour workweek could support a family. Short commute. Had a good sized house. Could retire with a full pension. Higher Education was cheap if you ever wanted to get it and become rich.

Now everyone needs degrees and both parents need to work. 60-90 commute each way. Can't afford a place to live. No pension. Working 60-80 hours a week. Educaiton is through the roof. Life is getting worse and worse as we keep working longer and harder for less and less.

And for whatever reason, no seems to see that there is a problem and somehow despite all evidence to the contrary think life is better now. And even less want to do anything about it.

I don't fucking want to live in hell. I want to die. Life is getting worse and has been since since the 70s. Why bother living?
