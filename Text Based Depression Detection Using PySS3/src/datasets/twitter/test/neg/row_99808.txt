Came up with a method that will be painless, quick, and not leave a mess for my family to find. People always recommend having a plan, because thinking about it and actually setting out to achieve it can be two very different things. Well, I just ordered the materials, and I'm still ready to do it. So, what then? I don't think I'll have second thoughts even as I'm putting all the pieces together. It's something I've wanted for a long time, and I keep running out of reasons to deny it. 

I guess I'm saying this here because I've been told all my life what I'm planning is wrong and I shouldn't be doing it, but to be honest, I've never fully believed that. I think it's the most right thing for a person to do, in fact.
