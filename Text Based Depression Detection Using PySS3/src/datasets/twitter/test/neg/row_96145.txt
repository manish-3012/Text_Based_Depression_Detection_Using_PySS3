I feel like its only a matter of timeI really want to die. I found a gun in my house that was missed in the first sweep by my parents. So I took it and some ammo and am keeping them hidden.

I already tried killing myself once by slitting my wrists, that didn't work obviously. I'm too much of a pussy to cut deep enough to hit an artery. And knowing my luck if I tried again, I'd only fuck up my tendons or nerves or something. 

That's why a gun is a much better solution. Quick, probably not painless but much less painful than cutting, and much more likely to work. Its only a .22, unfortunatly, but I know that a .22 can penitrate a deer skull from over 50 meters away and liquefy its brain. I got hollow point rounds, so that should be even better.

Now I just need to work up the courage to actually do it. I don't know if I ever will. But I know I'm taking steps to get there. Pulled the trigger on it when it was empty and at my temple. Jumped a fucking mile when the firing pin came down, lol.

I'm so sick of being alive. Life is nothing but a constant series of disappointments. Anything that's good in my life is counterbalenced by something bad. I have no hope for a happy fututre. All of the effort that I've put into trying to improve my life has culminated in nothing. Accoplishments with nothing to show for it are just words that are as empty as I feel.
