Starting fresh rather than ending it, any advice on how?Long story short, ever since I graduated college (2015) I haven't been able to find a job of any sort. It feels as if I'm blacklisted. Got good grades in school, constantly apply but never even get interviews no matter the experience level required. Basic jobs claim I'm overqualified. Always dealt with depression but was mostly able to keep it under control, but this has really exacerbated things. As I'm leaning towards ending it, I thought maybe I should just up and go, start new somewhere instead. Anybody tried/done this successfully? Any advice you can impart? I would've by now if I had the money but again...no job. The more you get pushed into a corner, the more you look for a way out no matter the cost/consequences, which scares me.
