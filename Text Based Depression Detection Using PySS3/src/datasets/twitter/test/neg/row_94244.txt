I'm doneI left my campus earlier tonight knowing I might not see it again it was kind of weird but I guess it's supposed to be like that at some point. I'm just done there's no way I'm going to keep doing this shit I'm waiting for something super shitty to happen so at least I have an excuse but why wait if my entire life is just a shitty existence
