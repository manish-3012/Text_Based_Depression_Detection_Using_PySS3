When will life stop fucking me over?If you do not physically have the means to kill yourself right there &amp; then,but are still very depressed,the Suicide Hotline will tell you that â€œsorry but I have to move onto other people,now.â€They will also do this if you do not immediately make the statement â€œYes,I feel like ending my life right nowâ€.Like if you just say that you feel like your life is worthless &amp; see no future or purpose of continuing your life......but donâ€™t directly state you are about to take a life altering action,they will dump you off their line.They donâ€™t want to talk to depressed people,only people actively standing at the curb asking them if they should step in front of a car or not.

Example: I call the hotline a while back.

Volunteer: Do you want to end your life?

I say â€œIâ€™m really depressed right now &amp; just need to talk to someone.â€

Volunteer: But are you about to kill yourself *right now*?

I say No,but Iâ€™m extremely depressed &amp; need someone to just listen to me.

Volunteer (after hearing my failures):

Wow,you sound like youâ€™ve been through a lot......

Iâ€™m sorry,but I need to move onto other people.

Here is the number for a depression hotline.

I say thank you &amp; the call ends.

When I call the depression hotline,there is an hour wait to talk to someone.

Why would anyone waste their time talking to people that sound so obviously fake (using scripts)?I mean,each &amp; every sentence from their mouths is 100% fake.They donâ€™t know anything about people that call the hotline.Everything they tell you is speculation.I understand that they must be careful in how they communicate with the depressed but I need a authentic connection.I know that they must focus on the actively suicidal but I would never ask these people why I should keep on living.This is not a conversation that can be had with an anonymous volunteer.This is why I canâ€™t help but wonder at people stopping suicides of people they donâ€™t even know.Who has the right to decide who should live &amp; who should die?Is each &amp; every life precious?I am not a religious person &amp; considering our limited resources on this Earth I would think each person would have the right to leave this existence as they choose to.If my life is miserable &amp; you stop me from ending my life,guess what........my life is still miserable.Your not going to stay &amp; help me try to change my life so that Iâ€™m not miserable anymore.Your act of selflessness is just that,an act.Your Bible tells you that every life is precious &amp; like a good little puppet you obey &amp; stop the act of suicide,not because you actually have the resources to change or improve that personâ€™s life,but because God â€œlovesâ€ me.Well,I donâ€™t believe in that plus where the hell has your God been while my life is in the toilet?Where the hell was your God when my family was evicted &amp; made homeless back when I was 19-20 &amp; we had to live in a cheap hotel for a month?If it were not for that motel,we wouldâ€™ve been homeless because there were no shelters in our area.Me &amp; my brothers were teenagers at the time so all five of us wouldâ€™ve been separated into men &amp; womenâ€™s shelters.I am 31 today.I honestly believe that the Bible is greatly responsible for strangers who donâ€™t know people wanting to save their life simply because God â€œtoldâ€ them to do it.People are selfish creatures &amp; walk by the homeless everyday while actively blocking the construction of affordable housing.

Okay,so lets say you save my pathetic life.

Guess what?

My life is still fucked.

You have done nothing to change my life.

You havenâ€™t saved the world.

You have done nothing at all.

You just forced me to continue to live this fucked up life in hell on Earth when I could be dead &amp; at peace:

No rent.

No bills.

No need to eat.

No need to do anything at all.

Nothing forcing me to live an existence I cannot see changing without a miracle.

I donâ€™t think the hotline is that helpful considering people know each &amp; every word out of their mouths is fake.

Just because someone says â€œyouâ€™ve been through so muchâ€ doesnâ€™t mean they know anything about your life.

I need someone that actually gives a damn about my life,not someone forced to listen to me through personal beliefs or societal pressure.

I know I sound selfish but the only person that really gives a damn about my happiness in life is me.

I feel pretty damn low right now.

Whereâ€™s my golden ticket in life?

So far,all Iâ€™ve gotten is getting fucked over &amp; over &amp; over &amp; over &amp; over......
