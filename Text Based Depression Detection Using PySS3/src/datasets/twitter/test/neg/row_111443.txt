Iâ€™m feeling lostI feel like everyone Iâ€™ve confided in about my depression says they care but when I feel desperate and I need help they donâ€™t even try to say anything comforting or try and help?? Itâ€™s like they donâ€™t give a shit and they just want to not look like a dick. I just hate myself so much and I donâ€™t know how to feel better. Iâ€™ve tried medications and they didnâ€™t help me, I just want to know whatâ€™s wrong with me and how to fix it and get better. Crying for hours a day is so fucking draining and I donâ€™t know how much more I can take
