Life RuinedDo to my own actions my life is over. I am serving a court supervision sentence for simple battery for 24 months. I lost my job as a pharmacist. I have 300 thousand dollars in student loans that I am going to default on. Nobody will hire me with this on my record. I lived a selfish and ungrateful life. I had everything I ever wanted or needed and I didn't even know it. I don't know what to do.
