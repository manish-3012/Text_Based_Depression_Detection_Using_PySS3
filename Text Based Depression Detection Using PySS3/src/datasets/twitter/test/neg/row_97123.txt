pls help me. i see no sense in life anymore.hey. yesterday i lost all my hope and all my sense for life. and i need someone to talk to. take a moment. i did my best to explain why i donâ€˜t see a sense in life anymore. i have a few friends but they are busy with their lifes and you know, there are things you canâ€˜t tell persons close to you. but i need to tell this someone. i have no idea how to move on. nothing maked sense anymore and i am like a robot. i donâ€˜t evem know if my existence makes sense. it feels like i could disappear and it wouldnâ€˜t change a thing. i donâ€˜t want to move on. everything hurts and i canâ€˜t think straight. i lost everything.

story: 
i had a pretty nice life. until yesterday. i had a terrible relationship with my mother, the abusive kind. my father was the only one i had and he was the best father i could imagine. but he was depressive and got sick with one of those fast cancer types. and yeah he died when i needed him the most. i moved on. after years of depression i got over it and got into a relationship which was fine but mediocre at the beginning but started to ruin my life.
so years later i met this guy i am reffering to, he is the reason i am typing this.

its the kind of story where two people have a serious relationship, have their entire future planned together and woven together. and i mean really serious. like soulmates. everything is happy, over years. everybody tells you how good you fit together and everything. we shared everything. i never ever were so happy in my life. he was so good to me and we did so much together and we shared nearly every hobby and so on. i didnâ€˜t knew what being in love and being happy meant before him. it was the happiest part of my life.
but then suddenly he quits the relationship from one hour to the other because he doesnt have feelings for me anymore. he likes me as a person and thinks we could be incredible good friends. he finds me attractive and he even said nice things to me until now. but he doesnt have the classic love feelings anymore where you think of your significant other at work and so on. but everything was fine. no problems, no other love interests. he is a very honest person and we talked a while yesterday. i think he tells the truth. honestly. i dont think he doesnâ€˜t find me attractive or has another love interest. he had a pretty big step coming for his future but i was with him. i would have done everything for him. and he knows that and he appreciates the way i am. but there is no love anymore. and he had a relationship in the past that he had for too long and should have quit sooner. so he is now thinking that he needs to quit it faster than carrying it with him. which i agree. but i dont agree with the reason he quit. i mean i did everything for him in the past and he knows that i could move mountains for him. so whatever reason he had for loosing the love for me, i think we could have rescued the relationship. i dont think that this is unchangeable. but unfortunately he doesnt see a way.
but i loved him, i didnâ€˜t loose my feelings for him. never. my entire body hurts, i cant think straight. my love for him lasted so long and i even fell more in love with him. this is not fair. i love him. i didnt have the time to quit the relationship in my head but he had. now i am sitting here. i had to move out, i am sitting in the apartement of my mother because i have nothing else. i canâ€˜t. i canâ€˜t move on. my entire life was about him. i have absolutely nothing left. how can i move on when everything on this planet reminds me of him and the future we had. i have no motivation. everything seems pointless. it seems like i am stuck in a nightmare. and everything i can think of is him.  he was there for me when i had problems so unfortunately i am more devastated because he isnâ€˜t here for me anymore. 

pls help me. any kind words will help. i have serious problems atm. im even thinking about if i need to exist but thats another story.  i wish i just could disappear and leave the pain behind. i doesnâ€˜t want to live like this. sry. itâ€˜s early in the morning here and i need to go to work. so iâ€˜ll check in later. i hope this fits here cause i seriously think about ending this but i am sorry for the people that will be sad... i donâ€˜t know.
