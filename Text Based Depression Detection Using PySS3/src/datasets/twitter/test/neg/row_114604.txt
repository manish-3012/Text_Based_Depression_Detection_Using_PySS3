My mother and this situation is honestly driving me to want to kill myself. I can't stop my mind from racing. I just want this all to endIm sitting my bed, crying. I can't do this anymore. 

I live with my mum, Im 21 in a bit. All my life, I have made my life about her. The sacrifices, whether conscious or not. Trying to reassure that she's not the bad person, that it is all okay. Moving with her wherever, not doing what I always wanted to do because it wasn't what she wanted.

She says I owe her. That I can't take that retail job that's in the next town over, where my boyfriend is. She said I am being unfair. That she's alone and. I can't leave her. She says she's scared I'll stay at this job, but I just want away. I have applied for it, she doesn't know. Before I applied I told her I want to apply, she said if I do, she won't speak to me.

I am an on call nurse, but there is no jobs going. The best I can hope for is a part time gig, but its only cause she works at the practice too and she's going away for a few months in two months back to our country. I won't have any hours for at least a month if not more. I am going insane. I just want to die. Ive stocked up on antibiotics and a lot of pain killers, all I need is the alcohol. I am so emotionally drained, all I want is for someone to hold me but for that person to be her. For her support of sorts. I am begging for it, yet all she thinks is how she is alone. She's blaming me that she's moved back here for me, and we haven't been here even 7 months and I want to move out.

All I want, is to die.
