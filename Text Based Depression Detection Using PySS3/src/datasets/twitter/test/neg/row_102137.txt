On Boredom.I have seen a lot in my 34 years. 

Been through college, had tons of sex, did a few interesting drugs, made more money than I need and have helped quite a few people through simple kindness and understanding. 

What I'm grappling with now is the fact that everything now - from waking to sleeping - is boring. 

All of it. Boring. 

Meeting new people, going new places, seeing new technology, learning new things, discovering new music, thoughts and perspectives. It's all simply boring. 

I feel like I 'get' life. I just get it. I know what it's about by now. You define success for yourself, and you work to attain it. That's what life is. But even with this, even if I were to achieve any measure of success be it inventing something incredible or changing the world positively in some way, it would all just be downright boring. 

There's nothing here for me. I feel like, in the words of Jane's Addiction: Nothing's Shocking. I don't get amped about anything, and haven't for a very long time. 

I'm just bored with life. There's zilch that captures my imagination or interest. I believe I have lived enough life that now I can end my life with a clear conscience, knowing that I've had my ride and it's time to get off. 

What argument can be presented against this? Why is suicide not a viable option for someone like me, someone who is simply bored and uninspired to even live another day, *especially* when it means living in a world fraught with violence, intolerance, hate and suffering?
