HelpI just need a place to vent. Iâ€™ve been on medication since 4 years ago and Iâ€™ve been swapping between medications because nothing seems to work. With this quarantine being set in place Iâ€™ve been confined to my house which just feels like 4 walls and a roof now, not a home. Recently Iâ€™ve been on the brink of falling off and just this last Thursday night a good friend of mine shot himself at his workplace. I canâ€™t get out to see the family, or friends of his, I donâ€™t even know if There will be an open funeral for friends. Ever since that night I havenâ€™t even closed my eyes, spoke to anyone, gotten up off my ass, went to work, nothing. Itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m angry, Iâ€™m just jealous... I want to see him again, i donâ€™t know how much longer I can resist the urge, my note is written, I have the medication, blades, and alcohol ready to go. Iâ€™m trying to fight, but I think I miss him too much...


To anyone reading this, please stay strong, stronger than I am. You are amazing, loved, and priceless.
