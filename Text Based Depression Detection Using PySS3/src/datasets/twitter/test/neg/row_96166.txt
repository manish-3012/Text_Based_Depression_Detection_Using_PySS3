I've been trying to get help for a while, but no one will help you until you're actually in crisis. Then, they'll thrown you in some facility for a few days or weeks, and then send you right back out with all of your same problems, plus some new medical debt.I'm not quite there yet, but I expect to be evicted soon. Debt and such are some of my biggest problems. Shit - as soon as they cut my internet off, I think that'll be it. It's weird how much Netflix has become my primary form of self-medication. It's as real as anything, but it sounds so dumb - it's not just a luxury - it's one of the only things that's kept me going.

And typing that, I can read the summation of my life now, "Man Commits Suicide Because He Loses Internet and Netflix." That's how cruel people are. 

Human lives are just jokes to, well, most people.

And as my family is handing a check for thousands of dollars to the funeral home director, they'll tell each other that they did everything they could, despite their refusals to help.

Fuck those people.
