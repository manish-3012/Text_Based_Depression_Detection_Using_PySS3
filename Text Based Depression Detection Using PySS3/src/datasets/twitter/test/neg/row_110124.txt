I wish I still had the gun in my roomMy dad used to keep a gun in my room in case someone broke in. A friend convinced me to ask him to take it out and I did and now it's gone. I know I shouldn't but I miss it. It gave me comfort that I had a near guaranteed way to go out in an instant if I snapped. Now my best option would be overdosing again. Last time I survived, though I didn't rake as many as I could have. Some days the only reason I survive is because it's more effort than pulling a trigger.
