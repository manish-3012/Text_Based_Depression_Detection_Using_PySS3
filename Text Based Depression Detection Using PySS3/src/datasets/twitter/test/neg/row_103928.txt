Job wants to fire me after burnoutHey everyone. I donâ€™t know where else to post this but I really need some advice and help.

A pile of shit has just been happening in my life and it really sucks to be me rn.

My cat, whoâ€™s the only thing keeping my insane, abusive family together is sick and will die soon. This is when my mental health started to go bad again. 

I had a mental breakdown because of my job, Iâ€™ve hated it since day one but had to get it because itâ€™s paying my tuition for my school year. I was away for a month with a sick leave, and when I came back they basically didnâ€™t give a single fuck and told me to work harder to keep up with everything Iâ€™d missed, be more social with the team (the team is literally 60+ years old boomers who I cannot have a conversation with and canâ€™t force myself to) or theyâ€™ll fire me in 4 weeks. I donâ€™t think I have the mental strength to keep up. 

My computer broke, so I canâ€™t even finish my work projects or keep up with school.

My whole country went back on lockdown again. Which means my computer will take longer than expected, and if I get fired, thereâ€™s very little chance I will find a new job to pay for my tuition. Iâ€™ll have to drop out. And find a job, which is barely possible atm. If I canâ€™t find a job, maybe the government can help me with money but Iâ€™m not even sure. If Iâ€™m unemployed Iâ€™ll have to move back to a shit town with my abusive parents, hence another breakdown. 

I have no idea what the fuck to do. I feel so hopeless. I donâ€™t feel like being alive anymore honestly. If my existence is resumed to going from one shit job and one breakdown to another I donâ€™t see the point. 

Please someone whoâ€™s been in this situation, give me advice or anything.
