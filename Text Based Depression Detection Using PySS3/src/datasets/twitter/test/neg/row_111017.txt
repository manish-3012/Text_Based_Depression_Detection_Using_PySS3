"Small victories"You see people talk about these with mental health all the time. I guess it works for some, breaking down a huge task of getting better into smaller, more manageable steps. But I can't relate at all? Maybe it's because I'm a chronic perfectionist and pleaser, but I don't feel accomplished when make a "tiny" step forward... which is why I usually don't even bother. And I feel like with me, I always end up using it as some sort of an excuse for why I can now go back to my unhealthy coping mechanisms for awhile (because hey, I faced a minor anxiety-inducing situation today and handled it fine, so I definitely deserve the comforting reward of binging and purging amirite?). Also, things always end with that small victory, and over time, I manage to undo it as well. Just an example: about four months ago, I came out to a friend after contemplating this for like 5 years (which is already pathetic on its own). Worst part? It just didn't feel anything. No weight lifted off my shoulders. I only briefly rode that high of a "small victory" before devolving back into my usual depressive, suicidal, closeted state of mind. Not because of my friend - she was very supportive. But I started pushing her away and regretting everything. I've been unresponsive to her attempts to talk to me about this. So naturally, she's stopped bringing it up. And now I'm back to square one - except that I'm probably going to lose my only friend as well, with my reclusive behavior. I'm sorry about this rant, but I'm lying in bed right now, overwhelmed with emotions, and I just needed to let some of that out.
