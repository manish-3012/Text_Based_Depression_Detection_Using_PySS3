I guess it says something about me that something like dental problems makes me want to kill myself.Like, so what, you've got a tooth or two rotting in your mouth and maybe gingivitis. So what, you don't have money or insurance to do anything about it. Plenty of people have had that problem, and just deal with it. 

Not me. When I imagine losing my teeth, even just one or two, the first and only thing I can think is, "Guess I'll have to kill myself when that happens."

I guess that means I'm fucked up. But honestly, life offers so little reason to *not* kill yourself at any given time, even before it starts destroying your body. I don't see how normal people can think it's worth living despite things like that.
