A two sided life and a battle I cannot winAs the title suggests I feel like my life is torn in two. The first half is a confident young computer programmer who is making a steady paycheck and is successful on the job. The other half is an incredibly lonesome person who can't seem to make a personal life that's worth anything to anyone.

Now that the intro is out of the way I don't want to give the impression that I'm ungreatful for my job and what life has given me but I know every day on the drive home I lose all drive and desire to do anything.  I'm an introvert and fairly shy by nature but I've always had close friends to count on until this last year.  About a year ago my best friends girlfriend tried to use me to get over him. I kept her at a friend and nothing more, but her action severed the trust of my friend circle to the point where the only person left to talk to was her.  Thanks to some of this im left splitting an apartment with her. But she doesn't really see me as a friend, she's flat out told me to my face that I can't be around any of her other friends because it would be too 'awkward'.

Here's where massive depression started setting in I can't help but blame myself for what happened, and I can't make a single friend no matter how hard or what avenue I try. At work I'm the youngest by 10 years and no one has time even to grab a beer at the end of a day. I tried Meetup programs but after months of attending events no one wanted to hang with me outside of the events. I've hit 3 rock bottom points where I've contemplated suicide,the first being my birthday where I never even got a phone call, and most recently I ended up spending Saturday night standing on a bridge hoping a gust of wind would knock me into the traffic below.

The only thing that kept me from jumping was the thought of how sad my parents would be which was enough to make me collapse to the road and just cry for long enough that tears wouldn't come anymore. This side of me is so lost and alone and I just want it to stop, stop the deafening silence.
