I'm ending my life on fridayI used to come to this subreddit, and /r/depression to give advice to people "in need". It was not much,  but i hate suffering, and i hate that people can feel the way i do. 

I have learned so much about myself in the past three years, and it has been great seeing the changes i have made in my life. 

In the end, these accomplishments don't overlap how i truely feel, and i am pretty sure that i won't be more satisfied with myself. 

I am simply out of options on how to treat myself. I have tried too many things to end my suffering, and so far i havent seen a single change in this sharp and constant pain. 

I'm just tired. I feel like giving in to the pain, because thats the only thing i haven't tried at this point.

I have to set myself free.
