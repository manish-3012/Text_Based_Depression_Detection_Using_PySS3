Sometimes I feel like killing myself because I miss my dad so muchMy dad died 6 and a half years ago. He died in a VERY traumatic and unexpected way, on Thanksgiving. 

My dad and I had the most special bond. Words don't do it jurstice.

Is it still supposed to hurt this bad? 

Soon it will be 7 years and I still wake up screaming for him every night, because all I have are nightmares, and all I want is him.

I have a recurring dream that he wasn't actually all the way dead when he was buried. This is not grounded in any sort of reality, after what happened, he was clearly dead. 

What's the point of life when you realize that your whole universe could be shattered so, so easily. How do you go on when you've seen the person you love more than anything in a state that you only thought existed in horror rmovies?

I feel so wronged. WHy did they take him from me? Why did life have to influct his death on me and him in such a devestatingly cruel way? If some god or universal force needed to take him from me, why couldn't they have taken him peacefully. Why on Thanksgiving?

How is that fair?
