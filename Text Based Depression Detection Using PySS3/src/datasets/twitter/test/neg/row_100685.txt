Who even knows what is going on?So, I can't say that i'm having suicidal thoughts, but i would FOR SURE say i'm having SEVERE ideation. It seems like i can't catch a break. You know, it's funny, when I was a teenager i thought it was the end of the world when a boyfriend broke up with me or some drama with a friend started. I would feel so upset and just think wow, life would be better if i were to just end it. I would harm myself, scream, cry, beg for attention, etc. It was traumatizing to say the least...

The feelings i feel now are NO WHERE like that.

I'm drowning. I won't say that my break-up had nothing to do with it, because it WAS devastating. But wow. The car payment, the car insurance, the rent, the phone, the job, etc. All of it is so overwhelming. I know it's a part of being an adult but...man idk. 

How am I supposed to balance all my bills, my dog, my job, AND try to go back to school? 

If life is seriously this bad what is even the point?

People can say things get better but i have proof that it doesn't always. i see people in their forties and they don't even have electric. 

I guess what i'm saying is I really don't see the point in living anymore. I don't know if i'd actually do anything, I don't have a plan or anything but, i can't stand thinking about this all the time.

I'm tired of picturing myself dead every few hours...

Can anyone provide any insight on how to handle these thoughts and pictures in my mind because I can hardly handle it anymore.
