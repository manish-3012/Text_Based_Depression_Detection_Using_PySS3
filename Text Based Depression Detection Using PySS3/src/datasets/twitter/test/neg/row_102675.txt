.I actually hate coming here, but I don't really have anywhere else to turn to. I felt like leaving behind something. I'm doin this more for myself, I just want to say a few things one last time. I doubt anyone I know will ever see this, but if you do stumble across this and know me even if just a little, I want you to know you're such a beautiful human being and I love you. I feel like a burden to everybody. Everyone seems to hate me and to be honest I don't blame them, I hate myself too. I spent all my money I'd left on drink, so I've been sat in my room all day with the curtains shut crying and getting drunk by myself. I haven't left my room for almost 2 days now. Ive been saving a big bottle of whiskey to down just for tonight, I don't even like whiskey, I only want to be numbed. It fucking hurts so bad, I want to drink until I don't know what's going on. I can't cope anymore. I'm also hoping it will give me courage to follow through with this. Everytime I've contimplated doing away with myself the guilt eats me up inside so bad. I always think about leaving behind the only person in this world that I truly care about and how destroyed they will be when they find out. It breaks my heart. I know some people are going to be devastated and others I'm not sure how they're going to react to be honest. But I know they they will be ok, in time. In a few years people will barley think about me. I've been thinking about this really hard fo the last 3 days now and all day I've been waiting until everyones fast asleep. I can't do this, this life, existing. Although existence can be beautiful at times, the beauty left me a long time ago. I'm hurting so deeply for so long its gotten to the point where I just can't put on a brave face anymore. I can't think of anything else to make it end I just want some relief. I feel so trapped. I have nothing that makes life feel worth living anymore. Everything I had left that I was hanging on for is gone. I am nothing but an empty shell of who I used to be. I have done so much that I regret every single day of my life and sometimes I can't even look at myself. I can't live like this. God damn this world messed up. All we care about is money and war and resources whatever will 1up our egos. Everyone should just love eachother. That's all, just love. This planet is our only home and we're all in this universe together. Nobody is getting out here alive. Whatevers on the other side we will never know. But whatever it is it can't be worse than this. Goodbye I guess, I love you all.
