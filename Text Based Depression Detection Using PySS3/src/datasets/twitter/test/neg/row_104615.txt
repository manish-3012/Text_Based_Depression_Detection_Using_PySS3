I can't handle not being able to do stuff I want to do. Being poor is the worst.I would literally do anything just to have a little extra money, eat somewhere nice, travel... If I had any knowledge in chemistry, I would be breaking bad'ing right now. Unfortunately, in addition to poor, I'm also dumb. I will end this suffering as soon as I'm confident the method I chose will 100% work. I hate myself. I hate that I can't have nice things. Fuck me.
