My suicide notes are getting progressively worseHad a couple failed attempts a while back but i just now thought about this

I used to write whole multi page essays in advance detailing my struggle and hopelessness, apologizing for leaving friends and family behind, asking them not to waste their grief on me as i'm in a better place now yadda yadda yadda you know, the usual stuff. 

But by now i wouldn't even bother anymore. I guess i have some poems in my notebook that they would eventually find when going through my stuff which would explain some shit but now i think suicide notes are kinda corny. Like, who cares? I'm dead. People die every day. No need to be melodramatic.

Now if i actually wrote one it would be two minutes before i kick the bucket and it would probably say something like "Fuck y'all, i'm out!"

Thank you for attending my ted talk
