My girlfriend left me, I'm stuck in a low paid job and I have no friendsI love her more than anything in this world, she was the only good thing in this world and I didnt value it. Now I have nothing, I'm 29, stuck at a shitty job and I lost the love of my life.

I just wish she could come back to me, but it is not possible. I'm going to end my life tomorrow morning. I just wish things could have been different. 

I love you K. I hope you never see this. And if you do it wasn't your fault, I'm a failure of a man and I deserve to die.
