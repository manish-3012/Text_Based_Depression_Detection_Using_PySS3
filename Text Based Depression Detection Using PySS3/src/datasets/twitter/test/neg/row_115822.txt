help.i feel like there is a huge hole inside of me. i have no friends except my dog and most people think im a weirdo. i just feel sad and sick inside.. my children do not like me they moved out one by one and wont even answer the phone for me...they think i am just to much to bother with.. and all i want is just to talk ..to not feel so lonely.. i feel so sad and alone..im not sure if i can go on much longer. i think of how life would be if i was dead...i am only here (alive) because i love my dog and i couldnt bare him being mistreated. but hes getting old and im getting weak.
