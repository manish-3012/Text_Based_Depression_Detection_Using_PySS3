I hate everything about myself. I wish I could just do itI've tried before but I couldn't make myself do it. I'm bad at everything. I don't want to have to deal with all of my shit. If I ever actually somehow do fix everything, then I need to learn how to live in the real world. I can't learn all of this stuff this stuff can't be fixed. I wish I could just be dead. All I do all day everyday is wake up, watch youtube, sleep, repeat. I hate it. I'm a leech on society. They actually at least do things. I'm 19 years old and I act like a fucking 5 year old. I hate myself Nothing works for me. I'm broken, I wish others would just throw me away.
