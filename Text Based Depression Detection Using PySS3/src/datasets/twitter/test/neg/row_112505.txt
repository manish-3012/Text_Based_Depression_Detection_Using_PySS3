Thinking about it becomes a daily thingI don't know.

I see everyone around me succeeding and being happy and I've been unhappy, depressed and suicidal since maybe 15? 

Everyone keeps saying it'll get better but it hasn't. Have I improved somewhat since then? Yes. But it's not enough. I'm just tired of seeing life go by and me trying so hard to feel happy again but it never works. I've transferred college to be happy, I'm not. I moved closer to my boyfriend and father to be happy, but I only feel happy when I'm with them, which isn't a lot. 

It sounds selfish but I hate how successful my boyfriend is. I am very happy for him and the strides he's making, but I feel left behind and useless. He's involved with a club pertining to his major and field of work (he gets  lot of praise and is very important), has connections and acquaintances irl, has started working out with a friend, has a job, and is going on a 2 week study abroad trip to Argentina in May. My school has maybe 5 clubs I'm not interested in because I'm at the smaller campus, I'm in a big city and all the jobs that are listed quickly look over me since I dont have a lot of experience, and all my irl friends are 30 minutes away at minimum and I don't have a car or money for constant ubers/lyfts.  

It's just becoming really hard to find reasons to stay alive. I get so angry when people tell me "It's going to be okay" or "you just have to wait" I'm tired of waiting, I'm tired of therapy and being alone. I think about ending it everyday because I feel so worthless and empty all the time. 

I don't know what to do
