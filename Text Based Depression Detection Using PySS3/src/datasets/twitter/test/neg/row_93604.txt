ELI5: Why do people say you shouldn't commit suicide because it hurts the people around you?I think it is a terrible argument. Let's say you do have people who love you. Let's say they would be hurt by your death. That, in and of itself, doesn't seem to me to be an argument against suicide if your death also helps other people. I do not take it for given that, in all cases, suicide won't help the people around them more than it hurts. It will help the people that they are burdening. It will delight the people that hate them (these may not be the people they want to help, but help is help). It will help the people who never have to experience them in the future. It helps everyone in the world to some extent because it erases their carbon footprint.

I am at a point in my life where I think my death will do more good than bad. How am I wrong?



EDIT: I guess I should explain what I mean by "it would delight the people that hate them" since a lot of people are fixating on that.

I've noticed that suicide victims often make a lot of friends post-mortem. Suddenly people that previously didn't like them and had negative impacts on their life are now their friends, and the people that were actually their friend are now all their best friends. People think it is cool to have a friend who committed suicide. It gives them a tragic aura that chicks dig or something. I'm not expecting anyone to literally jump for joy at my death, but people that do not like me will definitely use my death to forward their own goals. Of that I am sure. Honestly, I don't mind. Even if I didn't like them in life, at least I'm helping someone. And in my own example, the people who hate me are good people and very esteemed members of society. It's me who is the screw-up. I'm fully aware of that.
