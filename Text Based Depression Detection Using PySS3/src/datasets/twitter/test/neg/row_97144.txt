Iâ€™m tryingIâ€™m trying so hard to make it out. To make it out of this pit Iâ€™ve been in for so long. Hopefully I will live past 25, hopefully those letters wonâ€™t ever be found and I will be able to burn them and say â€œIâ€™ve done itâ€. Till then I shall wait for that day to arrive. Suicide might be an option but Iâ€™ll try to not make it my final decision. I believe life can actually be beautiful, if u see the beauty within the dark. Being by myself has taught me so much. Iâ€™ve grown so much. Iâ€™ve learned that you have to make yourself enough for you. You will never leave yourself. So in the end itâ€™s you and only you. I will continue to fight, I wonâ€™t give up. Not yet at least maybe some day Iâ€™ll look back at this and cry about how much Iâ€™ve grown. Thank you. -xx
