I bombed a standardized test.I feel like I did godawful on a very important test. I studied, but I'm not smart, and barely any of the material I went over was on the test. And because I'm super petty and whiny, I wish I was dead. Where do I stand on the "Batshitinsane"-ometer? Because I feel like I'm overreacting immensely.
