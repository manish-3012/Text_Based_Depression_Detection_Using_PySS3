no one really cares what happensi tried to kill myself, got hospitalized and not a single person outside my friend group noticed i was gone. my friends may have noticed, but they donâ€™t care because a week after it happened, they went back to ignoring me. i have panic attacks on a daily basis and my friends are just like, oh well, sheâ€™ll get over it but itâ€™s then more than ever that i need their support. i feel so fucking lonely and my parents found out iâ€™m bi so they arenâ€™t really there for me anymore. i have no one so it doesnâ€™t really matter what happens to me. i am constantly dissociating when iâ€™m not, iâ€™m fantasizing about death. the only reason why i havenâ€™t killed myself yet is because iâ€™m afraid iâ€™ll fail and get hospitalized again. i just want it to end. iâ€™m so fucking done.
