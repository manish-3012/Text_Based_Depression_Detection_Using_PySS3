Why am I fighting these thoughts?I don't really have anything going for me right now. I don't work, I'm not in school (I will be in January, though), I have no friends that I can hang out with in my state, I can't do anything right. So why am I still fighting to be here? Sometimes I think, more like I know I won't make it until January. I mess everything in my life up. I feel like I am nothing. I dont really know why im writing this, i just needed to let everything out. i just dont know if i want to hold on and fight anymore.
