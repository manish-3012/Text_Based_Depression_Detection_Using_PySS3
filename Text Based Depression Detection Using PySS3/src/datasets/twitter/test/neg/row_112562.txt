I canâ€™t do this anymore, and I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s gonna stop me this timeShit will never get better because I will never get better.. Iâ€™m not enough to anyone, and Iâ€™m not enough to myself, not hot enough, not smart enough, not diligent enough, not athletic enough, not smooth enough.. letâ€™s face it Iâ€™m a fucking failure and honestly the people around me are better off without me around.. Iâ€™m done, my hope, if there was any left, is gone.. college? Ur gonna fail. relationships? Ur gonna fail. Life? This rollercoaster will never fucking end unless I do it myself. Everything is bleak and damp and dark up in the prison of my mind, and itâ€™s my own fucking fault.. Iâ€˜ll be leaving soon enough.. I ruin people because I cannot stand that I can never be as good as them.. I ruin everybody and everything.. now I canâ€™t think, canâ€™t care, and soon wonâ€™t breathe.. Iâ€™m about to do something drastic and no one will ever understand or help.. I am the eternal extra in the plot of others, I have a throwaway line or two, and I donâ€™t matter and Iâ€™m not thought of at all.. Iâ€™m a joke, Iâ€™m a meme, Iâ€™m mocked and ridiculed and rightfully so.. I canâ€™t with this shit.. college was my only hope and now thatâ€™s fucking erased.. I was gonna drive away and get the fuck out of here for good, start a new life, but I got in my own damn way.. I can never be happy bc I look back on things negatively subconsciously, every remotely positive memory is always dashed.. people tell me their problems but when Iâ€™m the one venting itâ€™s like they donâ€™t have time for me, I donâ€™t matter to anyone, thatâ€™s all I ever wanted.. i have asked for help millions of times but itâ€™s like no one cares or they make it so much fucking worse.. Iâ€™ve been so lonely for so long itâ€™s like I canâ€™t bring myself to talk to anyone anymore.. imma go kill myself now, nice knowing u all
