I don't know what to write. I want to die. I don't want to wake up tomorrow. I've been.to so many doctors and tried so many medications. 

I've changed my diet, lost 100 pounds, exercise daily, nothing has helped. I'm about to be homeless and honestly, is rather die. I have no.friends, every girl I've been with has used and dumped me away. I have nothing left here. 

I dont know what to do anymore. I don't know what I want. I just want..a friend, I guess.
