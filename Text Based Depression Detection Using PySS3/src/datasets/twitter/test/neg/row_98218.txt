Is Life that cheap? Do our experiences really mean so little in the "grand scheme of things" ?

If you start accounting for all of the experiences in your own life, and when you begin to account for the experiences in the lives of those you are aware of, or who are aware of you... then you begin to realize that we all have had those same experiences, to one degree or another, and those experiences amount to nothing.
