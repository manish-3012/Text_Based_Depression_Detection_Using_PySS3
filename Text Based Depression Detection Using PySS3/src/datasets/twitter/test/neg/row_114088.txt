Bought another bottle of acetaminophenI bought a bottle of acetaminophen today. 100 extra-strength pills. Same thing I get every time.

I bought it because I just want to know the option is there, as crazy as that sounds. It brings me comfort that I could try checking out, or at the very least self-harm, using these over-the-counter meds. And yeah, I know, acute liver failure would suck, but it has a high mortality rate, so what the Hell?
