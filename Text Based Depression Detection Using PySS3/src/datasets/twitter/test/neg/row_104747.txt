I want to dieA few months ago, I overdosed on pills and was taken to a hospital... I ended up not being admitted, but a doctor tries to have me involuntarily committed, and I had to stay overnight. It was the worst feeling in the world, worse than I'd ever felt, even when I was swallowing the pills... I can't get that memory out of my head, I don't go a day without crying over it. I'm probably going to kill myself soon, with a gun or by hanging myself or maybe even illegal drugs. I just can't tell anybody because I really can't go back to the hospital. Besides, none of my friends or anyone outside of my immediate family knows I was ever at the hospital, and I won't ever tell them. What would I say when they ask me where I've been.
