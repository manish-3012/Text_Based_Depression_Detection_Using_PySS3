Here it GoesI have so much on my mind. I don't want to die, but I can't find any reason to live for much longer.

Hello everyone, my name is Andrew, and I have been beaten, abused, and left with no hope of anything getting better. I was born with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome but I was not diagnosed with it until I was 16. This disease causes me tremendous pain in my joints, often leaving me immobile, physically limiting anything I'm able to do. This leaves manual labor only a far away dream for me. 

My parents divorced when I was 9, soon after my dad was out of the picture my mother married a man who would go on to physically and emotionally abuse me until I was 14, leaving me emotionally crippled. I trust no one, expect nothing from everyone, and if at all possible, I will have no contact with you.

I struggle so much with the weight of my past and I can't even see a future for me. Seeking gainful employment has been impossible for me, seeing how the nature of my disease makes me unreliable due to constant pain and/or emergency room visits.

All of my hopes and dreams have been crushed, now all I can hope for is that there is anything worth salvaging.

tl;dr: I have an disease that physically cripples me, and an abusive past that mentally cripples me. What is the point in living a sliver of a life?
