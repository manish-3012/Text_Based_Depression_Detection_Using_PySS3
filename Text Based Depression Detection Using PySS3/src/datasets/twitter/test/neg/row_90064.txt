SoonWell this week might finally be the week I commit, my life is in shambles, everyone has abandoned me, I had my last chance for hope completely crushed the other day. I wish I could say things will get better, but after 8 years of things getting worse, Iâ€™m pretty much ready to let go. There isnâ€™t anyone here for me on this planet, whether itâ€™s friend, family, or relationship. Iâ€™ll try to stick with it, but the thought of death has brought me more comfort than anything else lately, Iâ€™m sick and tired of the pain. I donâ€™t know why I was dealt this hand, Iâ€™m sorry to everyone Iâ€™ve burdened with my existence. Iâ€™ve tried to push for change, but my efforts have never been enough, no one cares about the trauma Iâ€™ve experienced.
