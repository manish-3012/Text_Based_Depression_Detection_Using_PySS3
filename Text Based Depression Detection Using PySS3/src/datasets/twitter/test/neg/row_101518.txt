have anyone else just wanted to die for no reason?I used to often think about suicide but for actual reasons, but now sometimes i will just think "I should kill myself", I'm happy, I live a pretty good life but everyday I think about doing it, I'm a teenager so maybe is just me "acting accordantly" but I've honestly just want to stop thinking about it
