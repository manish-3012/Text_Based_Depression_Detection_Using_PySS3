Bullied cause of my past (considering suicide)Well my past is about a kidnapping and rape story so now I had to transfer schools because of this and schools almost over now which I'm so thankful for but yet I'm getting bullied and it sucks! This kid says "Nobody loves you cause you were kidnapped and raped" and he yelled it in my face in the fucking hallway now a bunch of other people now and they don't bully me but I'm really getting tired of my damn past following me and I feel like I really just needed to vent this cause it hurts... and another thing my past happened like 10 months ago so it's really pissing me off this thing is still following me around like a fucking god damn cloud.... I'm done... I have no idea how to feel happy or good. I just hate myself and I hate that I weigh 120 pounds i hate being loved and feeling unloved I hate feeling alone I hate taking all the medication I do and I hate how much I feel alone... idk anymore maybe I'm just better off dead...
