Closest I've felt..So I've been seeing a therapist for a few months and they would like me to see a psychiatrist about possible medication.  This scares me so much because I worry about losing who I am.  I think about how I would feel knowing I need a pill to feel "normal".  I just feel so lonely and just want to feel like I belong to something.  I wish I could find someone to relate with and talk to.
