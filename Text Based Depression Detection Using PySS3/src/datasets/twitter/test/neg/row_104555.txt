tried to kill myself...charger brokeidk why im typing this...idk why i made a reddit account for this. i tried to end it tonight and my charger broke. i was so close. fuck. now i just have a bruise around my neck that i cant explain. my selfish ass wishes my parents weren't a part of my life so that i could kill myself guilt free. i was born with every opportunity possible, 6ft, white, educated, everything. i just dont know. i probably wont try again for a while, at least until my parents are gone. i just wish i could die in peace

**please dont send me any phone numbers
