I don't hear voices but I might as wellI don't "hear voices" in the sense that others do, or "see things" in the same sense. But I sometimes get these overwhelming urges to do something awful, and start thinking about where things are in the house...specifically, sharp or poisonous things. Sometimes I get flashes in my mind (not before my eyes, just in my thoughts) of various methods of offing myself and what the aftermath may be. I've noticed it gets worse leading up to my time of the month (21F), but I get them periodically regardless of how close I am. I know this is a bit different from what's usually on this sub but I need help. Google isn't bringing up much other than psychosis/schizophrenia (which I know I don't have). I am a Christian as well, but highly doubt this is supernatural, since it seems connected to what my body does every month. I don't want to tell my parents, Mom especially, any more than I already have since I refuse to go back on suicide watch. (Not suicidal, just having suicidal thoughts.) Dad would just get even more stressed, my brother is distracted with a full-time internship, and my boyfriend probably wouldn't know what to do. Please...anything is appreciated. I don't want to do these things but the thoughts come anyway and I want it to stop.
