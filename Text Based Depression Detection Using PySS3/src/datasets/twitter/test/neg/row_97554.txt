The trauma was already too much. The pain was already too much. But what really killed me wasThe fact that I'll never be loved. I can't be loved. I won't be loved.

And I can't do anything about it. I can't get better no matter how hard I try.

I've had professional help for years and years, going from inpatient and outpatient treatment to all sorts of meds and therapy and even alternative therapy and nothing works. My therapist says that my chances of ever being able to move out of my country for education is doomed because of my past suicide attempts.

That shouldn't matter now anyway tho, I have a gun this time, finally.
