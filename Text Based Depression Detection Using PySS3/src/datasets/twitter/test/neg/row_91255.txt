Don't want anyone to get involved anymore with trying to help me I just want to dieMy life is a mess. I'm constantly arguing with my family . I'm likely going to get asked to leave the social group I was previously going to, which I've been going to for the last two and a half years , all because I had an anxiety attack and in the heat of the moment I felt suicidal and I tried to climb up to the windowsill because I wanted to try and jump out the window as a way of leaving this world . So now I'm probably going to have to leave for good . My mental health issues make me feel like I don't have a place in this world and definitely not in common society . I'm just a freak an outcast an annoyance . I'm sick of the never ending stream of lies my brain tells me every day, that I shouldn't have friends and they shouldn't be hanging out with me because they should be hanging out with normal , responsible people not someone like me who cuts themself every day and goes to sleep at 2am, that I'm worthless because I'm not skinny with perfect features , that everyone in the world hates me and that they think I'm a sociopath . I can't take this emotional pain any longer and it needs to end. Thinking about ending it by cutting myself so I lose enough blood to go into cardiac arrest . This corona virus situation has broken me emotionally and it makes me so sad how we 're all being expected to pull our weight and push through this situation /cope, when so many people are going to lose loved ones or experience themself or a close friend/family member struggle with their mental health/physical health , not to mention that hundreds of people will have lost their jobs and that will surely cause their mental health to suffer. It feels like we've been faced with this nightmare and just been left to struggle :(
