AloneFor the first time in my life I will be completely alone and fear for my life 

I'm moving out of my parents house ( not an option to keep living there)

Friends don't even notice when I'm not online or don't care to answer my texts

Bf basically just told me that I'm too sensitive and that he can't live with me because I'm often "on a bad mood" (depressed) 


Struggling to keep my head clear and keep the bad thoughts and suicidal thoughts out 

Just self harmed after being clean for over 3 years 

Really scared of what I might do now that I will be completely alone for the first time
