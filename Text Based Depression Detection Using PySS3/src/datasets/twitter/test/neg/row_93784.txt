Iâ€™m done. Thank baby jeebusIf youâ€™re here, thanks. Sorry for the inconvenience. If there isnâ€™t cheese at this funeral, Iâ€™m going to haunt someone.
Anyways, sorry, I guess. I did really try. Friendships bloom and die. Youâ€™ll all get better in time. Im not trying to play a victim or look for sadness. Everyone dies at some point, I just needed it to happen sooner so I can escape to the alien ship above the horizon and finally join our overlords.

Joking. 

I donâ€™t believe in anything, Iâ€™m just tired. I want to fade into the ether. I want to dissolve into a breeze. I want nothing more than to erase the stain of my life until everyone else shines as brightly as I know they can. I have nothing to give to anyone. Iâ€™d be surprised if more than 5 people attend this funeral. But, just know I did love you all. Thank you for trying. 

Thanks everyone for trying. 25 cents more and you may get a toy
