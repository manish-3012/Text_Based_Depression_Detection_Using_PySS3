Too much of a cowardI know this would be the best thing for everyone if I just killed myself, but Iâ€™m too scared. I even know exactly how I would do it- get some plastic tubing and run them from my tailpipe into my car through the window, with some duct tape to cover the rest of the open part of the window. Iâ€™d do it when I have to go  into work early, leave my boyfriend a note, and do it in an empty parking lot. Itâ€™s the most painless way possible and it would solve everyoneâ€™s problems and make everyone happy but Iâ€™m still too cowardly and selfish to actually go through with it.
