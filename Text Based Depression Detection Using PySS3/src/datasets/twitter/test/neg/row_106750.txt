I'm starting to feel done.I don't really have the energy to write everything out. I have been consistently losing since I was a teenager. I had somewhat serious plans to end it when I was a teen. I'm now 21. I have been severely depressed since July of 2017. This prompted me to seek help; but it was ineffective. I don't have any romantic or social life to speak of; and I'm wasting my time in college.

I used to think that I would never commit suicide. Each day wears me out more and more; and I feel like I'm reaching some sort of threshold. I'm still deeply uncomfortable with suicide; but I find myself thinking about it increasingly. 

I just want to not be miserable. I don't want to be gay. I don't want to be an unsuccessful, lonely, loser.

I keep thinking maybe one day, I will be happy; but things look so bleak now. I'm just disappointed with the way my life turned out.

I would ask what I can do to start enjoying life, but I feel hopeless. Suggestions are welcome anyway.
