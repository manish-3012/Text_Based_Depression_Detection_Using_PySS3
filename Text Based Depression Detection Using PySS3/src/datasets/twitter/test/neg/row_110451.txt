Should I be worried?Disclaimer: English not my first language.

So I'm usually a pretty happy person, male mid thirties. Good job, going through some stress lately, but nothing major.Lots of friends, happy family relations and so on.

I do drink quit a bit on the weekends though, and always keep some prescription pain killers and sleeping pills to soften some of the worst hangovers. Last weekend though, I got really drunk, like blackout-cant-remember-how-i-got-home-from-the-pub drunk. 

This is Friday night, and I guess I pass out at about 1ish, I really do not know. Here's the thing though. I don't wake up until saturday night, like 10. Totally freaking groggy falling around while trying to get out of bed. 

Turns out I have downed 5-7 (not sure how many actually) different pills as the bottle is empty. 

At first I freak out and wonder if anyone has been there (like I dragged someone along back to my place) and drugged me. I quickly find out that is not the case and that I have seriously taken this huge dose of prescription pills myself. 

So. I get a little worried. I'm not an expert in human psychology, but it seems to me there are two options here:

a) I just did something stupid like trying to kill the hangover before it even started and didn't think it could be dangerous to OD

b) There is actually a suicidal part of me deep down that did not want to wake up again, ever


Of course, I understand things are not so black and white, but I would be interested to hear some opinions from people with more experience in this.

Should I talk to someone about this, shrug it off? 

Obviously I know you want to say "drink less", and that's fair enough.


Thanks.
