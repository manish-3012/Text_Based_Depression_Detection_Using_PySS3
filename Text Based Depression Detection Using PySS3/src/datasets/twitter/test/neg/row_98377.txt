I don't know why I don't want to live anymore...I mean, I already know, but I  can't describe it. I've tried it before, with a psychologist. I told her that we (humans) are shitty egoists who destroys the planet without consideration. But that's not really the truth. So the statement itself might be, but that wouldn't be my reason to die. Much more likely that life doesn't make sense to me. Seriously, humans only exist to reproduce and they don't even help the planet. But actually I don't give a shit about that.
