Worried that I'll go full on Columbine in a misguided attempt to help.I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/55rqo5/a_rantish_thing_i_need_to_get_some_stuff_out_but/) post in /r/depression that might help explain some stuff.

I want to die but don't want to destroy my family and friends when I do it. I had a nightmare a while back that I was going to end up killing everybody I know so that way, there won't be anybody left to be sad when I finally waste myself. I don't know what to do, my friends won't help me anymore and I don't trust anybody to tell them this, so therapists are obviously out of the question.
