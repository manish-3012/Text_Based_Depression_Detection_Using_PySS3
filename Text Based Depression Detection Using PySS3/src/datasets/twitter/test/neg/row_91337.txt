Nobody caresI'll be dead in a week or so. We will see how things develop. I'll have to leave first so no one I know suffers because of what I'm planning to do. Flights get canceled all the time lately due to the virus.  I wish I could've died while I had it. Seemed like a good guiltless death. Now I have to do it all alone and I'm scared. But there is no other way. I can't be a burden anymore. I'm just a parasite at this point and it has to stop. There is no other way.
