Hopeless.I am in my teen years and I suffer from parental neglect, Depression and anxiety, I had a job in which I gained quite a bit for my age, just recently I was laid off, due to health and safety issues, within the establishment and so my main source of income has gone. My parents don't give a shit about me, and I've been providing for myself for some time now. So when I lost my job it hit me hard. It seems like everyone had just left me, and I don't know where to go. Bad habits started happening again, cutting, eating less, things I thought I got over. I now sit here hoping for help, and right now, there are very limited options for me right now. Suicide being one of them. I'm just hoping for some help now. If not thanks for trying.
