Please keep hurting mePlease keep hurting me again and again. Make me feel miserable until Iâ€™m numb. Please let me get to this point and give me hope just in time so youâ€™ll be able to hurt me again. Please let me have a drop of joy so I can be sad. Please let me hurt myself when you canâ€™t. Make me feel insignificant and tell me Iâ€™m not. Please make me need you and leave me by myself. Please remind me how I wonâ€™t and canâ€™t change and tell me itâ€™ll be different. Let me be this pathetic. I beg you. Please stop hurting me.
