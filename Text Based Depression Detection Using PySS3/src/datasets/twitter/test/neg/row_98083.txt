To everyone hurting today:I know it might not mean much from a random person on reddit, but I just hope you have a bearable Christmas, and believe things can change. 

Iâ€™ve been there too often, and never once believed someone when they told me that things would change, but I now know itâ€™s true. 

As impossible as it seems, life gets better, life gains meaning, and itâ€™s beautiful. 

Merry Christmas to all :)
