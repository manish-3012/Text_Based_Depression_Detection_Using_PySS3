I'm outAll the signs are here. No friends, family don't mean nothing, failed dreams, relapsed on alcohol and self harming, I don't even want to get out of my fucking bed. I have nothing. Years and years of trying and being positive only to get shut down. I understand now. I get it. I'm not going to waste anymore time being fucking miserable.
