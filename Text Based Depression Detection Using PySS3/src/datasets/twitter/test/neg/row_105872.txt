i don't know what to do anymore.I'm 16 and my life has only been getting shitter everyday. I'm a useless self loathing shit who finds pleasure in fucked up things. I have been forced to sit out iGCSE exams due to me not being able to cope with the stress, i am however allowed to take 3 exams for the subjects I enjoy and am supposingly "good" at... but i keep revising and finding out I can't even do those subjects correctly. I can't remember things and can't even bring myself to try sometimes as I look at all my friends who do everything I can't do with a breeze. I just feel like I can't and won't accomplish anything in my life.

I just block things out with video games, the internet and basketball. But as soon as I need to step up and do something I fall into this pit of despair and hope someone will help me and sympathise with me. 

Buts thats just fucking pathetic. That's just me. Pathetic.
