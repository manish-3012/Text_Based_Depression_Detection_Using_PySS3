Starting to give upSo I've been suicidal for basically since I was 13 or something. I've been living with a death wish, participating in riots, drinking since I was 13, and even doing drugs because I didn't have the courage to end it myself. Recently I've moved to a new town and tried going to college after dropping out of mrd school last year due to depression, and I've been doing okay, but today I've screwed up a calculus exam and my scholarship depends on my GPA. I'm very broke and so are my parents so I can't really afford to have a life if I lose the scholarship. I'm away from my parents and all my old friends because I'm not American qnd I came to this country recently, I've no friends or family here either. I've been crying in my closet and slashing my arms while drinking, and I don't really know what to do. I don't really know why I'm posting this, or if this is even the right place to post whatever this is but if I died I at least didn't want to feel like I died alone. I apologize to the mods and anyone who views this in advance if this isn't the place to write.
