What the fuck is wrong with the Universe that I cannot succeed?24/m living at home still. Waiting for school to start up so I can get a certificate program going.  What the fuck is wrong with the universe that I cannot succeed?

Seriously?  12 years of school plus 2 of college only to have a "mental breakdown" fuckheads called it when I realized the system cannot support everyone who gets a goddam degree with a life sustaining job so I went a different route.   Tonight shit just hit me in the face again. My family is literally LAUGHING at me tonight because I am still living at home. I'm fucking TRYING.  This is HELL ON EARTH. 

The worst part about this shit for me is I believe in God so I cannot direct my anger anywhere but him right now. For a while I was so fundamental that I blamed Satan for everything. Every sin, failure, etc from the moment of the fall in the Garden of Eden has been Satan's fault. Tonight all I can think is that God has failed completely to set up a system to support all of the humans he's created.  I believe that God has literally created every single human alive and that makes it his fucking responsibility to support us.

As it is, I cannot move out. I cannot feed myself. I'm dependent on people who are LAUGHING AT ME DAILY for not being able to do these things in a system they so eloquently maneuvered themselves.  

Tonight seems like a good night to drink until my liver fails.
