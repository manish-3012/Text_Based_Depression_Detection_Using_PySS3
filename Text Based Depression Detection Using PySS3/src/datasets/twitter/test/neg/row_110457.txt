Why do we feel this way?I've been depressed for years. some days are better than others. then out of nowhere, it hits you like a bus. I dont recognize myself when i get into these episodes. now i can barely recognize myself when i get out. i dont feel sad anymore, i feel crazy. i'm going to be depressed for the rest of my life and i never know when the day will be that i finally do it. i'm my own murderer lurking somewhere. how can people live like this
