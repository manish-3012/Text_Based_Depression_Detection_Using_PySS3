StupidI can't live without her... I don't want suggestions of how to get better. I just want to post my thoughts.

So I left her. And my uplifting energy went with her. It's probably karma.
I wish she knew I of my frequent day dream of committing suicide. I would talk to her about it, but last time we talked she cussed me out and said I deserved what I experience. It's been fours years and I still experience so much negative emotion.
I feel so worthless but I think I'm a narcissistic little punk.
While being with her I started trying to get with another girl. That didn't happen because of timing issues. I was trying to get intimate with another girl because it felt like an upgrade.
What a jerk I was. I bet I would still be a jerk if females would show interest in me.
Anyways without somebody loving me I want to kill myself. There is nothing I want to live for. There is just the thing that I don't want to die because things might get better and also my parents have done so much to try and make me feel better.

Things might get better. Fuck that. Just because I might win the lottery if I buy a ticket does not mean I will buy one.

I have OCD and depression. Also my grandfather had was a bipolar schizophrenic and I'm sure those genetics aren't doing me any favors as far as my emotional well being is concerned.

How can my happiness leave with my ex?
I don't want to hurt her by talking to her again and I also want to feel like myself again.

But I am stubborn and always seem to reject taking the path to getting better.
