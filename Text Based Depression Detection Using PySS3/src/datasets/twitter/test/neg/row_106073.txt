Wishing I could dieI've been on several different antidepressants, tried exercise, see my psychologist and psychiatrist, try to indulge in hobbies and go to work regularly yet the times of feeling semi normal are few and far between. When I do feel mentally okay, my body reminds me that I can't do normal shit. I can't even paint my nails fully without getting tired from the fibro. That's one thing that I may actually want to do for a side job and I can't even manage that. I've given up on so many dreams because of it. 

I hate my brother. His temper is short and he harbours a lot of resentment for me I've learnt recently, aside from blaming me as the only one who angers him enough to hit. My mother's mind is lost to dementia and she can't stand me much. My father doesn't do emotions well. He's barely hanging on to his sobriety. I have to work with my father and brother because in my country, regular part time work is too much for me to handle. As it is now, my depression, anxiety and fibro is crippling me to the point where I'm slacking off at the family work too and have made major mistakes this past year. 

I've always had self esteem problems also. I got a dog but regret it. She deserves someone with an actual yard (she's not a little dog ) or walk her more often. She is very shy so I can't ask neighbours and I don't have money to train her or pay people to care for her. I can't even support myself despite working. Pay is that low here. I don't know why we are obligated to be here if we are so unhappy. There are do many others who could benefit from my place,  my money and benefits. I've been starving on and off for a year now. It's the most harm I can do to myself. My appetite just goes and then I figure I don't deserve to eat. 

Fuck it. I've written too much as usual. The most depressing part is my brother has clinical depression like me since puberty and we are both suicidal. My parents also have depression, particularly my father. I sincerely wish my parents never had us. We have not left a positive imprint on this world. Hopefully since I stopped taking my meds today, I will go crazy enough to be able to off myself. I've been too afraid to try before.
