Reposting from MMBF (wall of text)Every since I was young I've lived in poverty.

As a child I would stare up at the stars through the window where I slept on an air mattress with my two other siblings and wish to be one of those kids who had food in the house and who got new toys and was allowed to have friends over. I was an awkward kid and my parents couldn't afford new clothes or braces so I was made fun of so much that the kids developed songs to sing while they chased me home and threw rocks at me.

Then as an adolescent the abuse really started to set in. My parents had always been good parents until circa 2006 when my mom went back to meth. It was a secret, obviously, I didn't know of it until a few years ago. My parents started fighting and when my dad went to bed, my mom (being all tweeked out) would stay up for hours, banging on our doors and accusing us of stealing and doing drugs.

I met a man at my Mom's work who flirted with me and made me feel beautiful despite never even being kissed. At 14, I lost my virginity to a 31 year old man. We would meet for four hours every other Saturday when I was allowed to leave the house and have sex in dirty hotel rooms. I was completely in love and willing to do anything for him. My parents found out after my cell phone bill was $300 over the normal price. I was forbidden to see him and he told me outright that he planned on returning to a wife and son I knew nothing about.

After that whole fiasco, my home life became unbearable; I was not allowed any privacy, any means to contact the outside world (except when I was at school but everyone knew about my 31 year old boyfriend and I was an outcast. When I was 15 years old, I dropped out of high school and ran away to the closest major city. I met a boy who cared for me and let me live with him. I love him desperately and he abused me physically and emotionally, cheated on me, and made me sleep in the car when he was mad because I had no where else to go.

Sometimes I'd look up at the stars from the backseat and wish that I had enough money to eat. I would get so hungry that I wouldn't be hungry and I wasted away to a very low weight. This went on until I was 18 and after catching him fucking another girl in the bathroom at a party, I left.

But we still lived together and it was easier to do that. When I found another boyfriend, I dated him in secret for a few months before my ex confronted me and said that I needed to leave for "cheating" and "going behind his back". I told him to go fuck himself because I was paying rent but he retorted that I had never paid rent. I told him I had proof and that I would go to the landlord but I learned that he had been taking my cash and saying it was his and telling my landlord that I was delinquent on my payments.

So I moved out and went to live on a friend's couch while dating the new guy. I got a retail job but could never make ends meet and my boyfriend didn't work -at all- nor made any attempt to. I had to quit my job move up to my grandmother's house to avoid living on the street and he went with me. That was great for a little bit; my dad put money down for a down payment on a car and I was working full time.

Then that boyfriend broke up with me to leave one of my so-called "friends" and my bipolar set in -hard-. I couldn't breathe, I would go through panic attacks, I tried raping my ex when he was over (although I wouldn't call it rape because he ended up on top), I tried to kill myself at least 4 times. I still have the gashes where I cut down to the bone on my thigh. My grandmother died, leaving me her house and my Dad (who was separated from my Mom) lived in the master bedroom while I had a whole room to myself.

It was alright for a bit, I was trying to work through it but things started to get... weird. I started hearing voice, seeing things, having vivid dreams that I was a fairy-tale princess who was protected by dragons and my ex bf was a silly fairy prince. I started hearing the voices of things I thought were fairies or spirits but sometimes they would be dark and tell me to hurt myself.

Then came Toby (name has been changed). Toby changed my life forever. Toby was everything you'd ever want in a man: Tall, handsome, patient, hung, stable, intelligent, funny, and as devoted to me as I was to him. He believed in my silly fairytale so much that he 'discovered' his own 'character'. We lived in my grandmother's house, my Dad loved him, and everything was perfect up until Thanksgiving. My dad moved back in with my mom and they were trying to fix it; my mom had started taking prescription pills for pain and would hand them out to my brother and I like candy. We'd been fighting a lot lately, mostly over money. I had a part time job but it only afforded me enough money to pay my car payment and cell phone bill. He had to buy food, pay rent, etc etc and though he made good money, he was fed up. I'd also ballooned out to 200 lbs from the 120 I was when he had met me. It's not like I hadn't been looking for a job, it was the end of 2008 and I wasn't aware of the world outside my own.

Near Christmas he told me that he was planning to move closer to work so that our relationship could grow and heal. I bought that hook-line and sinker and watched him grow happier and happier as he got all settled in. I wanted to be happy for him but suddenly he wasn't returning my calls and he just didn't care anymore. In January, I took a few Vicodin and felt brave enough to break up with him. So I did.

And then everything fell apart. The bipolar sent me into a hole that I had no hope of every crawling out of. I tried to kill myself several times in that empty house and my parents begged me to come home to be safe. I relinquished my ownership of my grandmother's house to my father and moved home. It was... okay... I would try half-assedly to find a job while my mom fed me pills and tried to help me back on my feet. Toby and I were kind of keeping touch and definitely still having sex.

I took a job as an exotic dancer after seeing pictures from a friend on FB of her being one and it looked so amazing. Suddenly I was losing weight and Toby was interested. He was impressed with how independent I was. It was the first time that I'd been completely financially independent and could buy whatever I wanted. I moved back into the city into my own place, eating any pill that was given to me, and clinging to Toby desperately. I needed him. We weren't together but we still had sex. He wanted his freedom to pursue other girls but when he couldn't find them, he would 'settle' for me. This went on for a year. We would text all day, I would beg to see him, try to seduce him via text, act confident and independent, and when he called my bluff I would spiral down into a panicked depression. When we were together I was never allowed to talk about my feelings -that pushed him away-, if I wanted any time with him at all, I had to fight to and then act perfect when he was around so he'd want to hang out with me again after that.

The economy started taking its toll on the clubs, I was spending most of my money trying to appear stable to Toby and buying pills but I knew I was going to lose it so I started selling my body. I lived alone so I would find men at the clubs and invite them back to my place to make some extra money. I always used protection (the times I can remember anyways) but I was sleeping with Toby AND doing all this. One guy blackmailed me into sleeping with him for free and letting him do whatever he wanted. For a month straight I lived in constant fear that Toby would find out or that this guy would report me. I let him rape me whenever he called and acted like nothing was going on around Toby. Things were nightmarish. I had been in a depressive state for well over a year; I would cry for hours, alone in my apartment, face down on the carpet and cutting all over my body. I wanted so badly to die. One day I decided I was going to end it. I looked online and purchased what I thought was cyanide. When it arrived, I told Toby and turned off my phone. To my surprise he showed up at my apartment and demanded that I go to an emergency room. I was starting to get a really bad tummy ache and I didn't want to pay for an ambulance so he drove me there. On the way I vomited all over his car and he missed his opportunity to go to Disneyland with a girl I didn't know he was seeing. He stayed me as long as he could; he watched them shove hoses down my nose and my mouth, my legs were shaking so violently and uncontrollably that I had to be physically restrained. They pumped my stomach and found that I had not been sold cyanide, that it had been something else (can't remember the name). A few hours later I was transferred to a behavioral clinic for 5150 but I talked my way out of it and was out the next day. They gave me Zoloft to start getting my bipolar taken care of and at first it actually worked! Everything felt like it was going to be okay. For my birthday Toby and I went to Vegas together. That week was amazing and I found out a few weeks after that that I was pregnant.

I was stoked. I wanted so badly to have something to keep him around and now I would have him for the rest of my life! He was so good to me, buying me food I was craving, rubbing my feet, being a sweetheart and holding me as I fell asleep... I talked for hours about the baby name and how we would raise it and assumed that he agreed but a week later he told me it wasn't a good time in his life, or mine, that I should try to get my bipolar figured out and to be more stable. He promised me that if I had an abortion that A) we would freeze his sperm and try again in a few years and B) that he would start treating me better and get back with me.

In my state, Planned Parenthood is require to show someone getting an abortion the sonogram of the baby. I started bawling when I found out it was twins. I'd always had dreams about having twin babies. I though my dreams were coming true. I cancelled the appointment and was so excited to tell him! Needless to say that he was not as excited. He convinced me that it would be really easy to have twins again with his frozen sperm so I hesitantly said goodbye to the lives growing inside me and went through with the abortion.

Toby was wonderful during the aftercare. I felt so loved. It was the last time I would ever feel that way.

An exact week later he stopped talking to me. I didn't get it. He'd moved into an apartment in my complex so I sat outside his door and cried and begged and banged until he came out. He said he was disgusted with me and that the friend who had gotten me into stripping had told him all my dirty secrets. The drugs, the prostitution, the lies. He said that he was waiting on test results from an STD check up and that he was writing me off. I hit rock bottom. God I was... Destroyed. My parents once again begged me to come home so that they could care for me and keep an eye out. I obliged, happy to have a change in scenery and told Toby I was moving.

When I was finally all moved in, starting to feel a bit better because I felt safe, I called Toby. We ended up arguing on the phone and he hung up on me, leading me to text him over and over again. I tried calling some more and finally a female picked up.

I thought I had called the wrong number but she informed me that she was his fiance and that I should really consider overdosing and just ending my pathetic life. I panicked and hung up. Then I hopped into my car and drove two hours to his apartment. On the way there he finally gave up and texted: "Fine, come on over and we'll talk." I showed up about 30 minutes later and knocked on the door. I expected to see him but instead she opened the door and started berating me. I could see him sitting on the couch with her dog in his lap, just allowing her to say hurtful things. She used every dirty little thing that Toby had told her about me, twisting the words into me while he watched and ignored my pleas. I'll never forget how it felt...

I don't remember much... but I ended up back at home with my parents in a fucking pile of tears. My mother subdued me with an assortment of pills and I slept for a few days. When I woke up, I felt an emptiness I'd never felt before. I knew that I was done. That it was time to go. While my parents were out and my little sister downstairs watching tv, I stole a bottle of tequila, all of my mom's pills and my exacto knives (My parents had hid them from me), climbed into the big, warm tub, and slashed my left wrist down to the bone. I remember pulling the tendon aside to keep cutting just in case I survived because it would have ruined my ability to use my left hand.

Apparently I passed out because when I woke up I was in the hospital, drunk as hell, and watching my wrist get stitched with 37 stitches. By law they had to 5150 me (I was on my 11th 5150 in my life) and it was there that something changed.

Someone actually listened to me. They told me it was okay to hurt, and to not be perfect, she taught me to accept myself and from that day on I wanted to succeed. When I got out of the hospital, the world seemed brighter, seemed more alive. As I healed, the medication started to really take effect and I was headed into a manic phase. For about 6 months I was on top of the world. I learned how to skateboard, started smoking weed, quit the pills AND cigarettes, got in touch with old high school friends and even got to date a boy that didn't even know I existed in high school. Everything was wonderful.

Until he broke up with me and I was spiraling down again. I told him I was pregnant even though I wasn't, I threatened to commit suicide and then felt obligated to so no one would think I was just doing it for attention. I got up to 17 5150s, ended up in jail twice for petty theft (mania makes you think you're invisible, that you can do anything), and started taking pills again. I found out that Toby had, legitimately married the new girl a a month or so previously and I secretly hated them both for it. This went on for a few months and then I started to come back up. I struggled to get stabilized but I didn't have a solid foundation to do so. In October of that year my drug addict brother stole my car and totaled it. It wasn't even paid off yet but it now sits on my credit as a charge off. He never once tried to fix it but he was not to be trusted. He'd fucked over everyone in my family multiple times.

One night after feeling particularly suicidal, I disappeared back to the city to spend the night with the ex that I had originally moved down to the city to be with. We were very much like siblings so it wasn't weird or anything. The next morning I got a text from my dad saying to never come back, that my mother had found all her pills and some jewelry and a few hundred dollars in my room. I denied it because I didn't have any of those things. My mom had set me up. To this day I have no idea why but when I got home, my room was in shambles; even my teddy bear had been pulled apart to search inside his stuffing.

I immediately called everyone I knew to get the fuck out of there. My very good friend's family invited me in but they live an hour and a half away. I decided to ditch everything, move in, and start my life again. I enrolled in community college, spent healthy time with the mom and sisters. It was like a real family but their dad had a temper and although he never EVER hit anyone, it made me really uncomfortable. They must have felt the same way because they informed me that they couldn't keep me there anymore.

Again I am panicking to find a place to live. I have no where to go. My ex got in contact with me randomly and asked if I wanted to spend the night again. I said yes and that night we talked about me living on his couch til I found a place. I was ecstatic. I moved the three boxes of my stuff I still had left over down to the city and hit the best manic phase I've ever been through. I was smoking weed a lot, expanding my mind, teaching myself ASL, skateboarding in the beautiful summer weather, and generally loving being free from emotional pain and my parents and my life.

I couldn't find a job though. I had only a skateboard to get around and a rapidly declining amount of money for public transportation and food. The money dwindled down until I had nothing. Once again I was wondering where my next meal would come from and that's scary shit. I lucked out one day and got an interview for an office job. The boss was incredibly understanding and took me in like a daughter; he bought me gifts, helped pay for things, gave me a full time job, was fulling accepting of my bipolar and never ONCE tried to come on to me. Life was going good. I got a puppy, started biking to work and getting in shape, I had a few flings here and there and while the breakups still sucked, they were slowly but surely becoming less dramatic. I still lived in poverty but it was okay because the city was beautiful and I was hitting mania straight on.

I spent a lot of time deciding who I wanted to be. I dissected who I was and altered any parts I wasn't happy with. I would find parts I didn't like and just phase them out. I liked myself. I was proud of how far I'd come, how much I'd matured, how feel I was from Toby's control over my heart. My brother asked to visit one weekend and after hearing his pathetic tale I invited him to live with me to try and put his life back together, like I had. I fed him, bought him clothes, smoked him out, didn't charge him rent and even found him a job. We were putting our family back together and making in work in a way that my parents had not done.

Last October I got back in touch with a boy I'd been in love with for many years but that had never been single until now. I thought it was meant to be -obviously because I had waited for him- but I instinctively knew that he wasn't over his ex and when he finally broke it off for that very reason, I went crazy.

October, November, December, January, February, March... 6 months or depression. I gained weight, stopped working out, could barely get out of bed... I felt useless. I hadn't had a real relationship since Toby and I was starting to believe that I would always be single but half of me wanted that. I was terrified of ever loving someone again because of Toby. I had thought that this new guy was the one. I don't know why, I just knew, I was in tune with the spiritual world around me.

But I was wrong. And that disappointment sent me straight back into a 5150. At that point I had missed so much work that my boss had to let me go in January. I didn't care about anything. I was empty. I didn't shower regularly, I didn't hang out with friends. Half way through March I set the goal to throw a birthday party to celebrate how far I'd come. My depression made it damn near impossible to to get anything done but I dropped all my saving into this party, I wanted to really celebrate and show my appreciation to all my friends.

Then suddenly I caught my brother with pills and coke. He'd been taking the money he was supposed to give me for rent and buying drugs. We had a knock-down drag out and I told him to get out. He then proceeded to tell everyone at his work that I had kicked him out for no reason. I found out that he had been using my car and acquire THREE parking tickets that were all overdue and in the hundreds. He'd been stealing cash from a private safe I had under the bed so I couldn't cover the rent that he owed me. He worked at the dispensary I bought from and convinced his boss to cut me off and cancel my membership.

Then I discovered bed bugs. I spent an entire paycheck hiring an exterminator. So much, in fact, that I couldn't afford a bed and now, again, I sleep on an air mattress.

The day of my birthday, I woke up alone, cried, baked for my big party and got high. A group of us went to set up the venue and I was SO excited. I left the rest of the stuff to people who were already dressed and ready to go and headed home to get all pretty for my birthday. Naturally it took forever but I felt beautiful. I was so happy and proud of myself. I imagined how dreamy my ball would be and when I got there....

Only the people who had helped put the party together were there.

60 people had RSVP'd and 3 of them actually showed up. I faked being happy and grateful all night because I didn't want to be rude to my guests but that night, for the first time in years, I cut.

And now we're here and I'm 15 days away from being homeless. Again. I have a car I can sleep out of but I don't qualify for unemployment since it was under the table. I am on food stamps now. I have $3 to my name and no opportunity for work. Not that it would matter. I'd work for a few months and then the bipolar would destroy me and I'd lose my job. That's just how my life works. I tried for disability but they view mania as a period of stability so it looks like I'm just sad when bad things happen and then I'm fine the rest of the time. It's an awful cycle.

I just want to be normal like everyone else. I want to be stable, to have a job that can work around my disability, to have a steady enough paycheck so that I don't have to worry about making rent. I want to go to school and do something my parents will be proud of but I'm stuck in poverty. Whenever I make any extra money I magically end up with a bill that takes it all.

I gained so much weight that none of my bras fit and they trap them painfully during the day because I can't afford to buy new ones. I've had to steal basics like deodorant, shampoo, soap, etc etc. I sleep on an air mattress with a slow leak and up until recently I was sharing a tiny bedroom with my brother. My car is falling apart; every time I turn her on I pray that the engine will start...

It gets me down that I live in poverty. I've tried so hard to grow and be a normal person but I have no control over this bipolar. I am at the mercy of my emotions and the voices of my tormentors in my head. I don't know what to do. I don't have any money to move, no hope for a stable job.

I guess if you're still reading, I'm going to kill myself. It's apparent that this life doesn't want me to succeed. I'm not meant to be here. I'm tired and have felt empty and different since Toby. Not a day goes by that I don't think about suicide and I'm tired of the consuming thoughts. I'm ready. I have no fear. I only dream of peace. What a sweet sigh of relief it will be. Just like falling asleep.
