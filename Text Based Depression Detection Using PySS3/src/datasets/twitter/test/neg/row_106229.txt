Iâ€™ve had so many moments of straight confusion, coldness, and alone throughout the large majority of my life.Iâ€™m 16. Parents split when I was 5. Both my parents blamed shit on each other. Life from the start was hard for me because I was born with known health problems. Im just living a path of long confusion. To trying multiple pills with having to take some. Iâ€™ve had a drug addiction most of my life. I just wanna go back and change where I fucked up but I just donâ€™t know. Thereâ€™s so much in my short life thatâ€™s fucked up. I wanna be a kid again. I wanna become the quiet boy who becomes something but I fucked that up wanting to be with people. I need someone to talk to thatâ€™s all...
