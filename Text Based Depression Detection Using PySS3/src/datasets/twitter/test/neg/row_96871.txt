Back here again.Just found out that my ex fiancee is sleeping around, after she tells me there was a chance. Spent three years of my life and lots and lots of money for us to be together. I give up. I can't get to her to chat, (complicated visa issues) and I'm jobless and almost penniless because of how much I spent on her. 

So, I'm going to do it. I've never been this angry or sad at the same time. 

See you guys. You've been good to me before.
