LockdownBefore all of this I was kinda hanging on in there by a thread, now as the days go on and the finish line keeps moving, i'm having a really tough time keeping positive.

I saw China who had reopened some stuff have already started shutting shit down again and that has just filled me with dread.

I could really do with some advice on ways of coping with all this when freedoms are very limited.
