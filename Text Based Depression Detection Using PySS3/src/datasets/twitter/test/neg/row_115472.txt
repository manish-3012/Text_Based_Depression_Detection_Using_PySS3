Killing yourself is a decision that shouldn't come lightly. I think that 16 years to think it over is more than enough.Actually, more than that, 16 years ago was the last time I seriously tried and my mind always comes back to it...I can't find any argument not to do it anymore, I thought not fitting anywhere and just being generally annoyed at existing was just a phase but I can see it's not, and I can't bear to live the rest of my life feeling like this, I've been on therapy, meds, you name it, I can honestly say I've tried to avoid it and it gives me some peace to know so. Anyone got any ideas for me to try before next Monday? Don't hold much hope but eh...might as wel....
