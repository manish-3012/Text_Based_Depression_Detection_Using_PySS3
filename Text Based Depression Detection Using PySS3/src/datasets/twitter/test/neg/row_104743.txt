Worried about my friend, am I helping him or just making it worse?So my friend recently broke up with his girlfriend who is also my friend, and he is really bad. He lost his virginity to her and everything. I texted him today because I felt like I shouldday something. He has been trying to OD and kill himself. I keep trying to tell him to forget about her and pretty much called her shit. (Which she's not, but it was suppose to motivate him.) saying he could do better and just to try to better his self esteem.

I told him he was a great friend and all, and that I cared about him and wanted him to stop. However, I have been unable to improve his mood. The best thing I did is when he told me he was worthless, I told him what affect he had on me and stuff, which he said thanks, it meant alot and pretty much seemed to have forgotten about me ever saying it when I texted him again later today. 

I'm worried he's going to kill himself and I don't want to lose a friend. What can I do to maybe make him feel better and was my method of talking to him about the situation good or bad?
