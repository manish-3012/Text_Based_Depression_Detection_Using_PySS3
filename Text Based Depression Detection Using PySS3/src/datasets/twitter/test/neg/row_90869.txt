I canâ€™t do this anymore.I try to keep going for my friends and family but itâ€™s just too hard. Iâ€™m so tired. I wanna sleep forever. I feel like people are insulting me and watching me. I misclassify jokes as personal attacks and then have panic attacks as a result. Iâ€™m never get angry at anyone. I only get disappointed in myself.
