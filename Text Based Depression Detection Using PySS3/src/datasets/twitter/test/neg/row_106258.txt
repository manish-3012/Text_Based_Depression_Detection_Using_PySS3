I have nothing and Noone. Im all aloneI had the opportunity to have it all. I put everything on the line and i lost it all. I feel like a loser all the time. Every one i know knows everything that happened and they all think so little of me because of it. Im a loser.

Never wanted to kill myself as much as i do right now.
