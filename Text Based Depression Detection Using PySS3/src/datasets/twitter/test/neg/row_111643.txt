I feel guiltyThis is probably going to be a bit long, and scattered. I feel like I cannot get my "deep" feelings out and don't ever talk about them with people anyway, besides Reddit apparently. I'm going to regret posting this later. 

Right now I am going to a different school far away from the one I once went to. This school is a Cambridge school but it is in the middle of no where. I am 15 so I have just come out of middle school. Middle school was truly awful but going to that Cambridge school does not make anything better. 

In middle school I was bullied a lot, shit I have been for my whole life. After coming here I wasn't expecting much but everything seems to just be another great big shit-stain. There are people there who cause drama, and even though it is petty it just makes me feel hopeless after everything. Yeah, and I get that I'm young and it is high school, maybe it is me just being a angsty teenager but I cannot help but feel hopeless. And not just hopeless in the sense that I'm a failure but in the sense that I really don't want to do anything with my life. 

To me it feels like life is not real. There is no reality but maybe it is just a dream, this is what I hope for anyway. I get detached and that is where most of my troubles begin. I made all of these dark jokes because of that detachment with my friend who I've known since preschool (now no longer with me because I moved. But also I always considered him my best friend but he had plenty of friends, I had none.) I feel guilty for these jokes but I also like them. I feel guilty for everything I have ever done. I have done some straight up embarrassing things (especially in middle school) and oh god, do those memories make me cringe. They make me want to die, literally. I think back on everything and realize it was my own demise. I feel guilty because I am privileged to even be sitting in front of a computer and breaking down while typing. Many people have had it much worse and they can actually get through things fine, I'm a selfish piece of shit.

I don't know what I want from life. I hate myself so much and I've done so many stupid fucking things. I don't think I can change my life. I am scared to get help because the last time I got help I got Baker Acted. My backpack was searched and I had drawn some troublesome things in order to cope with the bullying and school resources officers instigated me. They turned everything from me going to my school counselor for talk about suicide into, "am I going to do something really horrible to others?" I understand they were doing their job, but the way the school resource officers attitude towards me changed after seeing those drawings unnerved the shit out of me. Now this incident made my loving mom worried about what was happening at my middle school so that she is now making me go to this Cambridge school. Though I am going back next year to where I once lived and am going to the high school. Some people will know me from middle school. 

I don't know why I should stay alive. I like drawing and writing but every concept I come up for a drawing or writing is terrible and "edgy". I can't do anything right. Right now I am failing math. I don't belong at this school. 

Maybe I need a friend who can truly understand, someone I could talk to for hours and actually talk to out of school. Maybe I just need to act like a completely different person. Maybe I need advice. I don't know what could keep me alive. I don't deserve to be alive.
