I cut myself for the first time todayI'm only 19 and I can't find a single thing to be hopeful in my life. I spent the whole of this morning  cutting myself and for the first time it felt like I had control of something in my life.

I tried calling a suicide line today, but my sim card reader is broken so I can't use my phone to call/text anyone anymore (I desparetely need a new phone but cannot afford it)

I live at university with one other housemate who works full time, meaning due to COVID I am alone around 40 hours a week at least.

Only one of my parents is working and has any spare money to help put me through university. I love my mom so much but Â£25 a week is not enough to live on.

The university has denied my application for additional funding to help get me through life.

I thought I'd have a job working as a janitor for my university, but it's fallen through due to COVID

All my spare money goes on drugs because nothing else makes me happy.

I lost my wallet last night that had Â£100 in it that was meant to be used to pay my rent. Now instead of getting an xmas gift my parents are helping to cover decembers rent

I have an exam I'm supposed to have completed by midnight and I've only watched 4 of the 10 total weeks lectures cus I'm always making excuses and feeling sorry for myself.

I really want to be thankful for everything I have, because being born in the UK to two parents who love eachother means I am one of the luckiest people in the world.  I just wish I could see that and not wake up every morning wishing I was in someone elses position.
