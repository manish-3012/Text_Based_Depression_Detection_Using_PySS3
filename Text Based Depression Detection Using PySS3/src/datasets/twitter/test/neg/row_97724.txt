Itâ€™s fucking bullshit franklyItâ€™s like our bodies specifically evolved in a way to work against our minds. Our innate and instinctive desire to live combats our emotions and logic that itâ€™d be better if we just ceased existing. It really shows that we absolutely donâ€™t have full power over ourselves and the lack of free will we truly have.
