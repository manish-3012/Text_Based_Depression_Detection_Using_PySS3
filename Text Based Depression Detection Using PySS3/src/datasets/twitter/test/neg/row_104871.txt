I'm back.You know shit gets real when you are back on /r/suicidewatch.... Last time you guys made comments saying how "you are here for me" and "You are my friend, pm me and we'll talk" But you guys all know just as well as I do how much bullshit that is. You guys are here to cheer up some mental case like me and move on to the next person. Even if you do stick around it is SO different then actually being able to talk to a person and physically communicate with them. So now I find myself setting at a computer screen in some desperate attempt to get help, hoping that this time it will be different, this time you will actually help me in the long run and I will have a friend...
