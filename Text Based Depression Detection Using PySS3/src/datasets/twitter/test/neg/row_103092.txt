Iâ€™m done and on the edgeIâ€™m in my early 30â€™s with a beautiful daughter but I am a mess and my wife keeps cheating and I have just to many problems at work. Iâ€™m here to ask if there is a combo that can be taken to knock me out? I have many anti depression And anxiety pills. I have made my mind up and I want to go fast. I tried getting help and it didnâ€™t work plus I have no friends so Iâ€™m very lonely.
