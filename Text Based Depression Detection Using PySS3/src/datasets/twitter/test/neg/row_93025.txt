I had a dream about a girlI had no idea what she looked like, I just knew I woke up in my bed and she was there too, awake and looking at me with a smile. 

Her hand reached out to me, I could feel her soft fingers gently caress my left cheek. Thank god I woke up. 

I immediately proceeded to try and calm myself. I have nightmares very regularly but this is too much. This isn't funny. This will always be worse than flashbacks of the violence, the rape, school whatever. This is much worse.

I couldn't scream. I couldn't cry. I wanted to break everything around me. I just put my hands on my face and kept clawing deeper and deeper into my left cheek, exactly where I remember her touching it, until I drew blood. Thankfully face cuts heal quickly.

Why does my brain think it's funny to keep teasing me like this? I know I'll never be loved. I know no girl will ever be attracted to me. Why does my brain think to keep pushing that fact deeper and deeper when that's the one thing that makes every single living second of my being the most pain I've ever felt and I ever will feel?
