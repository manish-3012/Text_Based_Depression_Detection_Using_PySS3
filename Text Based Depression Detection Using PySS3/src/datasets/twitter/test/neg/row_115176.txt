I have no hope leftMy husband's violence slowly escalated over the course of a few months. It came to a head the night he spent a 45 minute car ride spitting on me, punching me, hitting my face, breaking my phone and telling me to do the world a favor and put a bullet in my brain. I've had serious depression and anxiety issues the past few years making it impossible for me to hold a steady job.  We are presently sill living together though not fully intimately after this incident. I got a job, and one night a few weeks later got drunk and cut myself. My bathroom was covered in blood and my ex I guess you could call him forced me into the car and to the er. I declined services, was arrested and forced into the hospital. I was evaluated and able to answer everything appropriately enough to not warrant Institutionalization. I lost my job from not being able to go to work the next day. Since then, I have no motivation or hope for my life ever getting better. This man cleaned out our bank account, and wont help me with day to day life, though us being married puts him on a lower tax bracket so his paychecks are larger. I have always been an optimist, but I just can't think positively anymore. I want the pain and fear for my worthless life to end. End rant. I guess.
