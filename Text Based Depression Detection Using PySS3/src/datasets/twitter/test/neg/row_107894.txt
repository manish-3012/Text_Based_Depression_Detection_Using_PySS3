I don't know what to do!!I'm so lonely, and depressed. I'm also introverted as hell. I want to talk to people but i'm so bad at small talk. I have no friends, and have been single my entire life (28). My sister and younger brother are currently out with their boyfriend/girlfriend, while i'm here in my room alone. 

I finished college and have a good paying job, but it seems like it pointless if i can't enjoy it with people.

I've never thought about suicide until recently. I'm almost 30 with no friends, no girlfriend and still sleeping in a twin size bed in my parents house. 

Even cousins my age tend to invite my other siblings instead of me since i don't talk much.

I feel like if i were to leave this planet, i would truly be happy. The only thing stopping me is my parents. I wouldn't want them to find my hung in my room. 

I even have a written note that indicates that for all my money be transferred to my parents
