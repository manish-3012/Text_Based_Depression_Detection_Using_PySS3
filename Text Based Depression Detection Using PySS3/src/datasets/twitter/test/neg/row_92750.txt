For the first time in my life I have set a dateThrowaway account.

At the start of April this year is when my life turned into a living nightmare. I lost the one I love and she will never return to me. I've struggled with depression in the past but when I wa  with her it faded away and she was my one escape. Now with her gone everything just feels wrong and I'm in a worse state than I've ever been.

I've set the date than I will leave this world as August 1st. If things aren't better by then, I'll be leaving. I've even written a note out which is something I haven't done for about 6 years. I'm scared and anxious but it's a better alternative than living this painful life. 

As for how ill go out, I'm considering stepping in front of a train. That should be pretty painless right? I know what you're going to say. "Don't make the innocent people on that train suffer by doing that" and for the most part I agree. I don't want my death to be as big of an inconvenience as my life currently is to others. However I'm suffering so much that Im not sure I care anymore. This world has fucked me over time and time again and I held my tongue and minded my manners. I feel like I at least deserve an exit that I want, even if it might make some people late to work or something.

For now I'm just trying to hold on for another two months. But with the way things are going its going to be really hard to wait that long.
