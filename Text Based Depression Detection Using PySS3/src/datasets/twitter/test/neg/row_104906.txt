It will be snowing by the time I'm homeless.I may be homeless soon. It's already getting colder here and by the time my landlord kicks me it will likely be snowing.

My dog would have to suffer too I suppose, especially if I decided to stay out of a shelter just so I can keep them. I just talked with my father, hoping he could help and he only told me how it was all my fault.

I've dropped out of college because I couldn't take it, and I still do not have a job even after searching. I don't feel like my life will amount to anything at this point but bringing down others. And no friends (not that I really have any) nor my father would miss me once I was gone.

I want to die right now. I want to stop being such a coward so that I could just kill myself. I've hated myself for a very long time now and I wish I could end my life. 

Fingers crossed right?
