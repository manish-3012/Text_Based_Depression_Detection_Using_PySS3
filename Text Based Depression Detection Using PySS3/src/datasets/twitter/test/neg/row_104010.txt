Posting againIâ€™ve been cutting a lot more lately. Some part of me still wants to be alive though which sucks because every other part of me is screaming at me to die. I feel like everything I am is a lie and I feel like I shouldnâ€™t be doing this right now. I feel like Iâ€™m just being dramatic and I should get over it already. It would all be so much easier if I could just cut my wrists and be done with it. Iâ€™ve been doing my research on the best ways to die cause I donâ€™t wanna mess up and still be alive or have some permanent condition cause I couldnâ€™t even did right. It just seems like thereâ€™s no easy way to do it right. I canâ€™t get my hand on a gun so thatâ€™s not an option. Overdosing never kills anymore cause you just vomit it up or get caught. I have no way to hang myself and I hear itâ€™s always faulty cause the ceiling beam will snap or the rope will snap I also live with other people so there wouldnâ€™t be an easy way for me to hang myself and they wouldnâ€™t catch me. Itâ€™s also pretty difficult to bleed out enough from cutting your wrists because your natural survival stuff stops you from cutting too deep. Iâ€™ve always wanted to jump off a tall building cause then I could feel like Iâ€™m flying before I die but there isnâ€™t anywhere close to me that I have access to that I could jump from. I might just say fuck it and try the wrists thing and take a lot of meds at the same time just to up my chances of success. I feel absolutely nothing right now but I also feel so much pain and cutting just isnâ€™t enough anymore. Iâ€™m running out of space before it becomes noticeable so Iâ€™m just opening up scabs and cutting wounds deeper. I go about my day putting myself in danger whenever possible. I walk across the road and beg that a car will hit me hard enough to kill me. My mind is spinning and I feel sock from the depression. Everything feels useless and I donâ€™t know what to do with myself anymore. The only thing stopping me from killing myself before was what my parents might think but now I just donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t care about anything and I just want death.
