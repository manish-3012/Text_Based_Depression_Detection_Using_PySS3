I want to commit suicide.It's not my first time here but I feel desperate. I might just overdose on my pills and drown myself in alcohol. I thought I recovered, I thought I was fine. But in a sudden turn of events then I am not. It's been 8 months since then. And I can't take it anymore. End my pain, not a single fucking day passes before I beg to God I die. I counted my years backwards and I realize that I only felt happy once in my whole damn life. Years, almost 2 decades now. I can only recall 4 months I was truly happy. But those days are gone and my pills will be the death of me.
