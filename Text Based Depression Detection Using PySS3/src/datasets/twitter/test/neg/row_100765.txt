I feel like I'm only living for other peopleI've been depressed for a long time. Since i was in middle school I'd come home and cry since i was always unhappy. I had friends but i was never close to any of them. I probably have mild social anxiety (I get kind of shaky when i'm around large groups of my peers). When i was younger i just shook it off and figured that maybe i'm just doing something wrong and it'll get better when i'm older. 
I had suicidal thoughts but never went through with it since i felt i had to be there for my parents, i couldn't let them go through the guilt of my death. (i'm often home alone since they work often and i know my mother feels bad about that. I'm not mad at her about it though.) Or i couldn't do it cause i couldn't let my brother grow up without his older sister around anymore. 

Recently I've realized how much I just walk through life doing nothing and wonder why i'm even here in the first place. If it wasn't for my family I wouldn't hesitate with killing myself. I don't have many friends and the ones i do have hardly notice when i'm not around. I'm not needed here, and i just broke down. I really need to fix this cause i just can't live like this anymore.
