Is it the end?I'm early 30s with a genetic disorder that causes severe pain. I've been on disability for a few years, but couldn't live on that small amount after my ex husband divorced me, in part because he didn't want to deal with a sick wife. 

I got a new boyfriend, but he doesn't work - he goes to college full time and relies on me for money... I got a job but now I will be losing it after 6 months due to being disabled and missing too much work. They just don't care. The job is where my boyfriend's mother and father work as well, so I will be embarrassing them. 

I just want to end it. I have a partial bottle of narcotics and a bottle of xanax as well as heart meds. If I can make it look like an accident my boyfriend and daughter will split my life insurance, helping them out. I don't have custody of my daughter she'll barely miss me. My ex husband used my illness and constant pain to earn custody. 

Basically I hurt all the time, can't keep a job, will probably lose my boyfriend, already lost my husband and I can't afford to live. There seems to be no way out.
