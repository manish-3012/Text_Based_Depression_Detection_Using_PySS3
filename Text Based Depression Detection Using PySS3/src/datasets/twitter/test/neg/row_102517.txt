I canâ€™t get over my nihilismI canâ€™t get over my nihilism. If there is no god, what is the point? How can anyone ever be fulfilled if nothing matters? Life is but a memory, happened long ago. Life meant something once upon a time. Now I just feel empty and nothing in the whole fucking world can change it. Iâ€™ve been in love. Once youâ€™re in true love once, how can you possibly fall in true love again? What is the meaning of true love if it isnâ€™t true? I feel like my mind is on fire all the time. Has Satan taken over me or is this just the truth? I donâ€™t even know what sane is. I feel very up close and very far away at the same time. I canâ€™t bring myself to believe in God. And I know Iâ€™m weak for it, but I canâ€™t live in a world without a reason. No reason for any of this. The world eats itself. I just canâ€™t shake it. Iâ€™m flailing my body wildly around all the time but no one can see it. I throw myself at every light but I only feel like I see right through it. What is the reason? What is the reason?
