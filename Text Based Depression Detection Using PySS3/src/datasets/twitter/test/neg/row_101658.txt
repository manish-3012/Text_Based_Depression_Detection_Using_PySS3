I just wrapped a cable on my neckLiterally, I doesnâ€™t care about anything after this time. Nothing is important for me. I wonâ€™t call any stupid numbers to try to help me cause I know they canâ€™t. I tried to suicide dozens of times before but I couldnâ€™t even how close I was. This time I am ending this stupid life forever.
