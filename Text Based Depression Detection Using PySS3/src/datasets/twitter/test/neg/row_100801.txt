Ever lay in bed...just praying for an aneurysm?

The tiniest things drag me down because they all add up. They've been adding up for 48 years slowing me down. Adding to the weight I carry, that I never asked for. Then there is the knowledge that so many more suffer so much more than I, which only makes me feel weaker &amp; less deserving of life. 

The only positive thing that runs through my mind is that this is a simulation run by the actual me, trying to figure out the best path forward, &amp; this isn't it.
That relief is short lived as it just makes it that much easier to end this failed simulation.
