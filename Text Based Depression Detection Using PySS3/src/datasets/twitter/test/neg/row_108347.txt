Embracing my darknessDo you ever have one of those days when you feel like you can't fight it anymore?  That was my day.  My first thought this morning was that I wanted to cry.  That suicide was a valid option.  That I was a complete and useless fuck up of a human being.  

I just could sit here an cry and I don't know why.
