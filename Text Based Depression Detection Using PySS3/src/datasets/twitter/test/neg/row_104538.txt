Struggling.I'm finding the reason people give me not to kill myself is that it will upset other people. I won't be sentient so it seems a slightly ironic/paradoxical thing to say to someone who won't know at the time.
I'll be dead; I shan't know I'm dead, or be gaining happiness but I'll shed this depressive, eroding rot I feel.
It probably is selfish but absolute nothingness seems appealing right now. I won't lie, I don't know if I will or not right now but there's always risk of finding that calm place five minutes before it kicks off. And being nihilistic, I suppose it could be seen as an unreportable experiment to see if there is anything afterward. Silver linings.
