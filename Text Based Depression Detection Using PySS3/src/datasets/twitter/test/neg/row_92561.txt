Day 4.5Its been 4.5 days since Ive eaten or drunk anything. I didnt want to rush into a decision Id regret but its helped me realise that no one cares about me in my life, that no one would notice if I was gone. Im worthless and meaningless and Ive destroyed every meaningful relationship Ive ever had, I cant wait to wither away and disappear.
