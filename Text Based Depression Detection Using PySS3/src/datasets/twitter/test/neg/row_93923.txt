excited about my eventual suicideas a self harmer, iâ€™m always looking to go deeper, bleed more, hurt more. iâ€™ve never gone for the wrists because i hate the idea of someone finding out that i do these things, but knowing that one day iâ€™ll slice my arms an inch+ deep vertically and bleed to death fills me with such excitement.

i genuinely canâ€™t wait for the day i finally lose my last reason to live and get to carry out this fantasy.

last week i almost bled out and it was a somewhat unpleasant but extremely thrilling experience. i canâ€™t wait for it to happen again, with real results.

every day the urge to just end it all gets stronger, and iâ€™m not sure how much longer i can hold out. even when iâ€™m having a particularly good day, the urge to off myself is always there in the background.

i canâ€™t wait for the day i die. iâ€™m so very excited for this, more than anything else iâ€™ve ever looked forward to in my life.
