I donâ€™t want to be here anymore but Iâ€™m too scaredI donâ€™t want people to think itâ€™s because I donâ€™t love them. There are so many people that I love much more than I could ever love myself. It just hurts and I feel like it wouldnâ€™t make that much of a difference if I wasnâ€™t here anymore. Almost every day I think about suicide. I wish there was a way for me to just not exist for a while. Iâ€™m too scared to do it though. Iâ€™m afraid of the pain and Iâ€™m afraid of throwing away my life in case it does actually get better. I just donâ€™t know if it will, right now it seems like nothing ever changes. Every year I feel like this and Iâ€™m only 17. Itâ€™s not right but I canâ€™t fix it. I donâ€™t hate living, but Iâ€™m not happy. I donâ€™t feel like doing anything. I just want to lay in my bed and sleep forever but I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone. I feel like a horrible person for being this way but I donâ€™t know what to do. I want help but I donâ€™t want to be a burden. It seems so irrational. I sometimes wish I had something physically wrong so people could see it. And when you tell someone they donâ€™t know what to do either. I need help but I donâ€™t know what to do.
