I think Iâ€™m about to do it but I feel the need to let it out firstI donâ€™t know if this even belongs here or in r/schizophrenia or r/bipolar bc i think im having an episode and mania. I keep punching myself and am high af and keep doing it not to cut myself but Iâ€™m really not doing okay I donâ€™t feel okay guys the only person that supported and understood me was my best friend not even my mom and she has left and everything has been going so bad I know that life but fuck Iâ€™m hurting so bad Iâ€™ve been disappointing people so much and I canâ€™t take it.  I canâ€™t tell my therapist because she will hospitalize me again and I donâ€™t want that fuck Iâ€™m feeling so many things right now I canâ€™t do this Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m so sorry itâ€™s really bad this time
