Iâ€™m done with itI just want to end it all. So letâ€™s start from the beginning. Mine parents arenâ€™t the best. The fight a lot. And they always scream. They never talk at 60 db. And they seem always mad. Then in March my dad almost threw a chair at my mom in the first weekend of lockdown. My siblings are the same. Always screaming and fighting. March was also the first month I started with self harming. Just cutting with a scissor and not deep. And I started to have suicidal thoughts. Fast forward a few months( it just got worse and worse). I started to lose religion. And Iâ€™m scarred to tell my family because they will be very mad. When the school started back I found myself very distant from the few friends I have. And today I texted with my friend (which I have a crush on). And apparently she went on a date. I thought it went good with her. We talked every day since September. And we where a bit flirty. But no itâ€™s not going like I thought. But after looking back at everything from March onward. I found the problem. It is me. From the fighting to my Friends and crush Iâ€™m the problem. So thatâ€™s it. Itâ€™s 3:50 am now. So Iâ€™m going to sleep( hopefully die in my sleep). And tomorrow Iâ€™ll write my last letter and find a way to commit suicide. I thing I wonâ€™t commit suicide tomorrow but Iâ€™m definitely sure I wonâ€™t make it to 2021.
