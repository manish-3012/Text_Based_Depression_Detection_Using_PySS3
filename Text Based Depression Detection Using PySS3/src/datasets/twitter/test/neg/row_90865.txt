I Feel Like God Is Telling Me To Kill MyselfA couple of months ago I started contemplating suicide because of a certain issue. During that time, certain things happened and it almost feels as if God is trying to tell me to kill myself.

I was once on the Youtube homepage, and I clicked on a song suggestion. The song was ' West End Girls ' by the Pet Shop Boys. The first line of that song is '' Sometimes you're better off dead, if there's a gun in your house aim it at your head ''. I immediately closed the song.

I'm not sure if this happened on the same day, but it happened close to that time. I was again on Youtube, and I saw a thumbnail for a song suggestion. " God was never on your side '' by Motorhead.

Despite being a Motorhead fan, I had never heard that song before. The reason why this title struck me so hard was because earlier this year, something happened which caused me to believe that the exact opposite was in place. That God was on my side because something positive had happened and I was feeling very thankful. But that positive thing turned negative a few months ago, which is what caused me to become suicidal. And I feel like this song suggestion was like a '' Haha gotcha loser '' message from God. 

I have gotten a few other moments like that. Where I've seen things which eerily remind me of my situation. And what I've seen has always involved the element of death. I feel like God is laughing at me up there and is turning my life into a joke. 

I'm not even that religious. I'm agnostic but I've always leaned towards the idea that there might be some universal power out there. 

But what I'm experiencing right now has got me convinced.
