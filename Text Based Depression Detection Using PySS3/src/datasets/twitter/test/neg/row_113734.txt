The only way this pain is going to go away is if I can talk to him again, and that's not an option.He's in love with a new girl. He doesn't talk to me anymore. He doesn't care. He was my support system. The only way I would get a response from him is if I were about to kill myself. He would ignore me if I tried to reach out for any other reason. I know exactly how I'm going to kill myself. I haven't decided if I'm going to reach out to him or not. I want to, because I miss him. But what good will it do? He'd try to contact my family so they could stop me. He'll find out one way or another, and he'll feel like shit one way or another. This fucking pain I am going through just won't stop no matter how fucking hard I try to be normal. I can't go back to normal. I've gone off the fucking deep end. I'm crazy, and desperate just to feel like my old self. But I can't. That was a past life. He was a past life. He gave me normalcy.
