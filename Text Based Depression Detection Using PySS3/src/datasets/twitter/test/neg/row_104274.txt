I wonder if I'm the only person who intentionally tries to 'eat himself to death'?I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this. 

So I'm a guy in my early 30s about 5'10 and I think around 400lbs. I've been suicidal at least to an extent since I was maybe 10, I don't remember really. My life has always sucked, when I was growing up it was because of my violent parents, only violent in the way society is 100% in support of nothing special and problems with school, as an adult my problems are internal, I am all alone in the world, always have been, am fucked up in the head, and just don't care about anything an enjoy little. 

So, I guess it started as a joke maybe? I've been a fan of eating since age 10 or so, and fat since I guess 8th grade. My weight was in the lower 200's in my early 20s. I said something about wanting to die of a heart attack, joking about "Im coming Elizabeth!" or "Da Bears!" being my last words, and at some point I decided that I wanted to eat junk food until it killed me. I honestly didn't think I'd live this long.

I'm too scared to cut my wrist or take pills. Part of the fear is, I'm agnostic, and I find blasphemous humor to be particularly amusing, and I'm not a good person, and I've lived in a society where they tell ya about Hell and all that bullshit and part of you believes it, maybe the same part that looks for a bad guy behind the shower curtain when you get up to pee at night, or is that just me? I'm not being funny to make light of anything this is just how I think, I'm being serious honest. 

So here I am still alive and getting worse mentally, and neglecting one's health for more than a decade having predictable results, and some I didn't see coming. It's not not comfortable carrying this around, my legs hurt, tired all the time, junk squished between pubic fat and thigh fat, expensive eating habits, impossible to find fitting pants offline, etc. The being ugly and disgusting looking thing has the added benefit that I have a better excuse for not seeking out impossible romantic attachment than how utterly fucked in the head I am, and low opinion of people, and how eager they become once they find that spot in your back where a knife would fit best.

I like the idea of a fatal heart attack. Sudden, unpredictable, and it's over. It's like the pressure of actually pulling a trigger or taking the pills is taken out of my hands and put onto something almost like chance. I mean like if you had one suicide pill, taking it would be hard. But if you had 1 cyanide pill and 10,000 placebos, mixed it up real good and took one pill a day, that's easy right? And if instead of a pill it was 4 tasty burgers for lunch and another 2 for dinner, even more so.

I don't think I have any other options other than to continue and see how long I last, unless my worsening depression drives me to take direct action. I can't turn back, there's not only nothing for me in this world, no one I can trust or talk to, and I've finally admitted that the sweet lies I told myself to cheer myself up are lies, [redacted]. I can't seek therapy because I don't trust therapists, the least honorable of all professions that charge you hundreds of dollars an hour to make you feel better. And I'd rather die than talk about [redacted]. The damage I've done to my body and the hard work, self denial, surgeries, dental work, and plastic surgery it would take to make me normal only serve as a convenient burnt bridge. 

I don't know if anyone will read this, I doubt you could help if you wanted to. I think I feel a little better just writing this down. At least when I talk to strangers they don't respond by getting offended that I would dare try to hurt their feelings just because I hurt every single day. Poor babies.
