I'm not "planning" to kill myself this Christmas.Although I highly suspect that will be my breaking point.

Every waking moment is pain, and apparently some non-wakeing ones as I've woken up crying a few times. 

I'm so tired and the crushing loneliness this holiday is mounting. I'm not planning anything but if I think realistically I'm going to be driven to my exit point by Christmas if not earlier.
