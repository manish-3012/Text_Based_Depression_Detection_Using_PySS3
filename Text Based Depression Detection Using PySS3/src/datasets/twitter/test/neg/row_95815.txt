Everyday Iâ€™m reminded how much of a failed human I am. The end is coming soon for me.Iâ€™m reminded everyday of how much of a piece of shit I am. How much of a waste of space I am. How much of an oxygen thief I am. How much I donâ€™t deserve life. How much I disappoint everyone thatâ€™s had the misfortune to know me. How much I suck the joy out of everyoneâ€™s life. How much I cause pain. How much I cause suffering.
I donâ€™t deserve to live. The end for me is coming soon. I have a place. I have a method. Iâ€™m just waiting for when it gets too much.
