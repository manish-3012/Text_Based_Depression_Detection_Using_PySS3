Reality (possible trigger warning)Everyone always talks about getting help and working on getting better and feeling better..but what if some of us are just not meant to be alive?

Maybe some of us just aren't meant to survive.

I mean survival of the fittest is pretty much the first rule of nature, and we are natural beings. Like it or not we are animals, we are creatures of this earth...so that must mean that law, or rule, applies to us also.

Maybe I am one of those people, but I'm too scared to try.

And by try...I mean: kill myself.

If I ever did, I would have to make sure it's NOT my mom and dad who find me. That would break them. 

But really my death would break them whether they were to be the ones who find me or not.

And that breaks my heart.

It breaks my heart, but also stops me from trying.

So I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place: living this life that I don't want to be a part of, or feel unable to be a part of, but not being able to rip out of this body without breaking people who I know love me...even though I'm broken all the time.
