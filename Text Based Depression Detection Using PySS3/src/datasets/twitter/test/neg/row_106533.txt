Really really need to talk.I am back on this subreddit again which is in itself, super disappointing. 

I just really really really need to talk to someone right now. I won't be able to see my counselor for about a month or so. I'm starting to isolate myself from my friends and I'm not talking to anybody. My panic episodes are becoming more frequent. I haven't self-harmed in over a month now but I'm getting compulsions to start hurting myself again and I'm not really sure why. I'm not sleeping. I just got finished with the semester, but somehow I am more anxious than ever. I just feel like I have nowhere to go. 

 I am getting very very very scared. 

I really need to talk to somebody.
