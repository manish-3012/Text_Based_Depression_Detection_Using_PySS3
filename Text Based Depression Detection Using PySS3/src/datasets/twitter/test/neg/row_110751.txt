No matter what I do, I'll always be autistic and I'll always be aloneI fought hard reddit. I really did. I was nonverbal until 3, and I fought hard to speak. I struggled through school because of my autism and ADHD, and I basically did cognitive behavioral therapy on myself without realizing and now I have multiple degrees. I couldn't find a job and I was homeless due to a lack of networking, and now I have a great job and I'm decently well known in my community and field. 

But it wasn't enough. Despite my successes, once I disclosed my autism, my boss has been out to get me. My "significant other" now wants to see other people after I told her and said she wants to be "just friends." Even worst? She's been trying to "help" me find a lawyer, but every time I ask her to "slow down this process" because I feel completely overwhelmed, she gets mad at me and yells at me and then i try to explain my communication struggles, and she yells at me for taking too long. Instead of waiting, she punched a wall, told me to shut up, and left to go on a date while I was in crisis. 

And yesterday, when she came back, after ignoring me for hours while my car broke down and I was stranded, I told her I felt betrayed. And she didnt even care! I gave her so many years of my life, fougbt my disabilities, fought through poverty, allowed her to quit her job so she could go to grad school, and she didn't care. And I just freaked out. I've NEVER done this but I called her names, yelled at her, I broke stuff just like she had.. I had a full on meltdown. We've "been together" for 4.5 years. She's now at the other guys house.


My family doesn't understand, my friends avoid me. People at work now look at me weird. Even on reddit, I'm told my posts are too long. I can't interact with anyone. 

So I'm ending it. I need to figure out how to make it look like an accident so my family and ex can receive life insurance. Its I've been looking for methods all day. I've changed the locks to my apartment so no one can come and stop me. Now I need to find a quick way to do this. I can't do this anymore. 

If you know anyone that struggled with neurodevelopmental disorders, please accept them. All it takes is one person. We've lived our lives completely shunned by people. The average age for people with autism is 36! For black autists,  I'm sure its lower, but no one cares to research us. Please, just love that person unconditionally. Don't let them end up like me.
