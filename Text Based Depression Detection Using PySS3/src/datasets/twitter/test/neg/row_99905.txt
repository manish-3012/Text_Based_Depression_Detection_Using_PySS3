I have been depressed for so long that I don't remember how to be happy. I don't know how to heal. If my friends and family knew what was best for me, they'd let me die.I want to know the honest truth of what people think of me, how I can improve myself, but I am a pathological liar and can't be truthful to others.

I am self-conscious of my body, but I do all of the wrong things for temporary pleasure.

I want to use my life to bring change to the world, but I can't motivate myself to leave the house.

I want friends, but I am too picky to choose them and too depressing to keep them.

I can't trust anyone with any of my problems, because every time I have trusted someone I have been burned. When I finally went to a counselor for help, I just gave up and stopped going to appointments.

Anxiety rules all of my decisions and I no longer have the self-control that I once worked so hard to obtain.

Why can't I take the easy way for once in my life? Why can't I be selfish once after being a doormat for so long? I am so miserable it hurts...
