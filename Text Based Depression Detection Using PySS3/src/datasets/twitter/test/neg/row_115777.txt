I can't keep living. It's not even possible.I'm not scared of death, I welcome it, what I am scared of is living like this.





Hello. I am a 23 year old guy battling severe anxiety and bipolar 1. My anxiety is so bad that I can't get in other people's cars, I can't go to bars, can't drink, can't go to party's, can't work, can't even go to friggen church without having a panic attack. I can't date, I can't hang with friends, I can't go out to eat, I can't do ANYTHING. 




Keep in mind I've been living like this for 4 years and every effort I make pushes me farther into the rabbit hole. I've tried meds, I've tried CBT, nothing works. 





On top of all this, the thought that I might have a medical emergency keeps me up at night and makes my days hell. 



I can't live like this. 





How can I change? If I can't find a way to fix myself, or at least start to, I'm ending it tomorrow.




I've tried CBT, Exposure, meds, therapy. You name it
