I feel so alone.I feel like no one is listening to me. I don't know what to do. I don't feel like anyone could understand because no one is showing they understand. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I wish I wasn't such a pussy so I could go through with it. I feel so alone even when there are people all around me.
