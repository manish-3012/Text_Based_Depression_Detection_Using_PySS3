Im stressed to fuckIâ€™ve worked 31 hours this week, 21 of which were in the past three days, I dropped out of high school, my mental heal is dipping and I canâ€™t use the support around me. I feel like so much like a failure. Iâ€™m glad my grandparents havenâ€™t found my poorly hidden blade by bumping into my desk or some shit. I just want to die now. End me. Iâ€™m such a terrible friend and person, always have been, always will be.
