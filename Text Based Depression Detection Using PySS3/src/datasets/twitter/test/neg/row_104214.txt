For What Reason Is There To Live?I walked past a homeless person today, and felt guilty for not being able to help.

I gave up animal products so I don't contribute to all the bad things they do.

I try to help others the best I can but I'm useless.

Governments don't actually care about anyone's health, they only care about money.

People are dying of viruses, of violence, of suicide. Yet, we're expected to feel happy whilst we pleasure ourselves under a roof? 

Why must life suffer at the hands of humanity? Have you no compassion? 

What reason do I have to live knowing many suffer and I cannot help?
