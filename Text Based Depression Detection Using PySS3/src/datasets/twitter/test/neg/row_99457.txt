It feels like I was dealt all of the right cards but Iâ€™m playing them wrong.I have good grades, Never been bullied, a family, no one close to me has died, friends, a girlfriend, pets, live in a good area, financially stable. With all of that I should be happy right? Nope. Iâ€™m still sad as a bitch.
