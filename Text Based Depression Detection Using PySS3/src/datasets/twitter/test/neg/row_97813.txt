I'm on the edge. And have been for a long time.Honestly, I don't know where to start. I feel like butter, stretched too thin. And have been ever since I was 13-14.

I'm just going to tell my story and apologize in advance for what might become a long read. I don't even know if I'm in the right place here. I just need to get this off my chest before I finally find the courage. I wish I could do this anonymously. 

I live in Belgium. I'm at the moment of writing 27 years old and have been depressed for about half my time here on earth. It all started during high school. I used to be very athletic before I started it. I swam competitively and played soccer. I quit both because of several fractions (soccer because of my ankle, swimming because of my wrist). After that I began to put on weight. Come the first few years it was okayish. I was hefty but also muscular. That changed rapidly and I started getting bullied. A lot. Mostly due to my weight and chubbiness but also because, well, we didn't have a lot of money. I got beat up, emotionally bullied and even teachers either didn't care or participate. I didn't feel right in my skin nor in my head. I became **depressed**. I started eating even more, gaming even more and generally didn't leave the house much. Friends I hadn't either. I endured this feeling of well, for a lack of a better word, unease and distrust and general anxiety until I had my gastric bypass. When I had my bypass I weighted around 144kgs. The kilograms started flying off and I guess for that part I started feeling a bit better. I was getting a bit more attractive and the bullies started wavering off once I started college. That didn't last long though. I guess because I was so severely bullied I sort of developed anti-social skills. I'm quiet, introvert and very shy, especially back then. I dropped out of college despite doing well, not good, but well, because the dark thoughts came back and I felt like I no longer could function. Instead I 'ran away' into a game or a book, just to stop the thoughts and get the feeling I was accomplishing something. 

Come my drop out I started working as a bartender in a new startup high-standard diner. Mind you I was studying Computer Sciences. I knew nothing but apparently I was a quick study. The people there accepted me even though my shyness and quietness. I guess it was because I never said no when they asked me to cover a shift or work longer or do something I hadn't actually been hired to do. I got 'promoted' to waiting tables. After that I got 'promoted' to being responsible for everyone working there when the bosses weren't around. I got no raise whatsoever but I did it because it made me feel like I was accomplishing something. It made me feel like I was good at what I did. They abused me, but I didn't know it at that time. Come this time my first toxic relationship started. She was a co-worker. Cute, charming. I immediately fell in love with her. She noticed and so it began. Coincidentally this is also where my **alcohol abused** started. We started dating. My family extremely disliked her but I didn't understand. Being bullied for so long, I was happy I had such a handsome girlfriend. She started to manipulate me and somehow, I don't know how and I do't want to blame her, I started drinking more. Eventually I ran off from home to go live together with her. I didn't speak to my family for months. 

After a year of fight after fight after fight, our apartment we were renting got sold. We needed a new place. Over the past few months I started talking to my family again so there was that option. Only she was pregnant at that time. It was planned. I sometimes think we planned it to save our relationship. I don't know. We had a choice, rent a new place for 3 or go live with my family to save for the baby even though she didn't like my family nor did they like her. But at least they were willing to make that sacrifice. I gave the choice to her because I didn't want to lose her. She chose to go live there, so we could save and maybe even buy a place for us. A week later, she left me. A week after that, when she came to get the rest of her belongings, she threw a paper to my face. Abortion. I was **devastated**. I've always wanted a kid. I began drinking even more. 

My family started noticing my alcohol abuse so I started to hide it. I'd come home late so they'd be asleep. I'd smuggle alcohol to my room and drink there and then afterward hid it. I did all kinds of things, just to drink. Just to forget. Just to lose myself. Just to keep those always-lingering dark thoughts away and ride on the train of alcohol induced dopamine. I only drank after work at that time. And then my second relationship came. It wasn't as toxic as the previous one, but she certainly took advantage my 'always saying yes'.

I'd met a girl I used to 'know' back in high school and we got reacquainted. She remembered the fat ugly kid from high school. By now I was only 69kgs and a bit more attractive then back then. So we started dating. She had a kid, from a previous relationship. A lovely 14 month old boy. I was **crazy** about him. Only now I start to realize it might be because of my previous relationship going sour on that aspect, I don't know.  I sort of shielded her from my family because of my previous relationship. I wanted them to like her and her boy. But by doing that I ended up getting the opposite effect. It's not that they didn't like her, they just didn't knew her. Or him. Just a week or two after we started dating, her ex got word of me. By then he was still paying half the rent for her to support her and his kid. Because I was there now he didn't want to anymore and they ended their renting contract. In Belgium that means you've got roughly 3 months where you get to stay, then you move out. We'd been dating **two weeks** and I was going to live together with her. I was so crazy in love. She was so gorgeous, the boy loved me and I loved him. I really thought I was doing well for a change and the thoughts faded a bit. I hid them from her. I didn't tell her about my thoughts. Why would I? We were madly in love and everything was going good. We searched for a place and found one. My family didn't agree and thought it was too quick. In retrospect I know now they were right. I barely knew this woman. Our good phase ran out quick. Don't get me wrong, we had good times, but there were also **a lot** of fights.

My drinking started to get even worse. She never said no when I drank and that's easy for an alcoholic. She sometimes even drank with me when the boy was with his father. Things were good, except financially. I worked roughly 40-50hrs a week. She did only 20 because of the boy. I understood, I mean we couldn't leave a 18 month old kid alone at home right? So I started even working more and with working more came drinking more. I was doing 65-75hrs a week at that time. The only financial burden that was directly mine was drinking. To this day I still don't know where all the rest of my money went. After a while I drank so much when I got home I only had time to see a small movie or one episode of a series we were following before I went to bed to get back to work the day after. I literally drank myself in a mini-coma every freaking night. I sometimes even secretly drank a small beer before work.

I got **fired**. The place I helped from start up fired me. The place that I helped create and organize fired me. Because of drinking and the general problems that come with it. (lack of hygiene, tremors, tempers, ...) This should've been a wake up call but instead I drank even **more**.

Until it was too much for **her**. She said she was leaving me. The world disappeared beneath my feet. I didn't see this coming. I mean, there were issues. There was my drinking and her obsessive cellphone use. There was me being too strict and her being too loose. But I mean, that's nothing we can't solve right? I guess not, she didn't want me anymore. She took the kid I helped raise (by now nearly 3 years old) and went to sleep with friends. We sort of alternated the place and when we were both there we had turns on the couch. I tried one last time and reserved at a fancy restaurant. I payed for the meal by myself. Turned out she only came out of pity. I have no friends remember. This gutted me. I felt laughed at in my face and even more abused. The dark thoughts came in full power. She slept that night with friends and it was her turn the next day. 

I called in sick at work the next day and told her I'd be home. She said she'd stay with friends one more night. I was still drunk from the day before and was drinking again. This time alcohol didn't help. The thoughts were there and they were massive. Instead of giving in to the usual sleep urge I get after drinking too much I kept on drinking. And drinking. And drinking. I was planning of drinking myself to death. **I nearly succeeded**. She came home to get some things. By now I was so far gone we had a fight. She said she was going to a store and would be back. She left the boy with me because of the situation he was frantic. I drank even more and more. With the kid just roaming around. I was so far gone that I didn't care about the boy I loved so much. I drank myself into alcohol-poisoning. If she hadn't been back when she was, I would've **succeeded**. I finally would've. She called my sister because I was unresponsive. My sister brought me to the hospital and I was admitted. They said afterward I had about 5 promille (google says BAC for the correct translation, I don't know) in my system. I spent 5 days in a detox center at the general hospital. Then they admitted me to their psychiatric ward (in the general hospital) for alcohol, depression and suicidal tendencies. 

That's where I met her. The true love of my life. Yes, at a psych ward. We had the same psychological issues, so we related on so many levels. Difference was our coping mechanism. I drank, she smoked pot. But by God, we could talk. I never talked much in my life about my feelings and neither did she. But we talked. A lot. Every day. Every hour. I don't recall us officially dating but we were inseparable. When I was discharged I felt a bit lost but I could cope knowing she'd be out soon too. The following months we did everything together. I helped her with her place, she helped me with my place at my parents, we bonded even more, we talked even more. I had my **soulmate**. We were going too quick. We weren't living together but we weren't apart either. This became too much for her. I didn't understand it at that time, I was devastated and felt everything I work for crumble apart again. We agreed we weren't quitting the relationship, we'd just spend a bit more time apart and everything would be alright. I couldn't handle it. I missed her, I felt like losing my support when she wasn't around. I started drinking again. She noticed it a few times and we had our first fight, after nearly 6 months. That's how good we were together, we went 6 months without a single fight or discussion besides her need for a bit more air. 

I checked myself in at the psych ward again. I didn't want to go back to the road I was on before her, but I was about to and noticed it. The dark thoughts never disappeared but lessened when around her (she felt the same BTW). I didn't want them back in full-on mode so I checked myself in. My family didn't understand. I had a fight with my family. My mother said, to my face, you just need to get a kick on your ass and get your shit together, all this talking and prying apart isn't helping you. I don't understand how a few talks could help change the way you think. My mother has no idea how a depression works. She thinks you just flip a switch and think differently. Maybe she can, but I **can't.**

The psych ward I'm talking about has a limit time when you can be there. It's a sort of crisis-situation based mechanism. They helped me get back on my feet emotionally. And so did she. She **never** went a day without visiting me. Together with her I made the decision to go into a mental hospital. They have a waiting time over there. I'm still waiting.

Upon my discharge I still hadn't spoken to my family. Despite her need for air she said I could stay with her. I stayed with her for around 2 weeks. I **suffocated** her emotionally. I regret this deeply. She broke up with me. If I'd have shoved my pride away and contacted my family we'd still be together. But now we aren't. I went into a homeless shelter. I couldn't find my way there. I started cutting again (I also did this in my youth). There's so much drugs and alcohol in this, I usually just locked myself in my room and only came out during meals or when I had an appointment with my social worker. I got so low. I tried again, but without alcohol I somehow lacked.. I don't know, the balls? Besides I still had her for support, just not in the levels that I was used to, but I still had her and I guess that kept me from doing it.

My social worker contacted my family. We came to an agreement. Even though my mother will probably never understand, I get to stay there until I can go to the mental hospital. 

Today I went to get the last of my things at her place. Even though we're still close friends, there was so much distance between us. She's still working on her issues. I **broke down**. It felt like goodbye. And I guess it was. I haven't heard her since I left. I'm so God damn broken right now, I don't see a way out anymore. I don't want to anymore. I don't want to find another way. I don't want to get over this hill again. I've climbed enough. I've lost everything I ever lost. I lost the love of my life, a kid, an unborn kid, my job, my home, ... 

**I'm done.**
