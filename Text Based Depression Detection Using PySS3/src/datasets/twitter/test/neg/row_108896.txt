I truly want to dieI feel no love. I canâ€™t love myself which means icant love anyone else. I feel like I have never truly felt real romantic love because I always push it away. Deep down I know Iâ€™m deserving of love, but I feel nothing. I know there are different kinds of love, like physical love and love for mankind. I have it. But at the moment I want to get out of the heartache. I feel like I have sinned. I am not religious. I feel like I have sinned so badly and that I am an awful person. I feel like I wonâ€™t go to heaven. I am scared of death and scared of the world. You donâ€™t know what you have until itâ€™s gone. I want to know. I might write a suicide note just to feel better. I do have a plan. 2 steps forward and one step back is my life. Iâ€™m sick of it.
