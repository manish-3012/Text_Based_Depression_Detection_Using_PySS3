I've tried it all reallyI've tried meds, therapy, pyshedelics ( gave me pyschosis eventually ) , exercise, eating healthy, keto, long streaks of nofap,noporn, being religious and having faith/hope ( not anymore ) , tried telling people and it just gets worse, tried supplements, meh. Even when I do all of it. I'm still depressed, and ugly, and dumb and have mental illnesses. Its so easy for people to say 'oH dOnT sAy tHaT' but they are not in my damn shoes.

I'm 20 and cant get myself to care about a damn thing Nothing interests me. . Im not eligible for military. College is expensive as fuck and im too depressed too care. I cant hold a damn job longer then a few months and i've been unemployed for a year cus of pyschosis. And I question if im just over exaggerating, its really feels like it. I'm rude to my parents but nice to everyone else so i'm a fake fuck. I do deserve do burn in hell. I don't know how much longer i'll last, but its not looking good.
