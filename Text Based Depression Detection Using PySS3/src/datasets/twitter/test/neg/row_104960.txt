QuestionI have 3,525mg of nortriptyline and 2,080mg of fluoxetine. I am around 105 pounds and 22 years old. How painful will this be and how long will it take me to die? Please donâ€™t try to stop me, Iâ€™ve already made my decision. Iâ€™ve seen multiple different psychiatrists and therapists for years so Iâ€™ve already gotten help, and it doesnâ€™t work for me.
