My face is too hideously ugly to allow me to live, no matter how much work I put into myself. I'm clearly inferior to other males and unfit to live.Just to begin, I'm almost 30, so this isn't just some teen angst.

Sorry if you actually believe that you are ugly, and don't fret if you do think you are, as there are those who have body dysmorphia and aren't as ugly as they think.

Not with me though. I laugh at those who tell me that confidence, humor, fitness, and style will win over anyone from the opposite sex. Just because they were previously average/moderately unattractive and worked on these things and became attractive so it worked for them does NOT mean that it works for everyone.

Imagine having a face so disgusting that it repulses women from the sight of it. That's my reality. Day in and out. 

I know what your thinking though: "You just need to workout more/get a better style/get some confidence/whatever meaningless advice that is thrown at the normal loser that can't attract women. Been there, done that. Seven years worth of improving every facet of my being. It wasn't originally just to meet women, but emotional intimacy was definitely a factor.

Yes though I got ripped. I made sure I dressed well and styled myself well. I studied social skills, wit, and charm and put myself in public situations 5 to 7 days out of the week to learn to talk to others. I studied seduction. I involved myself in numerous different new hobbies and meetups, and volunteered frequently as well. 

I'm still forever alone. I have friends and that's nice and all, but I crave emotional and physical intimacy with a member of the opposite sex. Too bad they can't look at me without being disgusted to the point of gagging, since my face still nauseates people. 

Seven fucking years down the drain though. I know my parents are going to be upset when I end things, but they don't understand what it is like to disgust literally every member of the opposite sex and having to know how inferior you truly are to the rest of the human race.

I know your next comment: if it's so bad, why don't you get cosmetic surgery??? Well I have looked into it, and the only thing that would work is a full facial makeover, which would cost at least 40k in South Korea, and *far* more in the US. The way I see it, since I'm nearly past my prime in age and that there is no guarantee that it will not make me more gruesome than I already am, if I have an "accident" the life insurance money could be donated to a cause like Doctors Without Borders, saving multiple lives for those who are genetically fit to live (unlike myself) and just were cursed with living in a bad area of the world.

So unless I am missing something, I have plans on ending things in the next week. Got a good home lined up for my dogs and getting my affairs in order. 

I cannot wait for sweet death. Someone as disgusting as myself deserved it long ago. 

Edit: So after reading the responses, to be honest, aside from either disfiguring my face by either modifying it with weird shit the lizard guy from Ripley's Believe It or Not or scarring it with a curling iron, I have found ending things is the best alternative. I do however appreciate everyone's input, as you all are amazing people, and I wish you nothing but the best.
