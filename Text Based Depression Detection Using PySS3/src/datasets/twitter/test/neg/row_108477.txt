My ex (who I was with for 7 years) is dating my 'friend'He's been dating her 8-9 months now. He and I are 30 and she is 48. She was a mother figure to me. It's mainly my fault we broke up. I cheated on him because I was unhappy. But I still love him. I still do. I can't cope with the blaming myself about how things are, I can't cope knowing they are together, I can't be mad because I deserve it. My head goes round and round and round and round and I'm obsessed. I don't feel like anyone else will ever love me. It's been 2 years since we broke up and I think about him and her 24/7 pretty much. I just want it to stop. And no there's no chance that he will come back to me he wants nothing to do with me. He won't even talk to me. He doesn't care what happens. He knows I've been suicidal over the breakup but it doesn't matter to him. He wants me gone and wants her. I've been thinking about suicide more and more and more and I think it's the only answer. At least I could speak to him again one last time and tell him I love him.
