National Suicide LineWhen you donâ€™t know where to go... you search on google: â€œIâ€™m a failureâ€

Recommending â€”&gt; National helpline - Substance Abuse &amp; Mental Healthâ€™s number. 

*calls number listed* 
Me: Iâ€™m at a loss for words. I donâ€™t know how to explain how Iâ€™ve been feeling. Iâ€™ve been out of the mental ward for 3 months now. 
CS: I am here for you. Let me give you this number. 800-273-8255
Me: ok.

* calls number listed*
Me: I was told to call. 
CS: whatâ€™s going on?
Me: I donâ€™t know... *pause* (me trying to figure out why I want to plunge this Gerber knife vertically down the bluest vein on my left arm) 
CS: hangs up.


â€” if these phone lines have helped you Iâ€™m glad. Iâ€™ve had nothing but inadequate experiences here and in a therapy session. This is literally how quick I was cut off the line. No longer than a minute combined with both help lines. One less poor soul to deal with I guess. Cheers.
