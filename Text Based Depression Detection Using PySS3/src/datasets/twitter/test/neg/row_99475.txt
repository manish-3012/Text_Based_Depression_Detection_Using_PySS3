I'm not sure I'm "bad enough" to go to the hospitalI've been dealing with anxiety and depression for months now. I'm on my 4th week of my 3rd SSRI and just started with a new psychologist today. I lost a good friend of mine to suicide and I always told myself if I ever got bad enough I will admit myself to the local hospital. 

Well I think that time has come. I have been thinking of suicide for days now, I'm just so hopeless on recovery, nothing really brings me joy, and I just want to stay at home and sleep all day. I wake up in the morning and don't want to eat, I've lost weight. Combined with that, I started fantasizing about hurting people tonight at work and it scared the shit out of me. I have an 8 hour shift tomorrow and all I can think about is what if I do actually hurt someone, or myself. I go into the bathroom at work and think about all those bottles of bleach, I think about the oncoming lane on my way home from work, I think about the gun in my dad's safe. 

The thing is. I don't want to kill myself, I don't want to hurt anyone, I want to get better, but the thoughts are getting worse and worse to the point where I don't know if I believe them anymore. I want to go to the hospital tonight, get the care I really need, maybe my medication adjusted, and just a time where I can really work on making myself better. I just feel like they wont admit me because I haven't attempted, nor do I have a solid plan.
