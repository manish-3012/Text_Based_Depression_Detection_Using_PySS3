Hi friendsIâ€™m not really sure why Iâ€™m writing here - it may be more of an outlet to just vent my feelings, Iâ€™m not sure.

Iâ€™ve been on the front lines of COVID - as well as dealing with some real hard things prior to...this has all stacked on and Iâ€™m just...defeated?

I donâ€™t want to hurt myself, honestly, but I canâ€™t stop thinking about the end.  Iâ€™m not sure if that makes sense - but I donâ€™t know how else to explain it.  I am trying to get help, but I just have no one I can really open up to, and it is making it harder.

Iâ€™m here.  Iâ€™m alive.  but god damn am I tired.
