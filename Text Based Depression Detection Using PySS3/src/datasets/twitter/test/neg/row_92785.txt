I think it'll happen this weekend.I'm just so tired of everything. I feel as those people won't miss me if I'm gone. No one has text me in like three days, so it makes sense. I think this weekend I'll just be my "old happy self" and fake smile and all that. Then take the pills that I bought today and enjoy the new found freedom.
