November 27thI've set a date, no going back. No point in trying to change my mind or tell me "it'll get better" cause honestly it won't. I'm just gonna keep passing out or having asthma attacks or having the worst pain in my heart whenever it beats l or keep self harming. I'm done. With everything and everyone. This is it.
