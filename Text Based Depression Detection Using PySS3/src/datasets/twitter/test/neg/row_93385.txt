I feel like a prick when I'm selfish, but I feel insincere when I do nice things for peopleI feel like I'm caught in-between shitty options. I'm very inclined to be trapped in my own head. I'm very introverted and like spending most of my time alone. I don't enjoy socializing that much or hosting dinner parties. Sometimes I get invited over people's houses and get gifts from them, but I don't feel inclined to return the favor, since I barely have the desire to cook for myself. 

I'm constantly told by my family that I'm a selfish person, and I agree with them 100%. The issue is, when I give gifts to certain people, *those* people never express much gratitude, and when I host dinner parties, things go wrong, I cook the wrong thing, someone has a bad time, always. I routinely fuck things up in social settings and feel like I'm being inauthentic to myself, so I'm inclined not to try. The only reason I don't want to kill myself is the idea of how selfish that would be, but my life is a big selfish mess anyways, so sometimes I feel like it doesn't matter.
