Why am I spiraling from ONE THINGI'm transmasculine, and back in June, I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation and long story short, got put on meds that have been going good and working for me, and YET, last night at youth group when I got plopped in the girl group (i'm closeted at church), I went home feeling dysphoric and suicidal, with a sheet of paper I ended up filling with ranty venty notes about how much I wanted to die and how it felt like Hell etc etc, and cried myself to sleep.

Freaking why. Why does it gotta be like this. I should be used to this by now.
