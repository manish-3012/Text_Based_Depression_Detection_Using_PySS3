My arrest has turned my life to misery. I'm sick and tired of trying.My arrest record ruins my life. Everything is a shut door. I may not even be able to join the military which was the one thing I thought I could do to turn my life around and be productive. Now I'm here in my room depressed and just sick of living. I don't get the justice system whatsoever. I can just waste time and sit here and do nothing rather than support my people and land? I cannot do anything but my charge says I'm some criminal and I'm not dangerous AT ALL. I don't even smoke or drink or use bad words for God's sake. I'm super depressed about how my life has turned out.
