Husband threatened divorceMy husband threatened to divorce me tonight because I work too much, even though I've been trying to be more balanced. Divorce was never supposed to be an option for us, I feel so betrayed. He says he might not if things get better, but how am I supposed to work on my marriage with the constant fear/threat of him deciding to leave me. Compared to that I know it's silly, but he also yelled and called me fat. I struggle with my appearance and always took encouragement from him saying I'm beautiful. How am I ever supposed to feel safe, loved, wanted in my marriage again? I don't think I would actually kill myself but it is crossing my mind - he would be happier without me, and I could stop being heartbroken and disappointing him all the time.
