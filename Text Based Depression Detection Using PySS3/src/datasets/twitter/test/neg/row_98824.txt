A strange feeling...It truly is a strange feeling i have right now. One of liberation, relaxation, and happiness. I am finally building up the courage to end my suffering on this planet. I can't live in a world were pain and suffering is everywhere. Where rich people force poor people into wars. Where people starve so that others can eat. Where people are homeless and displaced, so that people can live in a home. I just can't live or justify living in this world anymore. I don't see it as me killing myself. I see it as me liberating myself. I have died before...I know what is next. I have missed the warm embrace of death for over two years now. I just want to go home...Don't know why i am posting this but i guess this is my way to say good-bye.
