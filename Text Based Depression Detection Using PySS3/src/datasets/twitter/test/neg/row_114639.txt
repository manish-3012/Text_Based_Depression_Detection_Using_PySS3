Nobody cares about you or your problemsNot in real life or on social media platforms. The amount of times Iâ€™ve looked for help on various mental health subs all to be ignored because Iâ€™m not a female. 

In real life nobody even asks if youâ€™re alright or talk to you at all. I dress nice, I smell nice, I take care of my appearance and the only way I could make one single friend at college was by drinking. It would be nice for someone to come to talk to me but nobody ever does.

College/ doctors donâ€™t really care, itâ€™s their job to prevent you from ending your life so they attach themselves to you so you donâ€™t and itâ€™s suffocating. When I emailed my well-being team they wouldnâ€™t stop messaging me and coming to visit my apartment. It didnâ€™t feel natural at all it just felt like â€œokay youâ€™re not dead byeâ€. Therapist always watched the clock and I had one single hour to discuss why I felt like shit. After signing up online to 24hour help, I wrote long paragraphs of what my issues were and everything only for the online whatever the fuck person to tell me â€œyeah you should sign up with your well-being team at uni good luckâ€

The only people that care is family but itâ€™s the burden of having to tell them what youâ€™re going through. I donâ€™t like seeing people sad because I made them that way. Iâ€™m also a terrible person and Iâ€™ve affected all my relationships within my family. Yeah they forgave me and stuff but Iâ€™m still the same person. I recognize my issues but I canâ€™t even change I donâ€™t know what it is.

Iâ€™m really just done with life itâ€™s boring and feels like a nightmare. Everything up to now has just been bad with peaks of okay but never great and good.
