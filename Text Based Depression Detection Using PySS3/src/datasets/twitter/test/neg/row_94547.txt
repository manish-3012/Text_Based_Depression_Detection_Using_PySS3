Ever had a â€œbadâ€ acid trip ?Or any bad experience on a hallucinogen? 

Thatâ€™s what my life has felt like for the past two months. Like a bad trip thatâ€™s real and gets more intense by the day. 

Itâ€™s real but at the same time feels like a dream because I never would have imagined it to be possible.
