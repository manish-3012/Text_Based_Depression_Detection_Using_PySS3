I planned to be engaged by the end of the year not dead, but plans change pretty quickly.I've planned killing myself for a long time, for a decade or so. But one thing kept me here and that was my boyfriend. We planned to get engaged soon and I felt like stuff finally starts to work out for me. But I'm not the type who gets a happy ending. He broke up with me.
I'm thinking about doing it on my birthday which is in December. I'll be alone and sad as usual anyways. It seems like a reasonable date.
