They say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem..They say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but it's also the only solution to a permanent problem. 

I've been sick for 6 years now and I'm only slowly getting worse each year. If you're fit and healthy, there still might be a way to fix your problems. 

But for me, there's no hope left.

There's just some things you can't escape.

Peace.
