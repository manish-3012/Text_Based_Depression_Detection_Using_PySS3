Imminent SuicideThe rational side of me is telling me that I'm on here because, deep down, I don't want to die. Here's to hoping that, by typing all of this out, I'll be able to talk myself down from the brink and soldier on.

But a soldier I am not; I can not remember a time when I didn't flee from my problems, when I "manned up" and fixed what I had broken. Maybe it's not in me, or maybe illness is just preventing me from seeing it.

For as long as I can remember, I've been unhappy. Brief moments of enjoyment in life are all-too-often ripped away by sadness and despair, and I've come to believe that the happiness is the abnormality, and the sadness is all that is left of me. I was adopted at birth; my parents took care of me physically and financially, but I never felt emotionally close to them. My dad "apparently" suffers from PTSD from his time in 'Nam, though he has never been diagnosed. He flies off the handle at the slightest provocation, even when what I did shouldn't have provoked anything; as an example, I unplugged our electric leaf blower one time, after cutting the grass, like we did every week. I had forgotten that he wanted to blow out the garage, too; all I would have had to do was stick the plug back in the outlet, but instead, he berated me for three hours, telling me how he was going to kill my dog, how I was an absolute disgrace, how he and my mom were "this close" to a divorce, and it was all my fault. I was probably 13 at the time; and as we all know too well, kids that age don't really pay any attention. This is one of the worst incidents, but it was the norm, and they happened very regularly.

When I was younger, I had an elderly lady for my babysitter; I'd come to rely on her for any emotional support I needed, because I wasn't getting it from my parents. She died when I was 11 or 12, and ever since, I've felt alone and miserable. I had no one to turn to when I felt sad, I couldn't even ask for "fatherly advice;" I had a crush on a girl in elementary school, and my dad makes fun of me to this day for it. No "here's a condom, be safe," no "there are plenty of girls if she doesn't like you." Nothing of the sort, and there never has been. My mother isn't much better; all she can do is spit cliched sayings, most of which don't even apply to what we're talking about.

When I was 16, I started abusing DXM; it's not just "getting drunk off cough syrup," high dosages of the drug cause a dissociative effect. Your mind is separate from your body, and all the concerns you have are swept aside, replaced by blissful unawareness. It got progressively worse over the years, so that by the time I was 19, I would drink two of the large bottles of maximum strength, every few days. I know I did damage to my brain during this time; it's inevitable, and looking back, I can tell I'm not the same person I was before that started. I was highly intelligent; Brown University sent me a recruitment letter without so much as my ACT results, to which my father responded something like "you'll never get in there, why bother to apply?" He was content to send me to the local, small town college, where the accreditation might be valid, but wouldn't be sought after by employers. I had a 35 on the test, the first time I took it when I was a junior, without studying, without test prep, and likely, on a DXM hangover. A couple of months ago, my stepbrother was conversing with my mom, and she made a remark that "she didn't know anyone who had scored higher" on the test than one of my cousins; no mention of her own son, one point away from a perfect result.

I've repeatedly gotten into financial trouble; I suspect it is because I do not see a future for myself, and so don't bother to plan for tomorrow, content to live today and do enough damage to myself that I won't have to worry about it. I currently have a title loan against my family's only car, which will be a month past due come Tuesday, and I don't have the money to pay it; it's only a matter of time before they come and take it away.

I married my wife two years ago on the 20th; I thought she was the best thing that ever happened to me. She came with a kid, but that was okay, too; I wanted a family to love, and to be loved by, some kind of emotional connection that I'd not had since my babysitter died so long ago. Now, we haven't had sex in at least 18 months, and I've been sleeping on the floor, on a pile of pillows, for the last 8 months. We barely speak, and if we do, it's about trivial nonsense. She hugs and kisses me, but it's in the manner you'd hug your grandmother, or kiss your niece; I don't feel any emotional connection coming from her at all, and it kills me inside.

I'll coast for a few years, before something will happen that makes me snap, and lose any sense of emotional stability I had. The most recent came this past October; I worked in a medical office, and did scheduling. We switched providers, and the new one couldn't physically get around as well as the last. I presented several ways of readjusting the schedule, one of which I worked on, at home, over an entire weekend. The other scheduler refused to cooperate, and I was, of course, to blame for the hours-long waits. One of the assistants even took to berating me in the halls, calling out in a sing-song voice about how shitty I was, how I couldn't do my job, how I should just be fired. The physician heard her, and did nothing. I couldn't take the abuse any more, especially when I tried so hard to fix it, and quit.

But the worst bit came a few months ago, when I broke into my father's gun cabinet, and stole his rifles, taking them to pawn to pay for my family's basic needs. I have but a few days to get them back before they go up for sale, and then I'm relegated to 1-5 years in prison for my crimes; I have no doubt my father will press charges.

My family deserves better than be; the 2.5 year old boy loves me unconditionally, but he's still young enough that I can be replaced with little upset. The mother clearly doesn't care any more. I see no future for myself, I see no reason to go on, dragging everyone down around me as I let my life go to shit.

I hear of people with tens of thousands of dollars of debt, and I almost laugh, knowing that five grand would fix all of my money problems. But I don't feel like I'm even worth the stuck-together pennies you pull from your cupholders in your car. What future would I have, what purpose for living, if not to make others miserable by my presence.

I'm going to spend tonight, and maybe tomorrow, with the boy; everything will be routine, we'll probably go to Wal-Mart. I want to see him smile, I want to make sure they have enough to make it for a few weeks after I'm gone. I care about him, and for some reason, I still love his mother more than anything. If for no other reason than that, it's just best that I move on. Eternal nothingness is better than the decades of torment I'd have to endure if I stayed alive.
