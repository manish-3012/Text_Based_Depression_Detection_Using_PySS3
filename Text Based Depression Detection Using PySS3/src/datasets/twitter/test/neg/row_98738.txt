Things have until the 18th to improve.I'm sick of everything getting worse. As soon as I think it can't get worse, something I hadn't even thought of happens. My entire life has become doing nothing because I'm afraid if things getting worse, and I've tired all my options for help. This isn't a life worth living.

So I've set a deadline. Things have to get better before the 18th, and it's already off to a bad start.
