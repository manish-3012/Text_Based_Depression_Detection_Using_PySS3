I've felt this way for 3 days now, and its not getting better.Well, I didn't think I'd ever need to post here again. Guess I was wrong.

The last three days, I've almost killed myself. All three times, I messaged a friend and told him what was going on. He made me keep talking to him and I did. I always sat in the window, and he told me to go back inside, which I did. Tonight he went to bed early and my other friend isn't responding. No one else is awake right now.

I've only today realized how alone I am. It might be time tonight.
