Can't even think of a titleI've always felt like the reason anything falls apart, I feel like I was, am, and always will be the biggest problem with the lives of everyone around me. I want to feel like a remotely likable person. But, when I say that to myself I just think "hahaha, good luck!" (abrupt ending, because I don't know how the fuck to end a post properly)
