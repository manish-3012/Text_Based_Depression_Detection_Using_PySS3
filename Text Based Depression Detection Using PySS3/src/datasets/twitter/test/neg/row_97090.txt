Where do I start?The first time I tried to kill myself, I was 4-6 years old. My brother bullied me so bad. Tried to kill me twice. My parents never believed me. He would beat me up. If I fought back, I'd get in trouble. I suppose that was the premise of my life.

Now, in adulthood, it remains the same in roots, but has evolved and become more complicated than ever. There are way, way, WAY too many things that are stressing me out, in addition to my already fucked-up mentality, and I can't handle it like any normal adult could. I still want to die, and it's just getting worse.

It took a long time for my fiance to pull me out of that hole, and once he did, I was so happy, and I began to feel like life might not be so bad after all. But now that we've moved in together, things have only gotten worse, just as I feared they would. We're still trying to navigate our relationship, and learning how to deal with each other's idiosyncrasies (we're polar opposites and it's exhausting). On top of that, I'm trying to go back and finish school (I dropped out) and I'm on a time limit, and I'm way behind, but doing the work is either boring or stressful and I can only do little chunks at a time.

I only work part-time. My fiance was just laid off. I can't teach my dog to stay home I'm fat. I live with my parents like a fucking loser. Every single day I wake up wishing I hadn't. I just want to die. I just want to die. I just want to fucking die. I'm done. There's no point. No matter how far I get in life, it doesn't matter. I'm done. I've been done. I'm ready to go.
