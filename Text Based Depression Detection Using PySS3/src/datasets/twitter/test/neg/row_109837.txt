It's over in ~3 hours...finally.In about 3 hours I will be taking my own life.
I've always felt that this was the way things would end for me...it was always just a matter of when.

Even when I /mostly/ forgot about my problems...I always still felt like I was just delaying the inevitable.

I've made my life the way it is now; there is no blame.
This is what I've always wanted.

I've made up my mind, but will answer some questions before I go to pass the time. 

Theatrical to the end:
"As he fell to his death, he finally was able to feel free. In that freedom he forgot about pain and worry and was truly happy for the first time in his life. The End."

Edit 2: Still alive...going back to therapy next week.

So tired right now...
