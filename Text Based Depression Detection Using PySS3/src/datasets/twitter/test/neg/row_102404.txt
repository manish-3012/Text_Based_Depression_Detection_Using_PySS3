Iâ€™m suicidal but donâ€™t think I should call a lifeline because Im probably not gonna act on it [yet]. What should I do?
I called a lifeline twice last year and ended up in a psych hospital immediately. The whole experience was extremely dark (especially having to tell my parents) but Iâ€™m not ready to go back there, nor do I think itâ€™s bad enough that I should right now. I was in EMDR therapy before corona, but havenâ€™t been since. I moved over the summer and am working and living on minimum wage/ pay check to pay check. I canâ€™t afford therapy rn so I donâ€™t know what to do. But Iâ€™m NOT okay... at all. Everyone told me last time this happened that I shouldnâ€™t let it get that bad and when I need help I should tell them, but even when I make very clear cries for help, they always get ignored or downplayed. Iâ€™ve literally told my SO several times â€œIâ€™m not okayâ€ and he always just says â€œoh Iâ€™m sorry babyâ€ so I stop talking about it. He knows Iâ€™m not okay and sees me cry all the time but I guess thereâ€™s nothing he can do to help so I feel like no one can. I feel helpless and life feels pointless. I donâ€™t want to hurt people so that holds me back. Killing myself would actually kill my mom. Otherwise Iâ€™d be dead already. But at some point Iâ€™m afraid even that wonâ€™t be enough.
