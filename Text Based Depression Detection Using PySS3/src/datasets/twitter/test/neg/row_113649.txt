Maybe I really am worthless.You know, I was never really popular when I was in the military. If you didnâ€™t workout 3x a day, drank alcohol every night, or went to the strip club outside the base every Saturday, then you werenâ€™t â€œone of themâ€. And, if you werenâ€™t â€œone of themâ€ you were a â€œpiece of shitâ€ or â€œworthless fuckâ€. 

The pieces of shit and worthless fucks were abused on a regular. Often told we should off ourselves off and make the world a better place. I lost one of my close friends that way. His demons got the better of him and he ended it.

I left the service in 2017 but I can still hear them in my head telling me Iâ€™m worthless. I still remember how they treated me.

I went to a therapist and she didnâ€™t help at all. I was looking forward to it too, since she worked with veterans too. But, all she said to me, even after I admitted to trying to blow my brains out, was that she didnâ€™t think my situation was â€œthat seriousâ€ to warrant continuous therapy. 

She said to try writing happy thoughts on index cards whenever I was sad and that weâ€™d meet back up in a few months to see my progress.

I never came back.

Years after the service, Iâ€™m starting to really think Iâ€™m just truly worthless after all. I keep thinking how better life would be for everyone if I really did just end it all. 

My life insurance would pay for my sonâ€™s college and heâ€™d be set for life after high school. Itâ€™d give my brother enough money to move out of mom and dadâ€™s and put a down payment on that 2020 Ford Mustang heâ€™s always been talking about getting. Itâ€™d settle my parentsâ€™ debts...

Itâ€™s enticing, knowing how better off everyone would be without me. A part of me is sad that itâ€™s like that, but... a part of me rejoices thinking that my pain and suffering will finally come to an end. 

Sometimes I hope that things will get better. That Iâ€™ll find my lifeâ€™s value one day. But, then again, maybe I really am just truly worthless after all.
