I can't take it anymoreI don't know what I'm going to accomplish by posting this here. I don't even know if I care anymore. Right now, I feel so angry and alone, like no one in this world could give a damn less about anyone but themselves. My boyfriend, who needs a kidney transplant, is going to be disqualified because we can't afford transportation to the hospital 35 miles away every time they need him there. Nor can we afford to move closer to the hospital. I lost one child already due to adoption, I'm about to pose another because financially we cannot afford a child and I do not believe in abortion. And now I'm going to lose him too. I've lost my family, the majority of my friends, and anyone I do have doesn't seem to give a shit about anything but their own lives. I called a friend the other day about it and they said oh sorry but blah blah blah is what's going on with me. I have no problem supporting my friends in anyway I can, but wtf is the point when they never support me. I've made a lot of mistakes in my life and I'm trying to correct what I've done and make shit better but what is the point when you lose everyone and everything you care about? I just want to give up and shoot myself.
