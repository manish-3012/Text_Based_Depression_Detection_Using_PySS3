i called a hotline and went to the hospitalyesterday i was on the phone with the community crisis centre. the girl on the phone told me she sent over the ambulance but 4 police cars showed up. they came onto my porch and sat with me until an ambulance showed up. there was like 5 people with me and all my neighbors were watching it was weird. someone who saw told my mom bc she showed up. i basically spent the day in the ER waiting for a psychiatrist to show up. iâ€™ve done this at the hospital before and it pretty much ended the same. they didnâ€™t want to hold me in a psych wart because iâ€™d be more anxious from that environment. they put me on a wait list for a councillor and sent me home. iâ€™ve actually been on this wait list before, for a year. they never called me, i guess my mental health isnâ€™t as at risk as i think, at least according to others. they asked me if i wanted to change my antidepressants which i said no because doing that would make me even more vulnerable until my mind gets used to them. iâ€™ve been at home all day today, my friends are all aware of the situation. no one has come to see me. i know itâ€™s selfish for me to want people to drop what they are doing to come see me, but i know theyâ€™re with each other probably getting high. they want to see me tomorrow. is it bad i donâ€™t want to see them? i cant help but feel like a burden to them, itâ€™s a chore to visit me. i donâ€™t want to bring everyone else down with me. there is never a moment in life i feel sane. i feel as if i should try to kill myself late tonight. nothing ever ends good for me. my friends call me selfish and say i make everything about me and itâ€™s true, but i donâ€™t know how to stop and iâ€™d rather give up. im no ones responsibility and i cant help but feel like the world would be a better place for the ones i love once im dead.
