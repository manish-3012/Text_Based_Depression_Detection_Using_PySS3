Are all of us really just useless people. Would the world be better off without me?I have been suicidal since I was 12. I have had numerous failed attempts in my life, the closest two being once I hung myself when I was 14, but the branch broke sometime after I lost consciousness, fortunately I had not broken my neck. The second time I took a bunch of Zolpidem, Vicodin, Dextro-amphetamine and gin about 3 years ago, apparently I threw up and the only side effect is that I now suffer from an irregular heart beat when I'm dehydrated or stressed. I am bipolar and have moments of extreme excitement, but they have been less and less common over the years. People tend to criticize me when I am happy and it is extremely tedious to try to keep myself happy or prevent myself from slipping into depression. For the past 7 years in order to prevent myself from going through with it, I have wrapped myself into relationships where I feel important to someone's well being. For the past 4 years my primary rock has been my girlfriend. Her father committed suicide when she was younger and I was trying to prevent doing the same to her. She was very tough on my self confidence though. She criticized just about any interest I had and told me I looked like an idiot or embarrassed her every time I was happy. By the time she finally started making an effort, and she did, I was a hollow shell of a person. I took in my brother who also tried to kill himself recently (our parents are getting divorced, or grandparents died and my mother went insane and tried to sabotage our lives). But he has been anything but appreciative. He doesn't clean up after himself, he throws parties on weeknights and was horrible to my girlfriend. Eventually she left me and is now living at a much older "ex"-boyfriend's (who apparently raped her best friend while they were dating and the best friend was under age). I found out 90% of her history she told me is a lie. 

I just don't feel very well. I've gone out to try dating again, and I've had some success, but ultimately if I actually start caring about the person I feel like I am just going to bring them down. I've watched the two girls I've dated before turn from driven people to being as depressed as I am. I try to play cheerleader but I can't always. I met a girl this last weekend who blew my socks off. She is quite possibly the most amazing person I have ever met. I felt the same way about her that I felt about my ex when I met her, before I turned her into the cynical, spiteful person that she has been for the past 3 years. I couldn't stop thinking though about how miserable I'd make this girl if I actually started dating her. My life is in shambles and no matter how hard I try I can't seem to get any kind of direction going but down. It seems like the only way I can get my life to move forward is by destroying it. So my plan is thus. I intend to slowly drive everyone in my life away. Hopefully they will stop following or caring about me. This is difficult because I genuinely have a hard time being mean to people, but I hear it comes easily after a while. Hopefully by the time I end up broke and on the street I'll have no one left in my life who cares enough to be hurt by my death. I will try to procure some sort of drug, hopefully ecstasy or something like that, start rolling balls, masturbate one last time and jump off of something really high so that I can feel like I am flying before I suddenly splat and everything stops. This idea excites me to no end, but whenever I feel happy I sabotage myself by trying to wrap myself in more relationships.

I at one point had intentions to write a suicide note. As pretentious as this sounds, I feel like I have an insight on the world that would be verified within the next 200 years. But I just know no one would read it and it would be just get lost and dismissed as an obviously unstable person's ramblings, not to mention it would be very tedious to try to lay out my findings in any way that would make sense to just about any reader but myself. So I have decided to abandon this notion, it would also only cause people to remember me, and I'm pretty sure I don't want that anymore.

My choice isn't immediate and I'm sure I'll be able to take myself out of this before I actually do anything. I'll wrap myself up somewhere else so that I'm constantly just postponing. But I just needed to get that out there.
