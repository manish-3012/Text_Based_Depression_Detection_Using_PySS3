Don't have the guts to end myself...but managed to push myself a lil further todayWanting to end myself has been in my mind for many years.  With highs and lows.  I have moments when the rage in myself blasts out when I get so frustrated with myself I just want to beat my head in til dead.  Today I totally lost it with myself and ended up doing my stupid thing of punch my desk as hard as i can til my hand hurt but this time I had my mobile phone in my hand, and blasted into my forehead a number of times, which I've never done before and i must of hit a same spot a number of times that when I stopped after 3 or 4 times which hurt more than usual, I looked down and thought I was having a nose bleed and when my other half came over to me, said I had managed to cut my forehead open abit and it was bleeding like crazy, at that moment I wishing on myself that I was gonna pass out and kill over or something, I just felt sick, the t shirt is covered in blood.  My other half helped me to stop the bleeding.  I'm fine (outside of my head still hurting, and feeling a lil sick) now just got a cut showing how prophetic I really am.    
I hope you guys don't mind me venting on here, I have no-where else to talk about this to or with. 

I know making yourself bleed is nothing special, but when I made myself bleed outside of cutting I had a strange feeling of knowing I could go further at somepoint.  My biggest disappointment was doing that with my other sitting in the same room when I did it. I didn't want her to see be this, she has enough on her plate without fucking useless bf trying to hurt himself.  When the time comes when I do have the guts to go further, I want to go in with a clear mind and end it without anyone else around.

This post like a previous one I did a while back is abit all over the mind, and my grammar is pretty bad as well. 

But if you did managed to read though my crap, thank you it means so much just to know that someone spent a minute out of their time to read my messed up head.
