I have no more strength leftI have no family to turn to, everything in my life has become unravelled, I donâ€™t see any way out of any of the terrible situations Iâ€™m in. It just doesnâ€™t seem doable anymore. I did everything I could but it just wasnâ€™t enough, and I donâ€™t think I have the strength to fight anymore. I wouldnâ€™t even know who to address a suicide note to. I wish just one of these things would get better. But I know they wonâ€™t. Iâ€™m sorry everyone.
