I am alive, but thatâ€™s not livingIâ€™m writing all of this down with the hope that itâ€™ll be cathartic in some way, because it feels like Iâ€™m standing on the precipice of giving up and Iâ€™ve been told time and time again that things will get â€œbetterâ€. Though I do wonder if I even have a better, perhaps this perpetual partial drowning is my baseline of being. It feels like Iâ€™ve been holding my breath, waiting for the surface that never comes. My lungs burn with the pain of my existence. 

The only things keeping me from letting go are the ones I love, I do not wish to pass this burden onto them and so I carry on. Every morning that I wake the first emotion I feel is disappointment, I am still here. I am alive, but I am not living. 

If given the choice I would much like to live. To feel the warmth of my partners touch and smile, for I am wanted. Instead I ask to be held in the hope that the memory of him holding another fades. To have a father who enjoys my company and guides me in life, instead I am nothing but a mark on his arm, forgotten. To reminisce on a childhood I enjoyed, instead I have torture on demand, memories of my abuse stuck on replay in my head. To hold children of my own and know that they love me, instead I have an IUD to hide my inability to perform the most fundamental aspect of humanity. 

I am tired, so very tired. I am exhausted from the daily struggle with myself, to fight and carry on just so that I may fight and carry on another day. My fuel tank is running on vapours. Help me.
