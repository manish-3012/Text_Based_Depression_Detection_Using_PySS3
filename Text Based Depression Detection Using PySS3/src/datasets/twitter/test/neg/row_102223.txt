The old daysI remember I used to smile see the light in everything, and think about my future. I wanted to become an actor, i wanted to move to another country and study there, I wanted to start my own family and give my kids everything I never had. 

Now I donâ€™t even remember the feeling of it, I donâ€™t even know what the point is. We live in a world where we need to go to school, work and then die. It doesnâ€™t even make sense, I feel like our life should be more than just that and I know we can make our lifeâ€™s the way we want to, but then again we die anyways so what is the point? I know there is people that have it worse then me and I need to be happy with what I have. But honestly I just donâ€™t see the point in living no more, when everything we do is already decided for us
