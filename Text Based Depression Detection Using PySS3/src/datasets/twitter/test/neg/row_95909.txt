I Realize Why I Used to CutThis may come off as obvious to some but I like the pain. I hate it and I know it hurts but I like it because I control it. My mind never shuts off. I feel frantic and I have resorted to something I used to do when I was in Middle School because I hate myself and I do not have it in me to do the final deed. I've posted plenty of times on here (not too many but I obviously need help) and my cries feel so unheard. 

I'm moving with my boyfriend of 8 years and he doesn't know. Don't know how I'll explain the cuts on my wrists but I just don't want to e a part of the world. I'm too angry and weak. I need help.
