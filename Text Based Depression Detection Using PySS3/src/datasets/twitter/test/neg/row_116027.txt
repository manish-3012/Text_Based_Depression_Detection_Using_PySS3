paralyzing anxiety &amp; depression are pushing me to the edge (20F) long postHello,

I've never posted something like this before. I'll try to give a quick rundown as a backstory for anyone who may care enough to click on this post. I hope the language and story itself doesn't come across as dramatic or like I'm whining about anything. I am suffering, and truly don't know what to do.

Basically, I have two types of uncomfortably debilitating trauma (r*pe &amp; molestation) that sends me into dissociative episodes quite frequently. To cope with this, I made the healthy decision to go to counseling at my university. I worked with my counselor, a lovely man, for about a year and a half (November '16-~March '18) to try and understand the trauma better. I definitely have worked extremely hard in this aspect and while I am obviously not comfortable with it, I can cope. I also have history of EDNOS/binge disorder/elements of anorexia, essentially a horrific relationship with food and my weight, AND have a weird form of body dysmorphia where I don't trust mirrors or cameras and have no idea what my body looks like, which obviously bothers me extensively due to my history with body image issues. 

In late Feb. 2018, I experienced an extremely long depressive episode wherein I self-harmed at night to distract myself from the thoughts I was experiencing (never thought I would make it to the age of 20 because my childhood and teen years were spent with severe suicidal ideation [picked a date, harmed, etc., but never really had a plan] and I assumed I would die before then). I was essentially in what several professionals have told me was 'crisis mode' and took it upon myself to go to emergency counseling via my university again (note: at this point had never been diagnosed except by my counselor, had never been to therapy other than counseling), but MY counselor was out for the week and my assigned counselor thought I was having a manic period [note: was not consequently diagnosed with bipolar or borderline although I have suspicions] and sent me to an inpatient facility for about a week. I was put on Lexapro [major depression diagnosis], Seroquel [GAD and sleep aid, at night &amp; PRN], and Vistaril [GAD, 1x daily and PRN]. Lexapro had me manic for a full week which I've heard is a sign it's not compatible with you, but I tried to stay positive after the mood drop and continued to take it. I HATED Seroquel, it fucked with my sleep so horribly that I fully took myself off it after about 3 weeks. I felt guilty about this but at the time I was trying to readjust to going to classes after missing a full week and didn't want my sleep issues to get in the way of it. I had also received follow up instructions from the hospital I was at that essentially told me I only had a 30 day supply of the meds and needed to get a permanent supplier and therapist. 

Naturally, I did not. I tried my hardest, but every local facility never picked up my calls and returned my voicemails when I could not answer the phone. I was playing phone tag with literally fucking no one, and consequently gave up on the search. This is where I began to lose my grip on my motivation to 'get better'. I was able to receive an emergency month's supply after my first prescription ran out from my PCP, but after that month's Lexapro ran out, I convinced myself it was hindering rather than helping me and weaned myself off of it. I have not tried to contact a psychiatrist since, and this was about 1.5 months ago. 

The depressive episode continued, or maybe just blended into the one I'm in now, and post-Lexapro I was experiencing very consistent and DAILY dissociative symptoms. I would 'wake up' from walking around campus and not know how I got to where I was standing. I lost hours upon hours and consequently started to lose my grip on reality. This also didn't help my body dysmorphia and I felt like I was going insane. I had another self harming episode and stopped going to all classes. Instead I would wake up at a random hour in the afternoon, ask a few friends what they were doing, and go and smoke with them. To pinpoint when this started, it was literally right after this year's Passover/my Spring Break, so I've been like this since the beginning of April. I began making jokes about how I hadn't been sober in a month, but they really weren't jokes. I was dependent on the weed for a lot of things, including forcing myself to eat. On Lexapro I was rarely hungry and my stupid eating disordered brain loved it. Off Lexapro, the thought of food made me nauseous and I would start to gag if I tried to eat anything, UNLESS I had smoked weed prior to trying to eat. 

Currently, I take Vistaril PRN and have genuinely not had a single sober day in two months. I've lost all sense of who I am and any of my passions. I have three fucking majors in college that I LOVED. I FUCKING LOVED LEARNING AND WRITING ACADEMIC PAPERS AND DOING WHAT I LOVED. And now my depression is eating me alive and I just don't know how to escape it. I failed all my classes this semester. I gave up completely. I have absolutely no motivation to help myself after phone tag and the medication not helping. I also still cannot see a future for myself and have been getting increasingly more and more suicidal the more anxious I get over letting myself just fail a whole semester and fail myself by not taking care of myself. I don't know if you can tell, but it's one of the most vicious cycles I've been trapped in since I was restricting my calories at 11-18. 

I am home from college for the summer, and my mother knows NOTHING. She thinks I adapted well to being back in classes, or at the very least thinks I passed. She doesn't understand mental illness very well, and it's not like I want to sit her down and tell her, 'Hey, I want to kill myself because I've ruined everything for myself completely'. I also honestly don't care about myself enough to reach out for help. Typing this out right now, it's not even a cry for help. The whole point of this post is me needing coping mechanisms, I guess. I can't eat without nausea, and if I eat while high I eat too much to the point where I feel as though I'll puke. There's no calm medium in my life anymore, and my options are between two extremes. Today, I tried to eat the pasta I had as leftovers from lunch (where I had literally two noodles and gave up) and basically chewed the food until it was mush, spat it out, tried to make myself puke into the sink in front of my mother, started crying, launched into a panic attack, ran downstairs to find my Vistaril in the unpacked car (from moving out of my dorm), and sat in the car for an hour contemplating if I was going to give my life one last try or just kill myself. 

Right now, I do not know where I stand in terms of my own life. I daydream about overdosing. I've gotten to the point where I feel as though nothing would change if I were dead -- which is really bad, considering that when I had suicidal ideation as a teenager, I always told myself that so many people would be sad if I died, and I had things keeping me around; essentially excuses that I guess worked. But now I don't fucking care, I feel like I'm constantly at battle with my brain and if I make the wrong move, I have physiological reactions that I can't quell. Nothing is fun anymore. My self esteem is at an all time low after gaining 20 fucking pounds in 2 months. I want to either be dead or to be at a point in my life where I am fully medicated on something that WORKS for me, and back in school fixing what I created for myself this semester. The latter option takes so much effort, time, and care that I simply do not have. I'm basically toying with my life, lmao. I don't feel like going through month long round of different medications to see 'what works'. I don't feel like dealing with dissociation. I especially do not want to be living in the body I'm in right now. (Another telling sign that I've given up is that when I was younger, I very closely followed the stupid pro-ana mindset of "I can't die until I'm skinny"; but now I'm overweight and if I died this way I wouldn't care.) 

My biggest flaw, as you may have picked up on, is that I am too aware for my own good. I see every path I can take from this very second forward, and some end "well", and some end "badly". I don't know where to sort "killing myself" and "getting help". My apathy is either hindering me from doing what's right (I suppose getting help) or pushing myself to die. There are so, so, so many healthy steps I could take for myself. I could protect myself and help my future. I just can't bear the idea of staying alive long enough to have one. 

I apologize for the long post.
