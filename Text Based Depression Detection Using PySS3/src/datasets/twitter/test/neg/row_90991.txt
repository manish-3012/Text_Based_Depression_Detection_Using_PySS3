I need advice, I feel that I am going to lose a friend or myself...Hello all,

Forgive me if I'm posting in the wrong place, but right now, I am very distraught and need advice on a friend. This may be a very long post...my apologies.

I used to have a good friend, we'll call him Jody. We attended high school together and were both in the jazz band. It wasn't until after I graduated that we became very good friends (he's a year younger than me). This was about a year ago.

Days passed and he decided to trust me fully for some reason. I felt a bit honored since he had so many other friends, but decided to trust me all with his thoughts and things. And I did the same. He showed his true colors as we became better friends, but that just did nothing but concern and worry me.

He always talked about how his life is so miserable. He mentioned something that happened in his past that made him this way. I was never told what it is. He told me how he's sick of all his friends and that he can't trust any of them. What bothered me the most was how he said he just wanted to die. He told me of an almost suicide attempt with his car, but something stopped him from doing it.

Fast forward, he asked me one day if I smoked weed. I said no, and he admitted that he did. He said it's the only way for him to forget. I'm not sure what though. He went further and further into a downwards spiral and I think it was because of his drug usage. It became heavier and heavier to the point where he wouldn't even sleep, but stayed up for 48 hours at a time. He did ask me a few times if I wanted to try it with him. At first, I kept declining. According to his other friends, he was always trying to get someone to smoke with. I remember a time where I needed to talk to him because I was feeling extremely down after my last relationship breakup, but all he replied to me was 'I need drugs.' to which I replied, 'I need hugs.' and he never replied.

Throughout our whole friendship, he was always so nice and comforting to me. He lived over 45 minutes away, but he always offered to come down over just so I could cry on his shoulder. And as I mentioned before, he helped me though my breakup with my last relationship. I was a wreck as it was my first every breakup, but he was very patient with me and knew what to do to cheer me up and give advice. He would always take me to the mall, or just on a drive through the neighborhood, and even we became a little more than friends for a bit. 

Towards the end though, he starting ignored me. He wasn't as friendly as before... it's as if something changed. I knew he was still depressed, but I felt the marijuana usage made it worse. I invited him over to my birthday party, which he didn't come since he 'wasn't down in my area'. Then a few days later was my actual birthday, and he thought I was lying about the whole thing. How it wasn't actually my birthday and all that. That really hurt.

He continued to ignore me even more to the point where he just stopped all contact. I was concerned that something happened. I wanted to write to his parents, telling them of his suicidal thoughts, his almost attempt, and other bad things that happened involving him. I chickened out and never did. However, I did attempt to call his parents while he was away at college, but all I got was the answering machine.

Fast forward to now. Yesterday, I texted him, asking if he wanted to hang out, to which I found out he completely deleted my phone number from his contacts. I instantly started crying, that hurt like hell. I then got angry and started to rant a bit, releasing all the worry, anger, upset thoughts that I suppressed about him. I told him of how I lost two close friends to suicide this year. How I'm depressed beyond belief and stressed out about him. How I lost many other friends this year. How I want to be friends.

I kept crying and crying. What worried me more is his responses. From what I remember, he told me that he's a walking dead man. He says he hates who he became, but there's a good reason for why he is the way he is (I remember him telling me in the past it was because everyone's always mean to him) and that life just goes on. I asked him I'm not sure what he's trying to avoid (meaning why is he avoiding me &amp; our friendship), but he just replied 'life'.

I calmed down a bit and then decided to ask him what did I do wrong that he didn't want to be friends anymore. He said that he hasn't talked to anyone from high school since last year. I half believe that...I know senior year, he has a horrible experience which may result in that, but I still believe I did something wrong to hurt him. What it is, I'm not sure, but it has to be something. But if it's true that he stopped talking to all his high school friends..is that a sign for something? All I did was try to be nice to him, and this is what I get in return... someone who just wants to cease all contact with me. That was the last he texted me.

I thanked him for everything he's done and I appreciate him so much, but as I re-read my text, it looked a bit sarcastic and I hope he didn't intent it that way.

Today, I kept thinking how I acted towards him yesterday, and felt embarrassed. I deleted all the other texts we sent each other and apologized. I really do appreciate him always being there for me, and I want to return the favor so he has someone who will always listen to him. I sent him this text this morning around 10AM and with it, I'm intending to help him through his depression and whatnot: 

    hey listen. I know I'm probably annoying the fuck out of you &amp; im sorry for that, but I wanted to apologize for yesterday. I was having a horrible day yesterday, but there was no need to take it out on you. I feel embarrassed &amp; so bad that I did that, and I'm really sorry. I've had so many things suppressed that it just escalated my bad mood. I just wanted to say I'm really worried about you. I've BEEN worried since last year, to the point where I was going to mail your parents a letter because I didn't know if you were ok or not &amp; needed help. And I know you'd probably say to not worry about you, but I just can't help it. I do that with all my friends. No one should feel like that and I just want to try and makes others happy. I lost two really close friends to suicide &amp; I don't know if I can handle a third. No one should feel like that.
    
    But I just want to start this over. If I asked you if you wanted to hang out, would you? Because that would make me so happy. Even yet, would you still want to be friends? I had fun with you like when we went to the mall or how you helped me get through my breakup (and thank you so much for that...you definitely made it easier for me to go through, and I appreciate it so much. I want to return the favor) and other stupid things. But now, I'm just rambling... Either way, I'm having a party next month and would love t if you came. Please text me back or call me. &gt;

I have yet to receive a response and its 6PM. I feel like he's not going to respond any time soon. I feel horrible, I've been crying these whole two days worrying about him and I haven't eaten since yesterday. He was a great friend and I don't want to lose him. I feel like I already lost him figuratively, however. I feel that I need to be there for him. I'm someone he can trust, he can vent to, hang out with, all those things. I can't imagine losing him for real.

My question is what should I do to save him? I'm really worried with what's he's saying and feel that he's going to commit suicide. I was thinking about calling him in a few hours to ask to talk, but knowing that, he probably won't pick up. I was also thinking of calling or mailing to his parents later on once he goes back to college in August, but I feel that would be too long. I'm at a loss of what to do, I would appreciate all help. I know stressing over him is super detrimental to my health and isn't helping my own depression either.. Thank you :(

EDIT:
Thank you all for listening to my story. I forgot to mention in the previous post... Since junior year of high school, I've always had a bit of a crush on Jody. I did eventually ask him on a date and to prom senior year, which he politely declined. He knew I liked him at first, which is why we didn't become friends until after high school, when I was dating another friend of mine. Eventually after I had the breakup with that friend, Jody hung out more with me and we eventually became FWBs. The last time I saw him was last July. I was confused about my feelings for him, whether or not if I fell in love with him or if it was just lust. He eventually realized this and I think that's a reason why he started to distance himself from me. Later on, I told him through text that I think I've fallen in love with him again, which he told me he already knew. I regretted saying that immediately because I realized I didn't actually love him, I just enjoyed his company and spending time with him as friends. I think this too could be contributing to his lack of communication &amp; I wish I could tell him I made a mistake.

Huh, but before I continue my pointless rambles, I'll stop. I think that's enough. I just hope whatever I'll do will be the right thing for him. I'm so worried.
