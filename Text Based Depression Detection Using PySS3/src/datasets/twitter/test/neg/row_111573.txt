Damaged goods, worthless, and alone.I've been dealing with depression since I was a young teenager. I've been the victim of sexual child abuse as well as bullying and domestic abuse as I got older. Now, 22, I am on academic probation from my second college because every November (birthday month) for the past two years, I get depressed and become afraid to go out in the real world, and stay locked in my bedroom for about two months or more. I play video games for hours and browse the internet -- anything to keep my mind off of my reality. 

It's really easy to stay so alone here because although I currently live with my mom, she and I are 100% enemies. She comes home from work and doesn't say a word to me ever unless it's to criticise or demean me. She's kicked me out at 15 after having gotten knocked up by a guy who was just using me, and only let me back in after forcing me to abort. That was a traumatic experience and I went to therapy for years after that, not just to help with my guilt but also to try and repair my relationship with my mom -- but she never once came with me.  After that ordeal, I graduated high school and was accepted to a four year college, but couldn't get in because she wouldn't cosign my bank loans (I was 17 at the time). Years later, I've gotten married and divorced, hired and fired, dropped out and then reapplied. 

While doing better, (going to school, being more social), my mom and I started arguing more -- this time either about my dog whom she once called the cops on me about (he's a 10lb pomeranian who is the friendliest dog you'll meet) or about smoking weed. Since I was a kid I've been suffering with awful migraines every day of my life when I wake up. After about 10 mins or so they'll usually go away and I can be alright for the day, but other days it makes my whole body ache, I can't leave my bed and I'm incredibly irritable. Smoking marijuana alleviates this. No matter to my mother though, whom went behind my back to have me legally evicted since you can't kick out a full time student on the street in NY. After a bitter argument one weekend, I left to spend a few weeks out of state with my best friend's family. In my six weeks of visiting, I'd been asking friends if they'd let me crash on their couch with my dog for a couple of weeks while I tried to find work and a better living situation. A new friend eagerly welcomed me into their home but then kicked me out a week later because they were so accustomed to their privacy that I suddenly became a burden. 

I legally got my way back into my mother's place, since the eviction hasn't come in and once it does I have 30 days to get out, but I've been even more stressed and depressed now. I've been struggling to find simple clerical work for the past two years and now I have less than two months to find work, save up, and gtfo.Tbh, every night I lay in bed and tell myself it'll be easier if I just kill myself. I've been this way since I was 15 years old and I don't think I can be helped. 

The only times I really feel worth anything is if I'm dating someone who claims to care or the 10 hours of so of comments and karma on my GW pics. 

TL;DR You probably shouldn't read it anyway if it's too long.
