i'm just never good enough.there's too much to write about. essentially i've just been barely irrelevant from most things in my life because there was someone who was literally just a better me or my parents never let me have the same basic experiences as others like watching pokemon or harry potter. life just feels so boring and meaningless because i don't feel any true desire to do anything besides play video games, study, eat or sleep. i've tried to talk with others and while things went well initially, a replacement for me showed up and took what i would have done and did it better than me. i know the lives of others are probably much worse off than i am like those in Cambodia or Africa, but despite what i always like to say, i just want someone to think about me and my happiness too for once.

i feel so useless when it comes to doing anything group related too because afterwards, as much as i feel i made an effort and as much as others would like to say i did, simply from the words they used i could tell they felt i was just as useless as i thought i was. i always thought i could try to make the world a better place, but now i feel like it would be better off without me.
