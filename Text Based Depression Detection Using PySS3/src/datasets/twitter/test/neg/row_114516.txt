I don't get itThis is probably going to sound like I'm an ungrateful little prick but I'll tell it like it is. 

I have no reason to want to kill myself. I have a life many people would want. I'm 16, I've got a car, a great job, a girlfriend, great parents. I'm smart, I've got a lot I could look forward to. But I don't. 

For the last two months or so I've changed quite a bit. I just kind of stopped caring. I lost emotions. I'm not really depressed, I'm just living. I lost most of my friends. I noticed I've become more of a jerk. I'm lazier. In the last month it got more serious. Three times I was ready to hang myself. Three times I was on a chair ready to kick off. Three times I could have ended it. I was ready to, I'm not sure why I didn't. It seems so simple. Less than a minute and I don't have to exist anymore. Nothing to worry about any longer. 

The urge to get it over with comes and goes. Most days I'm fine, just drifting through the daily motions. Hiding what's really going on. But once of twice a week, the thought pops into my head. Not just a quick "hey, if you're dead you don't have to worry" but "hey, do it TONIGHT. You totally could." I plan it all out in my head before I snap back to myself. 

It's weird, but its something I want to do. I've told my girlfriend. She's really supportive and I think if I hadn't have told here I'd've carried through with it. I can't tell my parents. They just wouldn't understand. I can never get the chance to talk to my one true friend to just talk it out. 

Right now I feel like I'm just taking everything from my parents and leaving nothing in return. I just hide in my room hoping for as little human contact as possible. I almost feel like reddit is keeping me alive. It's one place I feel decent at. 

Rant over, thanks for listening.
