I woke upAnd really just donâ€™t want to be here, Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m tired of being okay for other people, Iâ€™m exhausted, I told myself Iâ€™d wait til my grandma left but itâ€™s fucking hard, people constantly telling you youâ€™re stupid for your opinions and Iâ€™m so tired of watching people post racist shit, we didnâ€™t move here for this shit. I have a black boyfriend and I learned so much about his culture itâ€™s so beautiful and seeing people act like theyâ€™re animals hurts because his family took me in. My moms side is Afrolatino and where I come from there is no racism. Hated because of your skin. Iâ€™m really just done. Thereâ€™s no where to go. In fact I donâ€™t think it would shock anyone.
