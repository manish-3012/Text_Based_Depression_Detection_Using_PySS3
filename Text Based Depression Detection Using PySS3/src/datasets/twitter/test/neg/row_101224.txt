Iâ€™m actually considering leaving this planet for the first timeDear all,

I hope you are all doing well during this terrible time, because Iâ€™m certainly not. I am constantly pushing people away including loved ones from my family and my partner because I donâ€™t want them to feel sorry for me for what is coming next. I feel disconnected from them due to my position as a lockdown skeptic, and furthermore I cannot live in a world where my individual freedoms are being taken away. My future career path is essentially dead due to the coronavirus and I have nowhere else to turn to. And for those saying Iâ€™m selfish or a sociopath for not supporting the lockdown, you might be right, which is why I have to end my life now. Iâ€™m surrounded by woods so when I do it nobody will likely find me. Iâ€™m sorry to my friends, family, significant other, pets etc... I have to go.
Love you all
