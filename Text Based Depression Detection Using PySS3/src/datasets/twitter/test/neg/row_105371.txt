I have lost my father, my best friend and my fiancee in less then 4 monthshi,

to whoever reads this right now. To give you guys a better understanding of what my situation is right now i will tell u how my last few month have been.

My best Friend got killed 3 months ago by a piece of shit that has been driving under the influence. My dad was alcoholic and in the end it costed him his life. (Liver failure) He died mid in april. My fiancee had been diagnosed with heart cancer half a year ago and died 1 month ago duo to hearth failure. I dont know what to anymore.

I dont wanna live anymore. I am only 20 year old and got no one in my life anymore. I am sick of trying to get up again after getting knocked down by life over and over again. I dont want people to tell me the happy and good times are about to come around soon. I know that i wont ever be as happy as i was with them. I know that i wont be able to love someone like i loved her. We were together for over six years. I dont really know why i even post this since i dont see a way. How any of you guys here can give me help or comfort in any sort of way. Im sorry if i misspelled anything. This is not my  native language.
