It's going to be soon.I don't know when, but it will be soon. I don't have any friends anymore and my family has confirmed with me that they hate me. I'm not worth anything and I have nothing to live for. My future has nothing in it. My grades are horrible and my physical illnesses keep me from being productive. I don't want to live. I've got infections from cutting and I shake because of painkillers. It's not going to get better for me and I don't deserve to get better. I'm going to write some notes to the people that I used to have. I still love these people and I care about them but they don't even think about me. I just don't know how much longer I can keep going. I've been trying to hold out just in case a miracle happens or I meet someone but false hope is worse than none. I just wanted to tell somebody that I'll be gone soon.
