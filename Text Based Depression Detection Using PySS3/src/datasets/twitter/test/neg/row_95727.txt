Overpopulation is a serious world problem right?So how about i do something useful for once and end my shit life. There's no point in me even living anymore, no one wants to fucking know me. All my friends don't give a shit, they just ignore me like all the freaking time. My family just like to either pander me like i'm a fucking child or tell me how much of a worthless disappointment i am to them. im filth and i need to die cause i'm just taking up space that could be used by someone much less inadequate. Actually you know what, i'm gonna go kill myself right now, im done dealing with absolutely fucking everything. My life is pointless, it'll never get better. Just fuck off if you're gonna tell me otherwise
