My life is going nowhereIdk if this is the place to put this but I dont really know anymore. 

My life is terrible. Not gonna give you the full sad story of how terrible it is but it is horrible. I'm 19 with 1 friend, failing my courses, unemployed and just a lazy asshole. I only enjoy playing video games and that's the only time that I'm actually happy and smiling. Everytime I stop and realise that my life is going nowhere I just want to die. I don't think the world needs or wants me in it. It costs $200+ dollars just to speak to a counselor and I have no idea how much it costs to see a psychiatrist but I can only imagine. These people dont want to help me. They only want my money. Which is something I do not have. It's so sad that I cant even afford to get help for myself. 

What's even worse is I'm a coward. Every day I grab a knife and try to force myself to stab myself in the neck, Or I grab the sleeping pills and try to force myself to swallow them all, or to jump in front of a train... so many things. But I just can't do it. And its killing me... it's so painful living I just dont want to be here anymore. I've tried so hard for 3 years to do something with my life, and here I am... going nowhere. Speaking to a reddit community because I have no where else to go and have no idea what to do. I wish someone would call a hitman to just end my miserable life.
