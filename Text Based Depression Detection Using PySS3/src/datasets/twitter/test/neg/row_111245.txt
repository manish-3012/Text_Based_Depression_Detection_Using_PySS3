I have been feeling suicidal the whole week, just need someone to talk toI have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for over 5 years now. It's cyclical, I feel like a normal person for a couple of weeks, but then it's pure darkness for I don't know how many days. Just absolute hopelessness, ruminations, lack of desire to do anything. I try to breath, I try to occupy my mind with something else, and it may help for a few minutes, even a few hours if I'm lucky. But then it all comes back again. I usually talk myself out of suicide by thinking about my partner and what would happen to her if I die or if she sees my dead body. I can't do that to her. But I can't live like that. I'm so tired of wanting to die that I want to die. My depression has depression at this point haha.

I'm constantly moving, so going to a psychotherapist is not an option. I'm also never alone, so idk how to go about calls. I have never seen text-based sessions. But really though, just having someone to talk to about how I feel would help. If you know how to stop this shit, it would be even better.

It's really late right now, so I might fall asleep pretty soon. But judging by how awful I have been feeling this past week and this november in general, I will still need help tomorrow.
