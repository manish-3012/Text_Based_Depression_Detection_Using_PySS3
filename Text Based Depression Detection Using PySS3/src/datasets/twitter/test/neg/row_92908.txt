I canâ€™t talk to any of my friends abt how Iâ€™m feeling bc Iâ€™m scared theyâ€™ll run away from me.Technically, I really only have one friend. But that just makes me all the more scared to talk abt my feelings. They donâ€™t rly like to talk abt their emotions, theyâ€™re kind and supportive to me but Iâ€™m just scared that if I say too much theyâ€™ll be scared to talk to me. I just wish I could be completely honest with someone without being scared of their reactions.
