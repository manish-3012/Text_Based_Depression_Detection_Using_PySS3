So is this a cry for help subreddit, or a suicide subreddit because as far as I can tell....I'm well versed through the Marines on how to end life and how to make things look like the subject ended their own life/lives. I've offered no less than 8 of you tonight offers of help to either talk it out or how to end it easy with under 60 seconds of pain yet no one has contacted me.

Maybe you assholes should leave this sub and leave it for people who are genuinely hurting and are literally moments from ending their lives. If you want attention it might be better to go to another subreddit because if any one single one of you took me up on my offer you would be deceased by now.

This subreddit is for people that need genuine help, not posers saying mommy took away their toys. I should know, it saved my life just 4 years ago. Fire department picked me up while I was hanging from the noose I was hanging from for about 25 seconds. 

Be men, be women, if you need **real** help, ask.
