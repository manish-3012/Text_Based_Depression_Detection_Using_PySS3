Gf 19, Me 21. Need help with food while finding a job. You're the only ones who will listen.Our parents have basically abandoned us, and we are left to ourselves. We are in immense need of food. 

That is it. We just...need to eat like humans.

Anything that anyone can do to help will literally save our lives. If you want more details, or something doesn't seem to add up, please PM us.

A few months of groceries while we recooperate (sp?) from being raised in a destructive, abusive environment, and while we search for employment, would *literally* be the difference between life and death. My girlfriend is ill....I'm on the edge. Please.

Thank you for anyone who has read this.

edit: Me and the gf are in Houston.

EDIT 2: If anyone wants to purchase my Toshiba Satellite C655, please let me know! It would be the answer I'm looking for...

**Edit 3 - It was my mistake coming on here. The world in its current state and the people that inhabit it cannot possibly understand our plight. My eyes do not deceive me; the health of my wife is declining before me. It is certainly a health issue. It is a sociological issue. It is political. I want to cease asking for help.

Why?

*Because if help does not arrive on swift wings for those all across the globe; the weak, the cold, the hungry, the neglected, the tired, the weary, the suicidal, those who have been abused, and all others who are our own brothers and sisters and our own flesh and blood...If help does not come soon, disaster will. Something big.* 

Thanks anyway, Reddit. I know you tried your best, as did I. **
