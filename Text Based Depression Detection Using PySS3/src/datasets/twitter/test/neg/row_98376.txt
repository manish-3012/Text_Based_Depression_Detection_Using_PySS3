Losing interest in everythingI've always loved drawing, singing and dancing, but lately I'm losing interest in everything i loved, I've been so focus on school in these years that it gave me so much stress and anxiety and i don't really knoe to chop with it. 
Now every time i draw i feel like I'm doing something useless and always stop midway.
I feel like I'm losing myself, i feel like my life is worthless, i feel like I'm just a burden to my parents, i don't know if things will get better i just feel like i don't have the willing to continue this life anymore, i had suicidal thoughs, but i just concluded that I'm a coward and keep running from ending it all.
I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.
