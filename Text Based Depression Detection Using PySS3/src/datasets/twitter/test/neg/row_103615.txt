Should I talk to a counselor?Ive been struggling with depression since I was little. Things have gotten progressively worse since college (im now a junior). Because this is so long term, my depression tends to cycle. also, because of a reaction I had to antidepressants I may be bipolar. Im in a bad low in the cycle right now. Im stressed and want to kill myself. should I talk to a counselor at my school? They sound like hacks. I don't know what the point would be. I probably should be on something for my anxiety but im an addict. I would never tell them that though. My skype is foundwithinme because I dont know. things are bad. Ok
