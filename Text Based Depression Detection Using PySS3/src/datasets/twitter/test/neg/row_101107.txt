What's wrong with not wanting to live?I haven't really wanted to be alive for around the past 8-9 years of my life. I am 19 and have been told i have severe depression and all of that. I just don't understand why I can not logically want to not live. I can enjoy myself every day and i grew up in a great house with very supportive friends and family. I just have no drive. I have no wants to get a job or be a productive member of society. I never have. I have yet to get a job to date. Yet here i am alive. I get that people can enjoy my company and my parents love me but I just do not want to do much. I just sit at home with my parents and i play video games. I talk to my friends online all of the time and have dinner and talk with my parents almost every night. Why can't I just want to be dead without people saying i have some sort of problem. I do not produce any goods or services to a wide enough audience to be able to support myself. I know i am not a burden upon my family, but i do not want them to be stuck with me just idling away my time with them. What is wrong with wanting to be dead?
