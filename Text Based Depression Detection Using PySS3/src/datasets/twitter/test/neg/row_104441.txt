I started self harming and I donâ€™t know why.Since secondary school I have suffered with anxiety and depression in and off. Recently (Iâ€™m now 24) Iâ€™ve been going through a really hard time again with my depression. A few nights ago I was feeling particularly terrible and for some reason I saw a razor on the sink in my bathroom and cut my arm. A few shallow-ish cuts running across my arm. The thing is I donâ€™t really know why I did that. Why did I have the urge to that? I never have before? I donâ€™t even know if it made me feel any better afterwards. I just wondered if anyone else could relate or has had the same feeling g could shed more light on it.
