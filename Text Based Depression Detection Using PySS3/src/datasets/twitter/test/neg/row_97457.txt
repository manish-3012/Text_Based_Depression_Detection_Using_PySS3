My face makes me wish I was deadWhy am I unattractive and weird?

When I was 16, I had this older guy take advantage of me at a party with his friends. They were both 18. Afterward, they ignored me and bragged to their friends, calling me gross. His younger brother was in my grade, and his friends bullied me too before that happened. I had no social media, and they would make posts about how I looked old and that I'm a fat slut. I developed at an early age and continuously told I was overweight and slutty.



They would pick apart my features every day. My lips are too thin, eyes too close together, man jaw, prominent chin, and that I was the ugliest girl in school. I moved away at 18 to a new state; it's been four years since all this happened. The guys in my grade would ask me for sex, but tell me not to tell anyone because I was so ugly. They would say no man will ever want me. They said I'm attractive enough to sleep with but not to be seen with me.



Iâ€™m just saying, why else would people treat me so horribly? Like a random girl from a different school at a party when I was 16 took a photo of me scrunching my face. She egged me on like â€œyou're so cute,â€ then posted it online, making fun of me calling me ratchet and her guy friends saying I look like a 40-year-old b*tch. Why would people do this unless ugly? They were all graduated and 18/19



They would say I'm the grossest girl in school, and any guy who sleeps with me is desperate. They would greet me by telling me I have wrinkles all over my face that I had peeling skin. I was so disgusting I burned and deleted all the photos from school. Is it true when people bully you? It shows their shitty character, not yours? Why else would I be treated this way unless I was hideous and annoying? Was this my fault? Doesn't the bullying show I'm weird?
