Going deafI'm 18 years old and for the past weeks I've been dealing with the deilibitating health anxiety that I'm going deaf. I am a musician who has abused my ears for the past few years significantly. If only someone had warned me about noise induced hearing loss. Yes, I know I'm very stupid. Now I have to give up music to retain the little hearing I have left, my one true passion and I'll still need hearing aids or a cochlear implant. It's not like anybody will care either way, in all my years of music production I don't have any listeners. Not that I was doing it for anyone, I made music as a means of self-expression. Now it was not only a waste of time, but it's left me with a hearing impairment that will only get worse in time. I'm still left with the desire to make more music. I'm proud of what I accomplished for myself and have a ton more creative energy. But it's too late now, I'm doomed. I might as well drown myself in the sea. I've ruined my one body and chance to experience life. Now I'll forever have tinnitus and be regretting my mistakes. There's no point in my living anymore. I wanted to be a teacher but they'll never let me teach now. Besides that, all I wanted was a man but he will never love me, especially now I may not be able to hear him next time we meet. This man is the best person I've ever met. I know I can never be happy with anybody else. But he will never be mine for numerous reasons. I want the waves to wash away all my mistakes, and become one with the world. This year was the best of my life, but it wasn't good enough for me. I can't go into the future so haunted by my past. Nothing can help me now. Music can't calm me now. It's time to become made of air.
