The thoughts won't go away helpMore and more I begin to have these attacks of the world is better off without me. The feelings are so strong, I've never felt something like this before. I constantly think of killing myself and for a while my medication and girlfriend were helping me but just now I have broken up with her because I think I will kill myself soon and I don't want to put that on her. I have begun to make some of my friends hate me, in hopes that they will have nothing to do with me if I finally end it all. I have cut my arm so bad and that doesn't help either. My mind is telling me that this is the right thing to do so I don't bring anyone else down with me.
