Support and some help.I really donâ€™t know how to start one of these but Iâ€™ll just start with the facts I know off the top of my head.

I am a 14 year old who has been having on-off bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 3ish months if I can recall correctly,the reason for this being is my dad died back in April(he had been suffering from a variety of illnesses and sickness for years before his death)

Now,before assumptions are made Iâ€™d just like to say I loved my dad so so so much,one of the greatest fathers ever in my opinion but then again everyone would say that.

My mother handled his death,well,as well as any loving wife could handle the death of an amazing husband and father I guess?

Back to the point,I am from an asain background(my mum being the asain)and due to this without my British dad as the sort of,border between me and my mums full wrath and lectures I have to put up with her at times,exteremely petty attitude and lectures,often at times being called stupid,an idiot etc etc.

I am really just sick and tired of being screamed and shouted at for honestly the most basic shit,my mental condition isnâ€™t in the greatest state after seeing my dad battle with cancer and diabetes for 4 years roughly.

I know this sounds like a scream for personal attention and a LOOK AT ME sort of post but I really just want a friend I can open up with and talk to.

Due to me being homeschooled my social aspects are extremely restricted and I only have about 3 actual friends,none of which I really talk to,hence why my entire social life is online.

Im sorry if this post is breaking some sort of guideline or rule but I honestly donâ€™t know what other sub to put this under,Iâ€™m getting desperate T this stage.
Thank you to everyone that reads this.
