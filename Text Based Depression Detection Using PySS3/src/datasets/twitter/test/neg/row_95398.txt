I'm a side characterI'm 14. Just started out in a new school. Its a private school and most people in my suburb can't afford it. My younger brother has been at this school for the past year so I didn't really have a choice of schools. It was either this or 50 kids in one class. I only have about 3 or 4 friends in the school that I previously knew from primary school, but most of my best friends are in a different school. They knew me and I knew them. We would get along well and they knew I've attempted suicide a few times before. In this new school, I struggle to talk about all of the times I tried to kill myself. I have no good reputation or anything. In primary school I was kind of the nerd, but very easy going and extroverted. Now I'm just another person. I'm not saying that I'm used to being pampered or being treated differently than anyone else, I just feel so lost. I'm so afraid to talk about my mental health issues to new people because suicide is looked down on very harshly in my country. I haven't even spoken to my parents much about it either. I went to a therapist once and it helped me for a month or two. After that I enjoyed life a lot. My dad bought an old car that him and I would restore and it helped a lot. I enjoy that sort of thing. Then we sent the car in to be painted by a friend of my dad's. The car has been there for the last 5 months. I don't have much else to keep me busy, I have basically nothing that keeps me happy in the long term. I just get an hour or so of tricking myself into feeling happy by playing video games and doing various chores. I don't have a long term escape. If I had a handgun I would've been gone with my first attempt two years ago. I've worked hard to achieve good grades and to please my parents, but in the end, the harder you work and the more successful you become, you just chip away at your soul until there's nothing left. I don't even take insults about my depression seriously anymore. I used to be so offended but now I just see it as words. You think suicide is selfish? Then go think what you want and I'll be happy if I could be selfish then. Why do humans exist? We built cities and monuments for what reason? Are we just here to be surrounded by people in a competition to see who is more successful? But in the end we are surrounded but still alone.
