A changeI need a change of my life. Like a complete one. Kind of want to reset it all over again. I'm tired of this life and I just want it to end already. This life doesn't seem worth living anymore. It seems like no matter what I do, nothing seems to make me feel that I should live. 

I'm so tired of finding ways to make myself feel so empty and dead inside.
