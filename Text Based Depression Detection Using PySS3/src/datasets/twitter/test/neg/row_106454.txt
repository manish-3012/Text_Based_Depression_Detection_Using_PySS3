having mostly grown up mentally ill/suicidal...Did anyone have difficulty thinking up or talking about goals and "the future" because it just didn't feel like something you'd have? Thoughts like "oh well I'll be gone/dead before I get there" about stuff you'd have to do as an adult?? 

Assuming you're now an "adult", do you now feel lost and get thoughts like "I wasn't supposed to make it this far" or anything like that? 

If you've already gotten through that point and figured out "how to adult" or whatever... What was it like? How long did it take? What helped? Anything? 


(I'm twenty and I've been mentally ill for like ever and I have a handful or so of stuff like childhood traumas including CSA...)
