I just want to give up at this pointEveryone that helped me is gone. I havenâ€™t seen any of them since March and only talked to two of them until July. 

My best friend, someone who ripped a knife out of my hand when he caught me cutting and held onto me when he saw me climbing over a bride railing, couldnâ€™t hang on and hung himself back in July. He called me to say goodbye and forgot to hang up, he sounded drunk or on something, I heard the chair fall to the side. I couldnâ€™t save him like he saved me, so why should I stay. 

Iâ€™ve already tried once during quarantine and passed it off as an accident when I failed again (Anaphylactic shock as an attempt, got a epipen to the leg). 

I havenâ€™t been self harm clean for more then a few days at a time. I donâ€™t want to be anyways, pain is the only thing I can feel anymore. 

Why not give up? Just OD on sleeping meds, I can just go to sleep and never wake up. 
It would be so easy.
