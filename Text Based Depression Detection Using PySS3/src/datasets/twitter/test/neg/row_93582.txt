I genuinely donâ€™t want to die just want things to get betterI turn 27 next month. Iâ€™ve never had a serious relationship, only fuck boy things. I want kids and a family. I just donâ€™t see it happening for me..the more I age. Itâ€™s weird because I do like myself, iâ€™m giving and I do believe Iâ€™m a light in this world. but Iâ€™m too sensitive to live in this world- Iâ€™m not a tough person. I can barely afford my townhouse right now, my precious Persian cat is the only thing making me wait another day. I just hate that if I were to kill myself it would cause grief. Losing my dad to cancer 10 years ago is grief I donâ€™t want to give to mom, sister and brothers. I have a gun to use in March, Iâ€™m 
giving life another shot until then.
