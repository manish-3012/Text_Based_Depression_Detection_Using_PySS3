I just told my stepdad I hate him and I want to hurt/ kill myselfI admit I shouldnâ€™t have said it but I did so thereâ€™s nothing I can do now. The asshole doesnâ€™t do anything and blames my mom for everything that happens. He tries to act like he this great husband when in reality no one in my house (including his own son at times) can stand him (aside from my mom). My mom came into my room afterward and asked why I said it and â€œwhatâ€™s wrong with you, what has he done to you?â€ even though the issue was never what heâ€™s done to me but how he treats my mom. I feel ill and I want to kill my self.
