Is suicidal thoughts common?Hey there,

I too, as many of you probably, have/had/will have thoughts about suicide.

I was wondering how common it is. Why do I have to have this thoughts if not everyone have them? 

What makes people who have not had this thought stay away from them even if they are in a shitty position?

Is it just thoughts that come to people who are failure like myself? 

But no, that cannot be true, since there are famous people who did suicide, along with the funniest man on Earth. Robin Williams.

To me, it seems as if suicide is a logical, yet extreme, option. If things are really out of hand, you have just take the "safe" root out. 

But why would I, come to this conclusion? if it was not logical. Even if you have depression as I am, sure logic seems logic.
