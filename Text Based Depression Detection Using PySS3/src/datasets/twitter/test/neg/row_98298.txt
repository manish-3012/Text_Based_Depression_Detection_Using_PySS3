Is it normal for a boring day to trigger your depression?So, I am a 15 year old freshman in High-School, just to be frank, and went to my classes. However, none of my friends were in any of my classes, which led to me being all lonely and depressed the whole day, making me suicidal and numb as hell. The last few days were harder for me, though Wednesday was the worst. Not sure if this is weird or not lol.
