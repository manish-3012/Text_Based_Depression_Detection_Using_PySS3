loss of friendsso I don't know whether to write it here but it seems a suitable place
so I was always a friendly person despite depression and anxiety and had a lot of acquaintances and a small group of friends. We all lived nearby in university dorms but things changed this year and we don't anymore. We now live in different parts of the city. As a result, it's difficult for us to meet every day and as a big group. Some even said they don't want to travel that far to see me. Yikes. Not everyone though. My social life is inexistent right now. This makes my depression worse, as well as suicidal thoughts. it's like nobody needs me. what do I do? I can't beg people to hang out with me and it's kinda difficult to adjust to a lonely life
