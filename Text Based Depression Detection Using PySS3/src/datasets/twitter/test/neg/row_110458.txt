Talked to my flatmate for maybe 6 hours, everything he said was right, positive and in no way condescending or unjust. What they talked about made sense and we agreed on many reasons why I should be positive and keep going. So why is my first instinct on getting to bed that I should kill myself?Fuck me the overwhelming desire/drive to do it is crippling and intoxicating.
