Iâ€™m past my breaking pointI have a kid that I love and I feel like he will be better off without a mentally ill mother. My husband would be better off without me  I have a history of suicide attempts, depression, anxiety, and I am at a place where I feel desperate for help and scared I might become more suicidal. Iâ€™m scared to reach out to my husband or therapist because I donâ€™t want to end up in a hospital again. I donâ€™t know how to talk to someone without them flipping out and me getting carted away again but my mental health is really deteriorating fast this time and itâ€™s scary losing control like this.
