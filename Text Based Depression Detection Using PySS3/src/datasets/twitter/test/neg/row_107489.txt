Thank you âœ¨Hellow \^u\^

My first important exam this semester is on friday, and I already decided that I'm not gonna be here that day - yay no need to study! God I hate exams. Well I mean, the 6 hours ones, where I just have to sit by myself facing a computer or a paper and a pencil are completely fine, but when I have to prove my knowledge and worth to other people for them to judge me? When I'm basically worthless? No thank you.

Luckily (or not so luckily for my mom, I love you mom) my mom take a lot of strong pills because of her condition, if I just get a little drunk and mix some of them together I should be okay from what I've read, and with okay I mean dead obviously. And if I die in a lot of pain, I probably deserved that too.

Well, I actually just wanted to say thank you to you all.. I've been here on multiple accounts, never made a post like this (simply because I'm a pusspuss and too scared of regretting) but I've talked to so many amazing people with similar thoughts as mine - people I've been so grateful knowing, even tho a lot of them were on their way to a better place when I met them - I hope we'll get to party together in a multiverse and be just be happy and free or something like that! - People who've really changed my thoughts about a lot of stuff. But yeah, this subreddit is a beautiful place.. harsh at the same time tho, but it has really given me a lot of insight. And talking to some of these people has really made me feel something.. for the first time in a long time. So thank you for that.

To you who even care to wonder what went wrong in my life, lemme try and explain. Long story short; I've always been this shy, unconfident alien, caring a lot about how people were seeing me. School has always been a very important part of my life.. It was the only thing I was kinda good at - I wanted to be the best, and I was for quite a long time. I did everything to perfection. I got straight A's and I was so motivated - god knows why. When I got into what we here see as high school (3 year period before university), everything changed. I was not like the other girls from my class. I felt like they were so much older than me, they were drinking, partying, just having the time of their lives, I was just me, reading books and my biggest worry was that people wouldn't like me. I tried to become just good enough... Anorexia hit me hard, my brain wasn't what it used to and that ruined me. I started fainting in class, and at museums, at home etc. But I was doing fine, I was still getting good grades, I was still doing everything to perfection.

In the end of 2nd year, my parents and teachers decided, that this wasn't healthy (I mean, looking back now, I was pretty damn destroyed but oh well), them telling me to take a break ruined everything, I was strong enough to keep going. I felt like the biggest failure, I was the biggest failure. Still am, still feel it. I lost all motivation, I still this day wish I could go back and just.. me that me. 

I started taking classes again last winter, I've never felt so worthless and I find everything pointless. If everything went as planned I would be ready for uni next summer, heh I guess not. To study Astrophysics to be exact tho. Space has always been my thing, where I felt safe - darkness and with the stars and planets as my buddies. And oh lets not forget the black holes too!

But lemme be real. I have a great life. I have the most amazing and supporting parents, I have the best brothers and that's the thing.. I've already peeked, my life can only go downhill from here and it will fuck me over. I will keep failing, I'll start losing people. I am just not a good person, and I take everything for granted. I feel so guilty and I don't deserve to be here. Every other person would be more than grateful to be in my position, but I'm just not. I dream about more, I want multiverses, I wanna travel in space and time, I wanna touch the stars (okay not touch them, but you know what I mean.. I hope)

Well I don't know what else to say, don't even know if anyone reads this. But thank you if you do.

And oh, one last thing. Please please send me your favorite song(s), that would be so appreciated. I need to blast my ears with good music till the moment I die. Thanks âœ¨
