Hereâ€™s to hoping I donâ€™t wake up.I pretend Iâ€™m fine, but really Iâ€™m just a ticking time bomb. Have been for the past three years. I just feel so lost, so empty, so.... cold? I just feel cold inside. I hate lying to people and telling them Iâ€™ve been getting better. What the fuck does â€˜betterâ€™ even mean when I lay in bed every night and fantasize about all the ways I could possibly end this? I want to, but I donâ€™t think I have the courage to. I just want a reason to live. Or a person to live for, I guess.
