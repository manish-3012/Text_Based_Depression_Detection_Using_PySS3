I finally wrote my notes.Iâ€™ve been thinking for a while about what I wanted to say and who I wanted to write to. I finally decided on just my parents and my girlfriend. It hurt a lot to finally put my feelings into directed words but at the same time I feel kind of numb to it. What hurts the most is knowing the affect the it will have on them. As much as I want to tell myself that they will move on and find happiness elsewhere I feel as if it isnâ€™t true. Am I being selfish for making these plans? Is it my fault? Is it even anyoneâ€™s fault? I donâ€™t know. All I know is that Iâ€™m sorry. Im sorry to anyone who cares about me. The last thing I want to do is hurt others, especially my loved ones, but I just donâ€™t feel like I belong here anymore. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this. And sorry for posting twice in the same night. Mind has been active tonight.
