I hate "it will get better" sentenceWhy? Because it's a fucking lie. It never get's better. It is only getting worse with every day. 

I got dumped by the person i wanted to spend the life with, and i honestly believed "it will get better", i fucking trusted again. And what i got? After giving all i can to someone i get dumped, because apparently all i could give was still worth less to her than a cheating ex, who suddenly remembers that she exists!

And yet, people try to tell me to belive in myself, that i need self esteem. HOW, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO BELIVE IN MYSELF WHEN I AM SO FUCKING WORTHLESS TO EVERYONE AROUND

I just don't have it in me anymore, can't sleep without pills, can't eat, can't think, i just want it to end.
