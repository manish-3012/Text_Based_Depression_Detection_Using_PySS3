Few days left.I always had thoughts like "If life doesn't get better I'll kill myself in exactly one year" since I was 14. Im 23 now and life never got better. I always wanted to keep trying but I'm sick of trying. I will stop trying. Just a few days and everything will be fine. A few days of preperation and I will never feel any pain again. Ever.

I've literally tried everything. I always thought "yeah finding a therapist is hard but after some time you found one!"..yea,seems like its not that in germany. Im looking for a therapist since I was 15. Almost 8 years now. Of course not non stop,I usually search for a few months until I literally called every therapist near me and then I'll wait a year and try it again. They usually just tell me "No space" or "I can't help you,you need to finde someone else". In the past 6 months I've called around 150 therapists.

I feel like a robot just going thru life. Nothing is fun for me,everything is exhausting. Last year I've lost my Mother due to cancer. My dad is going to die in the next few years and my girlfriend left me a month ago due to extrem jealous problems on my side (even tho she was on a similar level but somehow her jealousy changed in like one week). I tried to help everyone,I've tried to be there for everyone. I'm losing every single person in my life,doesn't matter if family or friends,everyone is leaving me. Nothing has changed in 8 years. Im going to force a change. 

Im sorry dad,im sorry for everyone who cares or cared about me but I cant keep going. Im not going to write a farewell letter. No one will ever know the reason and thats okay. Thanks for reading. Bye.
