I have given upI was bullied all through school and high school it got so bad i had to drop out my senior year since then i have just being wasting my life for 3 years now i have done nothing but sit and my room and rot video games used to help me take my mind of things now they don't even help me i never go outside i barley eat anymore i never even take showers anymore my anxiety has gotten extremely bad my mom throws me out almost everyday i will probably be homeless soon my parents have both made it clear they don't care if i kill myself so i don't know what is holding me back i have no friends no girlfriend nothing i don't know why i'm holding on still i want to die no one would notice or care if i ended things i am a waste of a life and i am pretty much worthless at this point. i keep hoping things will change but they wont if i don't kill myself i will just end up homeless probably on drugs to ease the pain i think me dying would be better than letting myself be destroyed i would rather die before the last piece of who i was ends up destroyed i just want to leave and find peace and happiness that is all i want is peace and happiness
