venting

Iâ€™m literally on the brink of just taking every pill I can find. The only thing stopping me is the financial problems. But whats the use? 

The north korea stuff triggered the fuck out of me snd all i can think of now is â€œim going to die.â€ I wanted only ME to die not my friends and brothers. Iâ€™ve already been suicidal for a while now but this has pushed me so much.

I cant concentrate on two weeks worth amount of work due that i have to turn in tomorrow, i cant do anything but wallow. I told my mom i wanted to kill myself hoping she would take me to a crisis center so i could calm down and be stopped cause im really fucking scared but she didnt care and i dont know what to do anymore.

Theres not a day i dont rock myself because of how stressed and anxious i am. Theres not a day i dont contemplate killing myself. I relapsed with self harm recently too. Im just a big fuck up and i dont want to be here anymore.

I have to turn in all of this work tomorrow AND a novel but ive been in such a depressive state that i havent been able to finish (charter school btw). I tried emailing my teacher but she called bullshit on me and told me i can do it all anyway and im stressed to the point where if i even look at it i break down. I have the worst migraine right now and i cant even fucking comprehend the fucking letters! Im going to show up there and embarrass myself looking like a fucking bum im so disgusting

I keep getting phrases stuck in my head and its frustrating the fuck out of me and i just want to pull out all of my fucking hair
