I donâ€™t know what to doI am a male and am 17. I have been battling depression  for a few years and finally spoke out and asked for help. But my parents think I am lying. Today I got my grades and they are not good  I am  going to remain in the same class. I am really depressed about it and the only thing I think about is ending it. I just donâ€™t know what to do. I know it seems crazy but I donâ€™t wanna live with this stress and lack of happiness anymore. Maybe I just need somebody to talk idk what should I do? Sorry for bad English it is not my native language.
