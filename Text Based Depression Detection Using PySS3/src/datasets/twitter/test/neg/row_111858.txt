Suicide Watch, I have no one to talk to because of what I've done. I feel like I have no choice. Here's my story. I lost most of my friends after the college transition. I didn't bother to make friends my first year, didn't see the need. Now in my second year, I broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years to win the heart of someone else, who happened to be in a relationship, but promised that she cared and needed something to motivate her.

I come from an abusive household. My father was very wealthy, but very angry. I remember thinking I was going to die at my father's hands at very young age. But I think I'm past that now.

I don't feel like there's anyone there. I feel my emotions flipping to extremes, and detached from everything. I think I might have Borderline Personality Disorder, but I don't want help. 

Someone tell me it will be okay. Even though I don't think it will, even though I don't want to find someone else, or put myself out to get the support I need.... I want to be alone, but being alone drives me insane. I don't want any of it. I feel exhausted. I've felt this way for at least the last 4-5 months. Help.  


EDIT* - That girl I tried to go after... she broke up with her boyfriend and got back together with him. She won't talk to me (understandable), and I work with her very closely in my job (which I might lose). 

EDIT*2 - I will respond within 5 minutes of you posting in the next hour.
