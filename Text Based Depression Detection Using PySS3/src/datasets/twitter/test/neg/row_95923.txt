i chickened outmy dad and his girlfriend just broke up. we live with her and shes so manipulative that she made my dad financially dependent on her. so now we have nothing. i was so depressed that i cut my leg several times but it was never deep enough. so i tied a belt noose and hung it on my doorknob. after around two minutes my breathing sounded loud and i was dizzy. i was scared someone would hear my breathing and find me before i died so i stopped. my neck feels weird now. i fucking hate life.
