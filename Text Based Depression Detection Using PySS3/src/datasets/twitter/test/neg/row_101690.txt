I was going to attempt suicide yesterday but I was too lazyI was going to buy sleeping pills and alcohol at walmart until I got there and the parking lot was full for the holidays. I'm too lazy to walk that far from the door or stand in line too long. I sat in the parking lot and cried for a bit. Then drove to  eat chick fil a. Now I have no money to buy the stuff. I left my phone at home on accident. My mother went up to my job to put it in the car but I never went. She was looking for me for 8 hours. I sat in parking lots around town in the cold until 11pm when my shift would be over. She was calling hospitals and everyone she knew. She told she was crying and thought i had been robbed and kidnapped. ( no one would kidnap me lol)
