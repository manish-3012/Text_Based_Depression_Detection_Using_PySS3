I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to make it past 2021Iâ€™d give a nice long rant and explanation but to be honest Iâ€™m just so tired at this point and I donâ€™t have the emotional capacity to think about it right now. This last year was so damn hard, even without corona, and I donâ€™t think this next year is going to be any different. Iâ€™m not sure how Iâ€™m even still alive but idk how much longer thatâ€™s gonna be the case.
