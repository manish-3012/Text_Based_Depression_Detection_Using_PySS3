Classic suicidal venting wankerThrowing a trigger warning: suicide, self harm, drugs and alcohol 

Having some real trouble seeking appropriate advice and have intention to further my problems by necking it. Not the first time and hopefully the last.  Been to hospo a few times because of it in the last 12 months. 

Reverted back to self mutilation to cope but that isnâ€™t working. Tried to calm by smoking up, again, little to no effect. Opted to drinking and Valium (not a regular drinker) and even that wonâ€™t settle me. 

Background: have had DV (domestic violence) problems at home with a very hostile younger brother, pressure to achieve at work, my mother recently having some surgery and regularly moves between Melbourne and Hobart. extreme expectations of myself, beginning a course at uni and not being able to see my regular psychiatrist for 2 months because he took on too many patients too quickly. I donâ€™t have a friend or trusted source to express my concern to, but cannot see a future anymore. 

Not even a month ago I was good to go, excited about future, and Iâ€™m that was the prospect of an esteem building surgery to help my body confidence. I no longer want to attend training or sport (usually an AFL and netball player), have cancelled any future mental health based appointments, and withdrawn from my course. Id prefer to prepare myself for my end date at this point. 

I hate the fact that colleagues and family are commenting on my poor attitude, my mother telling me to â€˜cheer upâ€™ and that Iâ€™m overloading her stress levels. 

I hate who I am, what I do and see no purpose in moving forward in life anymore; Iâ€™m no longer a reliable or helpful person that can achieve anything, and cannot see a purpose of moving forward to achieve anything.

I donâ€™t expect or want responses, Iâ€™m sorry that I am burdening this threat with my whinging. just canâ€™t have it all internalised. Iâ€™m sorry for fuckin yâ€™all over because I canâ€™t manage on my own.
