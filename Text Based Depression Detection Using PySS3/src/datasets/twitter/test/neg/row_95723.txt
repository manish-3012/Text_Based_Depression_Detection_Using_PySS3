Suicidal Post-ConcussionI got a terrible concussion about 7 months ago. It was really bad. I still have a lot of symptoms and I still can't play sports. Way back before this had happened I had been cutting/suicidal from the beginning of 8th grade-half way through 10th. I'm a type-A kind of person, 5 out of 6 of my classes are APs, I have a 4.5 cumulative GPA (3.8 unweighted) etc etc. I realized I was freaking retarded for being depressed constantly and managed to move on. Junior year was great. I was happy, had tons of friends, starting varsity on basketball and lacrosse (still JV in soccer though). I got my concussion at the end of junior year and it all went down hill. My grades dropped (4.0 weighted 2 quarters straight), I isolated myself from some of my more athletic friend, and I was told by my parents and sports med doctor that I really should think long and hard about ever playing sports again.

I thought long and hard, and decided to try to start running before deciding. Bad idea. I collapsed from dizziness every time. I quit lacrosse. I quit soccer. I quit basketball. Started running everyday. First just down the street, slowly increasing my distance. I still got headaches. Grades were still bad. Still can't concentrate. I went to a neurologist and she gave me a steroids to stop headaches. I hasn't worked, just made me sick. 

I now have slight anger problems that scare some old friends away. I'm disrespectful to people. I know its a bad thing but I can't help it. It just happens. I can't concentrate on anything. And I don't know when it started, if it was right after the concussion or right after I had to quit sports but I keep feeling like my life is honestly pointless now. I have short term memory problems, I'm in constant trouble with my parents, my grades keep dropping, I'm no longer the superstar athlete  used to be. I know I'm young but I don't know why this came back. I can't tell my parents. My dad thinks that I'm still faking my headaches and my mom doesn't believe in mental illnesses. I honestly don't know what to do anymore.
