I've literally spent the last 19 hours sitting in bed.I hate everything right now.
People keep telling me that life gets better and all this crap, what does life magically stop sucking so bad?
Im sincerely thinking about ending it soon. What does it matter, none of this matters. We are tiny men going about our tiny lives. Nothing makes me happy anymore. In fact, it makes me more depressed doing the things I use to enjoy; knowing I don't enjoy them anymore. 

What do.
