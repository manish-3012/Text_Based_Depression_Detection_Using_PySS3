overdosing as a call for help (1800mg ibuprofen)im not even sure if i want to completely die but i've made the decision to OD as a call for help almost...
i took 1800mg ibuprofen (in advil liquigels) and i'm about to take 4000mg acetaminophen (in tylenol extra strengths) because i'm afraid the ibuprofen won't work. i'm a 16 year old girl that's about 117-120 pounds... what's going to happen to me?
please answer as soon as you can
