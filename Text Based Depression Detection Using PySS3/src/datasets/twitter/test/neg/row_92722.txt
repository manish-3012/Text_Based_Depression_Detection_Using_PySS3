I've considered ending my life today and I can't seem to find anyone to talk about it.Hi. If this is the wrong place to talk to then you can just tell me where to go and I'll post there.

My life is pretty shitty at the moment. Today I really felt like that my life is absolutely worthless and not worth living. I thought hard about it and I'm getting afraid that it won't get better. Maybe this will sound melodramatic but that's how I feel.

I'm doing terrible at school and I'm not getting any student loans because I haven't finished enough studies. I can't seem to have a normal conversation without coming of as a fucking inconsiderate douche. I'm really starting to wonder if I'm an extremely uncomfortable person to be around. I have pretty shitty sleep schedule and I'm pretty tired at the moment (I couldn't sleep but I'm going to take a nap after I finished this post). My knee is damaged because of faulty training, and now I'm having a hard time exercising, the one thing I felt I was reasonably good at. I can't seem to focus on classes or friends talking to me and I seem to constantly zone out. I hate my life.

I suspect I have ADHD and I've tried to seek help for it. But it takes a long time and I will get help in about 2-3 months. Today I just wanted to curl in my bed and die. I talked to them and they said that there is no chance to hasten the process.

I've tried to call a few suicide/urgency-hotlines but they've all been busy or the line wasn't open at that moment. I don't think I'll really kill myself. The thought of my family living with that is horrible to me and I just can't do that to them.

I've tried commiting sucide back when I was a teenger but I failed. I don't think I will do it now but today I just really wanted to die.

I talked to a nurse and he suggested that I should go to acute psychiatric ward (I don't know what it's called in english, I live in sweden) and see if they could help me. He suggested that I could maybe get anti-anxiety meds and hold on to that until I can get ADHD-medication. I think it sounds a bit retarded but maybe it will help, I'm not sure. I'm going there later tonight and we'll see what they have to say.

It's weird, I feel like if I'm not shouting at the top of my lungs and attempting to jump from a building at this moment it's not considered serious enough to treat it.

This post doesn't really have a point, but I just wanted to talk with someone and maybe get advice. Whenever I talk to people about this they always seem to refer me to someone else. On every webpage on suicide it always says that there is hope and that you always can get help but I just can't seem to find it. I'm grateful for getting help on my suspected ADHD but it feels so far away and I don't want to feel like I'm on constantly the edge for two months.

I just wanted to share how I was feeling. If there is something unclear then tell me and I'll explain. I'm going to try to take a nap and see if I'll feel better. Thanks for listening.

Edit: Took a nap. Feel better now. Thanks for listening you guys. It means a lot.
