Confused and feeling alone, just need to get this stuff out of my headFour failed suicide attempts over the past eight months, last attempt was last week and it was the closest I have come to succeeding.
I find I am at a terrifying crossroads right now. I am either about to change my life for good and simply no longer care what people think (an idea that frightens me) or I am going to remain miserable living a life I feel is expected of me because it seems easier in the short term and no one needs to know just how miserable I really am.
I want escapeâ€¦and the escape is either change my life radically and put up with the scary unknown or take the easy route and just end it all. I donâ€™t want to end it all most of the time, but it seems easier than the healthy alternative when things get too intense.

What exactly is wrong? I am not sure. In love with a guy who canâ€™t be in a relationship as he just got out of a LTR and needs to â€˜find himselfâ€™ again. I also have feelings for another man who cant do the relationship thing either as it causes him intense anxiety about his own perceived failings and social awkwardness. He likes me but it depressed him to be with me because he does not feel good enough.
I am worthy of something more than both these men can offer, I am worthy of some sort of commitment but the problem is, I see these guys as the only two I am willing to share my true self with. Rationally I know that placing myself on hold for these guys is silly. Rationally I know that there are other guys out there, guys who are just as great, guys I can learn to trust and let myself go with, butâ€¦
It is not my rational side that is winning these days. 
I suddenly lost a parent a few months ago, something that shook me to my core. 
I am two credits away from obtaining my honours degree but I have been so depressed I have not been able to concentrate on my studies whatsoever, at this point, I wont be getting this degree I have worked so hard to achieve. I have serious issues when it comes to failure, being a high school drop out, not getting this degree is pretty fucking devastating.
That said, I am not sure why I care about the school thing. It is mostly my fears of what others will think of meâ€¦the degree is not for me, it is more for themâ€¦it for me in that I don have to worry about looking like an all out failure in their eyesâ€¦
I am ranting here. I donâ€™t know why I am posting this. I have no one to talk to and the fact that I came so close to actually overdosing last weekâ€¦oh god.
