Hydrogen Sulfide gas/Japan suicide craze EXPERIENCEI did the Japan suicide craze/hydrogen sulfide gas suicide method attempt. I tried this method because it is labeled on the Internet as a painless method of suicide because you pass out and then feel nothing. This was false for me (Please note that I have a low pain tolerance. I cry when I get vaccines; I wince and whimper a lot when I do finger prick blood drawings). There were a lot of painful complications 20 minutes after I mixed the chemicals to make the H2S gas and as it increased in concentration/ppm. My eyes were burning like crazy as if someone was pouring hot sauce into them and they kept watering so I had to dry them oftenly. My skin was itchy and burning as if ants were crawling all over it. My windpipe got tighter and it became harder to breathe. Each cough hurt more than the one before it. The smell was painful to ingest; it smelled like the fart someone would produce after eating boiled eggs, being piped into your nostrils.

After realising that I would die an agonizing death, I got out of the airtight pocket I was in and breathed in the fresh air outside. I aired everything out to 0 ppm of H2S, packed everything up and left in defeat -- excessive pain inhibited me from tasting the sweet goodness of death. This is why I am choosing to do inert gas suicide because there is more research on it about it being a painless method of suicide. Inert gas and all of the essential paraphernalia for suicide is expensive though and I'm barely getting paid but I am dying by it soon.

Chemicals I used for H2S: Lime Sulfur dip for Pets (I diluted it myself with water) and Lysol toilet bowl cleaner which has Hydrochloric acid.

So, it was painful for me and it might be painful for you too but you are free to do whatever you want.
