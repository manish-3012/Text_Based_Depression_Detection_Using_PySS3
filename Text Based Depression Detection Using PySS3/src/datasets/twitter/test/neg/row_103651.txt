Trying hard not to kill myself over disgusting, vile things I did in high school.I've been in a downward depression spiral over the past few weeks, mainly over the question: "Am I a good person?" I'm now 26, and I've definitely made some mistakes in my adulthood that have been hard to forgive myself for. 

Last night, though, it culminated in me deciding to go through my Facebook from high school years, and what I found has made me absolutely sick to my stomach and feeling more strongly like I deserve to die than I ever have before. 

For context, I'm white and went to a mostly white Catholic school. I befriended a girl senior year that I tried to be really edgy and funny with. Things I would absolutely never even think of these days (i.e. we basically had a burn book for people we thought were gross/ugly/fat. Many of whom never did anything to us, which breaks my heart to think about). 

However, in my memory most of this vileness was contained to our private conversations. Last night, though, I found (PUBLIC) posts from 8-10 years ago like: 

* "Yo n\*g!" (calling each other that) 
* A song we wrote about Jewish people and posted (neither of us are Jewish). 
* Generally a LOT of "Jew" comments back and forth. I guess we had called each other that for fun. A lot of stupid, immature stereotype jokes, too, like about pennies, noses, etc. 
* A post where we were bashing our AP English professor for her summary of "Heart of Darkness," where I said she'd just say "black people and jungle love" (I don't know if I was quoting her or just making a quick racist interpretation).  
* Nasty comments about someone we called "troll" (I literally don't even know who it is we were talking about). 

I spent the entire night sobbing and vomiting. Since college, I've tried to actively educate myself on the hardships of marginalized people and how to be a better ally. So when I found this, it was like seeing someone else had hacked my account--I truly don't even recognize this person. 

And I have no idea what my motive was for posting these types of things publicly. I guess I was trying to be funny. I was definitely not cool in high school, so I suppose I thought no one would see them or was paying attention. I was kind of like the middle-level between popular and outcast, and I think it turned me into a monster trying to get noticed and be liked. 

I wouldn't even know where to begin with making amends--I did have friends who were Jewish and POC outside of my high school, and I'm not sure if they saw this or not. I don't want to blindly reach out to people and assume they saw it. What would I even say? How could I tell them I'm not a monster anymore? 

I really can't live with myself knowing there are probably some people out there--high school acquaintances, former friends, etc.--that know me for these racist remarks. I have contemplated suicide for years, but I've never felt so intensely ready to do it, like it's my only option. 

**tl;dr: I found extremely offensive things that I used to post with a friend on Facebook, and I want to take my life. Does anyone have experience with this? How did you forgive yourself?**
