I need help, everything has gone wrong.Hey everyone,

I doubt anyone cares but I'm about to enter the worst state of my whole life. I'm about to fail out of university, my love life is going absolutely nowhere, my family and in particular my dad are going to think I'm a dissapointing failure of a son. I don't think I can do this anymore and I might kill myself soon. I don't want to be a burden on anyone any longer, everything points to me being a failure at 23 years old with no talents, the only thing I care about anymore is fashion but it's not gonna be enough to stop me. I just....I don't know what to do and I guess I'm looking for help.
