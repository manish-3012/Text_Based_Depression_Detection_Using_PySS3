Why do people act like moving on from an ex is easy?Seriously every person I try to open up to about how I miss my ex and how I feel like I'm lost without her or how I can't breathe, they all just say I have to move on and forget about her. It's been a year and half but it's not getting any easier. I'm not sure it ever will. It's completely destroyed me and I'm not coping at all, everyday I wake up wishing I didn't. I just don't know what to do.
