I hate my life.Im 20, I have no friends, I have never had a girlfriend, I have lost all my passions, I don't enjoy anything.  
  
I am currently in an unpaid work placement for 3 months which involves staring at a spreadsheet from 9-5. This is a requirement for the degree I am doing at college and have no interest in. My parents are pressuring me to get a job since I will be finishing my course in a few months and have no money.  
  
I have anxiety problems and feel numb in social situations. I can't motivate myself to do things and need approval from other people. I get frustrated when I fail at anything and am always angry at myself.   
  
I am most happy in bed or when I am engrossed in a movie or video game and distracted from reality. I have suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. I don't want to kill myself but I have been stuck in this cycle for so long and can't endure it any longer.
