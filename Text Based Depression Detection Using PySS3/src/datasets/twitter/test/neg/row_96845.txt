I had the bottle in my handsI was going to do it, none of my friends cared to listen when I tried to tell them. Now they're worried because I posted about being done, which I am. I'm called a pathetic person because I am petty apparently. I throw myself a pity party because my life is hard. I am a selfish bitch that just wants more and more, but give nothing in return. Great. Glad to know how my family sees me. The only reason I didn't do it. Family? Nope. Friends? Nope. My so? Yes and no. But I only didn't do it because of my one best friend, she listened to me rant for an hour of all the shit that has built up over the past few months that I tried to tell people about, but they wouldn't listen. I tried therapy, it didn't work, but I tried to let it work. This one friend is everything to me and I wouldn't be alive because of her.
