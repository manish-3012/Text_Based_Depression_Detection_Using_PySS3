It is currently 4:30 AMAnd I can't sleep, I gave up on sleeping. I've had insomnia since I was 5, I'm so tired man, I just want it all to end, I feel so weak and useless all the time, my brother works in a workshop and I can't even make a bed without getting tired. WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?! Am I lazy? Why can't I do anything? I can't even draw anymore since I can't find enjoyment in it. Falling asleep and not waking up wouldn't be so bad. I feel suicidal, and im scared, I'm afraid of being alone with myself. For fear of what I might do, I might pull out my hair, or punch myself in the head, or call myself a coward, I might even go get a knife and cut myself again. I'm just go fucking afraid man. I'm 13, I shouldn't be dealing with this. I just wanna be like a normal kid, in school, happy. I can't even talk to people anymore... I'm to afraid... this was a stupid rant, you can ignore it if you want, I don't care.
