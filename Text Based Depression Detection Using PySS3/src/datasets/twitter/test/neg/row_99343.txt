stressed, trying to finish a project but my mind is blank, want to take a bunch of pills but not diedying would break my family. i can't do that. i have things to live for

but im so tired and i just need. a break

i think i'll take way less than the lethal dose and hope for the best

i've also been working on this project for hours now and my mind is blank though i know what i'm doing. and my mother is very angry as it's due tomorrow

i'll finish it and then take the pills

then maybe tell her

if i die and my family sees this give all my stuff to izzy

edit: I contemplated taking them all night but eventually sleep won over. my mom knows now and she's taking me to the ER later today. thanks for the replies, through, they helped
