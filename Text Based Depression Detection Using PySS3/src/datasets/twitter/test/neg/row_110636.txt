Falling even deeper
I've been seriously thinking about killing myself for months now. It's always been something I thought of doing, but it was never this bad. Now, it literally consumes my whole entire day, nearly every day. I have all the things I would need to do it with, and no reason not to do it.

I am completely alone. My boyfriend of 2 years broke up with me in June, my family has never noticed me, they don't even acknowledge me when I speak to them, I have no friends whatsoever, and people pass me over when i do try to reach out. I come from what some may consider an abusive background. I don't have any real plans for my life, although I do go to college, but I feel it is a waste of time and money because the only thing I really want to do is die. It's not about being broken up with or my family or anything. Those things are just extra shitty add ons to an already shitty situation. It's about me, feeling completely drained and worthless and sad and alone every day of my life. The only thing that makes me happy is thinking about dying. I get maybe 5 good days out of a whole entire month, and the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I'm afraid to hurt other people. But I've gotten to the point where I don't care so much. People are selfish and think nothing of me 99.9% of the time, so I really don't owe anyone much of anything. No one deserves to live their life sad and broken the way that I do, and I am tired of being the one to do it for everyone else's sake.

I have exactly one week before I am supposed to return to college. I don't know what is going to happen and I could use someone to talk to.
