17yo lost cause - tonight :(Three benzos plenty of opioids just so I can finally rest easy. It has taken so much out of me but this has to happen today. I feel so sad about everything I have already / will miss out on. I wish i could have gone to school and had friends. I wish girls liked me. I wish I could get into a college and have some direction. Iâ€™m just a depressed 4th grader that has ballooned into a ptsd teen junkie. Iâ€™m sorry if you feel the way I do. I donâ€™t think I am lost potential I think it is meant to be like this. â€œWhat an artist dies in meâ€
Goodbye Julia, Rocky, Mom, and sweet little boy Alfie... Iâ€™m so sorry....
