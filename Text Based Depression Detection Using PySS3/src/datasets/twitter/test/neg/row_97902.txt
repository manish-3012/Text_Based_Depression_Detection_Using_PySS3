Advice after my husband attempt and potential hospital releaseMy husband of 7 years made an attempt almost two weeks ago after a (what seems to me like a) rapid 2 week spiral but he said he was hiding if for a few months.  He's currently physically well, staying in a mental health ward, starting to seem like his old self again and he says he's feeling better.  When I had a family conference it didn't seem like they wanted him to stay much longer and are forced on moving to outpatient care.  He's been given more and more privileges I think the end of inpatient is near. 

Although he has a history of suicidal depression,  the last bout of it was well before my time so this is new to me.  He hasn't wanted anyone to be told about this so I've been dealing on my own although some people at work know because it's impacted my work a bit. 

I have an awkward problem I dunno how to work through.   

We have a trip to Hawaii booked a week from today.  First week was to be a romantic getaway for us and the second week he was to come home and I had to stay for work.  At one point a source of excitement, now this whole thing is awkward and overwhelming and I don't know how to handle it. 

For the record, the work part in two weeks is not optional.  Getting outta it jeopardizes my job (I'm the only bread winner right now).  The romantic getaway is optional. 

If he's out,  should I actually be thinking of traveling with him?  Would it help his recovery to be in a calm beautiful place?  Or make him worse because he's not really around outpatient resources or routine?  How do I handle him alone for a week when he was suppose to fly home and be alone?

If he remains an inpatient,  what do I do?  He wants me to go without him (but this also was said when he still planned to not be alive at that point) but I wouldn't want the optional part away from him because it would probably just be sad for me but he struggles with the guilt (lost monitary investments when he's not even working and its already tight and taking away this from me).   What if he's released while I'm away?  No one else knows about this to step up. It feels like I'm abandoning him in an institution.  

Any advice?
