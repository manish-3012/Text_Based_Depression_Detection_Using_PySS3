I want to dieIâ€™m 14 year old and I want to die. I have the idea only adults are posting in this sub, so I have the idea only adults are the ones that sometimes really do have depression. I know others of my age sometimes say something like they want to die, but I have the idea they are just saying shit because they donâ€™t seem really depressed. So my point is.. is something wrong with me? 

When you read this you probably think like *contact an adult* or something, but I donâ€™t see the point of that. School will still stay boring, Iâ€™ll still be useless and life will still be pointless. 

I also donâ€™t want to hurt my familyâ€™s feelings if I really do commit suicide, but I also donâ€™t want to move on like this. I live in the Netherlands and I have a course on school thatâ€™s called VWO (the highest and most difficult course). School gives me way to much stress because of all that homework and stuff. My family, primary school friends and teachers all told me stuff like youâ€™re so smart and stuff, but I donâ€™t see the point of using that. Sometimes I just wish I was more â€normalâ€ and had less stress about school.

I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m just feeling down or have severe depression. I donâ€™t know what I should do. I find living further like this really not an option, but commiting suicide will probably hurt my family a lit. At least, Thanks for reading my post. Have a nice day.
