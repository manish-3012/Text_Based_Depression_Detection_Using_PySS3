Feeling selfish and useless.I want to reach out. There's nobody there. There never has been really. If there was, who would care? I've fought with these thoughts a million times, but things are getting progressively worse. Last time I called a hotline, the lady was kind; but her advice was to read a book and get some sleep. Needless to say, I don't think she understood.

Nobody can put themselves in my position. Nobody cares to see things from where I am. I confronted a close friend (nearly family) today because I was told that she didn't see me as a good mother. Which has honestly fucked me up pretty badly since I heard it. I've tried so fucking hard. I'm doing it basically by myself. When I confronted her, she made ME feel bad for confronting her. She doesn't care about me. I only exist to care about others and to get hurt. Apparently my kids deserve better than someone who caters to them every waking moment and makes sure everything is taken care of on top of working full time and dealing with many problems. I've been a shitty kid, a shitty friend, a shitty mom. I can't do anything right.

Idk. It can't be that everyone else is wrong. If I'm trying my hardest and not living up to everyone's expectations, what's the point? I haven't stopped crying since last night. I can't see things getting better. What am I doing wrong?
