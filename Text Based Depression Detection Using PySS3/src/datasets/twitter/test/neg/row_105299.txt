My dog is dying &amp; My dad has cancerMy childhood dog died of Valley Fever last year. My rabbit unexpectedly died in my arms a couple months ago. Last June, I rescued a dog who makes me want to live. He has controlled Valley Fever, but now has Aspergillus. Treatment will be thousands and it isn't guaranteed that he can be treated. 

My parents go back and forth from "it's too expensive" to "you aren't allowed to use your savings, we have it covered." I thought the other two deaths would be the end for me, but I know this one will do me in. He's another kind of special.

To top it off, my dad was recently diagnosed with cancer. They thought he had years, but it has spread, and my parents won't tell me how bad it is. I can't bring myself to ask.

I'm the one who wants to die, it's fucked up everyone else is dying instead
