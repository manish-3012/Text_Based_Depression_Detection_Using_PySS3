A little poem to the girl whoâ€™s caused me to end my life at such a young age.On sweet summers nights I rest in my chair
On sweet summer nights I breath the cool air,
On sweet summer nights my mind flies free
Yet, on sweet summer nights you savagely haunt me,
 
I converse with the Devil as you taunt me
Break me down and unravel me
Strip me bare of all my sanity
And corrupt my shattered remnants of humanity
 
From the shadows you creep upon hearing me weep
 Your deception and lies, they render me weak,
I canâ€™t push on with you in my clique
I hope that soon Death and I speak
 
For on sweet summer nights I hunt for rest
Yet you sink your teeth deep in my neck
Sapping my blood and bruising me deep
Alas, my time has come for eternal sleep
