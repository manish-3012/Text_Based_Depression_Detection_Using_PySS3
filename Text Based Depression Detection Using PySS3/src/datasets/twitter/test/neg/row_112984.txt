A wash.
I am sitting waiting for death because I lack the courage to confront it on my own terms. I have nothing but hate for myself and everyone else. I can not hide my contempt and I try to fade into the back round. It is all and always perspective. My brass ring is non-existence, and this is repugnant to those that hold life so dear. I will die. I hope on my own terms.
