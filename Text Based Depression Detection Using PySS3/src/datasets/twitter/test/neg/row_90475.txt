All I want is to either stop feeling this way or end it.I busted my ass for over half an hour trying to figure out what the fuck to write. How to word what I have to say and figure out if I even have something worth saying to say in the first place.
In 3 hours and 20 minutes, I'll be 21 years old. And I've never felt lonelier in my life.
I'm ugly, unattractive, and when your own mum is willing to put her hand in her pocket to pay for you to get therapy, what more proof do you need that you're a useless, pathetic, flawed piece of shit?
My boyfriend lives 3,000 kilometres away. He says he loves me, but I don't believe him. I know the only reason he bothers with me is because he can't do any better.
My dad never gave a shit about me. He'd rather drink coffee with his asshole friends than give a shit about his daughter.
I was terrible at making friends and got bullied relentlessly throughout school.
I was so lonely and miserably and he never gave a shit about me.
My brother's shitheaded friends stole my favorite painting right out of my house when I trusted my house to him for a party last week.
And my cat will most likely die in surgery tonight.
I failed my midterms because I was lazy and all I do is cause pain to my mum. It's all I've ever done. I just wish I could disappear and never be found again.
I'm so sorry I'm such a useless ugly pathetic fucking burden.
