Help I'm losing hopeI'm done
This past month and a half has been the hardest thing I've ever been through, I'm so exhausted and nothing is getting better.

My boyfriend left me (who I moved state for), leaving me with ridiculous amounts of debt and stuck in a lease I can't break and can't leave my housemates with as they can't afford it
So having to deal with heartbreak as well as all that and being in a state with no friends or family
I lost my job and I cannot get another one and in running out of money

I can't stop thinking about killing myself
I wish I was dead
Nothing is getting better
Everyone is better off without me
What is the point of anything anymore

He has ruined my life
