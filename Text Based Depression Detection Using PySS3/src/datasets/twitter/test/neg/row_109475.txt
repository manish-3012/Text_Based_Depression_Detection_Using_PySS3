i donâ€™t want to die but iâ€™ve got no choiceim currently in recovery for my anxiety and severe depression. ive been on meds and i receive therapy. my parents used to be very very supportive of me and i have a few close friends who are encouraging and caring. i started improving slowly and even if i had some bad moments, i could get back up after some time. things seemed to be better but last week, i started to feel very depressed again and i had a really bad anxiety attack that lasted almost an hour. i attempted suicide in the past and thought that i would never really try to do it again because of the aftermath but this time, i felt like it was the only way out since it seemed that i wasnâ€™t getting better mentally despite all the help i got. however, i was able to stop myself from doing it and resorted to self-harm, which is at least â€œbetterâ€ than killing myself.

i opened up to my parents about this (except the self-harming part) because they always talk about how i should open up more to them and also since i felt that it was a good thing that i didnâ€™t succumb to suicide. however, their reaction was really unexpected. they were angry with me and started saying the meanest things iâ€™ve ever heard them say. they said that i was hopeless and that itâ€™s impossible to help me anymore. they started saying that im not trying hard enough to recover and that im not putting any effort whatsoever. when i heard this, i felt my world crumbling into pieces. this happened about 3 days ago. since then, i havenâ€™t talked to my mother and conversations with my dad are very triggering.

im in the middle of my school exams as well right now and i cant get myself to study for them. im setting myself up for failure. i really just want to end this suffering. ive been dealing with my mental illnesses for 6 years and iâ€™m just extremely tired of everything. to be very honest, i donâ€™t really want to die, i just want this to stop. i feel like im extremely burdensome to my parents and this is no longer just a feeling but itâ€™s a fact. theyâ€™ve said it themselves. i donâ€™t want to die but what choice have i got? i donâ€™t want to keep living like this and nothing seems to solve my problems. im definitely going to hell for trying to kill myself so i hope God will be forgiving
