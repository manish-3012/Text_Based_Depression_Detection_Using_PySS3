Why does life have to be like this?Why does every day have to hurt? 

Why do I have to live now, in this life, in this body, in this time?

Why do I have to be so useless and ineffective and helpless?

Why does everyone have to explicitly tell me that they don't want to see me ever again?

Why can't life make sense?

Why can't I be happy?

Why can't I be healthy?

Why can't I live somewhere I want to live? In a place where people accept me as who I am?

Why can't anyone live the way they want to?
