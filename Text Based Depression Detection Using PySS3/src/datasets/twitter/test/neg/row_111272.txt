Please help meMy mind won't leave me alone. I just cut myself for the first time in three years.

This whole fucking pandemic has put my back to square one. I fully relapsed, and I'm one hundred percent sure that at 22 I will kill myself.

Not that I want to. I just know I will.

With Covid-19, my mental state collapsed. Apparently it's some disorder where I can't adapt to sudden changes in my environment? I don't know.

I'm this fucked up now. What's going to happen when I transition to working?

The answer is I won't. Even if I get better from all of this, I'll just relapse again. Maybe I should just kill myself on my birthday?

I'll probably do it far away, where no one can find me. That way anyone who does care about me won't blame themselves for my suicide. I'll just be missing.

Six more years left. October 24, 2026. I'll see you all there.
