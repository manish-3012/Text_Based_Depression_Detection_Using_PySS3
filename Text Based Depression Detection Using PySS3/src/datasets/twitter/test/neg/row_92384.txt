So, Im here for creative ideas or suicideI do not own any property, little to no savings, I got bullied at my last two jobs, I have no career, I have no real friends, I have a mother that supports me and I live in the same flat with her. Im 22 years old, my job sucks, I have no motivation to comtinue this shit. I speak German (fluently), Italian and English. Currently, I live in Northern Italy and Im contemplating suicide. So, Im open for new ideas, that do not pressure me into killing myself. I had the thought to go to Germany and start training on a real Job? 
But Im not sure if anyone actually wants me. I would also do a lot of Jobs nobody would like to do, I just want to get out of my shitty Job in logistics. I only carry heavy shit all day and I have no job security. In a month or so I will also be unemployed again. My current life is a mess and I dont see a future the way Im living life currently. At any time a robot could replace me and I have no real skills. Im setting myself a deathline, if my situation doesnt improve until the age of 24/25, I will shoot my fuckin head off.
