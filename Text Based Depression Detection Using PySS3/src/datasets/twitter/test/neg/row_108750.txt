idk...My problem isn't really that severe, I just want some advice. 15-yo high school student with mild depression and low self esteem. I'm not really a loner per se because I have a group of close friends that are relatively popular. That's kind of the problem though, since I have some esteem problems, I see all of my friends talking to girls and being social, but I can't because I feel like I'm too ugly or fat to. I've talked to some of them before about my depression but they act all kiss ass for like 2-3 days and just forget about it. I don't really want to tell them too much though because I'm afraid they'll be too kind and we won't joke around the have any fun; but sometimes they take it too far. It's kind of taken a toll on my self esteem and makes me feel like shit sometimes. My parents don't really help either, I mean they're fine. My mom has been through some stress and depression recently because of the passing of my grandpa (not only mentally but financially as well). I get called ugly and fat, but it's always jokingly (I guess). The mirror doesn't really contradict that either. I just want some advice to deal with my self esteem and depression. Thanks.
