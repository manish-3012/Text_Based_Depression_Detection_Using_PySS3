im ready to dieeverything is my fault. i ruined my sister's birthday. my mom isnt talking to me bc i didnt have the guts to tell her i was suicidal. i'm too scared to talk to my dad because im afraid itll be awkward. im fucking pathetic. i feel so alone. maybe its better that they hate me, so they wont care when im dead. 

school's starting soon. i have a feeling i wont make it. i somehow feel calm, knowing that i wont have to live in this hell anymore. everybody will be better off without me. m a burden to my family. i have no talent, ambition, hobbies, or hope for the future. whats the point of living? why do i need to try so hard everday just to barely get by? why should i work my ass of at school if i'm going to end up with a shitty 9-5 job that'll barely pay my rent? 

life is so pointless. i'm done trying to get better. evrytime things are looking up i fall into a deeper hole. i feel like everything i do is just an attempt to make others proud. i'm not living for myself. i'd much rather not be here in the first place.

 im ready to die, and i couldnt feel more at peace.
