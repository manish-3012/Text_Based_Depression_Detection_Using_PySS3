I'm constantly taking depression naps to escape reality and feel like I have nothing to live for.I posted this to another sub earlier.

&gt;I'm genuinely contemplating suicide and don't know what to do. I have zero IRL friends, my family won't understand how to handle things, and if I try to talk to my online friend I'd feel guilty about worrying them emotionally. I spend all my free time taking depression naps and I can't handle being lonely anymore.

I don't know what to do. I've been thinking about it every day for the past few months and the thought of ending it all is amplifying with each passing day. I want things to get better but I know life isn't a fairy tale. All I really want out of life is to be loved and form a connection with someone and I feel like I don't belong anywhere.
