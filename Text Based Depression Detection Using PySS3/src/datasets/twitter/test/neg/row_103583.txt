I think this is itHello im 23 years old and live in Melbourne Australia 

I have always had the thought of sucide in the back of my head and it's coming up again much harder this time 

I live at home with my mother and she never says it but i am in the way and she wants me gone i cannot hold a job no matter what i do ive gone through countless jobs time and time agian i currently have a 2 day a week job but had a fight with somebody in my work uniform and have a interview with the boss and im %90 sure im going to be let go

I am stuck in a endless loop of spending all my money on drugs especially weed 

I am a complete  failure who shouldn't have even been born as i was a accident 

I have asphergers and cannot hold friendships ive lost countless freinds and that ones i do have are on a knifes edge or we are in constant arguments 

Its so weird i can tell people on the internet about this but expressing my feelings to family and friends is terrifying 

Im so sick of week after week being the same over and over 

If i loose this job tomorrow my mother is probably going to kick me out and ill be homeless and even if that does not happen i cant stand to be a disappointment to her anymore or a burden

Ive never in my life had a girlfriend or fallen in love not once and i never will im just going to be alone

Im so lost and i just want to end it im over suffering depression and anxiety im sick of the heavy feeling in my chest and the shortness of breath

I have made so many bad decisions in my life and ruined one of my ex best mates lives and the guilt tears me apart 

I just want to leave this planet i want to go 

Thank you for reading i appreciate it
