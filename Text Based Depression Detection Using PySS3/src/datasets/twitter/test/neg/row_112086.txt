How long can one go with consistent thoughts of suicide?Iâ€™ve always been a generally happy-ish person, or at least had good and bad moments. But now Iâ€™m just in constant suffering 24/7.  

Not only is my body a wreck, but Iâ€™ve lost my passion due to injury.  Itâ€™s probably going to be a 6-12 month recovery and requires a lot of focus and hard work. 

Iâ€™m 20, not in school, no job because of my injury and mental state.  Iâ€™ve been in constant agony 24/7 for the past 3 months, and donâ€™t really even have the motivation to rehab this injury. Ive already done it once before and the amount of work I had to put in just to feel normal was insane. 

Only thing keeping me alive are my parents. I feel really bad for them.
