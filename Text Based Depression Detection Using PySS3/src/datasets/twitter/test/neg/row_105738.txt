Iâ€™m so ugly that I want to kill myselfIâ€™m so repulsive. I got bullied for it in middle school and elementary school, and the guys that â€œlikedâ€ me in high school didnâ€™t even have real crushes on me. Why would I believe they like me if theyâ€™re never into girls like me? Iâ€™m constantly the exception but never what they genuinely find pretty. Iâ€™m 17 and I think, do I want to go out into the world where Iâ€™ll be mistreated for being ugly? How much more bullying can I take? I donâ€™t want to even try. I genuinely donâ€™t see the point in anything.
