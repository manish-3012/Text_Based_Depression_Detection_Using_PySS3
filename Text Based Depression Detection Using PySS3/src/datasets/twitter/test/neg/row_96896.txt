I think I'm reaching a breaking pointI don't even have the energy to talk about it but I've been so stressed out due to my own choices (or lack thereof) that I've lost too much weight and now I'm just scared and sick. I also suffer from chronic headaches and the pain makes everything worse. I need to calm down.
