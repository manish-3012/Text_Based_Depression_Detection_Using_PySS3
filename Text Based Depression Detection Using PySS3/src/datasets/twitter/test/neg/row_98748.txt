Today is the dayI can't eat (or keep food down). I'm exhausted. It's all I can think about at this point. It's almost 4am and my partners funeral is in 6 and a half hours. Thank you to the person who has been supporting me all week. You know who you are and you've helped get me this far (and has in no way encouraged my suicide I'd like to point out).
