holy fuck just kill me already. why is it so hard to die.I am nothing more than a sad pathetic excuse of a human life. I have absolutely nothing to live for and I've accepted that. I've reached the point where I'm 100% ready to die. I pray every night that I'll die before I wake. I don't want to kill myself bc no matter what, I simply cant do that to my parents. so here I am, just waiting and praying for someone to kill me. whether it be a drunk driver or a tweaked out meth head, good fucking lord just KILL ME ALREADY.
