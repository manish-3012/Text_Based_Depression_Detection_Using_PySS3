Still don't know what to doI made a post awhile back (I'd link it but my phone keeps crashing). 

I've been to the hospital for a partial program and I am in outpatient programing right now. But I'm still lost I see a lot of people share how they don't want to be here anymore but don't want to die and I'm in the same boat. I've been self harming for awhile now and it helps a little but obviously it isn't the answer. I wake up everyday wishing that it would just be over. I feel like an embarrassment to my parents my girlfriend and my friends. I isolate myself and that just makes things worse. I can't think straight half the time and anything I do for fun starts some argument between me and one of the parties mentioned before. I'm sitting in my car right now just wishing I could end it all because then people would either be happier or realize it's worse then they thought since I never get a chance to say how I feel. My girlfriend thinks I'm depressed because of her which I'm not if my parents knew I self harmed it would crush them and my friends wouldn't know what to do. I'm just so sick of my life and everyone thinks it's because of them which it isn't and I never get a chance to explain that. I just don't know what to do or how to die without actually hurting myself or anyone else. Just needed a place to post this.
