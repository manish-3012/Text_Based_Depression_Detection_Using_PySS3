How do you talk to people?I honestly want to be helped. I've gone through the past two weeks constantly thinking about suicide and it's really shitty. I think I'm coming close to actually harming myself, and I want to get help. 

The problem is, I don't know how to approach people about this. How do you just go up to your parents and say "Hey Mom, hey Dad, I've been wanting to kill myself for a while." They already have their shit to deal with. How do you tell people? And please don't tell me "Just talk to them," because that doesn't really help.
