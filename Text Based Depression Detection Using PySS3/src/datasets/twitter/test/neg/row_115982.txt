On a break with my girlfriendMy already shaky mental health is now really bad after me and my girlfriend decided to go on a break. I miss her so much. The only reason why Iâ€™m not cutting myself right now is because I know sheâ€™d be disappointed/sad if I did that. I want to die really badly (although I know Iâ€™m not actually going to do anything about it). Usually whenever Im sad Iâ€™d talk to her but I canâ€™t now because I donâ€™t want it to seem like Iâ€™m emotionally manipulating her into getting back together with me, so now I donâ€™t really have anyone to talk to
