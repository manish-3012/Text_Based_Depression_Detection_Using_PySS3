why is it so frustrating to liveit's been a week since i started having suicidal thoughts again, i have thoughts in my head what would be like if i jumped from the parking lot of a mall or hang myself, even drinking rat poison to die. Everyday, life has become so predictable it's always the same; I do something good and then I get hurt by people who take advantage of me. It sucks. 

Earlier, I tried jumping from the school's rooftop but I was too scared and I thought I would survive this fall. It's better to die thoroughly than to live with a lot of fractures and being paralyzed-- but euthanasia can work out later. So I didn't go on with the plan, this anger, this feeling of disappointment and frustration in my heart is so unbearable I just wish I couldn't feel at all. Like I wouldn't give a damn about anyone, or anything. I just want to be dead, nothing ever happens when you're dead. Maybe it's pitch black and everything and I'll wander forever in it.

Nothing around me ever brings me joy, just stress. Even when I play videogames, it's nothing. When I hang out with friends, I still feel lonely. I wish I can get rid of this feeling
