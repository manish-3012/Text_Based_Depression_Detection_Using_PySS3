I was going to end it tonightIâ€™d finally had enough. I didnâ€™t even really know how. And Iâ€™m still not sure Iâ€™m not going to. But my one real and only friend stopped me, with a couple texts. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever read a few sentences so important. It was enough for now, but my best friend, my only friend, the girl whoâ€™s prevented it for now. Sheâ€™s the only person who I care about, Iâ€™m so hopelessly in love with her, and it hurts so Much itâ€™ll never be more. I donâ€™t know when her words will be enough. I just want to end it now
