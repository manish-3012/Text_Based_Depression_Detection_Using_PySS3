I can't hold a jobOne of the many, many facets of my depression is utterly loathing work. Everyone always says "you just need to find a job that's the right fit!" and no one ever seems to understand that any sort of work, just labeling something as work, makes it infinitely harder for me to do. The moment someone expects something of me, I fall apart. I will never have a job that I can tolerate, let alone like. I try to think of ideal, perfect situations: youtube/twitch gamer, mattress tester, professional dog petter. Everything will come with unpleasant parts and expectations and deadlines. Even "work" I choose to do for my own pleasure. I play DND and as a bard I decided to write summary songs about our campaign. That should be nothing but fun, yet I'm super behind because I can't force myself to do it. And if I asked my friends to give me a deadline? It would be so much worse. 

It's not my bosses, most of them have been incredibly kind and helpful and just good people. Not people I would be friends with outside of work but definitely good people. It's not the tasks, my favorite things to do at work are the mindless, repetitive bullshit that others seem to dread. I want to do things there's only the minimal chance I can screw 

My last two jobs I lost because I stopped being able to force myself to get up and go, at all. Not just in the morning, at all. I can only fight my brain for so long before it becomes impossible to motivate myself to get out of bed. And now I've started doing this at my current job, so even if my boss takes me back after this current screw up, it's only a matter of time before I can't at all. It's only a part time job too, I'm lucky enough to have family I can live with so I don't need a full time paycheck (yet). 

Then my sister's like "But you can go do fun things so you should be able to go to work, you're perfectly able" and I just want to punch her. 

1. I'm forcing myself to go do "fun" things because that's what therapists tell you to do, have connections and don't isolate yourself. 
2. It's still a huge struggle to even go do the "fun" things and sometimes I can't even do that. 
3. What universe are you living in where getting dinner with friends is on the same level of difficulty as getting up at 7am to go to work? Even without depression! ARGH!

I tried a few years ago to apply for SSI (disability) but they rejected me. I know they do that to everyone the first time and you have to pester them to even have a chance of getting it, but it was such a struggle the first time that the thought of even figuring out how to do it again sounds like hell. 

~~(It doesn't help that I'm disillusioned with the entire capitalist system and believe there should be a Universal Basic Income and yadda yadda other dreams that'll never come true.)~~

I just don't know what to do. In order to be alive I need to torture myself with work, but work makes me not want to be alive at all. It's like eating poison and expecting to live.
