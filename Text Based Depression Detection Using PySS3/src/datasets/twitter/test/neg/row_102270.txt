Same Shit Different DayI've been having Suicidal thoughts for 3-4 years now. I don't see anything good happening to me anytime soon. I was never good at anything, I don't have anything going for me. I feel so misplaced when I'm around people, I hate myself so much I want to die. Suicide doesn't even seem so bad after all.
