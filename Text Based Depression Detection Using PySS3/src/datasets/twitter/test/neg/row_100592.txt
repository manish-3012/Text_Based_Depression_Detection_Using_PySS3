Canâ€™t talk to anyone I knowI have a few friends and family, also a partner, but I canâ€™t burden them.
I tried to reach out for professional help but canâ€™t/wouldnâ€™t pay $250 per hour. 
I have thought about killing myself for the better part of 30 years. I used to cut myself decades ago before they had a term for it. I never imagined anyone else did this. 
I donâ€™t want to take medication.
I fantasize about all the ways I could kill myself, how it could be least impactful to my loved ones.
I donâ€™t want to leave my dogs. I think most people that know me probably know I think this way. 
I donâ€™t even know if I want help. 
My parents both died this year. That didnâ€™t always remember my birthday. 
I didnâ€™t have children because I was scared to bring them into my world/this world. 
I love nature and animals, when I eventually die I will leave my majority to animals, not the environment because I have no hope for that, but maybe a few animals could benefit in the short term. 
Sorry for being depressing. Feels good to say this out loud for the first time.
