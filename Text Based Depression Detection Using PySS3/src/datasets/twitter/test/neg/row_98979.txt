cryinghi iâ€™m new but iâ€™ve been looking at that â€œhow to die without painâ€ thread for a few years now and never felt more belonged, so i decided to join some reddit communities related to suicide or depression. long story â€œshortâ€, iâ€™m still alive because: 

1. i feel guilty for having so many privileges (a lot of freedom in the way i can study what i want, managed to get away from an abusive father that almost killed me a few times in my childhood, i may not be a millionaire but iâ€™m definitely not poor, iâ€™m not be white but iâ€™m still a pale asian so i donâ€™t get much discrimination, etc) yet i am still full of frustration and pain, and i still want to die. itâ€™s like iâ€™m the most unappreciative being and itâ€™s eating me up inside. â€œwhY aRe yOU sO uNhAPpy?â€ â€œbE grATeFuL ya spOiLt bRaTâ€

2. my two overdose attempts (amitriptyline and thylenol) both ended up in failure. now i have a gag reflex and canâ€™t swallow a whole lotta pills in one go. unfortunately i am a pussy and donâ€™t dare to die in pain

3. i donâ€™t look depressed. i can get up, go to the bathroom, and go to school (most of the time) like a lifeless robot so...people think iâ€™m fine/overdramatic and queue toxic positivity. people just say go to therapy etc and the 5 times iâ€™ve gone they just said i donâ€™t put in the effort. why worth trying again and having hope for the nth time. iâ€™m already worrying about how to function and get a job in the future with a degree that will basically get me nowhere yet i chose it not even because i want to pursue in it, but because i hate or am not intelligent enough for anything else. it was a last resort.

idk why iâ€™m writing, i guess i just hope people have suggestions or find some relatability. if youâ€™ve read til the end, i sincerely thank you
