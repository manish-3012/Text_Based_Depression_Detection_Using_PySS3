So life: what's the difference between liking/hating life the same way you like/hate anything else?I mean... From my perspective, I didn't exist, and then suddenly I did. But, if I don't like the idea of this life thing I find myself in then why am I supposed to try sooo hard to tough it out until things get better?
Please help me understand. I don't seem to be very good at it.
