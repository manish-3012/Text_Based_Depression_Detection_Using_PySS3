things to keep in minddepression really sucks.

life can wear down on you.

traumas can happen that hurt so much you can't even utter them.

anxiety can pull you away from things you like.

people may not understand you.

and here you are.

somehow despite how terrible life can be you've made it this far.

maybe it's not much but i'm proud of all you.

even if you've attempted in past you've come to a community to help support you.

taking steps in the right direction.

might not be much but the little things in life are what truly count!
