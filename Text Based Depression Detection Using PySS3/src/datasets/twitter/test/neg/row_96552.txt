I'm just too tiredHello, I'm a 24 year old woman. English is not my native language so excuse me if I made mistakes. 
This is not my original account. 
Well, the title says it all. 
At first, there was just one thing giving me pain, and that was the situation my boyfriend ( now ex boyfriend ) was living. Her daughter was abused, and he took it to the police. Her ex took her daughter away, and for legal reasons he's still fighting to see her. The abusers only got a three month restriction order. 
I think this was the first thing that made me feel like I feel now. I love that kid, maybe it's not my daughter but I always loved her and is one of my favorite persons in the world. 
And I cry whenever I think that I can't do absolutely nothing about all of this. 
That was months ago, and the process of take her back to my ex is taking a really long time. 
In these months, my two cats died. My grandmother got sick, and she doesn't remember me anymore. 
My insecurities grew a lot, my schizophrenia got worse, I started to feel paranoid and bombarded my ex with emotional speeches and false accusations saying that he was cheating on me because I really thought it was like that. 
He broke up with me, and I fell more in the void that I am now. 
I started to feel sadder and sadder, and I was mean to one of my best friends. I apologized but she is not talking to me anymore.
My ex is my best best friend, so we keep a fwb relationship, but I'm pushing him away too because I can't stop being insecure and he can't give me reassurance right now, he's having a really hard time and I can't help him, I only make the things worse and worse. 
I'm not sure about this, as I'm waiting to take a test right now, but I might be pregnant too. 
In my country abortion is illegal, and if I'm pregnant, I can't even think to bring the subject to him, because he's trying so hard to get his life together. 
I love him a lot, and I didn't kill myself yet just because I think that even if we are not so close as before, it would hurt him a lot. 
I can't find a job and when I have something I get anxious and can't even go to the interview. 
I'm seeing a therapist, I'm going to the gym, but nothing seems to be getting better. 
I talked to my parents, they live in another city, and are trying to help, but I can't bear with the pain anymore. 
I can't sleep, I eat until I vomit, or don't eat at all, I cry every day, and I can't get myself together, I only can think that I'm a selfish and horrible person, who wants to take her life when she has people who cares about her, and even a cat. 
I feel like I broke completely, and I tried to get better for months, but it was no use, 
I really, really hate myself, and can't stand seeing me in the mirror anymore. 
I only want the pain to stop but I'm too afraid of leaving my little cat alone, of breaking my parents hearts, that my bestfriend/ex will feel guilty or be alone too, but when I think of it I'm really sure he will be happier without me. 
I don't know what to do anymore.
