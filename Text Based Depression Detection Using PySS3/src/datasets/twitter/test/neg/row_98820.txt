are mental Illnesses curable?I want someone to be frank with me, I mean I have been in therapy since i was 8 and nothing have changed, I suffer from OCD,depression,anxiety disorder and paranoid personality disorder.
I can't suffer anymore I can't everyone says you will get over it but I won't if I live forever with my current mental status there is a chance that I will suicide.
I tried so many meds, now the long term side effect is I got a headache and hallucinations when I sleep.
what is the point of that , are mental illnesses curable or not i want someone who have them and knows well cuz I'm 17 and i can't live longer with this anymore.
