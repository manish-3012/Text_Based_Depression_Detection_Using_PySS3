I'm invisible, I don't think anyone will notice if I goI really hope I succeed this time, this time I'm going to jump, all I have to is jump and I can be freed from my ill mind. I feel so unstable it's unbearable, I feel out of my own control. Suicide is the only way I can control my life now, I want to do what's best for me. No one listens, no one cares. I don't know it just hurts. My heart hurts, my soul is tired. I don't want live like this anymore. I feel so alone. I have nobody, I'm 17 yet I feel like a ghost.
