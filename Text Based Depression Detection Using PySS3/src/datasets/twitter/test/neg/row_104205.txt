I just wanted someone to love me. I wanna kill myselfI posted on here before but i got harassed and deleted it today ...My boyfriend and i fought yesterday and he went offline and then on yacht party with other girls and his friends there and I actually thought he ghosted me but he returned some mails today and he clearly was still pissed. 
We fought because I delayed USA visa payment...
I am so hurt...Maybe I am too complicated for anyone to love. 
My delayed payment was because serious reason not because I forgot. He doesnt even bother to open his what's app and chats me only via mail
