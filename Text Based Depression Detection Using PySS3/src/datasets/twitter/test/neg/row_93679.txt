Iâ€™ve been ready to die every day for 10 years now10 years. 10 years of feeling dead inside. 10 years of feeling like I donâ€™t exist at all. The only problem is I do. 

I donâ€™t know how long I can go on like this. I suppose I could another 10 years, and then another 10 after that, and so on and so on. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone who cares for me but I truly feel itâ€™s been too long. You canâ€™t raise someone from the dead, and thatâ€™s how Iâ€™ve felt for 10 years.

Life is for those who are alive. When we recognize our time is over we should be able to bow out. â€œHey, my time here is over and itâ€™s time for me to go now.â€ I feel like Iâ€™m sitting in the theatre 10 years after the show ended. 

Thereâ€™s nothing left but dust.
