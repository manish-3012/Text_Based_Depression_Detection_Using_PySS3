I hate myself so fucking much. Yet, there's no chance for any change.Hey,

I'm sorry if it makes no sense at all, but I'm typing whatever comes up in my head.

I'm going to a psychologist right now. But it's not helping at all.
All I hear is what I already know. 
Saying the same things over and over are not going to help anyone with anything. In fact, it only frustrates me.


Ever since I've told my best friend I was suicidal I have not heard anything back. In fact, whenever I try to contact him, things only end in a fight because he seems to take everything as an insult. (And this is when we're "talking (texting to see when he has time)" about talking..)
I've stopped trying to talk with him.

I havn't seen any friends in a couple of weeks now. Or heard from them. Not since I told someone I was suicidal.
And it's not that I didn't try. People just seem to hate me.
What did I do as a response to that? Delete every single contact from my phone/chatting programs. And deleting facebook.
Now I have 0 ways to contact them anymore.

I regret it already but I always fuck everything up.


I hate myself.


I can't do anything right. I really can't. There's just so much wrong with me.


All I do all day is sleeping, watching tv and being on the internet most of the time.
Ofcourse I made it worse by drinking and smoking weed each day. Every day I am sober is a day where I want to kill myself.
Failing college and knowing I wasted 3 years of my life did help me with that.

Now I have no idea what actually will make me happy. I don't even want to try to think about it because I know I'll never be happy again.
The reason I decided to post here was some suicide clip I found on reddit where someone shoots himself in the head. 
It made it seems peaceful. It made me jealous.


I know it's easy to say: make new friends! :D And you can always try a different education!
But fuck you, that's not what I want anymore. Even if that did change anything I would only fuck it up to be in the same situation again.


I just have no other way to go.
