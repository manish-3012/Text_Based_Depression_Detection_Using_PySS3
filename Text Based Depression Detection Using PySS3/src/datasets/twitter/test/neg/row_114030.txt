I'm leaving with a freindWe are going to the mountains with a one person tent and two tanks of Helium. We are going to take overdose levels of extasy and turn on the helium in the tent so we can go out. It's rather painless and won't be a terrible thing to find for anyone. We are going to drive up to the mountains without our phones and just call it good. I've got work tommorow but I figure it doesn't really matter. I've left a few gifts for my close freinds and I'm going to leave an audio recording for them detailing why and what I want my funeral to be.
