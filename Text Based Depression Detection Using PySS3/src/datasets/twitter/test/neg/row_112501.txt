It happened today.I have not felt this feeling in a long time. I have not thought about suicide in a very long time. Today, that thought popped into my head and quite frankly scared the living shit out of me. 

A few years ago, I was ready. I had it all planned out. Letter's written. Everything. My parents were on vacation. I had stayed home because I had band rehearsals mid summer for the upcoming season. I'm not sure why, but one of my dearest friends showed up at my house to watch our favorite musical. (Phantom of the Opera) Her arrival was not planned or expected. She ended up spending the night and we stayed up all night and just talked. If it was not for her, I would not be here today. I have never told her this and probably never will. She is in my life today and that is all I'm worried about. 

Fast forward to today. I have been going through a lot lately. I have been under a tremendous amount of stress. Anxiety has been extremely high. I've been feeling very very alone lately. I live in a city where my closest family member is over an hour away. My boyfriend just left me. I work with what feels like 24/7. I have absolutely no friends that I can turn too.. and I thought to myself, "no one gives a shit about you. If you were to disappear, no one is going to notice." 

I cried for hours and I am not feeling "okay" right now. Any positive, helpful thoughts or comments would be greatly appreciated though the next few days. I'm finding it very difficult to pick up the pieces right now.
