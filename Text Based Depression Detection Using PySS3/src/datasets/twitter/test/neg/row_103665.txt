Has anyone here failed after jumping?I donâ€™t have a gun, so obviously jumping is the next best thing. I know a spot where a few have jumped and succeeded, but itâ€™s only around 8m high. I cannot risk a failed attempt. Thatâ€™s the only thing worse than death. 

Need to know if anyone here has failed after jumping. Or general advice. Need pointers to make sure that doesnâ€™t happen to me. This is the only thing that can take away my pain now. Please donâ€™t ask why.
