I canâ€™t do this anymore!So I was the fat ugly gay guy that none of any other gay guys want. So much for tolerance and acceptance in lgbt community right? I guess itâ€™s the same as straight people. 

But I decided to Iâ€™m prove myself by working out. I was 230 last May. Now, Iâ€™m 177. I even hired personal trainers to assist me on getting to know powerlifting but this new one. Itâ€™s not his fault... itâ€™s my dumbasses fault to fall for him. I was gonna stop training and messing with him. But I told myself, Iâ€™m gonna try to suck it up because he makes me feel good and accepted. Well except for the fact that heâ€™s everyoneâ€™s. But now I found out that heâ€™s sleeping with one of the hot snobbish guy at the gym and it hit me. I was like wow. This guy sleeps with elite gay men. It made me feel so small, insecure and dead inside. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. I stop eating *fuck my muscles. I just wanna go back to my home city.. idc if itâ€™s winter. Go back to sleeping in the streets and not deal with anyone. Itâ€™s really hard and frustrating to change yourself so people will accept you. Itâ€™s even harder to pretend to be nice and happy when all you feel is hate, envy, pain and jealousy.
