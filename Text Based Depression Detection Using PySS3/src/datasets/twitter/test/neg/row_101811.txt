Please help me.I've been thinking a lot about suicide lately and I was told by one of my older friends to come here.

I'm a 14 year old girl and have been struggling with severe depression since I was in 6th grade (11 years old). That's when I started self-harming. By the time I'd reached the end of 6th grade, I had already attempted suicide, but a teacher caught me and took the anti-freeze that was in my hand. She never did anything about it after that. Later on, all the emotional distress built up and eventually led to me hurting one of my closest friends and a few of my other friends. I made a HUGE mistake and it all went downhill from there.

7th grade seemed to be okay, but I was only distracting myself by going on the Internet and watching Let's Plays.

8th grade came around the corner, and towards the middle of it, it hit me. I don't matter in the world. My parents don't love me for me; they love me for my achievements. My friends aren't really friends; they're just acquaintances. My teachers don't even try to help anyone who're struggling, even though I went to a Christian school. I'm a bisexual atheist who went to a Christian school. Everything they would say about God/Jesus just pissed me off and reminded me of the reality of the pain and suffering out there. Nothing made sense to me anymore. 

I asked my mother to get professional help. I didn't show her my scars because I was afraid she would slap me and tell me to get a hold on myself. She just stared at me coldly and told me that I was overreacting. Then, to make things worse, she slapped me and told me that she would rather have one of my friends as a daughter than me. That hit me, hard. 

Nowadays, all my mom talks to me about is how I need to lose weight and get good grades. I graduated as valedictorian of my graduating class. She wants more from me, and I don't know how to give her more. And the reason why I keep gaining weight is because of the stress-eating that I do. Add in the fact that I'm severely depressed and the build-up of fat probably doubles. I'm 5' 2" and 151.3 pounds. I'm almost obese and I exercise regularly, but I can never seem to lose the weight. I even eat less and sometimes skip a few meals, but nothing ever works. Every single one of my conversations with my mom ends up in tears. My parents aren't abusive, but their not loving.

I desperately need help, but no one can offer it to me. I'm not loved. I self-harm. I'm overweight. I can't take it anymore.

TL;DR: I'm a 14 year old who has been severely depressed for years. I'm not loved by my parents. I can't get help because my mother thinks that I am overreacting. I am really close to just ending it all.
