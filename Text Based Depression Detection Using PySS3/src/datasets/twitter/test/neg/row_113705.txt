No happiness
I canâ€™t seem to find anything that makes me happy. I havenâ€™t been clinically diagnosed with depression or any mental issues, meaning I am not on any medication. The things I used to love, like reading, playing video games, making music, no longer give me any joy, and it all just feels like Iâ€™m trying not to sit and do nothing. Iâ€™ve tried my best finding new hobbies, improving myself, and making new friends, but none of it is working, everything in life is still a distraction to me. The few good friends that I did happen to make over the past few months are beginning to pull away, and I canâ€™t do anything about it and it just hurts. A person Iâ€™ve confided pretty much all my secrets to and (dare I say it) loved is beginning to ignore me and instead talk to other people, and even though I shouldnâ€™t be possessive of something I never had, I liked this person much more than as a friend and it hurts to see them pull away after relying on them for so long, and all the distractions I look for so hard arenâ€™t working so I have to sit and just think about that. This would make probably the third time Iâ€™m seriously considering to attempt it, but I know Iâ€™m exaggerating my problems and that I have no right to be doing this. I must ask, how do you deal with not having a purpose and having to deal with an absolute hell of emotions every second of the day? How do you stop being emotionally reliant on someone you know doesnâ€™t make you a priority, but still stay close enough to be there for her whenever she needs you? Sheâ€™s not aware sheâ€™s hurting me, and itâ€™s not her fault, but trying to distract myself from an unhealthy â€œrelationshipâ€ is becoming extremely difficult when thereâ€™s only one thing ever on my mind: the sweet release of death.
