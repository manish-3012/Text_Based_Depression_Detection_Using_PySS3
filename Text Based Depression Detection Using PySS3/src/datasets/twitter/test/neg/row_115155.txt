Iâ€™m going to end it, I canâ€™t fucking deal with this bullshit life right nowItâ€™s one thing after a fucking other every fucking day. My fucking paycheck didnâ€™t come on and I had to borrow more money to get to fucking work, as if I work for free. I canâ€™t pick up my medication because they donâ€™t ducking take Apple Pay, my bank account is overdrawn from a purchase I MADE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. Iâ€™ve been getting angry a lot lately and I canâ€™t fucking do anything but feel absolute rage. Again, I DONT FUCKING WORK FOR FREE WHERE IS MY FUCKING PAYCHECK. Iâ€™m going to punch the fucking wall if anybody steps out of line once with me today.
