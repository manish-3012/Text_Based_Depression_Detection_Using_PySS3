Got out of depression before uni, Covid19 brought me back. What's the point?I am a musician alone on a university campus. I have writers block. I have way to create music. I have no way to occupy myself or distract myself from horrible crippling loneliness. Coming to uni was fantastic for my mental state and now that I'm back to being all alone with no end in sight for this fucking Covid19 thanks to idiots not taking it seriously, I've really lost my pros and cons list to live.

Cheers. Have a good day.
