I cant do this anymore.Hi.

After battling with my depression and anxiety for years, I honestly cant fucking take it anymore. I feel left alone. It feels like everyone is against me. Fuck school, fuck senior year. I want to kill myself. Ive considered it before but this time I am actually serious. I dont know where to go from here. Theres so much backstory that I could delve into. Its too much for one stupid textpost. 
Fuck antidepressants. Fuck weed. Fuck ketamine therapy. Nothing fucking works for me.
I want someone to hold me and tell me its gonna be okay. I want my fucking ex to hold me and tell me its okay. Of course that will never happen.
I just cant imagine leaving behind my family. I dont know if I could ever do it. They have been the only ones to have my back.
I just wanted to put this out somewhere without someone flipping shit because I said what Im feeling. Will probably regret it and delete it later.

Thanks for reading.
