i think about it from time to time.mostly not in a serious way just wondering how death is like, would it be like pulling the plug of a TV? just a blank screen ? will your soul leave your body ?

sometime i think if i am going to leave a note what should i put in it? maybe i should write something in german just to mess with my family or tattoo some satanic symbols all over my body for no reason just i am weird and messing with people's heads one last time sounds fun.
