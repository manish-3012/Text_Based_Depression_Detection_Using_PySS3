Lost.Throwaway because someone I know checks my regular account.

I just lost someone very important to me. It was the last thing I had to cling to in this world. This world of guilt and sadness, that takes away everything and anyone.

This was my dream and it's gone. I don't know what to do now. This was my life. I mean, what do you do when you lose someone that you could picture yourself old with? Not just growing old, but you can see your life 60 years from now, and you're terrified of losing them to old age after all of that time. I know that sounds crazy, but that's how I saw my relationship. I had faith and hope. And now, for some reason I don't even understand, it's gone. And I feel like I'm losing my mind. 

I'm not going to be able to make it through the holiday's. I don't have a single person I can talk to anymore, and it's not for lack of trying. I try so hard and nothing ever seems to work out for me... I'm just tired. I've been depressed for 8 years now, through medication and therapy and so many different things, and nothing has seemed to help me. It's only getting worse with time and this time, I have nothing left to look forward to. This was it for me.
