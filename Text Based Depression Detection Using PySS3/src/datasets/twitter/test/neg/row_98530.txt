The same as all the other posts, yup, you guessed right.Mental images of a bullet casing, escaping, grazing my tormented skull. 
Knife wounds a hundred times in my chest.
I'm in pain. 
These suicidal thoughts grow stronger every night. 
How I hate myself, and my choices. 
Rip my soul from my body and set me free. The pain of this flesh is haunting me. On my 20th birthday here I lay, and I crave nothing more than death. I want a new life. Reincarnate with another chance to not hurt others or myself. I want to bleed out. I want to bleed out and choke on my own blood as I gasp for air and swallow the regret of taking my own life. I want to feel my own life slip away from me, so that in those few moments before death, I may rest easy knowing it's over. I want to die. Now, please.
