Whenever something happens that makes other people emotional, I literally cannot stop thinking about suicide.For instance, I was watching the end of The Office, with a few friends, a few starting crying or hugged or whatever, but for some reason I just got extremely angry with myself. I just kind of wanted to go to sleep and not This sort of thing has also happened at like weddings or just general meet ups. This sort of thing just reminds me how abnormal I am and how I'll never be able to succeed in life. I'm just a sack of shit that mooches off of nice people. I'm just an inhibitor of other's happiness.
