Why does It feel like Iâ€™m attention seeking?!I hate living! I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m alive! I canâ€™t answer that! Damn! I want to die! Maybe cutting my wrist is the only answer... people are telling me that Iâ€™m doing it for attention. But I donâ€™t want the attention! Iâ€™ll happily not speak or talk to anyone and just sit at the bridge for hours. But then Iâ€™ll still be attention seeking! Damn! Urghhh! I need to die!!!!
