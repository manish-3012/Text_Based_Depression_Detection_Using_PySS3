Not really sure what to do.I've been ugly my whole life. I hate myself. I've completely planned out my suicide- The time of day, method, costs, everything. My boyfriend no longer loves me. I kind of suspect he never did. 
I used to be happy, but even then I always imagined I'd commit suicide. I think some people are destined to do it, and even if they're helped or someone intervenes, they'll do it eventually.
I'll be honest and tell you guys that I don't see the point of posting here. I've been ordered to do it by my boyfriend, who I'm sure will leave me soon enough.
I've been to psychologists and gotten a few different results, something like OCD or Body Dysmorphic disorder or an anxiety disorder. I'm not sure what.
So that's about it, I guess. I have type 1 diabetes, I constantly get infections, I'm very unattractive, and I feel destined to commit suicide.
