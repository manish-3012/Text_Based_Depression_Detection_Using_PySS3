About to get thrown out of collegeI'm a 20-year-old college student. My GPA is currently 1.25, and if I don't get it up to at least 2.0 by the end of this, I'll get kicked out. I'm worried because it's the only thing I had going for me really. I held on to life in hopes of eventually getting a great job with the help of a degree in computer science, but now this last dream is coming to an end. If I get thrown out, my only future is serving fries to people.

I have nothing else going for me. No friends, no girlfriend, no job. Things used to be better: I basically cruised through high school because I found it to be extremely easy and, as a result, I've never learned how to properly study. And here I am, heading towards the end.

For the last few months, I turned to drugs (mostly alcohol and tobacco, but some weed too) to cope with my feelings, but every bottle of booze I buy just makes me hate myself more. Every day I promise to punish myself as I withdraw money from my bank account to get drunk.

I'm planning on waiting until the end of the semester until I actually do anything, but the odds are against me. I'm pretty sure my grades will be shit this semester as well, so I might as well prepare for it.

My parents will surely be devastated if I killed myself, and I haven't told them how I feel because they won't be much help. They'll just tell me to work harder, but they don't seem to understand that I can't. I just don't know how.

On top of my academic failures, I'm still a virgin. Never even had a girlfriend. Hell, I don't even have friends. I mean, I talk to people, sure, but I'm not close to anyone.

I was prescribed antidepressants in the past, and they didn't help, but at this point, I'm not even looking to get better anymore. I just wait for the time to pass so I can finally end this all.

Sorry if this is incoherent. Sounded better in my head.
