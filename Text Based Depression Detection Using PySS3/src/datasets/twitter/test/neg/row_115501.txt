HidingIve been hiding my true feelings and emotions from everyone for the past 3 years now, the only way i deal with my depression is by not speaking and being kind to people. I really want to end it all but i know that my suffering on earth will mean nothing if i kill my self and end up in eternal suffering in hell, im a muslim, and its one of the biggest sins to commit suicide, nobody from my family knows how i really am, all my friends think im a funny guy whos all fine and dandy because i hide my emotions behind memes (yes memes) when really im screaming for help but no one seems to take the hint. I have been holding this in for a while and i just needed to tell this to someone, somewhere, even if i have never met any of you.
