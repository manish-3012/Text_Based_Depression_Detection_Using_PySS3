Opiate + General (twilight) anesthesia?So i dearly, desperately want to die. Blah blah [don't do it comments here]. I was at an incare in april after a failed attempt and I now realize I cannot do it myself.

Well!  I have oral surgery tomorrow and am getting general (twilight) anesthesia. They gave me some 5mg percs which help the tooth pain some. I have an opiate addiction so can take several at a time but have been scared to take the whole thing. More afraid the bottle isn't enough with my tolerance and i just suffer or wake up sick. 

Long ramble short:
If I took a bunch and then went for the surgery, would the opiate+anesthesia combo cause an "accidental" OD?   Would the clinical setting br able to resuscitate quick enough (narcan, etc) to not be viable? 

Going to try anyway but it would interesting to know what you think...
