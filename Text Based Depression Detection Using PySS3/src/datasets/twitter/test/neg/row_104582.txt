i want to kill myself but im too scared to dieim 15 and i need help to find the courage to kill myself and i mean not for a particular reason its just everyone uses me and then throws me away and i get shouted at during lunch all the time and people constantly call me a whore and they tell me that nobody wants me here and sometimes the teachers join in too and call me disgusting and they talk to their class about how disgusting they think i am and everyone here basically hates me and the only person i had was my bf but he ended up cheating on me with 10 different girls and told me he only pretended to fall in love with me just so he could sleep with me and he said he doesn't actually like me at all and he said that im weird and i also struggle with a lot of mental health issues and ive been trying so hard to get better but its so hard when people do this stuff to me every single day. and he said that im crazy and everyone thinks it too and that he couldn't stand being with me because he didnt want everyone to hate him too. and i told him that im suicidal he said 'no youre not' and 'you wont do it' and i really want to but im so scared because i dont want any of my family, especially my little brothers, to find me and i just am so scared because of how it would affect them but i just cant do this anymore and i wish someone would just shoot me
