I told myself if I wasnâ€™t feeling better after the music festival I was going to Iâ€™d kill myself.I didnâ€™t want to disappoint my friend that I was going with. The festival has passed and I still have nothing to live for. I only feel bad about wanting to kill myself because thatâ€™s how other people make me feel. Nothing will ever get better. The way I feel about myself will never change. I lost the only person that I felt comfortable enough talking to about how I feel. No one can help me. I have three therapists and a psychiatrist and Iâ€™ve been unemployed for 6 months. Iâ€™d rather kill myself than go through the torture of finding a job again. Iâ€™m thinking about quitting my Lexapro cold turkey to feel bad enough to actually try. Iâ€™ve had multiple attempts this year alone. I feel too lazy to actually do it but I know I want to not wake up anymore. I wish I had enough xanax to take and drink with, but Iâ€™m on a low dose and I donâ€™t have a connect for bars right now.
