it would make things so much easiermy dad has cancer and hes dying and he doesnt give a shit about his health anymore and all he cares about is making sure im okay when hes gone and he keeps pushing himself and he cant recover and if i disappeared it would be so much easier and he wouldnt have to pretend hes okay and he could focus on getting better and he wouldnt have to pretend he still loves my mom and maybe tonight ill be luckier

dear god i hope tonight ill be luckier
