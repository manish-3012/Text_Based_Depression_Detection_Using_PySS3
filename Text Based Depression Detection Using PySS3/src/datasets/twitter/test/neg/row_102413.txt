Please just talk to me for a little bit.I posted over at https://www.reddit.com/r/Prevent_Suicide/comments/68wg39/can_someone_just_talk_to_me/ and someone suggested I cross post in a dm because there's more people here. 

Can someone just talk to me for a little bit. I can be an annoying oversharing burden so I wouldn't keep anyone for long. I just have nothing and no-one anymore and I'm scared of myself. My ex-partner (as guess they are now) has sided with the people who stopped me from leaving to be with her and I don't really understand why and without them I don't have anyone to talk to or help me. I'm talking too much already. I'd really appreciate someone just talking to me. I'm sorry I'm so pathetic here.
