I left home today.I'm sitting my car, contemplating on what my next move is.
They dont want me back, no one ever does. 
I'm most likely going to start hitchiking westward tomorrow.
I have all my gear with me, so I'll probably get an uber down to an oasis and try and pick up a ride there.
It's hard not to want to end it all right now, but I really want to see some beautiful scenery before I leave this earth forever.
