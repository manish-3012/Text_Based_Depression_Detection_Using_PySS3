I am not even going to bother with making this an interesting title.Hey. What's up. Guess I'm here now.  
Look, I've always had periodic run-ins with Mr. Depresso. I guess I just have the right genes for it.  
And right now I'm not in my longest-ever episode, there is no rational reason for me to believe that this is going to turn out differently than the past times (except once when I actually made an attempt -- or, well, to be more precise, I was going for an attempt and then broke it off at the last minute), but hey, it always feels like the worst time, every time. I don't think I've posted here till now. I know my fiancÃ©e used to, when she was feeling like this. Well, ex-fiancÃ©e. Short story is, I was too broke to live with her, I am a high school dropout so no job prospects, and she's American and I'm just not, so I couldn't stay in the country with her. We couldn't entertain a long-distance relationship in the end, so now it's over till either of us ever makes it to where the other is. So she's gone, that's great.  


Now fast forward please, because that's already months behind me. I somehow managed to pull off a fucking magic trick and make it into university. Well, I made it into a foundation year program, which is actually a foundation-year-and-a-half because the only way they would admit me is by tacking on an extra semester, but jeez, I'm impressed at that outcome nonetheless. Only problem; I need to move for uni, and non ho niente denaro. Neither does my family. Support from them is expected to be zero. In fact, my sister is livid at the thought of me quitting and not going there, because if I left she'd have to pay a bigger share of the rent. And that's how she thinks about me. And well, I have time till New Year's to come up with something or kill myself. I've weighed the options, guys. There is no mathematical chance in hell short of a miracle that I'll be able to make it there. Tuition was already a nightmare, I only managed to pay that with my mom's help, but we both know that the savings she took out then were the last scraps she had. And she still keeps trying to reassure me, keeps telling me, "If you don't make it on your own, I'll just loan you the money, whatever you need!"

Bullshit. She has none. We both know that. And here's the thing, fellas. University is the key. University is the only shot I have. I am enrolling in Pisa (the one with the tower, yes), for a degree that pretty much only exists there, at least in continental Europe. It's the only thing that came up at the very end of my "what the hell shall I do with myself" quest. If it's not this, it's nothing. I can't keep living with the fam, either. They're moving out soon, to a new country (we have family dispersed all over the globe, you see), and I am not exactly expected to be part of that relocation package. Because on the one hand they don't want me to go to uni, but then again they require me to. Whatever is most convenient to them. 

If anyone wants an explanation as to why we are so piss-poor, well, apart from my resumÃ© which I already linked above (high school dropout, no US work authorization, I think that's it), my mom is an interior designer who doesn't know how to work computers well (i.e. she's working minimum-wage jobs unrelated to her degree now), my sister actually makes a decent living but she's going to a private art school so her tuition takes the lion's share, and my dad is retired, sitting on a pension that we all know is capital-p PHAT because he used to earn six figures as a hotel manager, but he's not sharing it with any of us (parents are separated, just not quite divorced yet yadda yadda). My only ever source of income have been various online gig-type things, you know, the kinds of jobs where they tell you you're not legally an employee but an "independent freelance remote subcontractor" or some bullshit like that.

TL,DR; I wanna kill myself.
