Does anyone else have that feeling to just want to â€œcheckoutâ€?Let me elaborate,
I am content with myself, I make decent money,
I have very little debt, live on my own, Iâ€™m fed and eat good daily, got clothes on my back, have great friends, love my family,
Iâ€™m a decently happy human being.
Donâ€™t have any worries that I can think of...

But...
I donâ€™t really how to explain it any better besides just checkout?
Like Iâ€™m done, and just want to be euthanized.
