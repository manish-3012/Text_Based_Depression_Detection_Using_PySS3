I'm so relievedMy old boss was abusive. A bully. Told me I was dumb, had no skills, would fail in life without him. Only he could fix me.

It broke me down, it hurt like hell. I worked so hard for him, yet he scammed me of money and belittled me. Used me as a scapegoat. Then told me if I kept working for him, he'd make sure I became a store manager. It was my first job, I didn't know what else to expect.

I quit after 5 months. I was depressed, binged on food, felt that every single mistake proved him right. Failure seemee obvious. I was so fucking sad.

Now I'm at a new job. It's been 7 months, and my boss sat me down. Told me I was one of the hardest workers, that I changed the atmosphere of the store. That he uses me as an example of what to be. That I'm patient, charismatic, empathetic. 

I'm so relieved. I feel like I will be ok, and that everything that my old boss said has no effect on me anymore. I'm not as stressed out, or depressed. I have a will to live now.
