AITA for telling my friend I want to die?Last night I was talking to my friend when I got a panic attack. I told him and he tried to distract me from it to make me feel better. It didnt work because I couldnt really talk about anything else than the panic attack. I then told him I was having suicidal thoughts (I have talked about it with him before and itâ€™s not a sensitive subject for him) and I was afraid I was going to hurt myself. He got angry at me and said that I was guilt tripping him and that he doesnâ€™t deserve that. I donâ€™t know what to do. I tried to post this on the AmITheAsshole subreddit but you canâ€™t talk about suicide on there.
