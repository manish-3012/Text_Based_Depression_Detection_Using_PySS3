i wish the thoughts would go away or somethingi keep having the absolute most vivid thoughts on dying kind of. i'll think of how i want to go about it and then for the longest time it'll keep replaying over and over. what i'll say to my family, where i'll go, what i'll do, what my last moments might feel like. i even think of how people will react. i feel so selfish for this but i don't want people to miss me. i don't want anyone to even remember me. if they miss me then they'll be sad and i just really don't want to hurt anyone but i don't want to hurt anymore either. maybe i'm weak but these thoughts make me scared sometimes. sometimes i find a strange relief in them thinking i'll get it out of the way and be gone but... i just want to actually like living. i've got too much going on and idk where to even start making anything better. everything i touch breaks
