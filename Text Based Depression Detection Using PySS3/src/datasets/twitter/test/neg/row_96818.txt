At 25 I'll kill myselfI say this, and I say this and I say this.  
I've become so unreliable and untrustworthy of even myself, that I doubt that I can even give myself this release. But I say I will regardless. There's nothing really anchoring me to this world, and yet I still never do anything about it. I'm quite hopeful for this however.  


In 4 months from posting this, I'll be 25.  
I just lost a lot of my friends. We went on a big other country trip together. We've known each other for years. Almost a decade, and yet we'd never met. All around the world, Australia, America, The UK, South Africa. And I knew I shouldn't go, I knew how I was, and yet I went, because I wanted to experience Japan for the first time with everyone and I wanted to meet my friends for the first time.  


Well, as I expected, my depression wouldn't allow me to be happy, and even more so, it would drag my friends into the mindset of "if they don't ask how I am, then they don't care about me". 3 whole weeks and not a single second of concern shown for me that wasn't a joke. It makes me feel like a joke. I tried to speak to them but I was shut down. Anyone here who has depression may understand the frustration of trying to explain how you're feeling to people who haven't felt this way, just saying "just do this and you'll feel better".  


I made a vent post on Facebook, not expecting anything more than just being seen by anybody. Well one of my friends took it to the point of saying he doesn't even like me. It didn't hurt as much as I thought it would, since I could understand his point of view, nobody likes the downer of the group. I'm only there since I was the first friend.  


After many long paragraphs of explaining just how much I HAD been talking to everyone trying to connect, it just didn't resonate and I realised, I would never be better. When I was younger, I may have tried every apology under the sun. Every explanation of how I was feeling, every emotion, every reason, and how depression caused these feelings. But after a decade, I am very acutely aware of how futile these conversations are. Because everybody is set in stone with their thoughts. My friends hate me, because of an illness I'm dealing with alone and have always dealt with alone, even when I've tried to explain it.  


On to the main topic. Suicide. I'm nearly 25. My friends don't love me. They don't trust me. All of my family have their own families to worry about now. I'm the middle child, imagine what that means. Of 10 children, I'm the only one that still lives with their mum. I don't think this is a sad thing, I love my mum very much and she is only just coping too, with the help of me. She calls me her wheel. But I don't think it's fair for me to live just because someone else depends on me. I deserve to be happy but I can't be so I also deserve to not have to deal with this torture.  


There's all manner of advice you could offer me I'm sure. Most likely nothing I haven't heard before. Every day for the last 6 years at least, I've searched dozens of things about depression and my feelings and why I should live. Therapists, psychiatrist, alternative methods. Just, I feel like there's nothing up here. In this brain. I was cursed with a brain that doesn't want to feel anything but the embrace of death.  


I know this is bullshit though. I was a relatively happy kid I suppose. My mum went through a few partners and I never knew my dad. But I guess that was never something that really bothered me. I was raised by one of my sister's dads so I always had that figure in my life.

**Also if this seems kind of like a disorganised mess, that's just because I'm typing it as I go and as I think of things. My brain is a big hot mess of things I've bottled up because I can't talk to anyone. Mostly considering EVERYONE treats depression as something you just need to "exercise" to get over.**

Well. I've gone on a long time. I'm very proud of myself for how long I've lasted. 25 years right. Well, not exactly. Maybe... nearly 9 years of major depression and uh... 5 years of suicidal depression. That's 5 years of wanting to die without ever taking medication. So I'll probably have an appointment soon. Depending on when the clinic responds. If these meds have some kind of effect before I'm 25 I might keep pushing to 30, who knows at this point.  


\--- I kind of hit a dead end in my head with this statement.  


It was hard before. But now I've had an explicit statement from one of my best friends that they don't like me.. It's going to be so much harder. I suppose, why not go more into my background, it's not like I'm a private person or have anything to hide. 99% of you won't even read this far anyways. When I was younger, all I ever wanted to do was have my own family, grow up, meet the love of my life and have a family. The thought of that gives me the feeling of "I would do anything for my family, no job would be too bad for this family I've made, that I love". But I don't have one, I'm almost 25, I'm a kissless virgin. I suppose it's my own fault, I don't know what it's like to make friends, let alone meet a partner. It's not like I'm socially awkward or anything. I have no issue speaking to people or girls. I'm plenty charming, just, I don't want anyone to have to put up with this disgusting depression of mine. Nobody deserves to be pulled into this lifestyle. And I suppose in turn, I am attacking myself. I wanted to be healthy, I wanted to be better before ever looking for a partner. I never got better. And I never will.  


Please don't tell me I'm just being too negative. Before this post I was so so SO positive, for YEARS. I've gone to therapy, she even said she's seen a MARKED improvement. I knew, I KNEW that it was too good to be true, I knew it wouldn't last and I was damn right. I could go back but I know it wouldn't help. My LAST option is medication. I'll try this before I update this post, but don't be hopeful for me (lol like I'd get a response to this \*vent\* post). Vent tends to equal meaningless. I'm so unreliable as a person, I can't even rely on myself to kill myself. Makes me fucking sick.  


I've gone through multiple phases of spending thousands of dollars funding struggling artists. I couldn't care less about money, but those people who are living their passion who are still able to feel HAPPY. My dream is to just... win the lottery and make sure they never have to struggle again and can continue living their dream. That is my dream. But... I feel like it's fake. My friends make me feel like I'm not a person that wants good things for anyone. They make me feel like... I want it for.. gratitude or... recognition. I couldn't care less about this either. I just want... Nobody to have to feel like this again.  


(Really I just feel like... my friends are abandoning me because I see a bigger picture. A picture that they don't want to see. They just want to see themselves and a small peripheral.) This sounds kind of bullshit but I left it in here since I typed it, and there must be something in my head that made me think this way. I would have erased it normally.  


This far in, it's basically just a venting and coping post. I'll probably add a TLDR at the end.  


My brain can not cope with ANYTHING. Even the slightest bit of stress and my skin starts to burn. My work put me on part time from full time. Nearly 4 years and they like me enough to keep me on despite my unreliability and crippling depression. The only part time employee in the whole company. It's 4am and I start work at 2pm. I just had a little mental breakdown after typing this. I literally had a month long holiday. They really wanted me to take it, and I still can't stand going back. I just can't live like this. Unless I can find a way to never have to work again, I just can't... live... like this. My "passion". Art. I can't stand that either. I don't love anything anymore, I hate everything. So what's the point in living?  


\---------------------------------------  


Well, I don't want to write an autobiography, so the least I can do is stop myself here. If you read the whole thing. Well uh, thanks... You didn't have to, it's a clustered mess. This is kind of reminiscent of the nonsense I would send my friends, just, in the sense of trying to articulate how my depression isn't who I am. Of course, without them understanding at all in the end, then vilifying me.  


I don't expect to get any response to this, not that it matters to me right..? ha ha.. To be honest, really honest. I'm looking for any reason to live. But I'm not just fragile, I'm already broken. What do I do now? This is about 1% of a decade of bottled up emotions.  


Oh yeah, right, I supposed I should make a-  
**TLDR;**

In 4 months I'll be 25. I have honestly, not a single reason to live beyond that. I'll be committing suicide by then.
