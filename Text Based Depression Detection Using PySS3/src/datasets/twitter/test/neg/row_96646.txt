please comment.i want to explain why I feel like this all the time but I'm too exhausted to.
If I had a gun I'd have shot myself an hour ago. 
I hate feeling trapped.

if anyone out there could comment, literally anything, just acknowledge my pain it would be appreciated. Could be something weird, funny, completely unrelated IDC. I just need a distraction.
