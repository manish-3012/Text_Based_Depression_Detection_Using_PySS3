I don't know what to title thisJust feeling really really sad and alone. Don't want to continue living. I also can't eat anymore. My family is worried but I just want them to leave me the hell alone. I've been in hospital for anorexia and depression in the past. I really don't want to go back. I just have no  interest in continuing to exist. I don't want to feel like this anymore.
