I just tried and failedMy domestic partner has been arguing with me for 17 hours straight about random topics he keeps jumping back and forth . Literally wouldn't believe things coming out of my mouth that we both knew to be true, he just kept denying me and getting angry just to get mad. I couldn't take 17 hours of it .. so I tried to suffocate myself. He found me drooling on myself and he's still acting like what he's doing isn't crazy and the cause . Like huhhhhhhhh ....
