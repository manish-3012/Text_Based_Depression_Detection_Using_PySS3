How do I stop myself from repeating mistakes I've made hundreds of times over?Well, not really sure whether this belongs here or not, but I'm sure you guys can help a bit... Basically, there's a few mistakes I always make in life, and I really don't know how to deal with them. Each of them makes me upset in different ways, and some to different levels, but combinations of them can get me feeling really bad really quickly. If it's helpful for you to know, I'm an 18 year old guy from UK.

First and foremost, how do I make a good first impression? I always seem to get off on the wrong foot with people, and it makes it ever so difficult for me to get to know people. I have about 5 friends, and I'm not really sure I can rely on any of them. nobody seems to want to know me. 

I can't ever seem to tell my family anything. I often would rather lie about where I am going, what I am doing etc. if that's going to end up with them asking more questions. From January to April this year, I used to lie when I went to see my girlfriend, and to this day, 3 months after we broke up, they still don't even know she exists.

And here's the big one. I always seem to end up talking to the same two people, every day or two, and without fail I always walk away pissed off. They are complete dickheads to me, and because I have so little to lose, I will talk to them again and again and again, expecting it to change.

To top it all off, I am not going to be going to uni next year (didn't get the grades) I hate most of the people I work with but I still find myself planning a holiday with them because I know it's the best chance I'll get, I never get invited to anywhere by anyone and I seem to be losing all the talents I used to have.

What makes this all so much worse is that everyone I know that is similar to me is doing so so successfully in life.

Thanks for your time.
