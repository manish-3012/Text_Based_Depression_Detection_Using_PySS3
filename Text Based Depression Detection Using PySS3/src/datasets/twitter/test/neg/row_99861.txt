I just feel like the worst kind of person, and I feel like death is the only answer.Iâ€™m in my teens, and Iâ€™ve been considering suicide for years. Iâ€™ve had ideations in the past that have resulted in hospitalization, and now Iâ€™m considering just attempting without reaching out.

Lately my mental health has taken a turn for the worse. Iâ€™ve been having incredibly intense intrusive thoughts, to the point where I canâ€™t distinguish between them and regular thought. Theyâ€™re all disgusting, and make me feel sick and like a feeble excuse for a human being. Some are violent, some are sexual, some are just cruel, and I hate them all. 

In addition, I just constantly feel numb and uncaring, to the point where I feel like there has to be something wrong with me. Iâ€™ve broken a lot of friendships and havenâ€™t always been the nicest, and deep down I feel like I am a cruel person. 

I have a very abusive father who Iâ€™m not in contact with anymore, and I just feel like Iâ€™m the second coming of him.
