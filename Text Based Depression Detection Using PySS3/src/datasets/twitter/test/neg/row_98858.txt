Completely lost on what to doI have no idea what I could or should do to move on with my life. For the past few years, my mental health has been continuously declining, and everything I've tried to do has not helped me at all. I lost all of my friends who I tried talking to about my problems, I haven't been in any sort of romantic relationship since high school, and my family has been incredibly unsupportive to say the least. I've tried multiple different antidepressants which work for the first 2 months before making me feel even worse, and the current one I am taking has resulted in massive moodswings, to the point where I essentially have completely different personalities. My university's counseling office was not helpful when I tried using it years ago, and now it is a multiple month wait to even have an appointment. My grades are declining and I hate my major and internship but dont have the money to stay for another few years to try getting a degree in something else. I don't think I've actually experienced any sort of sustained happiness in years, and basically all of my friends I still have remaining I rarely see because of distance, and I fear they wouldn't still talk to me at all if they saw how much of a pathetic sack of shit I have become. Nothing gives me any sort of joy, and the best thing I can hope for from doing anything is a fleeting feeling of content. I don't want to hurt the few people who do care about me, but I'm becoming even further and more distant from them everyday so the only motivation I have to not end my worthless existence is nearly gone, since it's easier to get the courage to stab myself than to try grinding through another miserable few decades.
