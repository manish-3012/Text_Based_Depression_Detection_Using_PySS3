If I reach out to the online suicide chats will they send police?I am highly suicidal rn and honestly wanna kill myself. I wanna slice my wrist or I could jump off a bridge. I had a triggering moment to where I saw a childhood show that reminded me of when my parents were â€œabusiveâ€ I guess you could say. Itâ€™s the hardest time in my life in maybe 5 years. I really blocked those times out and my memory of those times when I was little are so splotchy. I wanna talk to the online suicide hotline but be honest. Do you think they will call the police? They called the police on me twice when I was 12 but I am much older now. Absolutely cannot have police sent to my house. I want to die so bad, Iâ€™m in unimaginable pain. If someone understands me please let me know.
