WhyI have hated my life since I was 11. I always found myself to be the odd man out. I mean I was always a nice guy to others hell I have helped others with their suicide situation. I never truly fit in anywhere and I grew up to be lonely. Though I did want to kill myself then and there I realized that I should stay alive so one day I can get married. But that ended a bust because no matter who I asked they all rejected me. So what I'm trying to say is What's the fucking point anymore?
