What should I do after custody?I was taken into custody by the police 2 weeks ago when my mom found me standing from a chair to hoist myself into a chain. This change was from my punching bag in the basement. I have anger management, and I hate myself to the depths. I've tried it twice, and the first time, the chain snapped from the ceiling. I have back to back therapy sessions for 3 months. I've been in 7 relationships and dumped in all. I was bullied freshman year due to the presence of my weight at 180, 5'7. I'm 17. I've lost 6 close friends to suicide. What do I do?
