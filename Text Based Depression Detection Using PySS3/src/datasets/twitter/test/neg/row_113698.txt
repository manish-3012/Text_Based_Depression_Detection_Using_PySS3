i had a life with trust and connection and i fucked it upi live alone and have spent about 85% of my time alone since the beginning of covid. ive ruined the first relationship ive ever had where ive felt safe in genuine ways but i keep fucking up and every time i do there is less safety and less trust each time, and i dont know how to repair it any more, because my moods are at a point where im completely apathetic, catatonic. like, get up, sit in one place all day, lose time but also be aware of how horrifically dragged out a single minute is, get stoned so my minds not racing and then go to bed. do it all again. i dont speak to anybody, and i dont hear from anyone. i know at this point im not thought about by people any more and im almost just waiting for a sign or for permission that its ok for me to make this decision. 

the only thing keeping me going is making very, very gory and emotionally uncomfortable art, some of my stuff has been intense enough to cause a loved one to cry to me over it, so now those "close" to me dont really see any aspect of my true feelings any more, it's all too intense for people who love you. i dont want to be a burden any more.

i relapsed on my opiate addiction in the midst of all this bullshit and kept it hidden for as long as i could and kept keeping dirty junkie secrets like i always fucking used to, and even now dont understand why i obviously wanted to sabotage my life so badly in recent months, ive been fucking clean for 70 days, not so much as even looking at some heroin this whole time, ive not even tried to sneakily have a source, Just In Case, and have a "one off". ive taken no form of opiate. ive been sober with the exception of weed and i feel no better for it. everybody in my life treats it as something i should just be doing (not using heroin). my partner told me they dont trust me, the nature of our relationship is vague and i think they just dont like even the thought of me as a person any more. i feel completely and utterly unheard and unseen at this point due to just constantly spiralling into ways of existing and expressing myself that others just dont find appropriate, because it makes them uncomfortable, and im so aware of that reality. so, like. what now? i feel like its truly the end and i want to hear that its a reasonable way to think- i feel fucking nuts and i cant tell anybody im close to. im going to jump off a local viaduct. its 37m high. i have fucked it up
