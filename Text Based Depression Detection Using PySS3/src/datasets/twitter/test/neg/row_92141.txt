About to snap. Losing all hope.I just lost the girl of my dreams in a pretty rough breakup. Known her since I was 12 years old, and now she's completely cut me off. It's the only relationship I've ever had, and I don't know how to deal with moving on from it. I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with this girl. 2 weeks before we broke up, she stopped talking to me, and said she doesn't want to deal with this right now, then broke up with me on Friday. 

The past 2 weeks have been so hard, because I didn't know what was going to happen. I fell into depression, and now that we have broken up, I'm falling deeper, and deeper into a hole. 

I used to have a self harm problem, where i'd use razor blades to cut my leg. Last night I did just this, and I feel awful. I feel like I'm about to snap, and I know that, if left alone, I'm going to do whatever my thoughts are telling me to do.

On top of this, I have an undiagnosed stomach problem that I've had for over a year now, which makes me feel sick all the time. It's gotten worse with the stress, which isn't making me feel any happier.

I feel all the thoughts in my head getting stronger and more intense every day. I feel like an empty shell. I'm thinking about doing stupid things, and I'm losing control. I've decided to book a counselling appointment with my University, but I don't know how long it will take to get an appointment. I need help, before I do something terrible to myself.
