Looking for answers anywhere beforehandI have gone to 2 different counselors about suicide and they have done nothing to help me. All I did was sit there and talk for an hour and never got any feedback. They said maybe 5 sentences the entire time I went, so I left because it wasn't helping me. I am also poor, so I did not want to pay for someone to listen to me; I could do that for free with my friends. Well, it has been about 6 years and I have been keeping all my thoughts to my self again and constantly having to talk myself out of pulling the trigger. The fact that I can put the gun away makes me feel that I'm not bad enough to need counselling again, but I was wondering if there was any way I could avoid holding the gun to begin with (other than selling my gun, haha). 

I feel like going to a psychologist *might* help, but since I've never tried to go through with it that my insurance won't cover the bill. Also very reluctant because of my previous experience. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and will be return with karma!
