I'm afraid that if my parents die I might take my life as wellHey,

I feel shitty asking for sympathy like this because i know many people have it much worse than me and are going through much worse. I have loving parents, am successfull in college and I acutally have some very good friends. Yet every so often I simply see no joy in life and in these moments the only thing thats making me to keep going is the thought how crushing my passing would be for my parents who gave me nothing but love and support my whole life. I'm scared that once they pass I will have nothing to keep me going or cling onto. My friends surely value me but I know they could easily go on without me and in my 24 years of life (its my birthday today) not a single person ever felt something like love for me outside my family. I try everything to be happy like sports, hobbies and socializing but i always end up in this dark place at some point and I dont know if these brief moments of joy are worth the sadness that always comes later. I just dont see a reason for living outside of not hurting people if I were gone
