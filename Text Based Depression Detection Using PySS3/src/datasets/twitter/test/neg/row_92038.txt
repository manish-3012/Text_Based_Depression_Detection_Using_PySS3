Anyone to talk to?Recently I've been feeling like absolute crap, I've attempted 3 times in the past year, my ED flaired up more violently than ever and I've been in q constant state of depression for the past month and a half. I am currently in High school &amp; taking full AP, it gives me something to do other than lounge around all day. Either way, I'm incredibly lonely and have no friends. Was just wondering if I could talk to anyone on here about life and the lot.
