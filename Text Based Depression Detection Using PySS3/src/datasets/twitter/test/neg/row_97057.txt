I feel like I canâ€™t go on anymore.F22, been depressed for as long as I can remember. Everything feels like a struggle. I am tired. I feel hopeless. I donâ€™t know what I want anymore, I donâ€™t know what to do with myself. I feel exhausted of trying. I feel like a burden, as if every bad thing that happens is my fault. I wish life would feel light, happy and joyful again. I feel like running away. I donâ€™t want to go on anymore. The suffering is out of this world. I canâ€™t eat, I canâ€™t concentrate, all I can think about is how big of a fuck up I am and how no one likes me or will ever love me. Everyone leaves and I am tired of all this suffering. I feel like I am good for nothing. I feel like I am drowning again. I went to therapy for a long time, spent a lot of money on it, and my parents canâ€™t pay for it anymore. I canâ€™t forget all thatâ€™s happened in the past, all of my failures and my mess ups, and I feel like I canâ€™t do anything right. I am deeply unhappy. I feel like I donâ€™t deserve to live.
