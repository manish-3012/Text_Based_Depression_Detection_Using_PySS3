Everyday is the worst and last best day of my life.Slowly dying of severe cfs.  Very very bad quality of life.  Basically just torture until you are dead.  Prob killing myself soon.  It doesnt get better.  I can feel it building.  Everyday is endless pain.  So many different kinds of pain.  So much of it.  So much suffering.
