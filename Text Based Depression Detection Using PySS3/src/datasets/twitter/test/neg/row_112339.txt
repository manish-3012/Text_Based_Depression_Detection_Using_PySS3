Have a knife to my throat, help meIm the happiest ive been right now. I tend to have compulsion of doing crazy things in my head and failing others, ocd, but whenever it's about me ridding myself of my life I welcome it. I see another me, worn down, missing teeth, white hair with a light smile and gaze. He has an air of confidence about him, like he's sees everything and knows what the truth is. Whenever im near a flight of stairs, he tells me to jump, when I have a knife in my hand, he tells me to swiftly cut it through my throat. The real me telling me to do it, to finally free myself of living, from disappointing others and things getting worse. Rather than hoping for things to get better while suffering, while the very fact of being alive mocks me, I know for a fact that death will bring me peace, its the only damn thing in this world that im 100 percent certain off. Please tell me to do it. Please let me be free. Please Please don' let me live like this anymore, please stop putting expectations on me, please stop giving me a false sense of hope, pleas just let me be nothing, please tell me to do it, please help me, at least give me this please, the only thing I want is this, nothing more
