I can't believe how weak I have becomeI won't say that I will kill myself because I don't even think I have the courage to do it but It is certain that I've been fantasizing with that since a long time ago. It's incredible for me how my problems have completely overcomed me and the worst thing is that I know many many people in this world have waaaaay worse situations. However, I feel so fucking anxious when things doesn't go the way I want, but the frustration point begins when I realize nothing of what I have proposed have come true.

Love for me is very important and I have been missing it for years. Yes, my parents love me, but of course they do, I am their fucking son.

Actually, this paragraphs probably won't make sense since I don't even know where to start with my little and insignificant problems that are killing my mind.
