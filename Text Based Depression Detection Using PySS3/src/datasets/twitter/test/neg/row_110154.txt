I am unfixable19m, fucked from the beginning. Everyday it gets worse. Every fucking day something bad happens that adds yet another reason to kill myself and confirms i am a total failure. I can't even see myself alive in the near future. I can't even behave like a normal person. Can't go out of my house and do normal adult stuff because i am afraid i will fail and people will judge me and see that i am ugly and stupid. Can't apply for a job. Can't do paperwork because i think i will write some information wrong and have to deal with morwe people to fix it. And my parents have to be with me. Can't even go to the shop because i will screw up when asking for products and my voice is awful and people will judge me. I don't have any  motivation, personality or interests, or if i have they are temporary. I don't care about others. I am a bad person. I forget everything i learn and because of this i have no interests or if i do i quickly forget what i learned. My motivation fluctuates. I am not spontaneous and can't joke or talk to people normally. I am slow and supid. I can't make decisions on my own. I can't express my opinion or preferences because i will be judged. That's why i don't have opinions anymore. I am extremely sensitive to criticism. I don't have common knowledge or common sense. I am totally worthless. I want help but can't ask for it because i will be weak, judged and stigmatized. I tried once. I have dreams but quickly lose motivation and can't do anything. How can i continue if i know i will never be successful and be seen as adequate and intelligent and good looking? I want this suffering to end. This is worse than hell. I can hide it but i can't suffer like this all my life. But i can't get help either. What do i do
