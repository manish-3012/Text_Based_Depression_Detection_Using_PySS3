Dead ends everywhere. I feel like such a failure and burden at everything I do. I wish it would all end.I stayed up until 3 a.m cleaning the whole fucking apartment just so my mom could say they weren't doing an inspection while she chills at her boyfriends. Just fucking great. Thanks now that just set me back to a even higher number of assignments I have to somehow do thats my own fault because I gave up because im such a fucking idiot..


Maybe the Christmas lights could be used as a noose...
I should probably tell my therapist this but I can't because I cant. Because my mom says so. Like why do complain to me about getting me a therapist when I cant even say anything but im the one at fault here.


I am sooooo fucking tired. I feel like im about to do something. I swear if I found my pocket knife. Oh wait that wouldnt do shit.
You know what I hate. When I say I talked about my depression ONCE I GET JUDGED. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO. I AM ALONE. 24 FUCKING 7. I HAVE NOTHING.
