InconsolableI have lost everything. I have major faults like anybody else, but do I really deserve to have everything I have ever loved ripped away from me? 

I donâ€™t know who I am anymore. Everything I cared about, was passionate about, is gone. And there is no getting it back.

Iâ€™ve tried it all to cope: drugs, alcohol, therapy, anti depressants, anti anxiety meds, cognitive and behavioral techniques, meditation, religion, no religion. Nothing works long term.

I mean absolutely nothing to this world, so I feel very ashamed for still breathing its air.
