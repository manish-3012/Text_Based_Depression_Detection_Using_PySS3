I am a burden too those who regrettably interact with me.I've thought about it everyday for the past 3 years, killing myself. I thought marrying my best friend would save me but I ended up being a burden. My best friend goes to college and studies 5 degrees. He is the best, and the busiest, person in my world. He is so busy he works 3 jobs and gives me nothing but support and happiness. I want him to know this. However, I am a loser, dropped out of high school never went on to be much. Then tried to commit suicide a handful of times, and I'm depressed alot, or so others in my life say. I got fired from my job last week. Said I was too sad and depressing to be interacting with clientele. I cant find a job and now im on unemployment too. God im a piece of shit. Today I've decided I dont want my husband to be burdened any further. It would be so much easier for him if I wasn't here. I'm a bad wife, I constantly smoke weed, play video games and constantly cry. I don't have any real defining features or great traits to balance me out either. It would be so much easier if he had someone who really supports him, and loved him just like I do. Someone like a trophy wife who does her hair and makeup all day, and doesn't mind cleaning up after him. I know she'll at least be better than me, which isn't difficult. I know I'm ready, because I want others in my life to be happy and I know this is the right choice. I just hope that I don't burden them further. I'm just a kid, i cant really impact anyone. Sure my parents would lose be but my dad hasnt called me in over 5 years and my mother, well shes currently destroying my very small siblings life just as she did mine. To be honest I wish I was a bigger person, but if taking the "easy" way out is the way for me to make everyone happy. Im going to do it regardless.
