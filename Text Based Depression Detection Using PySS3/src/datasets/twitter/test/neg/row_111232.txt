Had enough of men treating me badly. New bf flirts with his younger colleagueI have bipolar disorder and am pretty much through with life.

Iâ€™m 30, female, very attractive people say but plagued with misfortune. Bipolar disorder has cost me my fiancÃ©, house and career.

I got a new boyfriend recently but discovered when he shared a screenshot that heâ€™s been texting an ex colleague who is pretty and 24 (he is 40) that he misses her and calls her little sweetheart, when I am actually staying with him, cooking him three course dinners and having sex with him.

Iâ€™ve just had enough. Life seems bleak and pointless to me now. 

Tl:dr - I am 30F, have bipolar disorder and new boyfriend flirts with younger colleague
