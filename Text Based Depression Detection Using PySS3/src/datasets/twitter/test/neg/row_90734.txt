I found a nearby bridge that's suspended 276 feet above water. I'm driving to it first thing in the morning and jumping off.I think this is it. I officially give up. I'm a miserable excuse for a human being and I have no more hope of ever changing. I'm nothing but a loser--an ugly short obese balding small-dicked loser with gynecomastia and social anxiety and a severe speech impediment and a crap personality. I am universally rejected by the people I meet, whether for platonic or romantic purposes. I'm 23 and have never so much as kissed anyone let alone had sex and I can count the number of times I've been invited to a social gathering since I was 10 on two hands. I'm revolting both to myself and everyone I meet and I suffer the consequences on a daily basis. I'm over it. I'm over the pain and the depression. I'm over the self pity and the despair and the envy of all the guys who get to live the life I want. I'm over the cycle of getting my hopes up of anything good ever happening before getting them dashed once again when I remember I truly am a worthless human being destined for failure. Natural selection is trying its damnedest to get rid of me so why not give it a little help? I intend to kill myself tomorrow. The only reason I'm not going right now is because it's late and it's a four-hour drive to the bridge and I don't like driving at night. I can't wait for this shitty life to end and to be welcomed by an eternal unfeeling abyss.
