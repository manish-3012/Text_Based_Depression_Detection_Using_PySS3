Sometimes I ask myself, do they really need me at all?I mean I don't really care if they don't, that's just something that happens over time, right? 



I wish I shouldn't have said anything. I wish I hadn't have met such great friends who i really care for. I feel like I ruin things with everything I say, react, or do. I keep criticizing myself. I know it's bad and I should lay easy on myself, but it's really difficult not to. Just a vent to make myself feel better.
