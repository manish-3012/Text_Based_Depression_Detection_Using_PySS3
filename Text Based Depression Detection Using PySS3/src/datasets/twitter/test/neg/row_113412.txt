Wasn't made to surviveI started life in easy mode. I come from a well to do family and I've made it to college. But every little thing gives me huge anxiety and I fall apart when I face set backs. I don't think I was made to live life. I'm incapable of doing it.

People have it much harder than me and they are doing fine. I'm a failure. I'm just not cut out for life.
