I Donâ€™t Want This At AllI just canâ€™t understand why itâ€™s so wrong to end oneâ€™s life. I have been unhappy for years. My only purpose now is to keep surviving so other people donâ€™t have to be sad, but how is that fair? Why canâ€™t I do whatâ€™s best for me? 

Iâ€™m an extremely unlikeable person with my only friend being my wonderful significant other. Iâ€™m constantly angry and sad which causes fights and destroys any possible relationship with other people. Itâ€™s been months since any â€œfriendsâ€ have even attempted to reach out to me. I canâ€™t even blame them for it.

My S/O is the only person Iâ€™d really worry about, but I know he could do so much better than me. I see how I hurt him and how I ruin his day with my baggage. He needs someone who is uplifting. Someone to take care of him for a change. I know Iâ€™ll never be that person. 

This just has to happen. I have to go. Iâ€™m so tired of putting it off, but I know itâ€™s what I have to do.
