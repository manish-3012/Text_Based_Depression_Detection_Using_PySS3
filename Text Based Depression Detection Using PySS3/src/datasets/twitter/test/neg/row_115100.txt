What to say when it's not going to get better?I'm posting because I'm concerned about a friend. He's almost 31, and was diagnosed less than a year ago with a genetic disorder. Its incurable, and presents with symptoms that don't let him lead a normal life (he's no longer able to work, or complete everyday tasks like writing or even eating well). An additional symptom of the disease is depression. On top of that, he suffers from PTSD. 

He's a great guy. He generally has a really good attitude about this, but recently he's become more depressed. He reached out on facebook saying that he's legitimately scared, but doesn't seem ready to talk about it yet. 

Here's the thing- I can say all the right things, but at the end of the day, this isn't going to get better. He knows it, I know it. I've given him strategies (my profession lends itself to his kind of condition) to help with the physical symptoms, but they haven't helped. Hell the guy isn't even allowed to eat his favorite foods anymore because they literally poison him. He's in therapy and has express instructions (which he follows) to go out every night and do something with friends. He does that. He's involved in groups, and charity, and has a great circle of friends that he loves that love him. But I'm concerned it's not enough for him anymore. 

I would love advice on how to talk to him effectively. 

TL;DR: I want to be supportive, but I'm just not sure how at this point.
