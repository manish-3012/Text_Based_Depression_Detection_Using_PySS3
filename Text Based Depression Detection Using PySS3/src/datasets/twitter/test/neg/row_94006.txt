tomorrow.tomorrow is the day. not sure how i'm still trying to figure it out but tomorrow. sleep tonight wake up tomorrow and then soon sleep forever. i'll finally have peace. i think. i have no clue what happens when you die but it has to be better than the life i've had. i hope you all find peace and have incredible lives.
