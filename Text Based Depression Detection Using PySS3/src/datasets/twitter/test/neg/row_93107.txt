I dont know why im still hereI just hate it. My mom always pisses me off telling me "you're such a disappointment" every single fucking day. I'm not doing very well at school either. Im starting to think my friends are fake. They talk behind my back. Im not getting good grades and everyone layghs at me. I feel mad and sad everyday even though nothing happened. I'm sad right now but I don't have anything to be sad at. I don't know why I'm posting this. I think I just need to talk to someone right now. Well I guess that's it. Good night everyone  and I hope if this day was bad for you. Hopefully your next day can be better . well goodbye
