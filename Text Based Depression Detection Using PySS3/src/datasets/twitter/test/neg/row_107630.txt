Seeking suicide support in the OKC areaI posted in /r/OKC too.

Long shot here, but my mother in law is living in the OKC area and currently lost her son to suicide. We just found out this morning. Upon telling her, she has admitted to being suicidal herself, and at this point we are really worried about her as we live in Washington state and cannot be there right now to support her. We cannot make it there until at least next week.

My question is, are there any kind of nonprofit in-person support services for someone going through a tough time like this? I know there are suicide hotlines, but I'm looking for something more.
Any suggestions help. She is very alone there and until we can make it out there I just want to see what I can do to ensure she gets the help she needs and that she isn't completely alone.
