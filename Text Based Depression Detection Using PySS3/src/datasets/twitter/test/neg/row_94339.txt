Hey EveryoneHey Everyone, 

Long-time lurker here, it's 1:36 am currently and I just cannot sleep. But for the first time in many months, my mind has been clear of any suicidal thoughts. I had my first counseling session today with a wonderful Psychotherapist and it went incredibly well and I was able to pinpoint a few causes of my depression and anxiety in just the first day. It's kind of crazy how subtle and how obvious some of our personal problems are. I just want to say to everyone, please stay strong, for what it is worth I love each and every single one of you on here, your bravery in sharing your experiences have helped me in my struggle.

Thankfully,
