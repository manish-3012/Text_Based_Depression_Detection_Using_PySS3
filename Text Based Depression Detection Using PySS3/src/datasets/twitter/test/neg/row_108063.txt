When they ask "are you thinking of harming yourself"We've all heard it a million times. You call somewhere, (e.g. the dept of psychiatry at your insurance, hospital, etc) and you get asked by a nurse or perhaps just a service rep if you have thoughts of self-harm, have thought of suicide, have thought about how you would do it, etc.

Is there ever any point in answering "yes", like if you want better or faster psychiatric/psychological services? Or do they just send the police and stick you in a horrible psych ward?

To be clear, "yes" is the truth. My mind is far from made up. But I'm in a dark hole and want out.
