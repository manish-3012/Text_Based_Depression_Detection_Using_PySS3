Speaking my mindToday Iâ€™ve spoken to friends Iâ€™ve been distant with for nearly 4 months. It was a relief to know we were still mates and it sorta seemed liked they were happy I was there which I suppose is nice (the reason we were distant is because my anxiety and depression were really bad and I needed to try and focus on myself and that isnâ€™t the first time this has happened either). We had a laugh and it sorta felt like old times in a way but we have definitely grew apart which can only be expected when you go 3 months without talking to people who donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going through. Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t trust them with it, itâ€™s just that Iâ€™m too scared to speak my truth (to anyone). We spoke for about 2 hours and I forgot my problems for a while. I hope this is the start of us being a lot more close again and Iâ€™ll maybe be able to speak my truth to them. Over the last 3 months Iâ€™ve self harmed a lot and become obsessed with committing suicide but Iâ€™ve always had something to take my mind off it for a couple hours which is usually family who are normally always round which is nice as we always have a laugh and my 2 little cousins are always round and they canâ€™t get enough of me which can be annoying and thereâ€™s days where I look after them for 7-8 hours which can be tiring but it takes my mind off it which is good I guess. I just canâ€™t imagine what being â€˜normalâ€™ would be like after the last 2-3 years of mental health problems but I feel Iâ€™m making small steps in the right direction despite the constant suicidal thoughts. 

Anyway sorry for rambling on but to you whoâ€™s reading this I want you to know that you matter and I hope you can be able to live a happy life 

Cheers for reading I just needed to get my thoughts out one way or anotherðŸ‘âœŠ
