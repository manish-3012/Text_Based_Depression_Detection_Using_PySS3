I need something to kill meI am so done with life. Itâ€™s like, no matter how hard I try, I canâ€™t enjoy anything whatsoever. Iâ€™m running in circles. I try so hard and I do well at school and work, but I donâ€™t feel any of it. I just donâ€™t feel it. Iâ€™ve been told I canâ€™t kill myself because people will miss me, but how am I supposed to keep living? I canâ€™t keep living like this when every day feels the exact same and every day I feel so much pain that I just want to die. I donâ€™t understand how Iâ€™m supposed to get through this, or how to live. I canâ€™t. My brother committed suicide in September, and although I wish he hadnâ€™t, I understand why. And I wish I could be with him right now. I want to be with him. I donâ€™t want to be here. If I leave tonight, then I wonâ€™t have to feel the pain ever again. I wonâ€™t have to be alive tomorrow. Thatâ€™s all I ever think about. Itâ€™s been 5 years of nonstop depression and I just want to give up. I really do. I came close to ending it back in February, that was probably the closest Iâ€™ve ever come, but I think tonight is going to be it. I have no clue why Iâ€™m sharing this. Maybe someone will find this, who knows. I wish you all the best with your struggles. I hope you find peace. Just know that Iâ€™ve found mine.
