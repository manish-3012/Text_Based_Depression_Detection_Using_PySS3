My dad wants to kill himself, what do I do...He is 56 works full time, today he was drinking and crying saying he wants to die and is sick of life and his plan on how he will kill himself. My whole family is scared (family of 5 with young kids).

Im not sure what to do, I feel calling the authorities will be worse for him, as he will be detained (UK law) and it may make him worse as he has never been in trouble with the police before.

My plan is to go back to work in manual labour and ask him to leave his job and leave the mortgage to me. But I don't know how to go about it. He has to go back to work tomorrow and im really scared for him. I dont want him to go to work tomorrow, but I dont know how to tell his workplace without him getting in trouble with authorities.

help me please, our whole family is sad right now. I dont want to lose my dad
