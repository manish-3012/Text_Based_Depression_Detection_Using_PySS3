They're going to send me somewhere after this...I posted on a throwaway before, but I guess that doesn't matter now... I got in a huge, HUGE fight with my boyfriend tonight. He's going to tell my family about my suicidal thoughts and they're probably going to send me to wherever suicidal people get sent. I wanna do it before they find out.
I'm crazy. And I'm just a burden on everyone, including myself. I wish I was never born.
