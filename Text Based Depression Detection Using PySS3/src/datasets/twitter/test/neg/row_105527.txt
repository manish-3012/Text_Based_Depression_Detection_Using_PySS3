I have a planThe next time both my parents leave, I can drive my truck(Pre 2000's, before they made cars produce less carbon monoxide)  into the garage. Start it. lay down by the exhaust and play on my phone until I lose consciousness.

My only worry is that I can see that there's a tiny opening even when the garage door is closed. maybe like half an inch to an inch opening for the whole garage door. seems like it could be a problem.

anything I missed?
