I talked to my counselorBack in 2013, I first attempted suicide. I was in the hospital for a few days and then a psych ward. I was only 8, but I had my stomach pumped for downing a bottle of medicine. I was being beaten to the point I couldnt walk. I lived with my bullies, if I wasn't being beaten by my cousins, it was my parents. If it wasn't them, it was my classmates. I couldn't tell anyone. I couldn't even tell anyone when I was r*ped. From 2013-2018 I self-harmed.. alot. Whenever I felt down, or whenever I thought I did something wrong, I'd cut or burn or pinch. 2016 was also the year my best friends died. Either the car crash I was in or by suicide. I was alone with my thoughts. My classmates, my friends, the only people who gave a damn about me, were dead. All of my birthdays were spent alone. No one ever showed up. Not even my relatives showed up. My thirteenth birthday rolled around and my mom set up this giant party, I invited everyone I knew. Not a damn fucker showed up. I was crushed, I sat in my room crying most of the night, I cut a bit too deep and now have a permanent reminder. Today I broke down in the counselors office, I showed her all of the cuts I made in the past and present. I showed her the suicide notes I'd been workin on. I showed her the bruises from my mom and dad. Im not sure what's going to happen. But I feel better.
