Yesterday, I considered flipping a coin to decide whether or not to kill myself...I realize now that I have so little respectful for myself, and that needs to change because I do not fucking deserve that. I was going to leave a life or death decision to a fucking coin. I just had this moment where I realized that I deserve more than that. I need to start treating myself the way I want others to treat me. Hell, that is probably I am surrounded by toxic people. I am accepting the love I think deserve. I think deep down I believe I deserve to be hurt. I don't. No one does. I am justifying so much bad behavior because I don't want to be alone, or I feel I need to be punished. I won't allow it anymore. It is okay to be alone and I don't need to be punished. I have fucked up so much but nothing I have done nothing that cannot be forgiven. I'm human. I mess up and that is okay because I have learned from it. All my justifications to treat myself like I am nothing are bullshit. I would never let anyone speak to another human being the way I treat and let others treat me. I need to stop putting others on pedestals. Basically, I am so fucking sick of thinking I deserve to die. I am tired of thinking about life and death in general so I have decided to just fucking commit to life for what it is. I am going to be lonely, depressed, and scared. I accept that life is going to be shit a lot of the time. I knowingly accept the hardships and pain. It is going to be hard but I am not going to make harder on myself anymore. I know it won't be easy to rewrite how I view myself, and there will be days where death is an appealing option but I am going to fight for myself. I am going to tell myself that I am kind. That I am smart. That I am exactly where I am suppose to be. That I am a good person. That I do not deserve to be punished. That I deserve to live. I am going to tell myself those things until I believe them. I am promising myself two things today. One, I promise to live for myself. Two, I promise I will be compassionate towards myself and others. Thank you for reading. I appreciate all the support and kindness this subreddit has ever given me.
