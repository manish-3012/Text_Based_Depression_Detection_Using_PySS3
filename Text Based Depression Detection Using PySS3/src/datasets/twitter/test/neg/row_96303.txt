Wife asked for divorce nearly a year ago still cant pull my self togetherShe left just before Christmas last year and I have yet to really pull my self out of the initial depression. After she left I started going out with friends got a new job and even started dating. but none of it felt like it had a point. In each situation I question why I'm doing what I am doing. Why am I even going to work whats the point of going out tonight that kinda thing. When it came to dating I felt I was Cheating on her. the guilt I felt After the first time I had sex was just horrible I remember just rolling over and pretending to sleep all the while hating my self. This is not me though before my wife i was a typical guy i slept with a lot of girls and it did not affect me. i only really would say i loved or cared about one other girl in my life. but even then i was 18 so when that ended i went right back into my teenage ways. I know what advice I get here wont work until that deep part of my brain is ready but I cant telll this to any of my friends or family. they are all caring people and would most likely devote to much time to my problems when they have their own to worry about. I would just feel selfish and a little pathetic putting this on them. which is also one reason I think I have not crossed the line to wanting to kill my self Yet. but really I just wanted a place to vent and I'm just hoping doing this takes a bit of weight off my shoulders. but any advice is more then welcome
