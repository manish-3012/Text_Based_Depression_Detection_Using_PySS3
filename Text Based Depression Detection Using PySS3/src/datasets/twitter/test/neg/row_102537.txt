I will not die a virgin, but I plan to die afterwardsFor years, I've struggled with MDD and self-harm. I've been on all manner of anti-depressants. I'm still in this position.

I am a virgin at 27 years old. Not out of choice, mostly because I'm a beta and have the seduction skills of a rock. Go ahead with the Steve Carell jokes lol.

I tried to change things. I was a studious nerd in high school, but I reasoned that I could change things in college, because college is (theoretically) a place where we can all reinvent ourselves. I'd rather not discuss the things I tried, but safe to say they led to some quite odd conversations. Looking back, it's sort of amusing.

I tried again in graduate school. I forced myself to go to bars and parties and talk to people. I tried online dating. Nothing ever worked. I'm pretty much a loser cuck for life lol.

I find myself reminded of the line in the *Wolf of Wall Street* movie: "I will not die sober." Well, I have resolved that I will not go to my death with the disgrace of being a virgin. I will instead go to Bangkok or Medellin and buy bitches and blow to my heart's content. Don't bother telling me that I'm potentially contributing to sexual trafficking or whatever, I really don't care at this point.

Unfortunately, bitches and blow are only a temporary reprieve from the suffering of my life, so I will end things soon after.
