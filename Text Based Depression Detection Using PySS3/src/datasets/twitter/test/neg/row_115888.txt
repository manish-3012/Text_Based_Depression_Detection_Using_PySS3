Can't Keep Going OnI'm so tired of relapsing. I don't have anybody that cares about me. I mi9ss my old online friend. I've had such a shitty start, I have no energy and I can't keep going. My Dad never talks to me unless he needs me to clean some room for him. This time he asked me to clean the bathroom and honestly I don't even have the energy anymore. I just lie in bed all day, I've never been this depressed and tonight I was sitting on a stool with a belt wrapped around my neck, ready to kick it.
