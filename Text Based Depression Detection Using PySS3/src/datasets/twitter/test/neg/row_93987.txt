I want to die, Iâ€™ve had enoughHey,

Iâ€™m 26 and final year of university, Iâ€™m one of those people who are too kind and people just walk all over, especially if I love them.

Iâ€™ve been in a 3 year relationship with someone i absolutely adore and will always be special to me. However, from the 15th of June she randomly decided she wasnâ€™t interested in me anymore and preferred to call, message with an ex who treated her like shit in the past. Constantly lying to my face about what was going on, knowing that I obviously knew.

Like a mug, I let her mess me about for two weeks with the whole â€œi canâ€™t decideâ€, â€œI donâ€™t wanna lose you as personâ€ but continually led me along whilst being really awful to me. I donâ€™t pretend to be a saint or perfect, but this keeps happening to me. I give my time, love and effort and itâ€™s always spat back at me later on.

I know the whole thing might seem trivial to some reading this, but i canâ€™t take this pain anymore. People always build me up to tear me down in the most cruel ways. I just want this crushing weight in my body and mind to stop and i donâ€™t know what to do.

I love my family and I know I have good friends, but my own personal life is just constantly the same type of beating on repeat.

Probably havenâ€™t explain this great at all, but I think I give in, i think Iâ€™ve had enough.
