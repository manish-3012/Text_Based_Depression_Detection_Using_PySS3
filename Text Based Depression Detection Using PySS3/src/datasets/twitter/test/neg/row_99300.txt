I feel useless and pointless.I'm 25. My boyfriend just broke up with me today after nearly a year, because I have a lot of severe mental health issues, can't hold down a job, and spend a lot of time just sitting on the couch.

I'm genderqueer, and it makes it really damn difficult to find a partner who understands and loves me for who I am.

He says he loves me, but we're just "not a good fit". At the same time, he's only giving me 2 days to find a place to stay. My mother is abusive, my family can't take me in, and my only option is my friend in Indiana, whose fiance wants to interview me before I move in.

So I basically have nowhere to go, nowhere to turn, unless he gives me more time so I can work things out with my friends.

Honestly? After being broken up with twice in two years, losing my daughter to my other ex, having a shitty mother, unsupportive family, no job, no car, no college degree...nothing to be proud of, I just want to end it all.

I have been officially diagnosed by a psychiatrist dring a visit to the mental health hospital with PTSD, Bipolar II Rapid cycling, Borderline Personality Disorder, Panic Disorder, and severe depression.

I don't want to live anymore.
