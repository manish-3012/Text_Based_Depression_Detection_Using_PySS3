Trust... Or lack thereof..I'm sorry if you are unaware of this, but it's a fucking lie, trusting is a risk and most people if not all will use it to hurt you. I'm done with this, I know whenever I shouldn't trust someone I do for some fucking reason even when I want to stop myself for whatever fucking reason I can't stop myself in the end and I just end up hurt, I'm tired and done with being constantly hurt...
