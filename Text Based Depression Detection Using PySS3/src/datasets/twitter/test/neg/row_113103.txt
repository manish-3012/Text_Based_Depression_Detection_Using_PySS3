Suicide seems so tempting? Why do I feel like such please?First off Iâ€™m not depressed(well I donâ€™t think I am?). Whenever life feels so tiring and painful I always imagine different ways of how I kill myself(most of the time). At school when I see different methods I could kill myself with different equipment I donâ€™t go through with it because I simply just donâ€™t want to die yet. 

There are times where I almost go through with it but luckily back off because:
-I simply donâ€™t want to die yet
-Iâ€™m curious to see how my life would be like in the future 
-It would hurt a lot 
-If I fail then Iâ€™ll be feeling shame and judged 

Iâ€™m sorry if I sound extremely insensitive or ignorant to anyone! Itâ€™s not and wasnâ€™t my intention so Iâ€™m really sorry if I offended anyone or wasted anyoneâ€™s time. 

I would just like to know why I find suicide tempting please.
