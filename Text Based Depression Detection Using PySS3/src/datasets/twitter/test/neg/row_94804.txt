I am sickened at the privileged life Iâ€™ve been able to live as a white maleI have a rash of mental disorders that make me suicidal already, but I donâ€™t deserve them knowing that just by existing I have been given the â€œwinning handâ€ in America. Iâ€™ve survived cancer, homelessness, childhood sexual abuse and divorce, but why should I get to continue living when lives are being taken around me for so much less?
