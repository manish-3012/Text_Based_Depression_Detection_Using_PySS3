I need to be honestThe last three years have been hell. And it feels like it is only getting worse.
Four years ago I dropped out of school. I started therapy before that hoping it would get better. It didn't. I was scared of everything. Afraid I could not live up to my parents and teachers expectations. And my own. My whole life revolved around school. It defined me. I had not life. Nothing. But I could not live up to these expectations. I was sick. Could not eat or sleep.
I quit school in 2008. That was the best thing I have ever done. I felt like I lived for the first time. My brother started taking me to parties and concerts. I fell in love with another guy. I came out to myself. Stopped living in denial. Discovered the furry fandom for me and started making music. My life was fucking awesome. I was happy. For the first time ever I had a perspective in life. Knew what I wanted to do, what I liked and who I was. But still, I was scared of all these new things. So I tried to talk to my therapist about them. Then everything went wrong. To say he didn't approve of my decsions would be an understatement. I trusted him. He was like a father to me. More than my real father ever was. What happened was that worst thing I ever had to endure. He tried to fix me. Told me that I should not have hope because I was propably going to be disappointed in the end, and he didnt want me to be disappointed. He said that it would not work out. I didn't understand him. Didn't undestand what there was about being who I am that would not work out. This wasn't about some fucking job, or school or what I was going to spend the rest of my life doing. This was about being able to accept who I was. I tried to explain to him what this meant to me. He didn't understand. I told him about the fandom. He didn't understand. Told me it was sick and wrong. I told him more and more, in hopes of persuading him. That was a mistake. I didn't understand the hate he had for everything I did. Then I gave up. I had no energy left to fight him. Started to believe him. I tried to shut it out. I lost the fight. I can't remember why I kept going there. Maybe I was hoping for some miracle. That he would acknowledge who I was. When the therapy ended in summer 2009 I felt like I was broken. In the last meeting he told me that he was sorry that he didn't understand me.

Tomorrow is my 23rd birthsday. I'll "celebrate" with people who barely know me. Im scared of everything I am. Cant let anybody know. Suffer from horrible panic attacks. I'm scared of my fucking guitar. Need to tell myselft that it's all not true.

I hate who I am. I fucked up. I made the wrong turn. But I cant stop believing him.


I'd rather end it today than lie to myself again. Three years is too long.


EDIT: I never told him i was gay. At the time I would have worked up the courage to do that it was already too late.

EDIT2: I have to admit that I don't even really know what I'm asking for. Of course the obvious answer is to "Just get over it", and it's not that I don't realize that he was wrong. But that doesn't change anything. The fear of what I am stays,
