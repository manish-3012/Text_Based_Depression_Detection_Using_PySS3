SpeechlessMy parents straight up told me that even if I were to commit suicide, nobody would ever feel sorry for my disappearance. Maybe they said that out of concern, I don't know. I actually tried to see things from their perspectives as immigrant parents coming from impoverished countries. Maybe they tried to toughen me. I don't know lol, but those words made me feel utterly hopeless and worthless. I have actually struggled with my mental health and suicidal thoughts a lot the past year and I even went a bit to the psychologist( mostly because my parents that I was crazy, not because I wanted to kill myself) , but my parents eventually didn't see the point of me going to such a 'tainted' place. They most probably don't know what I am going through right now. I have been actually pretty productive these past 2-3 months and tried to not think of much about killing myself thinking that I would leave my family behind and I really tried my best, despite my decline in my mental health. After hearing them tell me those utterly painful things I completely shut down and I genuinely don't think that I am capable of holding it anymore. Thank you for hearing me out:)
