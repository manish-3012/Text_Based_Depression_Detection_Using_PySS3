TrappedIm a 20m i got furloughed like 7 months ago and have been unemployed since, I live with my mom, siblings and a few other family members. I had a few failed suicide attempts from ages 13-16 and i feel like thats around the time i checked out and put my mind in autopilot so i cant really remember shit unless i focus hard. Working was the only thing keeping my mind busy i think and now i donâ€™t know what to do, everyday feels like a fucking struggle even thought Iâ€™m not doing anything all day. 
I have about $3k and im thinking about maybe buying a ticket somewhere pretty like Sweden and just od on top of a mountain, i wanted to enlist but my brains fried i cant do basic shit anymore. Where would you go if you had $$?
