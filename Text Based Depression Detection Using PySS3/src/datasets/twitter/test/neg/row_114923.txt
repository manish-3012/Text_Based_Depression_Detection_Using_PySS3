All of my Plan B's are falling apartI came out as transgender this past winter and went full-time right away. My transition is the only thing going well in my life, and I would never go back. In fact, after my name change court hearing later this month, I can never go back. 

Since then, a few things have happened. Most importantly, I ended my relationship with someone upon whom I had been financially dependent, but who was also quite unhealthy for me. I got a full time job and made plans to move out.

Part of my work is freelancing, but my only client just shut off the  spigot, possibly because of my own shoddy work.

I made plans to move in with a friend, but I might have offended her enough for her to pull out of these plans.

So right now, I work full time at the front desk of a hotel, earning about $400 a month less than I need to survive, and that's only if I quit therapy. I have zero credit. I have zero friends. There is nothing in my life that makes me happy. I think of the Courtney Barnett line, "I must confess I've made a mess of what should be a small success." 

I cannot imagine feeling joy. I cannot imagine something to look forward to. I'm approaching my own death as a matter of logistics. I was diagnosed with PTSD last year from severe childhood neglect and trauma, raising my risk for suicide dramatically. Transgender woman have a notoriously high suicide rate. Financial stress can frequently lead to suicide.

As far as I can tell, the world is telling me to kill myself. I feel like an afterbirth cobbled together to form a human. I feel utterly destroyed, like some unforeseen enemy has approached every weak point with surgical precision. I feel like my life is falling down, defeated, like a wounded horse. I have no reason to expect a good thing to happen to me. I have no family that can save me--my sister is also struggling financially, and my parents are dead. 

I've drunk some wine and am about to fall asleep. I would appreciate waking up to reasons to live.
