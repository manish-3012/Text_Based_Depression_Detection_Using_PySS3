Does anybody have time to talk?I don't think I'm necessarily suicidal right now, but I suffer from disorganized-type schizophrenia and I've been having some pretty erratic thoughts in the past few hours and I'm not sure if they're exactly normal/helpful. I was just wondering if anybody had free time and wanted to hear a story

I'd prefer AIM if anybody would like to PM me for information
