I run away from my problems, pile them up and it makes my depression increasingly worse.I run away and Iâ€™m not talking about isolating myself. Iâ€™m talking about leaving my province for a few days and coming back and still not dealing with my problems. 

Iâ€™ve been doing this for years on end. Especially when things get really bad. I pack my bags and leave. 

I run away from my problem in hopes of it fixing itself. I run so people can feel better without me for awhile when Iâ€™m gone since I canâ€™t kill myself.
