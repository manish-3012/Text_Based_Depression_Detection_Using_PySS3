A Suicide Note to My DaughterEvery day Iâ€™m faced with the worst decision Iâ€™ve ever had to think about. Do I continue to live with this disease and run the risk of contaminating my daughter, or do I leave her behind knowing that one day sheâ€™ll think to herself that she wasnâ€™t enough to keep me alive? 

How would I tell her that she could never possibly do anything wrong, but that I couldnâ€™t continue to be miserable and just hope that she would never notice? Is there anything I could say that would help her understand that Iâ€™m sick and canâ€™t get better? 

I donâ€™t want to leave her, but I canâ€™t poison her like my mother did to me. I donâ€™t ever want her to feel the way I do right this moment.
