Canâ€™t Handle LifeDoes anyone here just feel they canâ€™t handle life. Like Iâ€™m doing ok, but it just feels so unstable and not sustainable. I have to work and somehow survive for the next 50 years, and I just feel there is no way I can go on for that long.

Iâ€™ve only been in the workforce 4 years since graduating from college, and my soul feels crushed. Iâ€™ve jumped jobs/careers multiple times and I just feel the same. I know a lot of people would love to be in the position Iâ€™m in, yet I still wanna end it on a fairly regular basis. I canâ€™t imagine things getting much better, and if I lose my job they could get a heck of a lot worse. 

I just feel hopeless I guess. I struggle with every task outside of work too, cleaning, going to the doctor, exercising, general adulting kills me. I know people say it gets better but Iâ€™ve been unhappy for so long. I donâ€™t know how long I can take it.
