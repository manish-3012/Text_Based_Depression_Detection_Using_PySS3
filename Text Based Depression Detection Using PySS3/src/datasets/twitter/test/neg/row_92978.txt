Part 5 of my struggle to cling to lifeAn update: I went through 3 days of PHP, and feel more in control of my emotions. However, upon waking, I still struggled to rise from bed (though part of that was just treating myself to an extra hour of sleep) - the crushing effect of the building I can see from my room continues to loom over and torment me. Added context: in that building, I was offered a full-time position, but in asking about the role I was offered differing from what I'd apply for, the offer was rescinded. It haunts me to this day, symbolizing regret and what could have been. 

I become angry when it's a nice day now: I want to be out there enjoying it, free from the worry of finding full-time employment (13 months post-graduation and counting) and carrying myself with dignity. But bike rides require a 2 hour pep talk + prep, which is prohibitive; my ideal path takes me quite near the job building as well. I can't bring myself to enjoy a lovely day, so I regret that the day itself is lovely: I wish everyone found themselves in a similar state of misery as myself (at least for the time being - this search leaves me feeling like an outcast).

On the bright side, many of my suicidal ideations have subsided since beginning the program. Thanks to all whom have helped me survive this long.
