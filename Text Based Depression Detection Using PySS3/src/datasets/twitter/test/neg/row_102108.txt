Im stuck.Im stuck. I don't know why i'm still here, still trying, still failing, still alive. I want to end it all, but i'm scared of what'll happen. I'm fucking scared. I think everybody hates me, and yet I still love them. I don't ever want to leave the people I love. I think I can't trust anybody, and that everybody is fake, and yet, I find myself trusting people and telling them everything. I think i'm annoying, and yet there are still people around me. I just want everything to end, and yet I still find reasons to live, my friends, my lover, my family, my cats.. I'm so sick and twisted that I want everything and everybody to leave me, so that I can just end my life without worries, but at the same time, I find myself wanting more attention, more love, more friends, more of what are the only things good in my life. I'm mentally ill, I know that, but yet I can't bring myself to seek help. I hate being seen as weak, and yet, I want people to know how I feel, how I hurt. It hurts being alive, but I still hope that it'll change someday, but I know that it won't. And it hurts. It hurts so fucking much. I just want help. Everything fucking hurts, and I want it to stop. I just want everything to stop.
