Nowhere to run or hideI guess I'll give some background. I'm a 17 male with Aspergers, possibly just straight up autism.

I can't do college, but she refuses to accept it- And she's already went through all the work of getting me in my first semester. It's too much- The constant work, having to check every day, one assignment going bad ruining everything. She doesn't make it any better, always putting on a kind facade with anything but work. When it comes to this, she goes to swears and insults- and just can't understand how I can't do it or handle it.

I try my best, and it might sound like I'm making excuses, but it just doesn't happen. She's decided it's because I have too much free time, and has taken away the one hobby I only do on the weekends and that lets me connect to people, roleplaying games. I use these to get out of my shell and try to learn how to talk to people, since I can't drive out of fear. I now have been banned from it, along with video games. All time must be spent on work. I'm not even supposed to be typing this, but she thinks I'm working on an essay.

I can't just run off, even when I'm 18. I can barely drive, and have no talents. I'm fairly good with English, but I wouldn't have a degree or anything. If I go through college, I'll end up with shitty grades and tons of debts.

It might sound dramatic, but with nobody to turn to, nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide, I don't know what I can do. I can only think of suicide, but I'm sure if I asked to talk to a counselor for those thoughts, like the last time I brought it up, she'd scream at me and call me stupid for saying it. 

What do I do? Am I genuinely just too stupid to live? I don't even know what I could do for a living.
