The only reason Iâ€™m still alive is because I donâ€™t want to hurt my family.Seriously though, for the past 5 years Iâ€™ve had this thought that if I didnâ€™t have a family to worry about I wouldâ€™ve killed myself a long time ago.  Nothing ever goes right in my life anymore, and the only thing Iâ€™m contributing to this world is a kid who complains about everything and who is depressed.   If I didnâ€™t exist I can guarantee that this world would be a better place.
