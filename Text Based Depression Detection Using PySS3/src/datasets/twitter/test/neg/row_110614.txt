Graduated college 1.5 years ago, been unemployed since, no friends left, no romantic relationships, family getting tired of my unemployment.I don't think I'm autistic but I suck at forming any type of relationship. Interviews go terribly, I make good first impressions but it always turns awkward so friendships haven't panned out since high school, I think I'm decent looking but I've never asked anyone out because I'm a coward and even if they pan out who wants to date an unemployed 24 year old living at home. 

I know they say things get better and I'm sure they're right, but I don't think I'm strong enough to see it through honestly. I guess if my parents get fed up and hate me enough then there's no harm in ending it right? i just don't want to show up all over the news as the loner who killed himself because he couldn't get a job or a date or maintain any friends
