I am about to end it.This is gonna be embarrassing, and you'll see my naivety as a teenager shine through.

I have always battled with depression and suicidal thoughts but I've been able to battle it until now.
I have it planned for next week I'm going to overdose on pills that I have in my room. I am posting this to ask for help. Before it happens.
I got news that my parents are getting a divorce, and understandably, it has shook my to my core. I can never have stable friendships or relationships and I end up ruining every good thing I feel.
I am a walking path of accidental destruction.
My parents are both disappointed in me for being lazy in school, even though I regularly bust myself until I have nothing left to give.
I hurt people on accident too much to even think about. 
I've lied to so many people, I manipulate, I steal, I don't deserve anything  
I have a girlfriend who has treated me so well these past three months. But, I feel, even though she says it daily that she loves me, I still continue destroying everything in my way, even her life.
And I have destroyed her life.
I get pissed off at her for no reason.
I get angry. 
But I still love her.
And we're both pretty sure she's pregnant. We've done everything we can, even though it's just been a week, taken contraception pills (plan B). But after all that there's still continuing signs of pregnancy. And I can't handle that. She told me that if she is pregnant she'll kill herself because we're in a state of no abortion. I can't be alive to witness that. I can't be that witness and be the only person who knows why.
Thank you for taking the time. 
Please help me.
