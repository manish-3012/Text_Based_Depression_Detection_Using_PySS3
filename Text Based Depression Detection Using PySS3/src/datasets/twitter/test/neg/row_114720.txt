Have begun writing goodbye letters... can't take it...I want to disappear off the face of the planet. Who knows what comes after - perhaps I'll be reunited with my cats... that's all I wish if there is an afterlife.

The only thing keeping me here is my kitten. He's so kind and loving. If I go he'll be all alone. But then I start to make a plan of giving a friend of mine my keys under the guise of "for any emergency" so that she can take him elsewhere when I pass.

I've begun writing notes to people who might miss me. They'd be sent out right before I go, either by post or by email. I suppose a Facebook post would happen as well.

I guess I should mention I'm bipolar and feel like my medication has sucked out all the life out of me. And if I don't take it I spiral into psychosis. There's no winning.

I'm so sick of everything. I don't see the point of trying to achieve success.

I'm also FTM transgender and the transition is going much slower than I anticipated.

I feel like I'm going to go through with my plan no matter what I hear here, but perhaps there is hope, or something... I cry as I write this because I don't believe it when I say there is hope.

The looming holiday season isn't helping much, either. I'm estranged from my family and no one has invited me to spend the holidays with them. I know if I had a good family I'd definitely invite a lonely friend to spend it with us.

I feel unwanted.

I'm jealous of my best friend who has gained more friends over the years and who goes out a lot.

I keep putting off phoning a potential school to finish my high school credits and I'm already 22 without a grad diploma. Worthless.

I have a lot of pills that I can take now. I've tried in the past several times and ended up in the hospital. I've been researching bridges in my area where there's a lot of traffic. It's never been this bad before.

Thanks for letting me rant. This is a throwaway but I'll be checking and replying to those who try to help. Thank you in advance.

This is my last straw.

I don't even know if I want help... I don't know why I'm posting this.

Edit: No one's here to talk, I guess... that makes me even more sad.
