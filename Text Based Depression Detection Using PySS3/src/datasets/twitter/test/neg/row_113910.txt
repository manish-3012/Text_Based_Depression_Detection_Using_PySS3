My brain feels permanently damagedIâ€™m struggling with suicide every day.  Iâ€™m constantly tempted.  Iâ€™ve written notes and I have my methods.  All I can think about is my failures, all day every day, and Iâ€™m always in pain, physical migraines that keep getting worse and collapsing my brain into agony.  Iâ€™m going to therapy and Iâ€™m on meds but I still want to do it.  By some sort of miracle I have a girlfriend for the first time in years and I now have someone to talk to, someone to snuggle with on the couch, and Iâ€™m having sex for the first time in almost ever.  I thought that would be enough to â€œfixâ€ me, but itâ€™s not.  My pain just continues to get worse every day.  Iâ€™m out of options.  Iâ€™ve been reading posts on this reddit for weeks and this is my first time posting.  Iâ€™m so fucking scared of myself, like Iâ€™m getting closer to the inevitable.  Someone, please help me.
