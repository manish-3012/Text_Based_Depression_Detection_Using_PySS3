I thought about jumping into traffic yesterdayI was looking down from a railroad track and I saw all these speeding cars. I thought about how easy it would be to just let go. Unfortunately, on another road there were cars behind me stuck at a red light, they were honking at me and I couldn't stand all that attention so I came down. I'm so mad at myself, I can't even bring myself to take my own life.  I'm such a loser
