Iâ€™ve got everything plannedThis weekend is when Iâ€™ll pull the trigger. Jan 3 is the day.

I would have life insurance for two years by then so my death will be covered. Iâ€™m worth more dead than alive, at least my family wonâ€™t have to worry about money anymore.

Asked my best friend for her PayPal so I can send her my life savings.

Iâ€™ve got the gun and the bullet laying right beside me.

The only thing left is to leave a note. I think thatâ€™s the hardest part, because I never know what to say. I think Iâ€™ll just make it short and sweet.

â€œI loved you all. Iâ€™m sorry.â€
