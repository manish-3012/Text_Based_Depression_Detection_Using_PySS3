My girlfriend's brother tried to kill himself.This is a throwaway. I'm not going to give much detail on how he did it, but I've been told he's relatively stable. He may suffer internal organ damage. We don't know yet. My girlfriend is absolutely shell-shocked (I think that's a good word for this situation) and I'm at a complete loss on what to do. I can't physically be there for her. I'm several towns over and have serious work obligations until the weekend. 

I'm angry at her brother. Angry that he would put his family through something like this. They don't deserve this kind of pain. But I can't tell my girlfriend this because she clearly has enough on her plate as it is. To add insult to injury,  they lost a family member last week - her grandfather. And for her brother to turn around and do this. I'm just furious. He's never been known to be suicidal in the years that I've known this family. 

When Robin Williams (R.I.P.) hung himself I was angered because I wondered why he'd put his family through that kind of pain. A friend helped me understand that suicide isn't a cowards move. It's a heavy choice. And if somebody decides to end their life, we should respect that choice at the very least and understand they're not trying to put others in pain. And I believed that until now. I just absolutely cannot understood why he (gf's brother) would do this. I don't know what to do. I love this girl, but I'm powerless to help her.
