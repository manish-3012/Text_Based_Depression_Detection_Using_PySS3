Idk what to do anymoreI spoke to Corey awhile back
He said I look like the type of person to commit suicide
I wasn't aware I was giving off that vibe
I always thought I was doing a good (or at the very least descent) job of not seeming so depressed
I don't really chose to be sad /mad as fuck all the time
Or complasint
Or really any other emotion than happy
I don't remember every having an extended period of time where I was truly happy
There's been a few times where I stop in a situation , look around and think
This isn't terrible
But seldom does that happen
Even from a young age I remember not really wanting to run around and play with kids and I would rather just sit by myself and sulk
I think my " depression" stems from my family, a series of unfortunate bull shit, and mild psychosis
I'll start with my family
My dad specifically
He's an asshole
I mean I guess I "love" him but not really
I don't like him
But I don't want him to die
If that makes sense
If I was financially stable and I had my shit together
I wouldn't loose sleep over never seeing his bitch ass again
Always yelling
Putting himself above everyone else
He will never say it 
But he thinks he's god
Like he is some great gift to the world
I can't blame him though 
He was raised In Anger
His father (my grandfather ) was abusive verbally and physically
So that's what he learned


My step mother
I love her 
But she can be an ass face 
She has a mega attitude problem
And she treats me more like a pet than a son
But the problem with both of my parents is that the believe that since I am their son the my opinions, viewpoints, and feeling 
Are wrong and unimportant
Which is fucked up
They're quit to say " you can talk to us, and tell us anything" but in the same breath denounce my feelings as dumb or wrong
My parents are good for that
Like how could the way I feel
A FEELING
Be wrong
Its not like there's a right and wrong
And don't even get me started on my whore of a cuntbitch birth mother demetria 
But I digress


The very moment I knew life was gonna be shit was in the first grade
I had a crush on this girl
Its not like it was the first girl I had a crush on but it felt different
She felt more important than the other ones
We were relatively close
But I remember vividly 
It was theÂ  day before Christmas break
I had spend HOURS making a card for this girl
I was nervous as shit
Finally I got the courage to give it to her
And she looked at it
Looked at me 
Looked at it 
Looked at me 
Then ripped it up in what felt like an a million pieces
Threw it at me and yelled ew
Haha in hindsight it seems a little funny
But at the time it felt like sub zero did a fatality on me
I just sat there and cried 
Like a little bitch
For like 30 minutes until my dad had to get me
At that moment I remembered something I heard on TV a few days before
It went something like
"This is life its suffering and it sucks, but sometimes it alright" 
or something like that lol
From then on it was a series of bull shit scenarios
From getting my ass beat daily because by bitch ass teacher ms Green would call my dad on some bs everyday
To me getting bullied on the regular
To me not getting a birthday or Christmas present for 7 years straight
Like seriously
I haven't gotten shit since my tenth birthday


I guess I always just thought things would get better if I say positive
And be a nice guy

Hahaha that's super wrong

My thought process was if I'm nice and do everything I can to be a nice guy good things will come and my life would change

I thought I could change my actions and things would be better
They never got better
This became super evident senior year
That when I realized that all my effort to change 
Helpful nature 
Somewhat positive out look
Didn't mean shit
Nothing changed
Nothing got better
It keeps getting progressively worse

And I can't put the blame on other people

I'm just an unpleasant person to talk to and be around

I'm awkward as fuck
I'm tall as fuck
I'm ugly as fuck
And I guess in some aspects I prefer it that way
I'd rather distance myself before someone gets the chance to hurt me
Lol I sound like a straight bitch
Why am I even writing this
...
Fuck it
This isn't a suicide note as much as it is the reasoning behind why I contemplate it so often
I just feel mad at myself and the world
And I try to suppress that feeling as much as I can
And often I feel as if the wall are closing in on me
Robin Williams once said suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem 
But
He committed suicide 

so...
