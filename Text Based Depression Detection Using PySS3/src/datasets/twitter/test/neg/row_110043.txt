I need to die, to escape, and I can'tI have to die, I can't live anymore it's too much and I hate it. But I can't die because I have no access to anything that could kill me effectively. People who say they care are selfish as fuck. They don't care, they just want me to live for their own interests. If they cared they wouldn't be so okay with me living in such emotional pain. I'm sick of being in bed almost 24/7, I'm sick of being bored of everything and most of all I'm sick of other human beings. I don't give a shit how privileged my life is, I fucking hate it. Whatever, angsty edgy teen stuff. I'm done. I need to die but I can't. If I don't die I'll do something else but I've asked for help before and got the exact opposite, so to be safe I'm not saying it here. But it's getting difficult to think of anything else because it's my only other option

I can't talk to anyone except strangers by text (such as reddit and things like that) because of my selective mutism and it's impossible for me to be helped because of that so don't suggest a hotline or therapy please
