Idk vent post? Im not good at titlesI have been through so much shit in the last few years and this past year has been the worst.  parts of it were good but it all just kinda feels like im a placeholder at this point....im just here to make sure that a specific percentage of air gets used up...  My boyfriend tries to help but i dont know how to tell him or our friends that i feel too tired to bother....i want to give up. I dont want it to just end up as an attempt though. Its the only reason i havent yet really...i keep my journals and i take my meds and i do all the things im supposed to as a good little societal robot but why? Wheres the end and whats the goal? So my already disabled and decrepit body can get worse my mental health somehow gets worse than it already is and i lose more people i loved? My family never really cared and has only ever used me. The friends i do have i barely see my children have all either died or been sent of to the toxic waste of a being they call grama and the little bit of future i thought i could hold out hope for is getting ripped away because of it. Why do i keep trying when every turn i make keeps putting a pit of spikes at my feet? Wheres the off button for life? My art and poetry dont really make me happy anymore tbh
