Iâ€™m currently in the works of planning my final days on earthPreferably Iâ€™ll do it before school starts because I really hate school. Iâ€™m going to try and do most of the things I like before, and Iâ€™ve already started by baking cookies. Next is public transit. I donâ€™t want to grow up at all. I never want to go to work. How can anyone find that appealing? Just work until youâ€™re too old and then live for 20 more years till you can barely move at all. Nothing matters on the planet anyways. In four or five generations of your family no one will even remember your existence so itâ€™s not like your cursing your family to die out or anything.
