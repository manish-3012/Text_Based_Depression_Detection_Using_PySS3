Next time I'll actually load the bullet.I got so close. I had my dad's pistol pointed to my head. Magazine in, and hammer cocked. I probably spent about 5 minutes just deciding which angle I would point the gun before I pulled the trigger. I decided to put it against my temple and I squeezed the trigger harder than I ever could again. But nothing came of it, because I didn't load the bullet.

Next time I'll be sure. Hopefully soon.
