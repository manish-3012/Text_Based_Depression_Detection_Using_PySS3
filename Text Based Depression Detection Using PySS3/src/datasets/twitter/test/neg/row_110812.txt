How did telling your family about your suicidal ideations affected them?I tend to isolate myself when I go to these depths. I never seek out help, and just want to be left alone.

My family usually sees this as a disrespect to them. I guess I donâ€™t show how sad I really am, and I might just seem cold hearted when Iâ€™m actually crying inside.

My psychiatrist knows about these thoughts. I have also briefly told my younger (adult) brother about it a few years back. He freaked out, and we never talked about it again. 

I felt like he started getting sadder after that, but it could have been unrelated. We used to be close as kids, but our relationship strained over the years as I got sadder. Right now I canâ€™t see it ever recovering.

I just feel like Iâ€™m bringing everybody down with me by being this sad all the time.

I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m just curious, or if Iâ€™m tired of keeping it in, allowing them to think I donâ€™t care about them while I just canâ€™t get myself to show affection.

I am just wondering how did your family react after you shared your suicidal ideations with them.
