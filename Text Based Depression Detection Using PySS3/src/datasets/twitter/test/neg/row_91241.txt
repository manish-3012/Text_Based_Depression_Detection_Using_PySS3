What is even the fucking point?Legitimately, I just want to know why I'm supposed to even try and pretend I can give a shit when nothing about my life will ever amount to anything. I'm a fucking joke. My birth was a mistake, my childhood was forgettable and my adolescence was hell only because I was too weak to face it. And what was at the end of it all? An emotionally dead, talentless, worthless, unemployable, ignorant, selfish, fat, lazy piece of shit. My parents wish I had been aborted, my family wishes I would disappear, every friend I've ever made is relieved to see the back of me. There is nothing, NOTHING in my life even worth living for. So why do I keep on living? Why can't I just do something and end it? Why can I not just put an end to everyone's misery and remove the cancer from their lives? It's not like anyone would miss me or as if I would me missing anything if I stuck around. Because how can I possibly justify this? How can I justify what a terrible, miserable existence I lead? How can I justify what an unrepentant waste of oxygen I am? How can I justify the fact that I have to force myself into the lives of people who want absolutely nothing to do with me? How can I justify the fact that there is nothing in my life worth living for, and it's only my own cowardice that keeps me alive?

What the fuck is the point of continuing to live when there is nothing to live for?!
