SchizophreniaBut they don't know that I am a rat in a maze created by the angels. I can see their eyes watching me from beyond and they bend reality around me. They babble nonsense in my ears. People are always staring and talking about me when I go outside. When I sit in my cubicle at work I can hear my boss talking about firing me and I can't concentrate. the angels they reach in my brain and twist things around and i can't take it anymore

I hhope they do not resurrect me when I am dead for they will torment me. I have access to a 12 gauge and today might be the day. can't let myself crash or i don't know what'll happen.
