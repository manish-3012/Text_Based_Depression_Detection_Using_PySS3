I want to finally check into a mental hospitalI have been dealing with depression for years and on and off wanted to kill myself. I'm finally at a point where I think I really want to just end it. That's why I think I should try and force myself into one while I still have somewhat of a clear head. But the problem is, I have a court case in two days for a drug charge I got back in March. Do I have to wait wait for the court case to be over then? Cause I want to get checked in ASAP.
