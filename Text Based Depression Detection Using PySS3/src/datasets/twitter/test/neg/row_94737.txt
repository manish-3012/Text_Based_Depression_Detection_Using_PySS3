I wreck everythingI was lonely and depressed. A "friend" convinced me to try dating again. I got so lucky and found someone who I feel actually loves me and has made me feel the closest to being happy I've ever been. I'm not as lonely anymore but I'm still depressed. And it's ruining what I have. I'm upset and suicidal and have no motivation every day. My boyfriend tells me "it's ok" and "you make me happy" but I don't believe it, I feel like I'm forcing him to say that because he knows I'd just get more unstable if he told the truth. I'm ruining the one good thing I have. He tells me to keep going. But if he already is unhappy, or at least less happy, because of me why can't I just end my life. He'll be sad when I'm dead but he already is sad because I'm alive. But I don't want to hurt him. It's my fault. My fault for deciding to date him and make him care about me if I were gone. I should have killed myself before any of this happened, before I had a reason to want to stay alive.
