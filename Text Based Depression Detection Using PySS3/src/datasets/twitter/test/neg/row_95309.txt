I feel crappyWell. Found out a woman I liked (read fancied) was taken. Fuck. This happens every fucking time and now Iâ€™ve got a raging headache. I need to get this out of my mind. Wish I could do that with a couple clicks of a mouse at my computer but no. Life doesnâ€™t work like that. Wish I had the gonads to just fucking end my misery and pain. I hate when I do that. Fall for someone who is taken. No I am losing hope that I will ever find someone to love and whom will love me for who I am and not what society thinks I should be. All I have ever wanted is someone to just lay in a bed with me and cuddle. I love cuddles but I take really hot showers to deal with that. I just want the bullshit to END. I donâ€™t want to wake up tomorrow because nothing will change
