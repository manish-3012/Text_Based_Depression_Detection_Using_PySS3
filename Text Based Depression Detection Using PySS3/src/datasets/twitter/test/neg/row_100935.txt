i can't believe anything anymore.Nothing anyone tells me will change my mind about killing myself. You can tell me you love me a thousand times and that you'd be lost without me and I'd never believe you. The only thing that keeps me from crashing my car on the way to work is my own will. I tell myself I have to keep trying. Everyone else? Liars. Not that I'm not a liar, but what good am I to keep around? I have no redeeming qualities. I only make things worse. And no matter what I do to try and fix that, I end up two steps backward for every step forward. I don't deserve life. I'm a waste of space.

I'm not looking for comfort, for anyone to tell me not to do anything, for people to tell me I matter. Because I won't believe you. I just need to talk.
