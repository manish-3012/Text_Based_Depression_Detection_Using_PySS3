Living with the worm. A confessionI've come on terms that my suicidal thoughts are never going to end. Sometimes they will be a whisper, others a deafening scream begging to end the suffering. Like a worm eating my sanity, little by little. But I will not stop me. It will not stop me from enjoying every joy in my life. Laughing harder and smiling broader. Whenever I can outrun it, I will flee the worm.   


All I can do it's to acknowledge it and accept it, and to help others to ease the pain of others with my safe affliction.  


I love you all
