Yesterday i said i would regret not killing myself, and i did.The maintenance of being a quadriplegic is unbearable. I bailed on an attempt to kill myself yesterday and regretted it. The feeling of regret came as the hours and minutes ticked close to signal the arrival of my caregiver whom bathes and strips my carcass naked. The regret was stronger as I lay in bed feeling the feces uncontrollably make its way out of my ass and fill the diaper. 

I am exhausted from wear my fake smile all day at therapy. Wanting nothing more to sleep and never wake.

Freedom and all that i love stripped from me, and replaced with, pain and humiliation, why endure the life of a  quadriplegic? Life goes on, yes, but mines life is hallow.
