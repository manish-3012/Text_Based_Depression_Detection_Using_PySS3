Why can't I be selfish just this once?I don't think I can take it anymore. I absolutely hate living. I want to just end it all. Every day, I keep thinking more and more about why I'm still alive, and I'm running out of reasons to stay this way. People always say that it's a selfish thing to do, but after all of this, don't I deserve one thing to myself? I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to suffer anymore. I'm tired of pretending that life is actually worth it. I'm only 20, and I've already seen enough of this world to know I don't want to be a part of it anymore. I want to be gone, and I want to be forgotten. Is that too much to ask?
