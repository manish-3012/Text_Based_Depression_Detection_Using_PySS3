Just venting right now but who knowsI really just wish i was for once truly loved by someone as soon as i got kicked out of my exs home by her grandma i feel as tho she was so eager to turn on me and stab me in the back! Im still not sure if she may just he agreeing with her grandma to get her crazy ass to leave her alone but i will know next weekend and if it goes the way i expect it to go i will have nothing left and i am gonna act on my suicide plan because i don't belive anyone ever gave a flying fuck about me im just a mistake child with severe mental disorders that have been worsened by abuse and not feeling love since i was about 11ish i never knew how to express emotion properly and thanks to my parents it may have been the veey undoing of the one relationship where i think i really loved the person
