Please help me get through episodesFirst time posting, i feel like i have no one to talk to. I'm in a situation where i keep fluctuating between wanting to be really self destructive (generally late at night) then the next day i feel numb and regret anything i did like alienating friends or hurting myself in visible ways. I really feel like i'm going to do something bad if it keeps getting worse, does anyone know a good way to get through these periods of time? the urge always passes but i don't know how to make it go faster/good ways to stop myself until i'm able to calm down or sleep (I've tried sleeping pills but they made me feel awful)
