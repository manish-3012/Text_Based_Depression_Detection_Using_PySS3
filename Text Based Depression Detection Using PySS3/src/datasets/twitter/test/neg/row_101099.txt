Enough of the sufferingHello, 

I am edging so close to the end and taking the leap to end it, I guess its a culmination of things. I'll list them: 

1) I was sexually abused when I was 5 by my 13 yr old sister. I didnt know what the fuck was going on but this has really fucked with my head ever since.

2) I was sexually abused at 6 by a 14 year old male neighbour again same as above 

3) I always have such negative self hating thoughts, whenever i get something good i always expect to lose it. Its a constant mind game sometimes i feel on top of the world, other days so flat i can barely get out of bed

4) i worked my hardest and paid off my house, i have a wife and 2 beautiful daughters.do you think this would make me happy? Nope i cant even conquer my demons for them. Im under 30 and i cant imagine how much i will continue to deteriorate in the future.

5) ive got diagnosed ptsd, worked to a high exposure of self harm i.e. multiple slash ups &amp; hangings on a daily basis for a 2 year period.

6) im just a weak pathetic human being, my wife has repeatedly been unfaithful in the past and im such a fuckn pathetic piece shit im too scared to leave - i dont give a fuck about myself.

7) ive been battling father issues as he never got in touch or saw me and died when i was 13 

8) i am starting to believe i have bipolar or something and it will only likely get worse, i dont know whats wrong with me i dont want medication i dont want to fight a life long battle with this whirl wind in my head.i wish i could be  b normal like other ppl

So i guezs  that sums it up i have been thinking about ending it so much lately ive begun to visualize it.i cant stop this illness in my head i am self destructing and i feel like its a matter of time my soul is so weak and i cant fight anymore
