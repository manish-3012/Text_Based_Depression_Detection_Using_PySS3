My ex gf/ roommate attempted suicide last nightThis was the third time, the second time with me around to stop her. 

According to her, the first time she was out of town and walked to a bridge and was intercepted by police and escorted back to the hotel.

The second time, she was depressed and kept asking me for sex but I wanted to respect our boundaries. It wasn't just this that caused it.

Last night I was on my way home from work and got a long voicemail of her crying. I rushed home to find her in the bathroom cutting and she set up a de facto hanging in the kitchen. We agreed that she needs help so we went to psych er and tried to admit her. They did a breathalyzer and she blew    
.23 and was not admitted. I drove around with her for a while until she passed out in the car, trying to stall until she was sober and could be admitted. She refused to go back after they didn't want to help her. 

I've secured all the rope, pills, sharp objects and knobs to the gas stove and am hoping she will agree to go back in the morning. 

Now some back story.

We've known each other for about 10 years in an on/off relationship. She's experimenting with females and I fully support her being happy. Over everything she is my friend. 

Her mother recently found out that she is gay and pretty much disowned her. She's hispanic and I feel she thinks she's going to lose her family. Her mother lashes out (she's a complete narcissist) and this was the cause of the last two attempts. 

I don't know what to do at this point, she is a part of my life and I do not get emotional but the extent that she went to pushed me over the edge and I cried the entire time she slept. She's been napping but is now up and about. It's been eight hours.

I need help
