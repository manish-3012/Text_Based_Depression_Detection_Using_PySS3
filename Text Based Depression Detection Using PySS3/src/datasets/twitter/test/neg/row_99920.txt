Why I want to dieI don't really know why I want to die.  Everything is going well in my life besides school, which could be slightly better.  I just constantly have the thought "you should end it" and I want to. I really don't see a point of my existence.  I don't fit in with my family, I fight with them constantly because they can't seem to ever fucking understand me.  Keep in mind I'm a 20 year old college student, I'm not a little kid complaining about his phone being taken away or not relating on small things.  I'm very lonely. I talk to no one at school.  Today after work I drove home with my seat belt off, hoping someone would crash into me and kill me.  I've always had these thoughts of being worthless, unintelligent, scumbag, and an all around piece of shit.  Maybe I'm not cut out for life?  Thought I'd post something incase I actually am.

Title is dumb and is kinda an oxymoron , I'm just so confused.  Sorry everyone
