Depression and loneliness caving in.Iâ€™ve battled depression and anxiety for most of my life. I had a rough childhood and upbringing, my ability to talk and make friends is stunted at best. The last two years however have been hard. Iâ€™m a mother and I stay at home which is already an isolating endeavor but now I know Iâ€™m dealing with postpartum depression and anxiety but I just canâ€™t shake it. I have not spoken to a doctor as I refuse to go on meds. I know they may help some people but I just donâ€™t trust them. I wouldnâ€™t hurt my children but I however just want to die. I have a very very small group of friends but the friendships feel superficial at best and we rarely see or talk enough for me to take the edge off my loneliness. Iâ€™m married and though Iâ€™ve discussed my depression with my husband he either doesnâ€™t take it seriously or itâ€™s a competition and suddenly heâ€™s more depressed than me etc. Everyone says go out and do something or make friends but for someone like me itâ€™s not easy and it adds to my anxiety. I used to be close with my sister in laws but theyâ€™ve basically ghosted me for a very long time now and donâ€™t try to include me at all which is really hard as all of our kids are the same age, go to the same school, and play the same sport together. However Iâ€™m not included nor are my kids in hanging out with everyone. I really feel like a failure as a human, Mother, wife. I just keep thinking how easy it would be end it and not be a burden on anyone. All I keep thinking is how I can actually go through with it because someoneâ€™s always home or I donâ€™t want my kids to find me. I feel like if I werenâ€™t around then my kids wouldnâ€™t get outcasted because I wouldnâ€™t be blocking them from socializing since clearly everyone just has issues with me and thatâ€™s why my husband and kids get excluded.
