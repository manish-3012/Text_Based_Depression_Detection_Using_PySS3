My Life Went Downhill And I Want To End It6-7 months ago I was flying I was at 100. Everything were going fine. I was â€œhappyâ€. I had reasons I had pride to live. Everything was going great and happiness was part of my life. 

Now Iâ€™m at 0. I lost everything. Lost my pride, my honor, my happiness, my reasons to live. Lost friends, lost my skills and the motivation to do anything and my will to continue living. I have anxiety which makes depression worse. When Iâ€™m off depression anxiety hits me and it takes back depression.
