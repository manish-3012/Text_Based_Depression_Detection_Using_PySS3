I donâ€™t want to be hereMy life feels hopeless and I donâ€™t want to keep going. My family has fallen apart. We all hate each other. My biological father molested me when I was a toddler. I donâ€™t speak to him. My mother doesnâ€™t give a shit about how I feel. I tell her I feel disrespected or like she doesnâ€™t listen to what I say and she tells me I can just move out if Iâ€™m not happy here. My relationship with her is shit and all I really want to do is fix it.. I just want a mom who actually fucking cares and she doesnâ€™t. I tell her something is wrong, and she doesnâ€™t acknowledge the problem. I canâ€™t get a job to actually move out. I canâ€™t finish school. I just donâ€™t want to keep living if itâ€™s going to be this shitty. I didnâ€™t ask for this. I donâ€™t want this. Iâ€™m miserable. I could never push myself to actually do anything which just makes it feel worse. Iâ€™m in an endless loop of wanting to die but never being brave enough to actually do it.
