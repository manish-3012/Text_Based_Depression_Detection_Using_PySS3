I'm so disappointed in myselfApril was a really dark time, I was gonna hang myself on the 10th and I don't know how, but by some miracle I didn't do it and the urge to die was like never before. I was optimistic, I thought maybe there's a chance for me but now here I am feeling worse. To make it as short as possible, I'm just a terrible person, I hurt everyone in some way. My whole 25 years on this earth I had meet vert interesting people who should of been in my life but I lost everyone. Also I hate the fact that I'm a under achiever, I should of been way up the food chain by now but depression always gets in the way, I have a lightbulb blinking but don't go all the way with my ideas. Now I'm trying to become nocturnal and only be up at night and not during the day, I'm starting to talk less, I'm hungry but I just can't eat and I'm tired of talking to God. Today of all days I passed by my elementary school and today the kids graduated (I grad from there back in '04) and I couldn't help but think as I heard cheering while on my way home to a quiet room and bottle of whiskey; is that I was once there and I wouldn't have thought I'd be suicidal and lonely 15 years later to the day as my mom was happy for me. I literally feel like I can break a bottle and just violently carve my veins. I already told myself I was gonna kill myself on Dec 31 so I have nothing to lose but I'm hurting till then becauss I feel ike I'm entering the next level of depression and I feel more soulless that it doesn't feel like life anymore. I don't like to talk about this but I had too much in my mind today I couldn't keep it to myself. It was too much but I deserved every bit of it.
