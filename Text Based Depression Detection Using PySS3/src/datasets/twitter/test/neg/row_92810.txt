Dealing with life for over 25yearsI've hated living for over 25 years. I won't kill myself a coward I know. But that voice inside keeps talking begging for it to end. The constant worrying and anxiety is too much. My mind wants to shut down. I wish I was robbed at gun point or walk in a bad neighborhood and get shot.
