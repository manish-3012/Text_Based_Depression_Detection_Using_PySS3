I think I'm finally gonna do it.I dont think anyone's gonna see this but I just feel like I need to lift this off my chest and tell someone. 

This is gonna be my 5th try in the last 3 months. I'm using a different method than all the other times... I'm hoping I can actually be successful this time. These thoughts came out of no where. All last week I was super energetic and wasn't really sad. A few hours ago all the suicidal thoughts hit me super hard out of no where. I'm pretty young but I really dont see the point in living. I dont want to to grow older. I disappoint my family all the time. All my friends can replace me super easily. I'm a burden on everyone. I have no  realistic dreams at all. I'm just wasting space on earth. I wish I could live a long and happy life but how? How can anyone be happy? I dont get it....
I've realized that every time I'm about to go through with it I just get numb. Its great...  like everything's just gone. Like I'll never have to worry about anything ever again. But then it NEVER FUCKING WORKS. I hate that the government makes it so hard to die. Wtf. What's the point of keeping suicidal people alive.


Anyways, I think I'm finally going.







Mom.... if you're reading this, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Im gone. I've realized that in the past few months I've become a total stranger to you. I can tell you dont even recognize me anymore. Im sorry that you had to waste money on me. And that you had to see me like this. Im sorry. Im really sorry. It's not your fault. You did everything you could. My mind's just fucked up. Keep living. Dont forget you have 2 other people to raise and take care of (: Dont let this bring you down.
