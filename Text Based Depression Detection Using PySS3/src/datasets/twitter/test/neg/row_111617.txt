Iâ€™m 15, friendless, narcissistic family. No one loves me. No personality, not even a person. Never been happy. Iâ€™ll end it next Thursday.A father who controls me, whoâ€™s only ever humiliated me. He doesnâ€™t love me, he only loves the idea of me, a perfect kid with no character, not me. My mother never listened. My big brother never listened, laughed in my face when I cried. My judgmental middle brotherâ€™s only ever humiliated me, made me terrified just to be around him. He doesnâ€™t love me, he only loves the idea of me, a silent young brother with no feelings to listen to him talk. He and my father made me friendless, they ruined me. I had to teach myself who to be around my abusers in fear I would be hurt, I shut myself out, I stopped talking.


Iâ€™m friendless, I have no personality, I donâ€™t know how to talk, Iâ€™m afraid, Iâ€™m stupid. Iâ€™m sick and tired of crying, of the neverending insecurity that its my fault and Iâ€™m just weak, of being depressed and in pain, of not even caring. I cut myself, I hate myself. Itâ€™s even worse now because the past years I had feelings, I cried, I was in pain, I cared SO MUCH, instead now itâ€™s just an uncaring feeling. 

Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself many times before, i failed. But this time I know what to do, this time Iâ€™ll be gone. No more pain, no more insecurity, no more depression.
