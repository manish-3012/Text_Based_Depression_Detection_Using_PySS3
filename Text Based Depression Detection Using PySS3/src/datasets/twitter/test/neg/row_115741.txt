Nobody actually fucking caresIm talking about in my life that nobody actually cares. Classmates will still treat u like shit and make fun of u. Teachers dont give a fuck if you're depressed. My parents dont care either. My one friend barely texts back. No one cares and I dont expect them too but it would be nice if people could understand just be nice and not talk shit about someone who's thinking of killing themself.
