I want to dieIâ€™m 12 Years Old, and I live in NZ. I want to die. I just canâ€™t handle the pain inside me anymore, but the only reason Iâ€™m still alive is because Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m not scared of shooting myself in the head, but Iâ€™m scared of the people around me. My friends, family and other people.

The only thing Iâ€™m good at is typing. I get around 110 WPM, but I donâ€™t think that can help me with anything. I have bad grades, and my mom says itâ€™s ok, but for me it isnâ€™t. I'm so tired of the suicide jokes that my friends tell me. I pretend that theyâ€™re funny, but they arenâ€™t. Iâ€™m scared of my friends leaving me because I took it serious. 

And when I go play online, people call me a bad player, and that I should die. And I canâ€™t hold onto this pain anymore.

Please, someone help me.
