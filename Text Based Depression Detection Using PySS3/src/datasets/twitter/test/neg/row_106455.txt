An update from me...Tomorrow I am being admitted to a mental health facility. I have no insurance and I'm not worried. I've been thinking a LOT about suicide since my fiancÃ© killed himself last Sunday. I can't take another night tossing pills down my throat. I will rest, talk, and maybe even eat. I'm very sick physically as well. I have fibromyalgia and RA. 

WHAT IM SAYING IS: If I can do it you can. Please don't throw it all away. You don't realize who's suffering after you're gone. Read my other posts. Try to understand... Somebody loves you enough to think about dying after you do. 

I love you. You are my brother/sister on this planet. Hold on. One minute at a time. Don't leave us. Keep fighting for those YOU love. They NEED YOU. Say a prayer or send some love my way. My son &amp; I need it. Say a prayer for my love, James. Pray he finds his way now.  And as for you, HOLD ON. 

XOXO
