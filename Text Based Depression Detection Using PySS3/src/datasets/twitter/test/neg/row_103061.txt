I Asked My Mom If I Could Be Diagnosed For Autism and She Refused Because, â€œIâ€™ll use it to make excuses.â€ She Also Wonâ€™t Let the Doctors Diagnose Me Pills, and I Have No Motivation To Do ANYTHING Anymore.There is a gun in the closet near me. I can shoot myself at anytime, but I canâ€™t take pills. I hate my family so much. Iâ€™m ready to end it. They donâ€™t care. They just act like it.
