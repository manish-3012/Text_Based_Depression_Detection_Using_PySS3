I just found out a paper I submitted didn't send a month later.On February 4th I went on turnitin.com and submitted my paper. It said "sending..." It kept it on another tab while I was doing other stuff. Five hours later I check and it says "sent." During class the teacher says that some people had trouble sending their paper so they printed out a copy to give to her. Since the website said sent I thought that I didn't have this problem. One month later we have another assignment to send and I find out that my paper wasn't graded because it didn't send? I can't send it again and I have no proof that I did. I have no idea what to do, everything always goes wrong in the worst possible way.
