I'm back.Hi. I'm back. I'm back in the dark place again. And to be quite honest, I'm not sure how I got here. Part of me welcome it because I really never quite knew how to be entirely happy. I'm sitting in a public library right now, thinking about the ways I hate my life. 


I've gotten close to ending it before. There was always something to stop me though-- a cute boy's smile, my dog's cold nose against my hand, even just One Good Day. I would have my plan, and then one thing would derail it. I would remember what it was like to hope for better things. For awhile, 20 mg of Lexapro have made the good days more plentiful and the bad days rare. But even Lexapro has failed me now. 

I don't have my dog anymore. No one smiles at me. My family hates me. I'm a washed up failure at a shitty college, still living in my mom's house in my shitty hometown full of the same shitty people. And there's nothing I can do about it. I'm trying so hard. That's why I'm here, that's why I called a friend and begged her to meet me for coffee. That's why I'm sitting in a public library right now and not in my house-- I don't trust myself and I'm afraid. My mind is falling apart and I don't know what to do about it. 

I've seen it get better before. I just don't know how many times I can handle it. How many chances can I get?
