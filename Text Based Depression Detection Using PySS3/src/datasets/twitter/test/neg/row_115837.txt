I can't do it anymore and this year made me revaluate my existenceI don't even know where to start because it's all pressing too hard. 

I haven't seen my family in a year and a half, I'm getting a degree I can't pull myself together to care about anymore, I've lost friends and now I'm just at home 24/7.

By myself.

And nobody seems to care. 

This year i had a lot of time to sit down and think. 
I found answers for questions that bugged me my whole life. I'm not for people. I am who I am and I'm an unlikeable emotional slob of a person so I'm incapable of even having one good friend. Nobody is capable to love me, platonically or otherwise. The only person who was there for me died a month ago.

The tipping point was today. I realised that I don't even have a single soul to celebrate new years with. It was and is the only day that is so, so special to me and now I've realised I'm rotting while still alive. 

I don't want this anymore. I literally am about to go eat some pills because my mind broke me today. I feel like I'm underwater and under a pile of bricks and now I've stopped trying to resurface.
