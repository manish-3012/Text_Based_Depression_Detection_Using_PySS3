i made some plans for killing myself last night, and iâ€™m kinda concerned for some reasonIâ€™ve been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts since i entered 7th grade (iâ€™m a senior in HS now), and its only gotten worse because i feel like iâ€™m in a position (even now) where i cant do anything. it got to where iâ€™m at now; making plans for killing myself because of how grey and terrible the world is now, and for some reason, a tiny piece of me is making me talk to my school counselor. idk why i am worried anymore, i already accepted that my life is going downhill.
