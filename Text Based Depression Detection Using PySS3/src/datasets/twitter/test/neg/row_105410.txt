Does anybody feel like talking to me? Maybe exchange stories.Alot of people might be happy to finally have weekend. Not me though, suicidal thoughts don't have weekend. Weekends take forever, nothing to do and being all alone. Without anything to distract me 3 days take forever. I figured talking to people might help. Does anybody feel like chatting/talking? (pm's or skype or smth) send me a pm and I'll send you contact info.
