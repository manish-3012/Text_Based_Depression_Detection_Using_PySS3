Itâ€™s just not worth it anymoreIâ€™m just in pain all the time. Nothing ever gets better, if it does itâ€™s only for a second and then it gets exponentially worse. I have nothing to look forward to anymore. Itâ€™s taking everything in my power rn to not listen to the thoughts in my head telling me to use the gun from the next room over. The only thing Iâ€™m scared of is surviving. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I donâ€™t think it will ever get better.
