Admitting I'm suicidal, 30sFI cry everyday. I'm gaining back all the weight I lost. Behind at work and school. Drifting away from friends and bf. Tried every ssri/snri. So much therapy. Still miserable, unmotivated, just want to stay in bed. 

I used to love life! I've had depression for over 20 years, on and off every year.  This isn't angst, its seeing what I amount to, failing lots, and not feeling like any of this is worth it. It's getting worse. I never used to think about suicide so much. But this past year, it's just been all depression. 

I'm a gun owner. Its. Right. There. 

I've seen my friends lose others to suicide. That's the reason I haven't. What a shitty mess to leave behind. 

I comb the internet for reasons to live. Or just distraction. But I'm not finding much to hope for. 

I dont talk to my friends or boyfriend about being suicidal because I dont want to drag people into it and make them feel bad. They know I'm depressed. No one knows how bad. 

I feel like I peaked a few years ago and everything is just getting worse.
