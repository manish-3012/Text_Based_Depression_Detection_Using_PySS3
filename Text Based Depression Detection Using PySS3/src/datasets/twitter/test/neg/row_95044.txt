I don't want to to die, I know it's temporary...but how goddamn temporary?!Ive been thinking of happy days. My wedding day. Old days in school with by life-long best friends. Fun times with those same friends, together, the four of us. 

My happy trips overseas with my sister.

My happy days just working with the cattle with my dad.

Most of its gone now. I'm going to wake up tomorrow to a fourth week in a row with only two days off (I had to beg for one of them.)

I miss all my buddies from college and my old job. I'm not even asking for a solution; there is none, except to wait out until it gets better.

Sorry. Rough month.
