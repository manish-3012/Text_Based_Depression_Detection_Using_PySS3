ByeMy sob story: Iâ€™m in my 20s, born into poverty, still in poverty, I had a sexually/physically/emotionally abusive childhood, the abusers were everybody in my immediate and extended family, 


I barely scraped by with graduating high school, I flunked out of college and lost my financial aid after my first year, Iâ€™ve never had friends in my life until recently, I thought of talking to them but I just feel like I take too much from people, so I feel guilty. I donâ€™t deserve their help. Iâ€™m depressed all the time, itâ€™s bot their problem. I wonâ€™t bother them.


Iâ€™ve never had a relationship or even been on a date before in my life, because Iâ€™m too messed up from trauma. I have severe PTSD. I think Iâ€™m probably also either autistic, or Iâ€™m just so disconnected and dissociated from myself, and everybody else, and being so isolated my entire life that I never got the chance to learn how humans work, so Iâ€™m fundamentally different from everybody else.


I also have a chronic illness that causes me to be in physical pain constantly, ranging from being moderately distracting at best to being debilitating.


Iâ€™ve had more than 10 jobs since I was 16, I just canâ€™t hold anything down. Canâ€™t do anything right or up to anybodyâ€™s standards, even the simplest things. I tried therapy but it didnâ€™t work. I tried a lot of things.

I feel like Iâ€™ve never been loved and I never will be loved. I never CAN be loved. Iâ€™m nothing. Thereâ€™s nothing for me
