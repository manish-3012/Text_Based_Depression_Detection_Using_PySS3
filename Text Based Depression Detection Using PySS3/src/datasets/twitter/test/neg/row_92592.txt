Why should I stick around?I turned 18 this month. I should be ready to be an adult, yet Iâ€™m grouchy, jealous, and childish. I canâ€™t accept responsibility and I get incredibly frustrated at my lack of abilities. I go, or rather graduated from, a top school in my country and have received a spot at a prestigious college but it all seems so meaningless in the end. Aside from the one thing Iâ€™m majoring in, I have zero talents. Iâ€™m fat, Iâ€™m pretty ugly, and my body in general is incredibly average (short legs, long torso, 5â€™7) 

What Iâ€™m majoring in is an incredibly difficult field to be in and itâ€™s part of a collection of several other fields that are easier, so I was often mocked in secondary school for my slower pace. Couple with this a lack of effort in my other classes, and I developed a strong inferiority complex. When I left secondary school, I was so caught up in what Iâ€™m majoring in that I immediately jumped to the top of the chain, besting every students that would graduate the year I joined except one. My other grades also rose as well. However, my years at my secondary school left me bitter and spiteful. Iâ€™m still only talented at that one thing. The only other thing I remotely care about are video games. In this specific scenario, Iâ€™ve been playing a video game almost all my life and got fairly good at it. My friends picked up the latest entry last year and I was happy to be better than them, as childish as it sounds, due to the fact that it rarely happens. However, in the span of less than a year, theyâ€™re just as good if not better than me. I quit playing the game about four months ago because of the fact whenever I lose, I feel an intense self deprecation and immediate drop in self esteem. Any loss to me at something I kind of care about is absolutely lethal to my way of life and can disrupt my flow for several days if not weeks. So, I just quit playing. However, when we all hang out, and they force me to play, I feel upset and everything at the hangout gets awkward due to me obviously feeling flustered and upset at myself and the others for beating me. About a month ago I looked up what I should do about these feelings, and all I got were questions basically mocking me. â€œDo you expect everything to be handed to you on a silver platter,â€ â€œgit gud,â€ â€œyou should just quitâ€ etc. The likes of those. But the one that really stuck out to me was the first one I read, the silver platter one. On the thread I was reading, the person asking responded to it saying that that would be an ideal scenario. The person who said the silver platter thing then responded, saying that itâ€™s not how the world works. That, coupled with intrusive thoughts making me feel like a fucking monster, made me think about something. 

Yeah, thatâ€™s not how the world works. But fuck the world. Who cares? I hate having to work, and Iâ€™d like everything to be handed to me. Iâ€™m wholly average, not special and just another person brought into an already dying world who doesnâ€™t want to fucking be here. 

This entire ordeal has had me absolutely loathe any concept or idea of me being inferior (which doesnâ€™t really make sense since Iâ€™m posting this here, but I guess Iâ€™m screaming into the void.) For example, letâ€™s say somebody on this thread responds with â€œyou should respect yourself more.â€ Who the fuck are you to tell me how I should treat myself? Fuck you, you prick. Or, if somebody tries to offer me advice that worked for them, like â€œyou should do what I do,â€ it comes off to me as somebody saying theyâ€™re better than me, which again I typically respond very angrily towards. Hell, Iâ€™m gay and pride month just makes me hate myself anymore. Why should I be prideful? Because Iâ€™m an unnatural person with an attraction the majority of the world doesnâ€™t accept? Yeah, Iâ€™m really prideful about that. 

Intrusive thoughts, inferiority complex, jealousy, ugliness, being overweight, being mostly untalented, intense anger, (possible) depression, (maybe) ADHD (maybe due to the fact that itâ€™s undiagnosed so I donâ€™t want to claim anything, but both my mom and brother were diagnosed with it.) All of this stacked on top of another creates a person that I think is too far gone to be helped. Iâ€™ll be like this the rest of my life, I already know it. With the kind of intense competition my field has anyways and the fact Iâ€™ll most likely fail a lot of my auditions because of said competition, Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll grow to hate the one other thing in the world Iâ€™m good at too, meaning my life will finally be entirely meaningless. So I guess the point of this thread is just to ask; why should I stick around? Why shouldnâ€™t I take my life? I already hate the constant effort I have to put in 24/7, and I admitted that Iâ€™d prefer if the world handed me everything I wanted and I didnâ€™t have to work, and that obviously will never happen, and my mental state has deteriorated to the point of being unfixable, so why shouldnâ€™t I end it all? Literally one valid reason that I actually think is helpful. Thatâ€™s all I want.
