Giving myself 4 to 5 monthsI can deal with setbacks. If this was done years ago, preferably in 2016, I think I could be able to pick myself up.

But there's so much more at stake. I have a lot of responsibilities on me that I didn't back then, and I have failed them all. I can't see life improving after this, and it will all be downhill from here.

**How do I move on from this?** I have no job experience other than tutoring. I don't have any networking connections and no family friends. Out of shame, I only reached out to my high school biology teacher. **Where do I go on from here?**

My only reservation is that if I am gone, I'll be essentially committing a murder-suicide, because I know someone will follow me. But that individual might probably do it on her own volition when she hears that I have failed her.

Life is so agonizingly slow. It makes me want to leave earlier, preferably in January, but there needs to be work to be done:

* Submitting my family and my taxes to avoid the IRS confiscating assets after my death
* Fixing the mortgage situation
* Making sure payments to SEO freelancer goes through (you can read about this from a post I made earlier)
* Completing my holographic will
* Getting the next covid19 stimulus check to cash it in for my family

I can't stay here. It's dysfunctional for the both of us. The alternative, I think, is finding a job out of this state that pays $40/50k annually, and then figure out what the fuck to do from there. Maybe MBA. I don't know. But I have no connections, I have no friends, I don't even have my dignity and pride.

I already have the mechanism, the materials, and the date. Out of sensitivity I plan on leaving out details, but knowing physiology I have set it up for it to be foolproof.
