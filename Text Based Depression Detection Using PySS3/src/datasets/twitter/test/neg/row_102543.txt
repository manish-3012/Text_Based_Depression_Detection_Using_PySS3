A ridiculous story about our virginity.This is a very weird and unbelievable story, but that's because it will lack context in a way.  
And that's because I have to censor a certain important detail of this story. My story is actually longer than this, so it's shortened.  
  
I've... always dreamt of having a relationship and having sex. I dreamt of having sex every day and night.  
At age 10, I already had weird fantasies and such. I was always attracted to fictional characters and dreamt of them a lot.  
So at age 15, almost 16, when it was Valentinesday I got a partner. I was happy, but I had to really focus on her in my life. She... needed me, in a way. I was so busy it was so hard to love her, but I did my best.  
To this day, I'd still take a bullet for her. She's so important that I choose to suffer with her. Remember that, because that'll be relevant later. Also, I'll explain what it means first.  
When she can't go to a restaurant with me, I just won't go.  
When I step on her feet accidentally, I step on mine.  
When it's raining and I know she's outside not protected from the rain, I won't protect my self from the rain either.  
It's... just things like that.  
So, we didn't have sex until later in our relationship because I just wasted for the right moment. When we're both fully sexually mature, so when we're fully grown. It was only limited to me fingering her, giving her oral and me receiving oral.  
It's fun, but it did miss something... I didn't think much of it, we'll have PiV sex some day. We both weren't really ready for it as it's a bit too intense for the both of us.  
Doesn't matter, we'll just have other sexual contact in the mean time. Yes, I was super optimistic about it.  
I was 100% sure that it would happen some day. And honestly, I'm more of a pessimist always.  
I expect the worst, but I put all my optimism in this because I was excited for it.  
Life went fine in a way. I had minor depressions and sometimes small mental breakdowns and such.  
Sometimes I tried having sex with her, but it just couldn't work. That's when the bad evening hit...  
I was **extremely** envious of others and I was seriously pissed. Life was sometimes hard for me in a way, and I've had a bit of a trauma in the past.  
And I think this was the last straw in a way.  
I became very depressed that evening, but I still had a lot of optimism. I've asked for advice and tried it.  
That evening, she was really into it. I... failed like usual.  
The problem is, my dick is too big for her. Or rather, I hate to say it because it seems like I'm blaming her body, but her vagina just happens to be really small.  
I don't even have a big sized dick, I think. Not that I ever wanted a big dick anyways, for me that always seemed like an useless achievement.  
That night, she really didn't like the fact that I couldn't do it. I felt ashamed and felt sad for the both of us.  
She was really pushy for me to try it again, but I just wanted to sleep.  
Slowly my optimism drained quickly during these months. I don't know the name of my depression, but apparently it worsens over time and we both feel it.  
I also became more envious. Everytime I failed, I just had some kind of mental breakdown. I was crying so much.  
During these months I also got more and more information because I've asked others. They were all nice and trying to be helpful, but their behavior towards me changed. They started insulting me because of how absolutely ridiculous this was.  
They were mad at me, and they have emotionally hurt me so much. I have never felt so bad in my life.  
I swear, I am still filled with hatred what they said. I depended on a guy because he tried to ''help'' me like he said, but at the end of every message he said: ''Well, I got to go now, there's an angel waiting in my bedroom.''  
This his way of saying: ''I have what you don't, hahaha.'' I begged for him to stop, but I depended on him so I still tried to listen, yet he kept doing it until I blocked him.  
Nobody had hurt me so much in my life. Not even my mother, who is absolutely horrible to everyone in the house.  
Really, it's worse than you think it is. Everyday I think of him. I have never been so hurt by anything.  
I would prefer to be stabbed or even raped. I genuinely felt suicidal because of him.  
I can't take it, why do all the bad humans get the good things? I've never done anything wrong.  
Trough all these months I have been trying EVERYTHING I could. Yet a whole group told me I don't even deserve it.  
I am so fucking envious of him. I'd do **everything** (but hurt my girl) to be in his situation...  
There's also one thing I have to live with. My girl will die of a disease she has in a few years.  
That means I will live longer than her. Even if they admitted it was gross of them to say, they told me to wait to have sex for my next partner.  
But that's not even my goal. It's my goal to have sex with her, not anyone else. Even if you gave me the hottest partner, I would decline. Not even for infinite money.  
I am envious of every couple I see as I know 100% they can have sex. I get pissed by every time sex gets mentioned. I get more depressed every day.  
This is important, I also do this for her. This isn't just lust, I want her to experience it too. That's why I will never have sex with anyone else.  
Remember this whole ''I suffer with her'' thing? If she dies a virgin, I will too. That said, when she dies... I'll end myself.  
Every other couple can do this together, yet we can't. That alone may have just triggered this whole thing.  
Sex is special, it's something you just don't miss in your life time. And think about it, dying a virgin is probably one of the worst things to ever happen.  
You'll miss out on something that many couples do together for fun so much. We only have one life and missing this is just so sad.  
Nobody deserves this fate, absolutely no one.  
I really do not see her as a sex object, I love every part of her. Her personality, her body, her movements, her everything. It's just that I'm hit with these curses.  
First, we can't have sex together. Second, for some reason sex is important to us, especially to me the most.  
My depression is really serious. I have become aggressive and don't enjoy anything anymore. Absolutely *nothing.*  
If you're still confused why it's so important. Sometimes, you just think something is important.  
There's a lot of humans who will tell you this when your animal dies: ''It's just an animal, get a new one.'' It's kind of like this.  
We all value different things. And let me remind you, it's done against our will.  
I... honestly don't want to leave my girl alone in this world. But if I found a gun, the urge to end myself immediately would be great.  
I really care for her, but my life feels so shit and unlucky that I can't take it anymore. I've always been paranoid and fearful, so I don't dare to kill myself in another way.  
I just wish we could both have our moment just once. If we had it just once, I'll be grateful forever. That is all I want.  
Surgery won't work because she doesn't want to be changed as she's afraid of it, and I myself have no idea how to even have such a surgery happen to myself.  
...And one thing, I can't tell anyone about this. About everything I just said, I mean.  
She isn't mentally ill as proven by the doctors here, yet it's still in the files because there was a mistake. It had something to do with her disease that'll kill her in a few years. According to a very strict law in where I live, I am not allowed to have sex with her nor be in a relationship with her.  
  
I... am just sick of life. I just want us to have our happy little moment, that's all.  
My goal is so fucking simple yet I don't get it even though I spent so much energy, optimism and time into it. Yet everyone else does it effortlessly.  
I am no longer optimistic and I hate absolutely every human. I don't really want to live any more.  
I just... I just wanted that one minute of easy happiness together... That is all.  
Just because all of this, I have a worsening depression ruining both of our lives. It affects my whole mind.  
It feels like it affects my intelligence, I lose the ability to read sometimes, even. I go crazy from time to time...  
I am suicidal because of our lack of quality in our lives.  
  
Please, let me make something sure again. I'm not a selfish fuck who's just horny.  
That said, this also affected my libido. I lost the interest in sex for a while completely.  
I don't even try having sex with her any more. We're beating a dead horse.  
I care about her in a non-sexual way, it's just unfortunate for me that it holds so much value to me.  
And if we ever had sex, I wouldn't even care if I never had sex again. I just want the experience with her *once* and that's it.  
I want us both to experience it. She needs to enjoy it and I will.  
But no... just like everything in life, luck fucks me over. Sounds edgy and kind of makes you cringe, but if luck was a human... I'd do everything to torture this piece of shit.  
We don't deserve this. I was happy and optimistic once. *Once.*
