My heart is still brokenIn March a guy that I was talking to online broke my heart and Iâ€™m still not over it. He was the first person who ever understood me, and accepted me, and yet he ghosted me after 4 months of talking. 
I mourned for a bit and tried to get over it because itâ€™s just an online relationship, right? Heâ€™s not worth my time, right? And yet months later Iâ€™m not over it. This guy broke me down to my core, told me he wouldnâ€™t leave, and then just abandoned me. 
I feel so pathetic. Iâ€™ve tried to move on with real life dates and everything but Iâ€™m still broken. I feel fine and then he comes to mind and I feel like shit. I have no way to track him down, no way to find him. Heâ€™s gone without any explanation. Itâ€™s eating me up inside. 
Iâ€™m not that young..Iâ€™ve been in many serious relationships longer than we were talking, yet he has stuck in my mind more than any of them. He was my last hope of feeling accepted. Iâ€™ve already been on the brink of suicide many times since - of course heâ€™s not the only reason (I have a chronic mental illness and anxiety with a past of being abused), but if heâ€™d just have messaged me some explanation, gave me closure, maybe I wouldnâ€™t be wasting my time feeling crushed that heâ€™s gone.
