First ever Reddit postI just made a Reddit account 60 seconds ago because I needed to type this.  I'm not even really a huge Redditor, I lurk sometimes but never felt compelled to post anything before until now.  

I have no clue how I let myself get to this place.  I really and truly am a complete fuck-up.  My mental health is at an all time low and it's continuing to spiral out of control.  I don't even know where to start.  If I wasn't a complete and total loser who still lived with his parents at age 26, I would seriously consider writing a note and killing myself.  I actually feel like I'm too low right now to kill myself because I don't want peoples' last memories of me to be what they are right now.  If I can sort of dig myself out of this disgusting shithole that is my current circumstance, I'd be more inclined to just leave this planet for good.  I'm completely alone and I've been reading r/suicidebereavement for about a year now because trying to imagine the permanent damage it would do to my loved ones is the only thing keeping me alive.  But I don't know how much longer that will even seem attractive to me.  I genuinely think I am fully resigned to the fact that my life is going to end by my own doing.
