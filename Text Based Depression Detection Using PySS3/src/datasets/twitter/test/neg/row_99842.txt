I jumped off my balcony but I'm still alive.I didn't even break anything and as far as I know I'm probably not internally injured, since it's been a day and I haven't suddenly died, but it hurt like a motherfucking bitch, and I had to go to work in a lot of pain. I honestly just hate being alive more now.
