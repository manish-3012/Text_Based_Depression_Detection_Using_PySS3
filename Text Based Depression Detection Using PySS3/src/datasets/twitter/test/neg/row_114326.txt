Suicidal ideationLong story short I found out I might have a medical condition and when I learned it can be deadly my first thought wasn't "oh no", it was "oh good, maybe this will kill me", coupled with a feeling of relief.

I'm not nearly as concerned about the medical condition as I am about my mental health. I haven't had this level of suicidal ideation in a long time.

At least if I died from a physical illness my family wouldn't have to deal with the emotional pain of a suicide.
