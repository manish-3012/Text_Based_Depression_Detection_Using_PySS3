yay being alone and wantz to dieWhy did nobody clue me in a as a child, that being scoially withdrawn would lead people to avoid me, and think negative things about me? Had I know that forming conncetions wasn't just a fun option in my free time, but an actual requirement for survival, then I would have invested in those suckers as if they were stocks.       

Now I am completely isolated, socially detatched, alone, and whatever other word there is for a community reject, who could die without anybody noticing, or even being remotely interested.    

All of my friends were made by conicidence, or because people felt bad for me. They were all short friendships, and very confusing to me, cause guess what, I can't read social cues.     

Not only did I get myself into relationships that were nothing but wrecks, I also ended up hurting the few people who actually wanted to spend time with me. Because I'm also a fucking weirdo. No, really. The kind of weirdo that people should avoid, I would have avoided myself if it had been an option.   

I've been doomed since birth, with the shitty marriage of my parents giving me nothing but trauma and mental health issues. Not exactly the best additions to a socially awkwards transgender possibly autistic teenager. I wonder how many people thought I was going to become a serial killer, or an abuser. Either way, they were wrong, I simply became a handicapped hermit, who wants nothing more than to throw away all of his memories, and live as a toaster, since then I would be useful at least, and physically capable of more things than I am now.      

I now have also a phobia of smiles, because I swear to god, I get one more trigger each time I hear someone bare their teeth anywhere near me, and I am sure that I will never get to hear a genuine laughter, from any person that actually enjoys my company.    

I will never have genuine conncetions, noone will ever take me seriously, and I wish my mother had aborted me.
