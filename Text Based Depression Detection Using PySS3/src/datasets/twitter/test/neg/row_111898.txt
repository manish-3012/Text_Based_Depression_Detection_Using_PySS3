I'm giving myself 4 more years to liveNothing has been going well in my life. My childhood has been crap, adulthood as well. I guess the only thing which makes me happy right now is coming home to my cats everyday. I'm still trying to cope, but it sucks sitting on my bedside every night, unable to sleep with this itch in my mind. I envy those who can wake up everyday and go to work, acting like nothing's wrong with the entire broken system. Beginning to rely on drugs and alcohol to numb things out. Planned an exit method as well. It's supposedly painless? Either way, if nothing improves in the next 4 years, I think I'll man up and just do it. Suicide takes tremendous courage, and I've been too chicken to do it thus far, so we'll see.
