Finally coming to terms with it..I don't want to drag on and make this a long post. I have been thinking very seriously about suicide lately, and looking into the best methods and everything. I have come up with how I will do it, and when. It sounds silly, but my boyfriend and I broke up and he changed his number. There is zero contact. I can't take it anymore. My friends don't make time for me anymore. Even my family is leaving me out of many things. I don't know why Im posting, maybe to make myself feel better. I used to want to get help and see a psychologist. I don't want to anymore. I'm at peace with my decision.
