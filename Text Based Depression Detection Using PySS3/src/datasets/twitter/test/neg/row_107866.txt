failed overdose attempt and new diagnosis of EUPDIt has been just over a week since I was admitted to hospital after taking a staggered overdose after feeling i was unable to cope with the heartbreak of being dumped by someone i imagined spending my life with. I damaged!y liver and there was a discussion between doctors around me needing a liver transplant. It then unfortunately recovered and I was assessed by a psychiatrist and given the diagnosis of emotionally unstable personality disorder.I feel the diagnosis is a little too late, if I knew this, I would have not been so unstable and pushed the love of my life away. I have a big family, lots of lovely friends, a god, well paid job where I could excel in my career if I wanted to, yet I can't see me making the end of next month. I have never been so broken and unhappy.does anyone have any tips or strategies for getting through this? As I feel I am going to hang myself or jump off a bridge next,something that will hopefully work this time. No one seems to understand.
