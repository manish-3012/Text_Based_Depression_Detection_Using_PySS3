Finally had the push I neededPosted a couple of hours ago about being trans and some HRT questions, since I've been doing DIY for a while and would like to take the legal route. In the heat of the moment I mentioned some suicidal feelings I've been having. Someone traced me back to social media and said a lot of really hurtful things, but I can't disagree with any of them. It made me realize how worthless and broken I am. What I wanted to fix, just being stuck in the wrong body, is this horrible thing to everyone else. Even if I were to get through all of that the waiting would've broken me to pieces first, or I would turn out ugly and end my life anyway.

There's not much to say about me, but what there is to say is everything this person belittled me with. None of it was wrong. I'm not worth anyone's time.

If family or friends read this, I'm sorry for the mess this final decision has caused. It was the quickest way I could do it.
