Need help with depressed gfCurrently my college girlfriend, although I can't say is depressed all the time, she does have episodes every now and then where she would feel "too tired of living". She has attempted suicide before but currently I do not think she has taken an active role in it recently. From my knowledge she is usaully gets down about things like her future about whether or not she can be sucessful, realizing that she can not go to her dream school due to financial reasons, and overal her view about her looks and value in society. She is very against seeing a professional because of both the cost and the stigma that going to one will instantly make you the "odd" one a group whether people know it or not. I do realize I am asking a lot from you redditors however I grow more concerned everyday and fear the worse. If there is anything you may know from methods that helped you or others through depression or maybe even professional in the Boston area that could give her a free trail session just so she could see how useful it can be, I would apprieciate it.
