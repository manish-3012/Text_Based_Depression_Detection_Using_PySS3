Used And Dropped Without ExplanationMy best friend (and one of my few friends) ghosted me and then blocked my phone number. We used to hook up, and he has a new girlfriend. I suspect that has a lot do with it.

To go into more detail, I met him when I was joining the Army National Guard in 2005. He was a recruiter's assistant. (I ended up getting out of the Guard before shipping to Basic Training.) 

In 2008, we started talking again (via MySpace) when he was deployed to Iraq. That was when it turned romantic. We hung out when he had his two weeks leave during his deployment.

That continued for a while after he got back from Iraq in 2009. After that, we were just friends.

Until 2016, when he turned everything sexual. I found out later that he was married. After he got divorced, it started again. It stopped again this summer, but we were still friends.

Last week, he told me he had a girlfriend. Then he ghosted me. I admit I did keep texting and calling -- mostly about other stuff (I was trying to be friendly) -- and he ignored it. I called one time too many and tonight he blocked me -- it goes straight to voicemail. 

I really just wanted an explanation from him. I thought we were friends. Now it just seems to me that I was used for an affair, used on the rebound, and then ghosted &amp; blocked without explanation. I think ghosting is cowardly.

I've always been kind of depressed, but this is pushing me too far into the darkness. Is there any way out?
