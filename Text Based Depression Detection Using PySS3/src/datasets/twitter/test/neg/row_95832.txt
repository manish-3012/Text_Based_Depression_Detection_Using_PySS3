Still here. Didnâ€™t go through with it.I didnâ€™t go on my trip I had planned today, but I didnâ€™t go to the hotel I booked either. Iâ€™m still feeling the same, but I finally got out of bed and had something to eat. I still donâ€™t want to be alive, but here I am. Iâ€™m supposed to be moving to be with my momâ€™s side of the family next week. I guess Iâ€™ll see how well I do over there.
