What do you do when you can't stand all this anymore?I can't stand all those conversations with my parents, who try to understand but still don't can and try to say things like "Come out of this" (I'm german, I don't know what english/american parents say). The essence is: Get out of this and lighten your mood.
They don't understand that I'm fighting to get out of bed - Not in the morning, but just overall. Every dream is better than this life and I just cannot take anymore.
I talked to them about suicide thoughts and they took it serious but I don't think they really understand. I don't want to live anymore. Really. I won't do it myself, that's something I swore to myself, but I'm hoping for the typical happenings of this sub; An accident or a terminal illness or something like that.

Fuck all this.
