I know I cannot kill myself butToday, as quite a lot of days, I wish I could kill myself. I'm lucky and I have people who I love, and people who love me. I have a good family, and above all I have a daughter and a son, for whom I cannot really consider to go throw it. I know killing myself is not an option, but this brings me the feeling of live as a burden that reinforce the feeling of not wanted to live. I do feel guilty for having this feelings, but all I can do  is accept.  I don't allways have that feeling: there are moments I can feel at peace with live, but the feeling of not wanting to live allways come back. Today I do feel very tired, and I do not want to do anythink, but I will put a smile on my face and carry on with my day and my live, (wich right confined at home) but with a background feeling that everything is false because what I'm doing is just pretending while feeling all I want to really do is to kill myself.
