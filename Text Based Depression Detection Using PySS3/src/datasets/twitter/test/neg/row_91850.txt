I can't go to bed alone again.I just can't. I left my wife a month ago. She was classically emotionally and psychologically abusive, and I know intellectually that it was a good decision. But at night...I don't know. I can't handle it. It doesn't help that she changed her relationship status on facebook to with her girlfriend on Valentine's Day, something that I didn't expect to affect me as strongly as it did. The guy I have a mutual thing for is far away now, and for a very complicated number of reasons we can't be together. So, right now he's with his partners after a long and tearful discussion (they're all happy and hanging out now), my ex wife is screwing her girlfriend and posting about it on face book, my children (2 and 4) blame me for splitting the family apart and keeping crying and telling me they wish they were back at "our house", the vast majority of my friends blame my transitioning for the split up (despite the fact that my wife is dating another trans girl), and here I am, sitting in my grandmother's kitchen and typing this with a kitchen knife in my lap. The thought of going to bed alone, again, and doing it again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next, and the next...fuck. I can't. 

Literally the only reason I'm reaching out here is my kids. I don't want them to wind up with their other mom, but damn, I feel like I'm not much better than her a lot of the time. They're both young enough that they wouldn't miss me (and hell, they've already got a replacement mom). I don't know.
