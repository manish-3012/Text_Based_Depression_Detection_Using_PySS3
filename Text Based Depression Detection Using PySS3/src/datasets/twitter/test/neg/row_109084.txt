Debated about not even putting this upSo I'm thinking about trying suicide tonight. Tuesday seems like a weird night for it, but I'm really in a bad spot and I don't know if I can come back from this.

To make the story short, there's been a lot of things at my work that make me feel really useless. Most that problem is me being awkward and not knowing how to communicate properly, some people influencing me in ways so I don't trust people and then they don't trust me.

I guess the main problem is my sleeping habits. I've tried sleeping for 10 hours and being tired and hard to wake up, to only sleeping 4 hours and waking up really early. 
My job gave me the funding for a sleep study to see if i have any sleeping disorders, and I've tried making appointments. I tried getting it done January 2017, and they only called me at the beginning of the month for an initial session, and I had to reschedule getting the results. I have not received a call back and that would help with some of the stress. 

And then at work, I try to do the best work I can as a mechanic, but always feel like I'm falling short. It helps I'm small, so I can fit into small spaces easy, where other people can't reach. 
But they treat me like I'm useless and a problem most of the time. I can admit, I internalize things too much. I've been trying to let people in, but when I do, I feel like I get stabbed in the back all the time. What's worse, is I try not to let stuff like this show at work, which only makes it worse when it does.

TL;DR: I'm a failure to everyone I know and just want to take a swim with an anchor right now. 

My phone is at 12%, if I can't calm down, I'm going to try it when it dies.

I'm sorry if this stresses you guys out, I'm just so done with it all.
