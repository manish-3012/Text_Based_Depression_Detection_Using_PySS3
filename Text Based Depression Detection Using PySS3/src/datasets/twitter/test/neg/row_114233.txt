i dont know what to doive been suicidal for so long but ive never been able to reason myself into it because i had one thing keeping me from doing it and i was afraid and now thats gone and everything else in my life is going wrong and im so far from home and have no way back until fucking monday and i cant deal with any of this and nothing has any point and theres nothing just stopiing me from slitting my wrists because i cant deal with this and i cant see anything getting better. i dont see any point in staying alive for anything and i dont know whether i want to be talked down or not
