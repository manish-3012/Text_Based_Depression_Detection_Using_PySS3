You know how I knowThat my life is worthless and no longer worth living? 
One, I absolutely loved cooking and baking my entire life. The last year has completely taken that away from me. I don't have the money for a place to live let alone food.
I have no desire to lift a finger to cook anything anymore. I used to feel great preparing my kids delicious and really healthy meals every single day, every single meal. Right now, I don't remember the last time they had something I wouldn't normally consider crap.
All I think about is killing myself. I have completely detached from my children who I used to love so much. Now I look at them and I don't feel anything. I still want what is best for them, but I just don't feel anything. 
Having worked my whole life for everything I had and asking my friend to store it for me until I found a place turned out to be a mistake. He ruined everything in less than a month. Literally everything I owned is now trash you see out at most garage sales. Now, if I ever do find another place I have to start completely over. Shit that took me 15 years to get is going to take another 15 years of my life to build up.
I have not been patient with my kids. Homelessness is destroying who I was. I feel sorry for them but no matter how hard I try I can't treat them right anymore. I want to die for their sake. I don't want to affect their mental health for their entire lives because of this. 
All I want is a place to live. Is working two jobs not enough? When did literally killing yourself working become not good enough to have a home? I guess I'll never be good enough. I can't do this any more. I am literally killing myself trying to get somewhere and am getting no where at all. Everyday seems to just get worse.
I used to want the least painful way to die, but now, want the most painful thing I can possibly put myself through. I apparently deserve this.
