I can't stop thinking about dyingI used to be a really positive person. The job I had ate me alive and made me really, really unhappy. It was unfufiling and psycholigacally damaging to me. So, I quit it a few weeks ago.

But my lease is up in a few months and I live in Seattle. People don't trust me to rent because I don't have a job and people I know are backing out of living with me. Everything's too expensive for me.

I'm starting to wonder what's the point. I moved here to pursue my dream job. I was so close. I temped there but never got hired on full time, but was told to keep trying by the FTE's.

Nobody wants me. At all. I have no skills anyone would want to hire someone for because I don't want to work in a tech field, I picked digital design. The people around me are starting to resent me because of my unhappiness, and I just feel alone. I think about dying all the time now.

I don't feel needed by anyone. I hate myself. I hate that I want this dream job so bad. I hate that I have no redeemable skills. I hate that I've submitted hundreds of resumes since last year and haven't gotten a single interview. I hate that I'm almost 30 and have never had a serious relationship. I hate when I express these concerns all I get are "You'll find a girlfriend someday". "Someone is bound to read your resume someday."

I just hate myself. I hate that I can't do anything. I hate that I left a job just because I was unhappy there. I hate that there's all these people that believe in me for some fucking reason and I see zero reason to believe in myself.

I'm sorry for rambling, or if this is the wrong place for this.
