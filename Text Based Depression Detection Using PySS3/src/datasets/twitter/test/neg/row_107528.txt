Is there a place where..Is there a place kind of like a crisis center for baker acts but for longer term care? A place that would keep you while you wait the 60 days for most meds to fully enter your system or longer if you find out that particular med doesnt work? That also deals with drug addiction for people who self medicate? That can help you by training or educating you so that when your released you have the ability to pay for your meds and basic necessaties so you dont become depressed with your lifes shitty situation? And the best part is i need it for the low, low price of free.
I cant be the only person praying for death every night because ive screwed my life up so badly that without a coordinated effort of a dozen people for 2 to 3 years ill never survive. 
I feel like ive dug a hole so deep ill never be able to crawl my way out of it. I feel like i should go ahead and press reset on this life and start a new game. Maybe next time ill be smart enough to do something with the first half of my life so im not homeless sleeping on a floor with nothing to my name but shame and regret. I dont think its even worth trying anymore because i cant see a future with any happiness or prosperity in it.
