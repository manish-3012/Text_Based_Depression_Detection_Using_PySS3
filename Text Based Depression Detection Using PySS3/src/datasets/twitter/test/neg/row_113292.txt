I'm haunted by horrific imagesWhen I have time to think, my mind defaults to bad things. At work today all I could think about was a very vivid image of the box cutter in my wrist. Slicing all the way up. Other times all I can think of are my ideal suicide. I climb a tree and wait for midnight on my 20th birthday. Tie myself up. Then I swallow all my saved up pills. Then I slit my wrists with as much strength as I can manage. Then with bloody shaky hands, I shoot my head, collapse from the tree and the rope snaps my neck. Absolutely no chance of surviving that. It makes me shake when that image comes to my mind and people probably think I'm weird when I get all shivery. But its really horrible to keep on thinking about but there is nothing good to think about. I sometimes think I'm excited to come home. But then I get home and get sad because there is nothing for me at home, I'm just forever wishing for something positive.
