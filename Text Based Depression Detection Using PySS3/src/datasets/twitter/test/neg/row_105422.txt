I want it to end alreadyMy mind has just been in a downward spiral that seems like it went stop. I'm trembling and can hardly have a coherent thought at times. All I want is for someone to actually love, it feels like loneliness is slowly killing me and my mental state is just withering. I wish I could die, I never asked to be born or have the life I have. At the same time though, I want to keep trying because I want to know what love feels like again. Just one more time at least. My head hurts and I don't know what to do anymore, I just wanna take a nap. bleh
