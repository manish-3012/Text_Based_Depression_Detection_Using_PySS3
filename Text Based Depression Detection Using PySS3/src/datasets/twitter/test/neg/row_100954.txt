(25m) lost and not sure what where to goI'm a long time lurker of reddit. But I feel like now it's the only place I can turn. I'm am cook at nice craft beer bar. It consumes my life and I've let it for money and other reasons. At first I loved it. I was meeting different people, getting treated different (free drinks and warm welcomes) and most importantly making people happy with the food I was cooking. It's been 4 years now and I'm terrified at who I have become. All I do on a day to day is drink and do coke. I feel like shit the next day but then I drink and it all goes away for the moment. I'm living in a constant loop where i wake up feeling like garbage, stumble thru my day then get drunk. I've tried to break it with sober 7s, hobbies, girlfriends but I cant break thos lifestyle. I'm starting to have panic attacks every day. I'm losing myself, if anyone is awake I could use someone to talk to
