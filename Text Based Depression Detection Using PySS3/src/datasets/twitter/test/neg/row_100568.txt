I have nothing leftI will be expelled from school in the next six weeks. Once this happens, I will no longer have any future or any kind of career that will make my parents proud. They only see me as letters and statistics, not as a living and breathing human being.

I will literally be forced to kill myself once they and my entire family begin bullying me nonstop for being too stupid for school. I can't help that I'm stupid, I'm sick and tired of constantly being told by everyone there how worthless and useless I am. I'm tired of being everything they say I am. I'm tired of being unable to keep a job longer than a few months because I inevitably begin to start becoming so miserable there that they can me just so they don't have to look at my stupid face.

I'm tired of nothing working out. I'm tired of nothing ever working out. I'm tired of being alone and ignored and neglected and unloved. It might be the only way I can get people to value me for the first time, to prove the hypocritical nature of every person I know. They'll only care once I'm gone, and if it takes killing myself just to get one person to say they care, even if they're only saying it to soothe their own guilt, it's absolutely worth it. 

I have no worth. I have no value. I will never amount to anything. I will never be paid anything beyond minimum wage for grunt work. I am too stupid and cowardly for any kind of power or responsibility. I am a worm, a maggot, filth and pestilence and disease. Wherever I go, things get worse. People are horrified at the sight of me, I look like a demon. I probably am a demon.

I don't want to be stupid any longer. I don't want to be worthless any longer. I'm tired of people telling me to cheer up, telling me it gets better, telling me it's worth it, when I know the true: life is prison, death is escape. Death is beauty, for life is hell. Life is sickness, death is the cure. God is true evil, and the ultimate way to defy his will is to die before he wants me to. I feel nothing but contempt and hate for every molecule of this universe, most of all myself. If I were to remove myself from the equation, the universe would be beautiful again. Britain would rejoin the EU and Donald Trump wouldn't become president and people would get jobs and live happily ever after. All it takes is my death. That's all God wants, all he wants is for me to die. He takes away so I'll take it away. This is why he does what he does. He's always hated me, I've committed the cardinal sin of being myself and breathing.

I am the ultimate evil of this universe. Please torture into me new meanings of pain, beat me until I'm pulp, break all my bones, strip away my flesh. Pain is the only thing I deserve. I deserve every bit of pain I've ever felt, I've deserved it for breathing, for being alive. Someone like me doesn't deserve the gift of life.
