I just want to be normal.Iâ€™m tipsy just enough to post this since itâ€™s the only way Iâ€™ll actually do it. 

Iâ€™ve got social anxiety and I only have myself to blame. My parents werenâ€™t restrictive or overprotective, I was the one who decided to shut out people and continue to do so. The few friends I have hate me when I refuse to go out with them. Itâ€™s not possible anyway because Iâ€™ve been broke for 5 years, but even if I had the money the anxiety would stop me and I feel like an asshole for saying no.

Because I was such an awkward fuck up in school, my qualifications and skills are shit and I canâ€™t get a job because of a combination of anxiety,shit skills and a 5 year gap on my CV since leaving school. Iâ€™ve seen past school friends and people who made my life hell during school get good jobs and have solid relationships with people and I hate them for it, but I know I have no right to. Iâ€™m basically hating them for being normal.

Iâ€™m also gay and I hate myself for it. Paired with Social Anxiety it makes me feel even more afraid. Also my friends are homophobic so there's that. I wish I was straight so that people didn't look at me or think differently because of my orientation. 

Iâ€™ve had these issues for 9 years, since I was 13. I canâ€™t blame anyone for how Iâ€™ve turned out and I canâ€™t help myself because Iâ€™m so mentally fucked up. I canâ€™t talk to anyone I know because I know theyâ€™ll judge me. There are people who have suffered way, way more than I have and continue on with life and that makes me feel even more weak.
 
I really donâ€™t see any hope.  I just want to be normal and itâ€™s fucked to say that somewhere down the road, in the next 1-2 years, maybe even sooner, ending it would the answer.
