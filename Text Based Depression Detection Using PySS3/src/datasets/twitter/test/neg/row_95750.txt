Basically I feel like my life is in shamblesI'm 21 and in law school. I have relapsed to my eating disorder and self harm. My anxiety and depression has got worse. And I really feel like the world would be a better place without me. I genuinely feel a financial burden would be off my father if I just get done with my life. I'm not an amazing student and the prospect of not getting a job scares me. Also, my friends have been really cold towards me and behaving disant. I've tried talking to them but it's hopeless. At this point of time I think it's better to just kill myself.
