This Sub Helps MeI can't help these suicidal thoughts. I have no reason to have them. I am blessed to be in a university, I have a good minimum wage job. A supportive family, a great girlfriend, and friends who know how to make me laugh. But I constantly feel awful, it seems my own worst enemy is myself.

I can't help but think I need Jesus. I was raised in the church, life is not supposed to feel full without Jesus. So they say. But what if I go back, and I still feel the same. Year after year. Is all hope lost for me?

I almost did it a couple nights ago. It seems every few years the urges intensify. I almost had my fourth attempt. But, I found this sub. 

Nothings fixed for me. I don't feel better. But I feel less alone. I open reddit and my feed is filled with so many people who feel how I feel. So many people who have similar or polar opposite situations than myself, but we all feel the same. I don't feel like an anomaly. 

Who knows how long this sense of community feeling will last for me. I hope it's a while. Thank you for reading, and thank you for your vulnerability
