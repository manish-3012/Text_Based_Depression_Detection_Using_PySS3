Dear Zazzle Legal disclaimer: If caught and confronted I will deny all thoughts of  harm to self and others.  Stating that I am suicidal is speculation on  the viewers part. 

Dear Zazzle,

You are a selfish conceited whore-monger and I hate myself for having fallen in love with you.

You have the romantic finesse of a pimp and a comforting warmth only slightly better than a white collar inmate

It's true that Charles Manson would make you look like Mr. Rogers, but it's also true that Mr. Rodgers would make you look like Charles Manson.

You're the last person I wanted to fall in love with and the last person I wanted to say was the reason I keep going.

For some reason the universe reminds me of you daily.    For some reason knowing how strong you are, knowing you've survived worse abuse and bull shit than I have made you my hero.  Your ego is big enough without you knowing that but knowing about your strength makes me love you.

I've always had a weird delusion that I knew you in another life or two, I've always had weird premonitions about who and where you were.

I'll never claim you're not magic because you are.  Only that you are a shitty reason to keep going.

I do love you Zazzle but you have not one but two women in your life.  

At this point whatever we had together is just imaginary and I'm writing a letter to a shadow and a thought.

LIke I said you were magic and inspiration but you are a shitty reason to keep going.
