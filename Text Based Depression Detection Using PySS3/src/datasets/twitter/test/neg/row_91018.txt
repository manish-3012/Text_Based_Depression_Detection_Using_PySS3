Goodbye, dad. You piece of shit.Im living with a dad who only cares about his job. He's a sociopath in my view. He makes me help him with his job 24/7. Ive worked and studied my ass off. At the end, I get no money and I do horrible at school.

He cares for me at some points. But im tired of life. I love my mother, she's always helpful. But I give up. 

My dad made us move from Michigan to a shitty country because of the lack of Islam in Michigan compared to the country I live in. I hate it. No power. Small house. Food is toxic. It's shit.

My parents are at the restaurant. I wrote a 5 page book of my will and it's under my pillow. I have the bleach bottle 5 inches from my feet at this moment. I'm locking myself in my closet and drinking as much as I can.

As soon as I hit "post", I'll be dead. Goodbye Internet. Thank you.
