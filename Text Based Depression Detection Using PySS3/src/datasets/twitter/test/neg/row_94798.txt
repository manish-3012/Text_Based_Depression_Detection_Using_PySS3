I need advice on last chance survivalOkay...so I just posted the other day that I planned to end my life Wednesday but life is going to get in the way of that with my sibling and cousin graduating, so I am planning on next week instead. HOWEVER, if I do stay alive, I think my only chance is ECT. 

Does anyone have experience with ECT? How was it? Did it stop suicidal urges? Did you experience memory loss? If so, how much? Memory loss, even just the last few months, would be extremely beneficial to me, as a lot of my depression is from bad things happening recently. 

My only problems is it might be too expensive/not covered by insurance and also I heard it can, for a lack of a better way to put it, make you dumber. I'm a creative writer, so I would not like to lose IQ points or creativity but at the same time ... better happy than smart, in my opinion. 

I'm kind of rolling my eyes at myself trying to stay alive again but I'm mostly trying to stay alive for my mom and grandma who I wish not to traumatize.
