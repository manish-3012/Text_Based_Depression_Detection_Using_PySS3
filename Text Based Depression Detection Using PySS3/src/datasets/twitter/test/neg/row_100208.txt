Contemplating suicide for the past few years, donâ€™t know how much more I can take.Hi everybody. Iâ€™ve come to this sub to ask for a bit of advice and maybe look for a bit of support from people that may be struggling with what Iâ€™m going through. First off, let me say that things forever have just...not been great. From a very young age, sexual things were introduced me in ways that I believe you guys can put together, and abuse was always a major part of my life for well..as long as I can remember.
Sexual, verbal, emotional, all from different people. These things have plagued me for years, as well as depression, anxiety, and my autism hasnâ€™t been a big help either. As you can guess I have little to no self confidence and not a real reason to live.
I donâ€™t remember a time where Iâ€™ve ever really been happy...a few months ago I was diagnosed with PTSD and itâ€™s really kicking my ass. Iâ€™ve wondered if I had it for years, but I had finally decided to go see a therapist and people who could properly help and diagnose me. After several appointments, I still feel like shit. I know I shouldnâ€™t be so quick to give up after just starting, but I really donâ€™t know how much more I can put up with. Iâ€™ve never had a real motivation to pursue anything except for art ( though Iâ€™m not that great ) and my love for vintage toys ( silly, I know ). I have no passions, no people that truly care for me, and Iâ€™ve reached out for help all I can but it feels like Iâ€™m reaching at nothing- like every effort I make is just meaningless and nothing is ever going to change. Since the age of 12, Iâ€™ve always felt that I needed to die. Iâ€™ve never truly â€œwantedâ€ to die, but more of that I deserve to. I truly feel like every bit of abuse Iâ€™ve received over the years I deserve. So...basically what Iâ€™m asking is...what should I do? Is there hope for me? Are there any people like me that have had similar life experiences and have recovered, or should I really just end it before college starts? My mother is really my own support, sheâ€™s the only reason why I havenâ€™t put a bullet through my skull yet. I know if I died it would kill her, but I canâ€™t help but feel my birth ruined her life. 

Sorry if this sounded all over the place or unorganized. Iâ€™ve had a really rough past few months, and suicide has been a daily contemplation. This is really my last cry for help, nobody around me in reality seems to care or relate with what Iâ€™ve gone through and how I feel, so I really hope that maybe some of you guys can help me. Thank you for reading and listening to me.
