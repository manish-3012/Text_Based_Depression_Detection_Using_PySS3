I can't remember the last time I was happy. I don't know why I feel like this. First off, I should mention that I don't feel suicidal. I just feel like I can talk to you guys about this. 

I'm an 18 year old male, currently a college Freshman. My life has always been easy. I grew up with a great family. My mom and dad are supportive of me no matter what I do. I love both of my brothers and I know that they care for me. I have so many friends and I know they love me despite what I think. 

I grew up with the road paved for success. Anything I needed for school, for happiness, for fun, my parents provided. Books, toys, rides to friends's houses, anything. I did great every year in school but have always had a problem with procrastination. Well, not really a problem. I procrastinated as much as everyone else did. School subjects always came very easy to me. I could ace a test without doing any studying. 

Well, here is where things get messy. The first thing to happen to me which I think kicked me into depression was the death of one of my closest and best friends. His name was Chad. I met my best friend Travis, Chad's younger brother, when I was in second grade. Me and Travis became great friends and we kept a strong and close friendship until the end of high school. Since I was so close to Travis, I was also close to Chad. We had been friends for 10 years. I used to hang out with these guys every day. We used to do everything together. Then once we got into high school, they both got a job at a place I worked at and we became even closer.

Me and Chad used to smoke weed occasionally. He was the first person to get me to try it. So one day last year, he was working an 11 to4 shift, so I decided to come in a bit early for my shift to talk to him about getting me some weed and just saying hi. I talked to him for like 15 minutes and gave him 10 dollars. He punched out, I punched in. 

This part is ingrained in my memory and every time I think of it, I start to cry. He put his hand on my shoulder and looked at me and said "I'll be back in like three hours." He smiled and left. That was the last time I ever saw him. 

Later that day, I called him asking what he was up to, just a little check-in call. Fast forward a few hours and me and a mutual close friend were working when someone came downstairs from a wedding (we serve the food). He looked at his phone and then to us and said "Guys, I just got a text saying Chad got into a car accident and is dead."

I looked at my friend as the initial anxiety of the situation kicked in. I thought it was a cruel joke so I called Travis. He was on vacation with a friend but I knew he would know if it had happened. I called and my voice shook as I asked "What happened to Chad?" I could tell he was crying and he just told me "Call my parents." I hung up and everyone in the kitchen wanted to know if it was true. I nodded and started walking to the basement with the mutual friend. 

At this point, waves of emotion were flowing over me. Sadness, anxiety, anger, nervousness, horror, everything bad washed over me. I made it down about 7 steps before I burst into tears. I was sobbing fully and my friend was trying to console me but I knew he was about to break. We made it to the basement and I called my mom. I asked what happened to Chad and she just said (through tears) "Dad is coming to pick you up." I knew it was true. 

The rest of the week is just a big blur. I was a pallbearer at my bet friend's funeral. I had to watch my second family crumble beneath the weight of a lost son and brother. I had to watch my family get crushed by the weight of the loss of a close family friend. 

Throughout all of this (it happened on Sept. 4th, 2009), I held in all of my emotions after the first week. Occasionally I would visit his grave and sob like I did the day I found out he died. This still happens fairly frequently too. 

The only redeeming thing to happen to me during this period was meeting the two people whom I call my best friends. They are very different in the way they help me. One is much more activity oriented. We would play video games or discuss philosophy and religion. We would talk about anything we felt like. Our friendship grew throughout high school. I always hid my depression from this friend. He never knew about it until recently when he shipped out to basic training. I told him in a letter. 

My other friend helps me in a completely different way. She's always there to talk to when I'm having a hard time (which is daily). I can talk about how fucked up I think I am, I can talk about how I think my friends all hate me, I can talk about Chad and she still listens and it helps so much. I feel like she gives me too much for what I return, help-wise. 

These two people have been my only saving grace. If it weren't for them, my summer preceding college would have just been me sitting in my room crying. They really made the summer fun. I love both of them more than they know. Of course, one left for the military and I left for college so our fun ended and so did the almost-happy feelings I had. 

Now I declared Physics as my major in college. After the first month I realized that I could not keep up with this field and dropped my class. I went into a lower Physics class. I came in late, so not only do I not understand the material, I'm also behind in homework. This isn't helping me get back to where I want to be. 

I don't know what I want to major in. I thought Physics would be okay but it's not. I thought Engineering would be good but I can't do Physics. I absolutely love math but my parents heckle me about constantly thinking of changing my major. They ask what I'll do with a math major. 

To add on to me thinking I'm going to fail out of college, my parents think I'm doing great. I'm the oldest so I've moved out and they assume this automatically means I'm okay. My mom constantly tells me how my brother looks up to me as a role model. He doesn't know I cry myself to sleep some nights, smoke weed on the weekends, and fail my exams. 

Winding down, I'll summarize everything I feel. I feel hopeless and useless and worthless. I think my friends hate me or talk to me out of pity. This includes even the people closest to me. I feel like the old me is gone. I feel like I have to act like myself instead of just be myself. I have to make a conscious effort to look not upset. I haven't been in an actual relationship in my life and I'm convinced I'm going to die lonely alone with no one there for me. I just wish things were the way they were before. I want to be happy. 

How can someone brought up in such a conducive environment be such a failure? Why can't I ever do anything right? 

tl;dr Why do only good-looking people get depressed?
