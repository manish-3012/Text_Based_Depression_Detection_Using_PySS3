Best way to say goodbye without drawing attention?Despite the strong confident exterior I've put on for years, I've been slowly burning away on the inside.

Of the few friends I have, I honestly consider all of them good folks whom I'd feel terrible about traumatizing.

It is my intention to disappear without a trace but I'd like to say goodbye prior to. 

Any advice on what to say without drawing attention?
