calm me downim considering suicide im in high school getting bullied and havent go to school for month now(i dont get well with my clasmate but i kept contact with my best friend since i was 8),i have been troublesome child for a long time now  and thing that calm me down is anime,movie,game and my online friend,i always express my feeling online so i dont snap but that make me a dick,my online friend is fed up with me and decide it'll fun to pick on me,i cut contact with all of them when 1 of them cross the line,its like 10 people group chat and 2 peopel actually support me,the first one becoming busy with collage and rarely online and the other just help me up after i get bullied by those cunt.im a dick to my classmate and something end up to blocking but we both always end up ok,i just talk to him about no longer having people to talk too without having consequences in my irl daily life.usually the dick not always a dick they use to be nice to me and keep my mind of suicide.but since i cut contact i find it hard to find new people because if i open up to fast they gonna think im creppy and ran away,little chat always keep my mind of suicide bc im a loner and having someone to talk to is fun i don't want anything i just want a little chat thats all i ask for daily to keep my kind of suicide and i can go on to my day
