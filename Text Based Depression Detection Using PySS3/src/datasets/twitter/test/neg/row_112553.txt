I think I may have just unintentionally written out suicide ideation. What do I do about this?I was doing a stream of consciousness for my college writing class, and by the end of it, I reread something I marked down: 

"You make me live in a shell. Your family makes me live in a shell. My family makes me live in a shell. I canâ€™t go anywhere right now, or I will die. I canâ€™t stay here or I will die too. I will die here, I suppose. Itâ€™s better than dying from a choice I made myself. 

I wonâ€™t tell anyone. I wonâ€™t make it purposeful. Iâ€™ll make it slow. Iâ€™ll make it non-purposeful." 

I know streams of consciousness like these are meant to filter out every thought, and I guess a part of me was attempting to sound a little poetic, but I have been dealing with heavy depression throughout the past few months (BAD through the past two weeks) and... I'm a little scared, because this idea isn't outlandish to me. 

I would never do anything to intentionally harm myself. I don't even have a... plan, I guess. I'm not going to stop taking care of myself. I'm too scared to do that. 

I don't even know exactly what I meant when I wrote that, but I know I meant it, and I'm a little scared. I don't want to tell my boyfriend - since I live alone, he would worry out of his mind. 

My therapy appt is tomorrow. Should I bring this up? Will she have me institutionalized? It's only my second appt, so she's still getting to know me. 

Thank you so much for any help. I hope you're doing well!!
