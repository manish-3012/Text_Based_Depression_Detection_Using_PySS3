Can't think of a titleGot 3 60mg oxycodone crushed and ready started drinking for the courage and to help the tablets. so far still scared but honestly calmer than I thought. Waiting on my buddy to wake up (i wanna talk to someone while I go) so I've got some time to kill. Never posted here or any were else but I've looked around for  while so I kinda feel obligated to write this. Don't have much to say but I do like how friendly and supportive people seem to be here. I hope you guys all get to sort out your problems. Aaaaaand that's it. Goodbye ( don't plan on responding even if this didn't work)
