Failed attemptI failed at suicide last night. It was starting to work and Iâ€™m not sure why Iâ€™m still here. All I really did now was piss off my therapist, friends and family. I know my therapy will be terminated now bc of this. I donâ€™t even have it in me to try again. Feel so defeated and numb.
