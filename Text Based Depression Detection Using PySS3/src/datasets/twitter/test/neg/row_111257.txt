I'm close to giving up, please help meEverything has gone to shit, as always, but this time I can feel myself losing all hope of it getting better. I've never been so tempted to end my life. I can't live with my parents anymore. They haven't done anything bad but I can't deal with them always being sad because of me or saying things like "We're praying for you" when I know it's not gonna get better. I've been thinking of moving away. It was my initial plan for starting university but I felt better during the summer and made a last-minute decision to stay home. I regret that. I'm just tired of watching my parents lose hope and feeling like  burden. I know it's inconvenient to literally run from my problems but if I managed to find a university program, living arrangements and a doctor or hospital psychiatric unit to refer to, moving wouldn't be so bad, right?

If it's not a good idea, then what can I do? I feel like I'm already dead. Please help me. I'm only 17 and I have no one else who can help. I don't know any one who's depressed like me. When I talk to my parents or friends, they just say typical crappy positive things. Even my dad today, when I told him I was never going to be happy and no one wants to be around me when I'm depressed, was lost for words.
