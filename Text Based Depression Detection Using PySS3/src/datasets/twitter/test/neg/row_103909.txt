well,,i feel so utterly worthless,, everything i do is wrong. and even when i do do something right its always just mediocre. i honestly am so done. my future used to be the only thing keeping me here but its not enough anymore. every night i have dreams of killing myself. different methods. i think its the worlds way of telling me to just die. my family really wont care. theyre always mad at me for something anyways,,,, and for my friends,,, they wont think about it. im not particularly close with any one of my friends so it doesnt matter. nobody really needs me here so why stay? cutting has become a really good way for me to cope but since summer is coming up ive had to start cutting on my stomach and my hips but its just not the same. im probably going to kill myself soon. and,, honestly,,, its comforting knowing it will be all over soon.
