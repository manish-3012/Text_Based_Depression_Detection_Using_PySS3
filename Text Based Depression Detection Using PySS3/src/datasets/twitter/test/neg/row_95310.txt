why would i keep going?i am feeling the most down i have in years. So ill start off with my own dad went thru hell as a child so he is pretty much heartless and my mom passed when i was 6 from breast cancer so ive never had anyone to talk to about my feelings. The past 4 years my life was going in a better direction because of my girlfriend because i was able to talk about my emotions to her and she would understand. But i never realised i completely relied on her so it ended up becoming too much work for her and we talked and chose its best for us to separate and in those 4 years i lost contact with friends and siblings and such and dont know if my siblings even have heard anything about me in those 4 years. That is completely my own fault. And now i am left with nothing but suicidal thoughts ,anxiety and a shitty minimum wage job. I have no one in my life anymore i have nothing to live for i have no enjoyment in life.
