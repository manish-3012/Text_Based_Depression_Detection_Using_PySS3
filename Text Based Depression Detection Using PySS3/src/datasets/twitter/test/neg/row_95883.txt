Everyday is so painfulEveryday is absolute agony. I have gone through so much shit in my life that just isn't normal and it is so hard to live with. I am only at the start of my life. It truly baffles me that I have been through enough pain to last a lifetime in my early years alone.

I wish the misery would just end
