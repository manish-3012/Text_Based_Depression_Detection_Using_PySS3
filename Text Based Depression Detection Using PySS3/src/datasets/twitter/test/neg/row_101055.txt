I have surgery in three days. Instead I want to die first.Life is not worth living, full stop.

I don't desire to get better.

This surgery in 3 days time is not going to make the suffering in my life worth any more time.

I need to find a final method that cannot fail. I'm not interested in recovery or anything of hope.

For me, and my story, violently and abruptly dying and wasting all my potential is the pot of gold at the end of my rainbow. I want the sadness of wasting myself to ripple out forever. It is so beautiful nothing else matters but to achieve it. Help me find the right way
