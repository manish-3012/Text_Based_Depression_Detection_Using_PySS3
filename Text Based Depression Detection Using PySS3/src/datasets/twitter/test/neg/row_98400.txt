Suicide is the only thing keeping me goingIâ€™m in high school, and Iâ€™ll never be good enough for my parents. My life is meaningless. I try my hardest in school, I was always one of those gifted children when I was younger, but I donâ€™t know how to do anything anymore. Whenever I get a bad grade, whenever I turn in homework late, I use suicide as a way to comfort myself. My plan is that if I donâ€™t get into an ivy or a top college, Iâ€™m going to take my own life. Hell, I wouldâ€™ve done it in middle school but Iâ€™m too scared. Iâ€™m not too scared to die, iâ€™m too scared to fail. I would be dead right now if there was a sure way to die. The only thing keeping me from completely failing all my classes and giving up is killing myself
