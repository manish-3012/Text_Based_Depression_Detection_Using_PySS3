High on cocaine, feeling lost and sickI'm a former philosophy and english major. Whatever academic aspirations I had are long gone. My body is deteriorating. My hair slipping away, but body crashing from drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes. I'm in a pit I can't seem to escape. Tried a few times to die but all the attempts were half-assed. Been looking for answers for a long time. Thought maybe I'd find them somewhere in doomed love affairs, Ingmar Bergman, or Sartre, but all I'm left with is this bitter hopelessness, this infinite veil of sorrow that colors the all fabrics of my banal, broken life. I was born in poverty, and for most of my life I wore that adversity as a point of pride, but the older I get, the worse it feels. Lost the love of my life years ago after two miscarriages. Never fully got over it. I don't see much hope on this horizon. And yet I'm painfully aware at how precious human life is, how infinitesimal the chances were that I was ever born to begin with, and how brutally I've fucked up a life that could have been so much more fulfilling. I used to be able to harness this pain to create cool shit, to try to bring some beauty to this fleeting existence, but I feel so sick now that I can't even write anymore. I can't make music. I can't create beautiful things. And because I lack the fortitude as of yet to pull the trigger, all I can do is make as many attempts possible to kill myself or cross my fingers that I OD on something. I miss having dreams. I miss being able to cry. This emptiness, this depersonalization has gotten so bad that outside of a dull ache in the pit of my stomach I can't feel fucking anything. Wish I could fucking sleep forever.
