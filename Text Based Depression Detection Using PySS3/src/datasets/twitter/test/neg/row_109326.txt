I was watching American Idol with my grandparents last nightAnd you know how singing shows are, the mediocre singers with sob stories? Well, this girls was that her parents made her stay in her room everyday and she went into depression. But she has nothing on me. Iâ€™m 16, I NEVER went to a birthday party, Iâ€™ve never even had a sleepover. This is why I donâ€™t let people relate to me. They donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m dealing with and no one can help it get better. And seen as how itâ€™s been going on for 16 years, itâ€™s not going to change. Maybe when I go back to my dads Iâ€™ll just end my life, that way I can actually get out of my room.
