I should of listenedTo all the people that told me not to ask out my best friend. Now everything feels worse and I have no one to talk to. I feel like she's ignoring me now. And she treats me so much different. I hate that I care so much. 

My only question I want answer is if I'm so handsome and a great guy why did you say no... 

I got 3 more months left I decided a few months ago.
