I feel like im trapped with my abusive mom for at least 2 decades moreI live in a 3rd world country,and getting a job is extremely difficult.to top it off you have to earn at least 2x the minimum wage to even think of renting.
Im still a student and finishing next year(im late by 3/4 years already),should be going to college as soon as i finish but...
living with my parents is hell on earth.im a woman and dont have have friends,never had a lover.i just study and work(77 dollars a month) to give my money to my parents.they dont lt me socialize.
AND im a closeted lesbian.my life wold truly be in danger if anyone found out,i avoid even looking at other girls too long.my dad could kill me if he knew,and my mom already hates me,i have no doubt she would throw me out on the streets.
all i want is to move out.thats it.i just want to go far away from them.but to that i need well paying work,and to work i need college,to go to college i will have to live with them 5 years longer...
i dont see a way out.i will only miss my cat,but i trust that my dad wouldnt let my mother give him up for adoption.
i think i might jump from a malls 4th floor or get some rope and say its for the cat to play with.
