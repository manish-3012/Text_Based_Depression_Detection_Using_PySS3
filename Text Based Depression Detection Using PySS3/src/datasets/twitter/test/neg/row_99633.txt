Where should I travel ? I am depressed.Hello Reddit, 
First of all, sorry if my english isnt perfect. I'm from France and doing my best. 

I'm a 21 years old dude. 
I'm not going to detail everything that's going wrong in my life right now, because in my current mood it will feel pathetic. 
Long story short, I cry everyday, my mood is affecting people around me and they begin to hate me because of it. I feel very lonely. 

I've been "stuck" in my life for several years now and I'm starting to have bad thoughts. 

I think I need to go somewhere. 

Can you guys share your travel experiences and give me advices on where to go ? 

Please. I need help.
