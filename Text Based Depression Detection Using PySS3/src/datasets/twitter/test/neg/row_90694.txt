It seems like the only option to stop feeling so much painI'm tired of feeling so hurt all the time. I've come to terms with the fact that I'll never be anyone worth remembering. I've saved lives, I've been to many places, done many things and I've made so many other people's lives so much better. But in the end everyone still forgets about me. I'm tired of feeling like I'm never good enough. Im too nice for my own good. I love other people too much and I can't change. I'll never be free. I know this for a fact. It isn't as black and white as you'd think. I can't get out. There isn't a way. I just want to feel at peace more than anything. I just wish I wasn't such a fucking piece of shit coward.
