Friend of mine had a suicide attempt. I fear that he might try again.Several weeks ago, a buddy of mine attempted suicide by overdosing on pills and alcohol. Him and I are not super close friends so I figured I'd reach out to Reddit for some suggestions/thoughts/general comments/etc.

Basically, it all boiled down to him and his relationship with his father. His dad pretty much put my friend's brothers on a pedestal while not really giving a fuck about him. He has been living on his own (with friends) for quite a long time and we all fear that he is still on the verge of possibly another suicide attempt.

After the first attempt, he was taken to a clinic for a week or two, but there still doesn't seem like much change in our friend's self-worth (in his view), so to speak. Now, he has no job and can't afford to live with his friends anymore. It seems like his only option would be to go back and live with his dad, but, of course, that probably wouldn't be such a good idea. His roommates have said that they have done all that they can to help him out, but can't support him anymore.

Is there something that my buddies and I can do to get him on the right track and steer away from those thoughts? I was thinking possibly getting all of the guy's friends and people who care about him in one place and having some kind of intervention, but perhaps that would sort of single him out and make him feel even worse. What are your thoughts?
