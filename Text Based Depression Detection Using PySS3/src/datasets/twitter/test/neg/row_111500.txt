anyone up like now? I could use some talkJust got dumped without a reason and I'm panicking since a few hours ago. I don't mind being dumped, yes is painful but my problem is the lack of communication. I tried explain myself and got thrown out and blocked everywhere, I can't force a talk if she doesn't want. Then I panic and now the problem became that I panicked. I have a very important meeting in 7 hrs. I can't sleep and I'm scared to miss it because it's a medical thing and I don't have any money to fix this if I miss it. Moreover, my best chances to raise some cash in the next days was with her, I'm totally lost now, I need to put the pieces toghether again and I'm no position to do such. Stupid me for going into this, I knew I needed more time to stay with a girl but now I don't know where to turn. My dogs gave me the strenght to walk home to meet them again but I'm panicking hard I'm shaking I've a bit of blurred vision and I puked twice. I don't think I can do this alone, and nobody is here for me
