Getting closer. Cannot change myselfI've been trying with no success to help eliminate my bad habits but I am more set in my ways than I thought. I waste so much time and I'm depressed all the time. I feel like a huge drain on those that do support me. I'm unemployed and haven't found work in months, I'm almost completely broke, I'm nearing 30 and still don't know what to do with my life and my past decisions (like my choice of education, etc.) were poor in retrospect. 

I'm at a low point and unmotivated. I just want to sleep and now I want to permanently. It's all I can think about. I want help but I don't want to work hard either. Sometimes I feel energized but it doesn't last long and I can't find a 'system' for change that I can stick with or makes sense, etc.
