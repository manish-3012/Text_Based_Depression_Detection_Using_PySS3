I just want to give it up foreverIâ€™m 17, all of my life has been fucked up and shitty. My mom ditched me with my grandparents when she had me as a teen, dad tried to kill me as a baby, now have to live with a psycho step-dad and completely different mom than i remember. They are alcoholics and donâ€™t give a shit about me. They constantly scream at me and remind me about everything iâ€™m doing wrong. I donâ€™t really have any true friends that i can talk to this stuff about. When iâ€™m gone i just know that i wonâ€™t feel like this anymore. I canâ€™t move out because nobody will hire me even though i have good job experience. Whatâ€™s the point when itâ€™s just supposed to get worse? Why do people want to stay alive when the hurting can be gone so easily. Iâ€™ve dealt with this pain for too many years.
