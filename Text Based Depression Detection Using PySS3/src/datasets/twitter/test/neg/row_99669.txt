What else is there to do?16F .I'm embarrassed I let myself believe that the reason for my depression was my being better than my peers. That's just not true, there are so many girls around me so much more smarter, prettier, creative and intriguing than me, to the point where I am none of those things. Killing myself seems like the only way for people to see I understand what is happening around me. I am so sick of being patronized, having people not talk to me because they think I'm too stupid. I'm so sick of all of it. I hate my surroundings more than anything, the rare time I try anything I get criticized and ignored.
