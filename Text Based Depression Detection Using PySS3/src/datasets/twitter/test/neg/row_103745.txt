join usYou ever notice the same response to every fucking suicide? RIP,  I'm sorry I failed you, I'm so sad/sorry/bullshit, I miss them, suicide is selfish, I was just talking to them! They seemed better, etc etc.  


Fuck all of them, they don't care, always say the same self pitying remarks, as if they actually cared to understand your sufferering and pain.  


It's never going to go away, ever.  


Sure, go ahead, talk to and get professional help, talk to people that "want" to help, and even talk to those that attempted suicide before.  Keep talking so they can delay their momentary inconvenience and guilt.  
Or keep getting distracted cause no one want to deal with the mess afterwords.  


It always the same shit everytime.   Imagine and try to think how many people before you committed suicide, how many times this happens yet people still don't get it. 


THEY DON'T GET IT. THEY never will.  Don't take my word for it.  Don't listen to me too.  Find out for yourselves.  Go run the hamster wheel and jump through THEIR hoops.  You will find out it's not for you, it's for THEM.  


To THEM, there's no place for us, here. Join THEM or DIE,  

-  


or better yet F U C K THEM  Make this our world.  

Make THEM all suffer universally.

Why should this idea be taken any less then what THEY say?  What THEY want you to do, what THEY want you to feel.  


If THEIR way is not working, then what is possibly  next?
