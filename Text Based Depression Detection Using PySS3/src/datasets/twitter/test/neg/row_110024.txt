What am I to do? Suicidal ideation...I am losing the will to live. I am a widow at 23. Just had to spend my 1 yr anniversary alone. I married the perfect man and I ruined my whole life in one day. In one week I lost my husband, career, physical health, mental health, many friends, and all self confidence. All of this started with a car wreck. I haven't been working for months, my job is sore at me. My friends who were there for me have abandoned me due to my own isolation or lack of motivation to help me. My career means nothing to me and I don't even want to be in the same field. I have a masters and I don't want it anymore. I used to be happy and now I can barely be bothered to get up and take a shower in a day or maintain a healthy diet. I hate myself. I just want to die. I feel like I should have died from the wreck too. My life is a never ending shit fest where I get guilt tripped into living. Fuck these people who get to be bystanders at the glorious trainwreck that is my life. Oh, icing on the cake, I am facing felony manslaughter charges for my husbands death as well. I hate my life. I just want to hurt myself but I am an unmotivated coward. The only thing that keeps me going is the distractions I find like online shopping and cleaning and getting rid of anything that reminds me of my previously happy life that was actually going places.
