So much suffering. Makes me wonder what the point is.During this month alone:

â€¢ Coworker's son in law dropped dead from a heart attack at 42

â€¢ Other coworker's dad is in hospice and not doing well

â€¢ Another coworker's daughter was just diagnosed with cervical cancer

â€¢ Older coworker has cancer himself

â€¢ Member of our facility (16) was hit by a car and is in a coma

All of this just within my workplace in a single month. I don't even work with that many people. 

There's so much suffering in this world, it feels like hell on Earth. Humans were a mistake, and I honestly don't want to be a part of this reality anymore.
