Suicide thoughts showing up rather frequently latelyI'm holding so much inside of me and I just cannot let it out to anyone else. Dont get me wrong, I have few 'friends', some of which know my current situation but I dont have a 'real' friend I could trust, everyone just seems so far to reach. I think my depression started right when I was studying abroad and one day my parents told me out of blue through skype that they are gonna divorce, my dad made a child with different woman and also my granmas dog that I loved so much died too. I kept sobbing for several hours that and the next day too. 

Now Im worried that since that incident something has changed in my mind, like some fundamental thinking of mine. My dad is a strong manipulator and is trying to include me to his twisted-fucking realationship and also constantly tries to socialize me with his fucking little bastard. Although I'm 18 they left me alone in the house, dont get me wrong i still see my dad every 2nd-3rd day (only just to say hi and some basic small talk, but we didnt have any kind of conversation in years) and see my mom for about day or two per like 10 days (she lives with her mom in a different city since the divorce). I just cannot cope with the loneliness, everyone seems so distant, like I'm talking to a shadow of a person rather than his body. 

Lately I've been toying with an idea of suicide (which was on my thoughts more than once in a last couple of years) but this time it hit me harder than ever. I even reached a point where I'm just imagining standing with a rope around my neck and just passing out after chugging a bottle of booze. The thought is so comforting for me that it's in the back of my mind constantly. 

Am I asking for much if the only thing I really want is to be loved. To be loved by someone just because I exist and not because I'm their pathetic little creation of sort.
