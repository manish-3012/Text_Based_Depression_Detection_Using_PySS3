Back home from a Psych HospitalAnd I want to die again. Being in the hospital really helped me. It allowed me to really think about life and what I wanted, and how much I appreciate being alive. I didn't think about harming myself at all. I was genuinely happy. 

I was so ready to come home. So ready to really start living. But the second I walked into the house I felt all of the hope and happiness drain out of my body. Now I'm laying in bed on the verge of crying because I just don't know what to do.
