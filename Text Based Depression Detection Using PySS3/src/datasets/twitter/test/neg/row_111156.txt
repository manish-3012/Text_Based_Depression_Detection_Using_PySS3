I survived an attempt-to-attempt-to kill myself thanks to asshole junkiesI tried to buy heroin as a way to go out painlessly. I was ripped off and paid $200 for some kind of flour that I snorted a ton of before passing out from just being tired. Lmao.

I'm taking this as a sign from the universe to get mental help. For anyone else struggling, I know how much being in pain sucks, but let's try to get help.
