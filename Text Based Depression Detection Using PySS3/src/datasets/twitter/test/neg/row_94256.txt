i cant go onif i pass my classes this year, what happens next year? when i graduate, i wont ever see the people i care about ever again because i dont talk to them, and i dont talk to them because i care about them and itd be better if im dead. i cant live with my weird out of body shit that happens everytime i move or even eat. im gross and a burden, i dont want others pain and there isnt any way i can avoid that, i cant live with myself or anything, i cant go on living like this and i just need some peace
