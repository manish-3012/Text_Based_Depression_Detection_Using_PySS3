Never thought I would ever post here myself...My partner of over 5 years just left out of the blue today. I've started taking my xanax and it's not helping and I just want to keep taking it. I was already suicidal and severely depressed before she left due to mental health issues, and she was the only reason I didn't take things to the next level. Now there is nothing stopping me. The suicide helplines are useless to me, I hate the scripts, robotic responses, and people who could really care less. It  kinda makes things even worse knowing there is nobody you can call who actually cares and won't go off script to actually help you. I've been to hospitals before and they are even worse, they trap you in a hallway, you get no privacy whatsoever, and it takes up to two days to even see a "professional" who just straps you to a bed and hauls you off to the funny farm where there is no help to be had, and they just treat you like an inmate. I've been down this road before, it does not get better no matter how hard I try, no matter how much i self advocate, it all lands on deaf ears. So what is the point anymore. I'm just done.
