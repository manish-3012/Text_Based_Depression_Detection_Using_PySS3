i want to die im scaredI've been depressed for years, been on antidepressants for years. I was on Prozac (Zoloft) for 2 years and have now been on venlafaxitine (vensir) for about 2 years. It doesn't work, nothing does. Life is just fucking pointless, I have a fiancee that I love so much but she deals with the same suicidal thoughts too. I don't want to see her do it before me, I want to do it first. I've fucked my brain up beyond repair, too many drugs that I started doing around age 12. My last few acid trips have been so so bad, I feel like I have felt what death feels like and its a relief. My last (and worst) acid trip left me embarrassed and ashamed and even though it was about a year ago I get flashbacks every fucking day. I can't go a day without either drinking until I blackout or other drugs. I was addicted to opiates (not IV though) for a long time and I was clean for 6 months until I went for an emergency operation at a hospital which they gave me morphine for which started the whole spiral off again. I can't do this and I don't want too. My biological family haven't spoken to me in years and just see me as a 'druggy'. Every councillor, therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist  I have ever seen has been pointless, and to be honest I find it hard to open myself up to strangers who simply do it for money, and I don't want to tell the truth because I am afraid of being put into a hospital against my will. I don't know why I am posting here but I guess its a last resort. Nothing matters anymore. If you took the time to read this I fucking thank you, I know i'm irrelevant to your life but I appreciate it so much, just knowing someone is out there taking the time to read this. I'm also sorry to any mods if this isn't the right place to post this sort of thing.
