I don't even knowI've made a set of conditions in my mind in which I am going to kill myself. I believe myself about this and I am fine with it. I may snap and break the conditions that comfort me. This worries me most of all. No one knows and I don't want anybody to know. How can I exist in society like this? Is it possible?
