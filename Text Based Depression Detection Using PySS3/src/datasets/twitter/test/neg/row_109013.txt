After death, what happens to the mess you leave behind?The credit card debt, the loans, the rent, the bills... if I have no family, would they hound after my biological family, even if I was a foster kid? I don't want to leave a mess, cause any more inconvenience or trouble for anyone. I just want to be gone. 

Does anyone know? I tried googling it but got different answers.
