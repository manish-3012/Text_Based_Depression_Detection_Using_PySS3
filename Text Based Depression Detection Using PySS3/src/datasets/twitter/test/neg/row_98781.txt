Am I overreactingI posted this on r/nostupidquestions and was directed here 


My friend hasnâ€™t responded to me in almost a week. That doesnâ€™t seem like a big deal but she always does. The thing that worries me is that sheâ€™s and alcoholic and drug addict as well as suicidal. Iâ€™m really worried about her but I canâ€™t get into contact with her. Her home life is terrible and Iâ€™m worried sheâ€™s hurt. 

I know where she lives, am I overreacting or overstepping my boundaries if I go over there to check on her?
