I can't afford to existI can't afford to go to school to pursue my dream of becoming a linguist. I'm young for my grade, I'm going to graduate high school at 17. It took me so long to figure out what I wanted to do. I even applied everywhere undecided. Now that I've gotten all of my acceptances, I've only been accepted to my two bottom choice schools that I can't even afford with the money they're offering me. Community college is out of the question because I'd have to live at home for another four years with my mentally unstable mother who hates my guts and living on campus is too expensive to be worth it. Everything for the past two years has been turning out in the worst case scenario. I really ran myself thin working hard, not getting enough sleep, stressing out to the point of mental and physical breakdowns. I just don't can't handle it being like this for the rest of my life. It's either living paycheck to paycheck as an unskilled laborer or living paycheck to paycheck for the next thirty years under crippling debt. It's such a miserable existence. I don't want to do that. I have dreams and wants and hopes that I can't even afford to think about and I'll have to live with the fact that I can't accomplish almost any of it. I love to learn, I really do, but living with the fact that I can't afford to is just way too painful.
