I feel guilty, suicidal and lonely.Iâ€™ve been thinking of killing myself for the last week or so. First night that Iâ€™ve thought up a plan. I feel so guilty for feeling like this. I hate myself for feeling like this. Iâ€™ve got great friends. Iâ€™ve been doing good with college. Yet I wanna end it all. Iâ€™m so lonely. My best friend said heâ€™d set me up with someone but I donâ€™t deserve them. I wanna kill myself so fucking badly but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m a coward. Iâ€™m lost. Iâ€™m scared of everything. I donâ€™t deserve anything. I donâ€™t want anything anymore. It all hurts and scares me. I canâ€™t trust. I canâ€™t love. I wanna love. I wanna live a happy life. Iâ€™m just a coward.
