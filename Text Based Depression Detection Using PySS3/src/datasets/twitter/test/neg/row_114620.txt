How to properly treat wounds after cutting?Firstly sorry if it sounds messed up. 

Just recently I started cutting and self harm a lot. Usually is just 1/2 cuts but now it gotten much worst. I always clean it with just water but it takes so long to heal. Iâ€™m in my parents house and I donâ€™t want them to find out. My clothing is very limited.

Is there any tips after cutting yourself so it would heal quicker?
