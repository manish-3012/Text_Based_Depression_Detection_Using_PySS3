i donâ€™t know how to feeli respect my inner self. i love my inner self. i do not like who i am in the world. i hate the person i am. i donâ€™t want to want to kill myself but i think about it all of the time. overdosing. bleeding out. how everyone would react. if things would be different without me. i canâ€™t help it. i fantasize about near death experiences or situations in which i come close to dying or put myself on deaths doorstep but i notices i donâ€™t typically imagine a situation where i actually die. it hurts me to think about it a lot. i donâ€™t know what to do about this. iâ€™m not sure if i would ever actually kill myself, but itâ€™s always on my mind. especially when i get over emotional. iâ€™ve really really thought about doing it. i can never bring myself to take the last step, no matter how close i get to the edge of jumping or swallowing pills. it almost makes me feel like a coward for not being able to, but also makes me feel like one for wanting to in the first place. i feel like iâ€™ll never stop thinking about it unless i seriously put my life on the line to see if i actually want to be alive, but iâ€™m scared that if i try and i decide i want to live, iâ€™ll die anyways, or if i decide i want to die and i live, iâ€™ll have to deal with everything that comes with an attempted suicide and realizing the fact that i donâ€™t want to live.
