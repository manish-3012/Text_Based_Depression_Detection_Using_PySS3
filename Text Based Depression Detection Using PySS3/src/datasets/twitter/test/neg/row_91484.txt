First Post on Reddit.I am a 22-year-old male and I feel so trapped. I live with my mom and I hate it because she gets drunk every single day(my birthday included). She also treats me like I am her servant and she expects me to drop whatever I am doing to do something that she should be doing for herself. The latter really sucks when I am working on homework or studying at home during the school year. Today she had me go out in the pouring rain and get her a bottle of wine and I feel like that was the breaking point. I want to move out and find my own apartment badly. However, I was hoping to wait until I transfer to another school first( I go to a community college rn) and I pay out of pocket for my classes ( my parents don't help me at all). I know there isn't much to do about any of this and I just have to suck it up. But days like this makes life feel so hard.
