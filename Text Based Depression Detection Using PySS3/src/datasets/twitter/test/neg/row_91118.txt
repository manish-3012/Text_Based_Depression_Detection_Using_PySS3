Life isn't Worth LivingI've had severe depression (clinically diagnosed) for about five years now, but know I've had it for at least ten. I'm never happy for a long period of time. I feel so alone, don't really have any real friends outside of the internet, and my career and path in life seem to be going nowhere. People hate me, and im generally an unlikeable, unlovable person.

Recently I've been thinking about suicide. Like, a lot. It seems to be on my mind more and more, and I feel like if things don't start changing for me, I'll actually do it. I already self-harm more and more over these past few months. 

I'm just so tired. I just don't think I can do it anymore.
