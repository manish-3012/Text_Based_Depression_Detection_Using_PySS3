I may as wellA girl I was close to in Hospital, who I last saw ten days ago, was able to kill herself in the psychiatric ward. They weren't looking after her properly, when I was there I had to stop her from killing herself. 

She kissed me and it was kind of awkward but I cuddled her anyway because it was nice, she was nice and she wanted a cuddle. When I didn't want to cuddle much anymore the last few days I was there because I was feeling agitated, I hope she didn't see it as a rejection. 

I never had anyone I know kill themselves before. It hurts. She was so sad, and now she's dead. I've only known for 4 hours and the image of her dead body keeps popping into my head. Our interactions pop into my head. How I might have hurt her and how absent my emotions were at the time popped into my head.

I want it to stop now
