I don't think I should keep trying anymore.I've been feeling pretty good most of December. About 3 weeks ago my Dr increased one of my antidepressants and I was genuinely feeling GOOD after a few days. I was motivated, positive, and sleeping well. I was able to force myself to exercise. I joined a gym. I even picked up a new hobby - yoga! I was also eating really healthy. I was able to control my binge eating. I didn't eat anything bad at all the holiday parties I went to. I was proud of myself. I was feeling good about my body. I wore a skirt for Christmas Eve. Things were good. Not "amazing" but good. Content.

Then right after Christmas the good feeling went away. I just felt sluggish and blah. But today, today it all came crashing down. I don't know if there was a trigger. I don't know if it has something to do with the fact that I started a new birth control pill 5 days ago. Maybe I'm getting sick after being around a bunch of sick people for Christmas. I don't know. Does it even really matter? I had a taste of what it felt like to feel "okay" and now it's gone. I feel like a shell. I'm 28, unmarried, poor, ugly, and aging. I hate the way I look. I'm not overweight but I'm covered in cellulite. I'm pale as fuck, and not in the pretty way. My hair is frizzy and disgusting and my face has wrinkles and is losing it's shape. The women in my family don't age well. I'm not going to be an exception. I'm past my prime. What's the point in continuing on? I have so much shame in the way I look.

I really liked doing yoga. Until I decided to record myself. I can't afford a class, so I wanted to record myself doing the poses to make sure I was doing them correctly. What I saw made me want to vomit. I'm so disgusting. I'll never be a feminine, beautiful, graceful woman. I'll always be awkward and clunky and flabby.

I realize this all sounds superficial. But I think it was seeing my appearance that triggered me. But it's not just my appearance. It's everything about me. I have no friends. No social life. No hobbies. Nothing that makes me interesting or cool. And I don't even care. I don't care enough to make friends. Or a hobby. Nothing sounds good to me. I can't find pleasure anywhere. Nothing feels like it has a point.

I've been battling this for 15 years, 10 with medication. I'm DONE TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT. Maybe I'm just not meant to be happy. Maybe I'm just not meant to be alive.

I don't want to do this again. I was okay. I was doing alright again. Now I just want to kill myself.
