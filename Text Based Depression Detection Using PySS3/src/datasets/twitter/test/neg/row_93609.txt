Iâ€™m ready to goI am a 21 year old, ugly, short, fat, black guy, who has adhd and possibly ocd as well who hates myself so much. I am silently crying in my bed as Iâ€™m typing this. This is my biggest secret that Iâ€™ve only vaguely told one other person when I was either 13-15 I donâ€™t remember, and telling them has been my biggest regret).When I was 10 years old I was sexual abused by someone 4-5 years older than me. He would do things to me like sucks my toes and tell me to suck his and I would. Itâ€™s more misty but I think he even licked my asshole briefly. Another time he pulled down my pants and put my dick in his mouth. I hate myself so much and wish I could go back in time. I wish I could so much. I have this hanging over my head and I will never move past it. Iâ€™ve only ever kissed and had sex with one person and Iâ€™ve never had a serious girlfriend. Iâ€™m such a broken person. In high school I tried to compensate for people saying that they thought I was gay behind my back by lying and saying I fucked different girls that I never had done anything with and I hate myself so much for doing that. I would also tell people that I had mental illnesses like bipolar and borderline. Iâ€™ve told so many lies just for attention and I hate myself for that. Every friend that Iâ€™ve had has grown up and moved forward with their lives and are on their way to doing all of these great things with their lives and Iâ€™m just so broken. I hate it all so much. I donâ€™t think I can ever find someone who would love me for me. I told a friend that I was abused once and Iâ€™m not sure if he took it seriously and I regretted telling him that and I told him I was just joking soon after but I feel so vulnerable and regret that I told him that more than anything. I feel like this abuse would be livable with if I never told another person. I just wish I could turn back the clock because I have became a person who is fat and ugly and social inadequate and I am so lonely. I feel like I live in my head all day imagining a better life for myself. A few days ago I bought a gun. Iâ€™m just so ready to end it all.
