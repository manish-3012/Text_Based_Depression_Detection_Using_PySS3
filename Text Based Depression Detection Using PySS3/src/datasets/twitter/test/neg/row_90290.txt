Lack of supportI don't know what it's like where you live , but support for suicide or depression is pretty weak where I am from. Very few resources to help single males. Yet it's this group who are most at risk. I have made an appointment to see my local M.P. and I hope with the General election coming up he will take this complaint seriously. 
I was told it was a 18 week wait to get on a support group. (Meantime i have only my medication to help me)It's ridiculous that there is only two sources of help I can access with the other being Samaritans.  I was wondering what do you do to take your frustration out? Serious question no rude remarks.
