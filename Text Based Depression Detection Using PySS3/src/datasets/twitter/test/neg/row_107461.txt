I'm terrified of it, but can't see another option.I need to check myself into the hospital. Now. Sooner than now. I have been on the cusp of killing myself for days. Weeks even. I've refined my plans down to an exact science. I have means, motive, and opportunity. Yet... I'm not afraid of dying. I'm terrified of trying to get help. I'm afraid of how ill be treated if I go in. I'm mortified to think of what people will think if/when they find out I'm being hospitalized.

Is trying to live really worth it? Letting go would be so easy.
