I'm losing it.As the days drag on and on I feel more disconnected from everything around me. Like someone slowly turning down the volume of something you're listening to. I feel like I'm fading away. I'm failing all my classes in college. I don't even go anymore. I don't like my major. I don't even think college is right for me. More and more people in my life are turnin away from me. I feel myself being more and more disliked by my peers. I'm always tired. I feel kinda nauseous. I've come so close to offing myself so many times but there's always that voice saying that if I dig down deep and work hard at it I can make it through the darkness. I feel that voice and the hope shrinking. I see no good outcomes for my life. I'm an ugly looking, horribly put together, asshole. I'm lazy and have no goals or real aspirations anymore. I don't know why I wake up. I'm bad. A waste. Other people not flawed all the way down to a genetic level deserve the opportunities I have. I'm always in pain. Not just mental and emotional but physical. My family is poor though. I feel guilty everytime I go to the doctor's because I feel I'm wasting their money. Another thing is that I'm finding it increasingly harder to be around the people I enjoy. They treat me bad, like I'm subhuman. Grabbing me inappropriately(honestly though it's not like they knew I was molested) and always calling me slurs. Sometimes I feel so on edge I just think about beating them with my bare hands. Badly. Like barely breathing, bleeding profusely, broken bones bad. Other times I look at the knife on my desk and just wonder what if. I need die. I'm out of options.
