Why do people assume that suicidal people don't think about what other people will feel if we ever commit suicide. Life sucks, people always tell you to suck it upI can't help but get angry when people tell me that there are people who care for me or that it gets better or that there is still hope or that they will feel so affected if I hurt myself. Do they seriously think that we haven't thought everything through? That we have not considered all of those factors? I think that there really is hope but the problem is I can't feel it. I have done everything to make myself better but I still failed.
