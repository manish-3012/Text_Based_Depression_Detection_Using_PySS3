Need some adviceSo today I went and saw a doctor. And I told him that I'd been seriously depressed (on and off) for over two years. That's the first time I've ever told anybody in real life about my depression, so it was kind of a big deal for me.

I don't really feel comfortable talking about it, so I didn't discuss anything except the frequency/duration of the times when I basically lose it. 

I specifically chose a doctor I liked, and I'm glad I did because it was tough to have that conversation. At one point he asked me if it had ever got to the point that I'd thought of self harm -- a question which I'd been specifically planning to lie about. But for some reason I didn't feel like lying at the time, so I said yes but that I didn't want to go into the details of it. He asked if it was recently, and I said no. (Which was technically the truth, depending on how you define self harm and how you define recently). 

Anyway I am getting a blood test tomorrow (which is why I went there in the first place), and I have another appointment in a week to discuss the results.

My question is, how much can I say without putting the doc in a position where he is obligated to do something?

If I was completely honest, I'm not suicidal now, but I very likely will be at points in the future. And I do think I'd be capable of going through with it. I honestly don't know if I would or not -- depends how bad it gets.

The absolute last thing I want is to have my situation disclosed to anyone, or to be locked up in a hospital for my own protection (is that possible?). So I really think I need to be prepared in advance on how much I'm going to disclose on Monday. Have I already said too much about the self harm thing?

I'm sure people on here have experience with this -- I really would appreciate any advice. Please be honest with me.
