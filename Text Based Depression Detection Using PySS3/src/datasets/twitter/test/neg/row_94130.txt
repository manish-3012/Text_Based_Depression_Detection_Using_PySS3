Friendâ€™s teenage son just killed himselfOur friend had kids pretty young especially by todayâ€™s standards. She married some asshole with depression.  She had two kids. She got divorced. The dad was a POS and left them and didnâ€™t even want to see his own kids afterwards.  Poor boy just offed himself at 16 years old. 

We are all so sad. I canâ€™t sleep. I donâ€™t want to see my kids faces when we tell them. 

Donâ€™t kill yourselves for gods sake. Life is amazing when you participate and throw yourself in head first. Suicide just harms the people around you.
