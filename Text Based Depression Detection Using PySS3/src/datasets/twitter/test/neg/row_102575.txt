I'd prefer to die from the coronavirus than suicide.I suffer from asthma, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and a heart condition. My lungs only function at 80%. I've suffered from pneumonia multiple times in the past and had to be placed on oxygen. If I were to contract the coronavirus, I'd likely die. My family is generally healthy, so they'd likely be alright and only experience a mild case of the virus. I think I'd rather die from the virus than suicide, since it'll spare my family the guilt.
