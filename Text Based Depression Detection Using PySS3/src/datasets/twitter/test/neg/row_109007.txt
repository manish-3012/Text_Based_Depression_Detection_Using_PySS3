I'm out.First of all sry for my shitty english its my third language.

I have lost all hope. I have not felt happy in a very long time and i feel like its time to leave earth now. My life will never get better so might aswell end it while atleast some people still remember me. I have saved up some money so i have thinking about going somewhere magical to die alone with no return ticket. I feel very psychological unstable at the moment. So going on a trip alone somewhere warm and pieceful alone and enjoying the best of earth before going is a good plan to me. I might only be 21 but my life will never get better now i am sure and i dont want to become a lonely loser i have experienced alot and have had some good times with old friends who i dont see anymore and family. I will be thinking about these good times before leaving &amp; i think my last thoughts will go out to the stars and whatever is out there. Space has always fascinated me so much. Good luck everybody on this ruthless miserable planet. I'm out.
