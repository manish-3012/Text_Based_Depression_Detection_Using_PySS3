I know I'm going insane, and I want to end it before it gets worse.Diagnosed bipolar here. Every episode I have gets worse and worse. They alternate between manic/mixed and pure depression, lasting anywhere from 3-6 months, and happen at least twice a year. I thought it was bad when it started and I fucked relationships up when I was manic. Then the more time went on, the more I've lost my ability to emotionally connect with anyone. I'm so alone. During my last two episodes, I suffered from "pseudo dementia", basically you're so sick that your brain mimics the brain of a dementia patient. And it's not going away. Even in the time between episodes, my cognition gets more impaired. I've tried so many meds that my doc told me my condition is "treatment resistant." I've read that being in any sort of close relationship with someone who's bipolar can be horribly psychologically taxing. I don't want to do that to anyone. Not only am I a horrible burden to people who do care about me, but I know I have already put them through a tremendous amount of pain. I don't want to keep doing that. I've heard committing suicide hurts people more than other more "natural" deaths, so I want to find a way to make it seem natural. 

Not only do I know I'm losing my mind and who I am (being taken advantage of and harming people when I'm in an episode), but I know that morally I have to be alone for the rest of my life. How do I do it?
