Scared to sleep but hate being awake.Itâ€™s 630 in the morning and Iâ€™m tired but when I think about sleep I get a tight feeling in my chest. I feel like I am having a panic attack. I hate this feeling. I hate my thoughts. They keep me up because of the dreams I might have. Iâ€™ve been thinking about drinking more often and Iâ€™m fighting the urge but Iâ€™m getting weaker. Iâ€™m getting worn down with my lack of sleep. Itâ€™s been 24hrs almost. I hate myself. I did this to myself. I canâ€™t take it anymore. I donâ€™t want to be awake anymore but my brain wonâ€™t let me sleep. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll last much longer like this. Iâ€™m sorry.
