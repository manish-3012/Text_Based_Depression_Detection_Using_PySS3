Coming up with reasons to feel worseIâ€™ve been on antidepressants for about 4 months. I feel better but I find that most of the time I feel empty. I can hardly keep a coherent train of thought going, especially when it comes to things I used to think about when heavily depressed without meds. 

I feel empty but overall Iâ€™m doing alright I guess and not having as many suicidal thoughts.

Yet I still feel sad and it feels like I have no right to be. I have no reason to be. Nothing is even going on.

So i find myself purposefully thinking bad thoughts in hopes that they will make me feel the way I used to feel without meds. So that I have some justification for feeling bad.

Now that Iâ€™m on meds and dont feel as bad as before I feel like I have no right to talk about myself feeling sad for no reason considering that itâ€™s nowhere near as bad as it used to be.

I really wish it was bad again. I want to go back to feeling terrible. I feel guilty but I want to go back.
