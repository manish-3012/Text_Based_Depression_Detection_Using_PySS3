Please help me I'm hurting so badI've posted here in the past.

Sometimes my mum has often yelled personal insults towards me, when I have done nothing wrong. She says these things so easily and often that it's hard to believe she doesn't mean them. I understand how she can regret saying them, but doesn't mean she isn't obviously thinking them.

E.g. no wonder you have no friends, can't wait for you to move out, you can live with your father (when they divorce), I don't want you.

Shit like that. Mostly unprovoked, when she is angry at my other sibling. Otherwise I may be a bit angry about things like my sibling and then she'll say things like that - but totally uncalled for - I never say things like that first.

I was the victim of I would say moderate physical abuse from my father, and maybe even my mum, but mainly father, and also emotional abuse.

No physical abuse happened after I was around 14. 

Now it's just this fucked up emotional abuse.

At least I think it is.

I have 0 friends and she knows it. That's what makes everything more fucked up. You would think your MOTHER would love you and want you to be happy, and take special care with your feelings especially when you have NO ONE but HER.

BUT SHE DOESN'T CARE AT ALL.

Not one bit. Nothing but herself, how crap her work is complain complain complain. No room for my issues. 

But I don't care about that.

It's the PULLING ME DOWN. Insulting me, when I'm already at the lowest point of my life. Alone. Not even caring one little fucking bit.

I think she hates my fucking guts.

So I'm alone in this FUCKED UP world.

You know what's fucked up? Being a fucking child, and going through such saddening periods that I wanted to fucking kill myself. A FUCKING CHILD. This is probably from age 9? Maybe younger. It was regularly a thing I would get so stressed and upset from my dad hitting me and sometimes my mum, and then my mum not doing anything, I would fucking think about killing myself. It was a common thing I thought about and who fucking knew I would still be here. Is it not bound to happen if I've been thinking about it since age fucking nine?? Right up until now. I'm nearly 18 years old.

I told her I wanted to maybe live on campus at uni for a year. And make lots of friends. She sure turned that back on me as soon as she got annoyed at me... "can't wait for you to move out, yeah go live on campus". What the fuck?

I don't want to HAVE to move out. I don't have any FUCKING MONEY. I'M FUCKING POOR. I'M NOT READY TO MOVE OUT. MY WHOLE FUCKING LIFE IS TIPPING UPSIDE DOWN AND I'M SCARED.

I have some mysterious health issues. Pain. Lots of it. I'm currently thinking fibromyalgia  along with some inflammation here and there. Guess what can cause fibromyalgia? Child hood fucking stress. I knew that would FUCK me right up. Being a little kid and constantly being in so much pain I wanted to kill myself. Of course that's FUCKED MY BODY RIGHT UP. Who knows, my dad probably fucked up my spine / SI joints with him tackling me to the floor and pushing me in FUCKED up positions that hurt me.

I JUST DON'T KNOW IF I CAN'T FUCKING GET THROUGH THIS. It's already KILLING me trying to get through my last year of school which I do ONLINE BECAUSE OF MY FUCKED UP HEALTH ISSUES. Let alone dealing with all this fucking shit. How the fuck is anyone suppose to get through something like this?

I just don't understand how a mother could be so fucking oblivious to her daughter in so much fucking pain and she purposely fucking puts me down and hurts me.

I want to be happy and have a happy life so fucking bad. SO BAD. I DON'T WANT TO DIE AND I WANT TO LIVE. WHY DOES EVERYONE MAKE IT SO HARD. But it's just TOO hard. I'm trying so hard.

God please help me.
