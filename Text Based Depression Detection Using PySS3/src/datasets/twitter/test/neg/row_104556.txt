I have become a huge disappointment to everyone I knowLittle backstory: I had an amazing childhood, I was popular, I was good at everything I participated in, for example: sports, academics, relationships etc. I was motivated and everyone expected great things out of me. 
I lost my motivation to achieve things after I was accepted into University. I failed my first year and I moved to another country so I could be closer to my girlfriend at the time. I still couldnâ€™t find any motivation and I gained weight, I started failing my classes and I eventually lost her. 
Itâ€™s been 2 years and I still miss her every single day, Iâ€™m still struggling at University, I canâ€™t cope with the stress but I canâ€™t quit because my father has spent a massive amount of hard earned money for my education despite of his gradually worsening health problem. I keep fucking up and now Iâ€™ve lost my will to live. I let everyone who cared about me down. I let myself down. I am in so much pain and I feel myself slipping away.
 I need something or someone. I donâ€™t want to let go but I can feel my grip loosening with every passing day.
