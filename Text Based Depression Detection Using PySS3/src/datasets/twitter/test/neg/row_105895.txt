Stop the ride please, I wanna get off.Okay, I'm sick of this. I have been depressed for so long...I've made half a dozen posts on here before asking for help.

I'm tired of feeling this way. Something's clearly wrong with me. And I want to get help.

I don't know if this is just some weird partly sunny feeling amidst all the clouds or what...for months I have been planning and tying up loose ends for an eventual attempt to leave the planet on the best possible terms (under these circumstances).

The past few days the survival part of my brain has been working better than usual...still not great, but I'm now considering taking drastic action in order to save my life. And I do mean drastic. I have a lot of issues that I'd have to work on in order to return to any resemblance of normal. By getting help, I would essentially be forfeiting my current life as I know it.

I just need one last push. Maybe some help working out the best way I can do this logistically so that perhaps I wouldn't have to forfeit so much of my life in order to do this. Or advice on the best way to ensure that I get all the help that I need. I feel like this is the right thing to do at the moment but I'm also really scared...
