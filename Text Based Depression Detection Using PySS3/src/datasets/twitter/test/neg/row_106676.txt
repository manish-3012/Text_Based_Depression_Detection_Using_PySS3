I dont wanna live with this in my head anymoreI am going through a post breakup situation, Cant move on or get over it, So many people have tried to make me understand even me myself have tried to make myself understand but i just cannot let go. I wanna hate him by now but i cant it has been a year now and . am tired of life and i dont feel like living even for a second more. I wake up everyday and the first ever thing that hits me is this and after that my entire day is simply screwed. I live it with such frustration i wish to shut my brain off but i cant. My soul and my heart and my brain are at a war with each other. I am a homosexual and fortunately live in an Anti Gay country. I cant find a way out of this place. Then My Gay Boyfriend left me to get married to a fucking bitch who came into his life like 3 days ago. 3 years and he could not decide that he can live with me or not. and 3 days and they are engaged. I was all alone until he came along, and now he has stranded me and i have noone literally noone i could go to, Daily i have this want to go and just do something to myself. I just wanna disappear, vanish, gone no trace. I so wanna die. I have this thought of injecting myself with an air bubble. I have survived a suicide attempt 3 times. I once listened to him and took yself to the hospital after digesting loads of pills. If i had not . listened to him i would have not been here today. I dont know why i listened and believed what he said. I want someone to go to him and tell him that what he is doing is wrong and it should not be happening he should not be doing it. He is worried about destroying that bitch's life i mean i am also a human i have a life too why is he not concerned about my life. I wanna have him back. Or destroy his life. expose him infront of everyone and fuck his marriage up so bad that he would never be able to get married. He says if i love him i should be happy with the choice he made. Thats not love. Love is when you cannot see a stranger or any other person get that attention or time of the person you love. Jealousy is natural in Love. I attempted suicide just to have him stop what he was doing. instead i was framed for being selfish and i was trying to harm him by killing myself. If i would have died what would have happened to him? like seriously like as if you are give a big fuck about whats already happening right? Its been a year i am going through all this. Because of this my personality my aura my energy my career my education everything is getting damaged. and if not today if not tomorrow i would certainly do something to him or myself the day he gets married. I went on a trip once and my cell broke and i could not contact him and i was framed for leaving him. I didnt tell him cuz i didnt want him to worry. there was no other reason i was not cheating. I just went to meet a friend who had come back to the country after 4 years. An he broke up with me saying i always knew you would leave someday. I didnt leave i would never leave. I loved Him, I still Love him and i will always Love him. I am all on my on. I just wanted his presence and wanted to share and live this one life with him. He left with such ease did not suffer at all. Why am i the only one to suffer. He was equally consensually involved in this relationship just to cover his face, He left me, He threw religious shit on my face for the actions he himself had bee a part of for the past i dont even know how many years. Made me feel ashamed for who i was, Made me hate myself even more than i used to.Just so he could get out of this relationship. i dont know what to do. I am tired of listenign to the same old generic statements or advices that everyone can give you and that i have gotten from all my so called friends who didnt even hold him for what he was doing to me.
