1st valentine's alone in 12 yearsTomorrow is going to be hell for me, being a prisoner in my own mind and soul is no doubt killing me slowly.

I'm so alone and miserable I now just sleep all day and when I wake up I pop another sleeping pill and just repeat it.

34F with nothing, no love, no hope, no money, I wish I could of ended it a while back, wish I would of had the courage to say enough is enough.
