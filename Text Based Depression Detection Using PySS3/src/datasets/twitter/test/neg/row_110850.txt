It doesnâ€™t matter how hard I try, life never gets better.Iâ€™m tired of living this life. Everything is terrible every day. My family has little money, my mom just went for a mammogram and they are calling her back in which isnâ€™t good, I graduated college but cannot find a job in my area, Iâ€™m in debt from college, my boyfriend cheated on me three times, I am unhappy, I hate myself and I wish I was dead. I canâ€™t cut myself anymore because of the scars. When boyfriend discovers them he says itâ€™s childish. Now I just beat myself up physically because thereâ€™s no evidence. I hate my ugly face and will slap or punch myself hard in my head. Itâ€™s punishment for being me and being so pathetic, ugly, stupid, and worthless.
