Took pills threw them upI took around 50 pills an hour and a half ago. I threw them up just now. Itâ€™s one thirty in the morning right now and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m not gonna try again it was too painful. I feel really gross right now but I canâ€™t take a shower because Iâ€™ll wake up my grandpa. Itâ€™s in my hair. Itâ€™s all over the bed. Please help.
