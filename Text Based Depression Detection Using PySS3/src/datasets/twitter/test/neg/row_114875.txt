Transgender and suicidalHello, so, here's a bit about my history, I may make a long post because I have some steam to blow off. I personally find pretty sad having to pour all my sorrows in forums online because people in real life don't care if it's not something that affects them or it's not something that gives them money, but I have no one to talk with, later I'll explain how did I get to this point.


I'm a 19 year old girl from Venezuela, since very young age I didn't feel satisfied with myself, I liked doing things that boys do, dressing like a boy or androgynous, with 8 years old I didn't understand that I actually wanted to be a boy, but I was aware that being girly wasn't my thing. My mother didn't like this and forced me to dress and act girly until she noticed that trying to make me change was impossible, I suffered other types of abuse as child, for example getting beaten up or yelled even though I did nothing wrong, even my grandmother recognizes that my mom only pays her anger with me. At that point of my life it didn't seem to affect me, I was a top student since elementary until high school and my parents never had to worry about me going out late at night, having a boyfriend they probably would dislike, having sex or doing drugs, never touched that and never did those things really, I was a "good girl" and a "good example" but it's never enough for them and I don't even feel good with what I am right now.



I have been on multiple therapists and psychologists because I knew something was wrong with me but nothing of that helped and my emotional state just have gotten worse and worse with the years, adding it to the fact that I didn't pick good friends, suffered bullying and a lot of mental abuse during my school days, my family blaming me for every single thing that happens like I'm not even a person and the situation of Venezuela getting more and more hopeless everyday it was just matter of time until I developed all these confusing feelings.



At the moment I'm in university (fourth semester of computer engineering), currently on summer break, promising myself I'd actually change for the better but during these 2 months I have just been laying on bed all day, I can't even sleep, I just look at the roof or get lost in my thoughts, I hate what I am right now, food doesn't even taste like anything, I don't think I'm ever getting out of Venezuela, and if I am I don't think I can ever fulfill my dream of being a man, I am afraid of the future and I've isolated myself from all the people who called me friend, I feel I'm just a burden for them when I talk about my feelings and I'm better off dead.



My identity problem lead me to catfish over the internet, basically I tell to everyone that I'm a boy and I do the impossible to back up my story, I feel like shit for lying but I'm too weak to accept my reality (that I'm a girl and I probably have to be one forever), I want to fantasize for a bit to feel better about myself but once I get attached to a person I feel like a complete shit for lying to them, recently I made a friend on certain social platform, I liked him way too much and at some point I thought I loved him, but I felt so bad about myself suddenly for doing this to him that I've tried to push him apart multiple times with the only goal to end our relationship peacefully but I got nothing over it other than destroying our friendship, I think he must hate me now for that.



If I kill myself I don't think anyone would ever care, I can tell my parents will just say that I was a waste of money and I didn't do anything important anyway, I wish I was brave enough to do it, I have thought about methods but nothing is possible on my situation, due to the forum rules I am not allowed to get in details so I'll just skip this part... I can just hope to die on my sleep but I just keep going, I just want to end it, but a part of me doesn't feel ready, I just freeze and I don't know what to do, I have tried to open up about my feelings to my parents and family but no one cares, and it's not only that, they will just say anything to invalidate my feelings, they just tell me that I have no right to be sad because "there's so many starving kids in Africa" or because "They are stupid problems", I've tried to get psychiatric help by myself but I'm so unmotivated that I can't even do something as simple as getting out of bed, get dressed and walk to the hospital, I simply can't, I have been 3 freaking weeks telling to myself that I'd do it and end up doing nothing, It's probably my fault but I hate this shit and I really want to cut everything out and end the pain.



Thanks for taking your time to read this, sorry for making you read something this stupid but I really feel bad right now.
