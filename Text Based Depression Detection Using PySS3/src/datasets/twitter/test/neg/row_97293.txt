Im a human trashMy parents love me, thats the only thing thats keeping me from suicide. But i cant take the pain anymore. This year was a mess, i started with self harm and i became an alcoholic.

Yesterday i came home so drunk that my parents found me lying on the toilet unable to talk. Mother cried because of that and father is angry. If my parents knew that im a worthless trash maybe they would realize that their life would become 10x better if i was dead.

I really want to end it, its just that my parnets would be sad.I just cant take the pain anymore.
