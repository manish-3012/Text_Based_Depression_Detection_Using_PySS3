I hate being a South Asian male in the US. Want to set myself on fire!As an Indian guy we are just a joke in this country, i think I'm just going to kill myself, I'm done with my life. People like Kamala can become the first woman president of the US while an Indian male is mocked, ridiculed, and spat on by American society and media. Was Bobby jindal ever taken seriously? Nope! He was just laughed off the stage when Trump made fun of him. I knew this would happen. All the Indians in Hollywood are ALL only girls, the Indian guys get to fill stupid roles like cab driver or gas station clerk. I tried for the last 2 years to get a skilled workers visa to move to Australia, Germany, ireland, Norway, Sweden, UK, Netherlands, only half got accepted and when i got there couldn't find a job that would sponsor a 23yr old fresh graduate like me with little experience so I got dumped right back into America. I even applied for a visa to India but they denied because of coronavirus! So I'm trapped here in the US. Can't escape, tried everything, and all my worst nightmares are becoming reality. So you know what, I'm just going to check out of life tonight, I'm done being the ethnicity that i am especially in this country. I am just completely done. I hate that my parents moved here and caused me to be born in the US and therefore a citizen. It is so hard to escape the country you are a citizen of. So yeah, goodbye everyone. I made a note to myself that if stupid biden picked her that I would kill myself that same day, and looks like it's time to walk the walk. Because theres no way i can bear to watch this election unfold i just can't do it. I hope some Indian guys read this and beg their parents not to move to the US. I really truly do...
