Someone please reach out i cant do it aloneFirst off I'm going to start by saying, I took a drug. So  that probs pays a huge part of how I'm feeling rn, but I just feel so empty all the time, I can't escape it. Its such a horrible feeling. I have BPD and it just sucks I hate it so much and it makes me want to die so bad, I really want to get better but I just cant see that happening. I don't want to die, I need to die.
