Anger management problems...Im pretty sure i have anger management issues, im 15 and i dont get angry easily i just cant control myself when im angry. Its hard to explain but when i hit the zone of anger i just loose it and i dont know any other ways to let out my anger. Yesterday i got angry and lost my shit and i got home, started punching my table and when i calmed down i realized that my fists had been all cut up. A couple of my knuckles are cut open and my table is straight out broken. Idk how to control my anger, i want to have my anger under control but in a sense where i dont just put it down for it to build up into another burst out. ( i have previously punched cement walls at school till my fists were bleeding, put holes into doors, and just punched random hard objects) i know im sounding stupid but i really need help with getting ahold of my anger cause im worried that itll take over me one day and ill go too far.
