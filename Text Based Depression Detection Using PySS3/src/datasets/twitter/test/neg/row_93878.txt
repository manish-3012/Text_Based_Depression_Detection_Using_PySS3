Stuck. I wish I didnâ€™t have to die.Iâ€™ve been struggling long enough to recognize my warning signs and disconnect my thoughts and urges from my self. That doesnâ€™t make dying and other self destructive behaviours any less appealing. I know when I need help, and what I need, but no one is ever there, no one ever *listens*. 

Iâ€™m suicidal, but I donâ€™t want to die. My brain tells me to kill myself constantly, but I believe that I can improve my life (and quite honestly, my ADHD makes putting a solid plan and going through with it near impossible). 

Iâ€™m stuck in this situation where Iâ€™m depressed, constantly on edge, binge eating every day, dealing with horrible intrusive thoughts, feeling myself deteriorating and desperately want to *get better*, because I know dying isnâ€™t the only option. But, at the same time, feeling so alone, stuck, and ignored because Iâ€™m not actively trying to kill myself or dying and no one takes me seriously that itâ€™s starting to seem like the only option. 

Itâ€™s taken so long for me to come to this state of self awareness, of realizing triggering situations, yet it means nothing because I still donâ€™t have the solutions or coping mechanisms. Itâ€™s like being kidnapped, and finally finding a phone to call someone, only for them to say â€˜sorry Iâ€™m busyâ€™ and hang up. 

At this point, Iâ€™m seriously considering suicide, I donâ€™t want to, but it feels like I have to now. Iâ€™m losing hope in the concept of recovery. Itâ€™s too scary being aware of your disfunction, but feeling powerless to stop it.
