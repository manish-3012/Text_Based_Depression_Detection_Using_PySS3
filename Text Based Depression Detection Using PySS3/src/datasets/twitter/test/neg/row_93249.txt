I canâ€™t do it anymoreIâ€™m tired of living. I canâ€™t handle all the drama. I thought I had a best friend but someone told me that she was talking about me. I feel lied to. Iâ€™ve had these thought from 3 or 2 years ago. Every time I ever try to talk to my friends they either tell me to hurry up and that things will get better. Iâ€™ve been waiting for things to get better since 2 years ago! I mean they left me one day and said oh yah.. uhmm my mom said I canâ€™t hang out with you anymore because your suicidal.eventually they came back. I have so much going on at home and I listen to music and thatâ€™s my little escape. Someone talk to me please?
