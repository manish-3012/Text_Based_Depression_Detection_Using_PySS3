This is it.I can't speak to my sister because of some certain circumstances that happened today. 

I listened to my mom cry about it. It absolutely broke my heart. 

I'm a complete failure as a daughter and a sister. 

I live in America and with the way things are playing out right now with Russia, I could easily be dead within the next few weeks because Putin will drop nuclear bombs on the US. 

I contemplated suicide today for the first time in *years*. 

I refuse to die in war. I would rather die by my own hand then go out with a bomb. I would rather die by my own hand than anything. 

But dying scares me. I don't know where I'll go when I die. But anywhere has to be better than here. 

Right after considering it, I sat in my boyfriend's lap for a good 10 minutes, studying every last detail of his face. Every freckle, every gray hair in his black beard, the gap between his two front teeth, the way his eyelashes curled slightly upward. 

He kept smiling and asking what I was doing. I just kept telling him that I loved him. 

He could tell *something* was upsetting me so he told me he loved me too much to see me new upset. He told me I was the most important thing in his life and that even when he has nothing, he'll still have me. 

Hearing that made me hurt. Because I don't feel important. If I wasn't here, he could easily find someone else. He's a very attractive man with a very loving personality. It'd be easy for him to find somebody. 

Which is why, after 24 years of being on this earth, I'm going to just...do it. 

I'm done. 

I refuse to continue to be a disappointment and a failure. 

I refuse to listen to my mother cry again. 

I refuse to allow my boyfriend to be stuck with someone like me. 

I refuse to die any other way. 

This isn't a plea for attention or a cry for help. 

I've never been in control of anything. This is the one thing I get to be in control of. 


Goodnight, and goodbye. 

I'll see you on the other side, wherever that may be.
