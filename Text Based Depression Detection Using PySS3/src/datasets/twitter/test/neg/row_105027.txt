theres no fucking pointi want to kill myself (re reading this just thought no shit sherlock im on suicidewatch). i have for a long time. there is no reason to want to die i have everything i fucking want, im not abused nothing has happened to me but yet i still fucking manage to want to die. i tried to get help and i just fucked it up by refusing to talk. theres no fucking to help ill always be like this. everyone says "itll get better" well you cant fucking guarentee that. i hate myself and everyones telling me bullshit about what a  nice person i am. i dont see any reason to live all ill be is a fucking disappointment and a failure anyway and ill prolly kms before 24 if i somehow dont.
