Iâ€™m an analytical person and suicide seems like a solid option for my situation.Disclaimer: Iâ€™m diagnosed bipolar 2. However, I am currently stable and medications are working. Iâ€™m not in the middle of irrational thought. 


Simply put, Iâ€™m not interested in living a full life. Iâ€™m 24 years old (not young, not old, I guess). Iâ€™m pretty much asexual and havenâ€™t found anything that brings me joy or a remote sense of happiness. I have a dog I love to death but I live in isolation and I can tell itâ€™s affecting her. I have family in Florida who have other German Shepherds that I know would take her in. 


Iâ€™m a burden on my family. My mom helps with rent when student loans and work arenâ€™t enough. If Iâ€™m struggling in school my brother gives me a call to talk things through. Mom is a professor deep in important research. My brother is going to law school. My sister is on track to be some badass civil rights lawyer. They are all serving the greater good and my depressing existence is holding them back. Iâ€™ve been told so indirectly. I want to free them of this burden. 

I feel like Iâ€™ve given it a fair risk assessment. I wonâ€™t lie to myself and say they wonâ€™t be traumatized. They will be. But Iâ€™m thinking long-term. My mom, brother and sister all have SOs who I have gotten to know. They are great individuals and will give them the care they need to get through it. 

Iâ€™m not sure why I decided to post. Iâ€™m not looking for someone to talk me out of it. If Iâ€™m going to do it, Iâ€™m going to do it. I guess I just wanted to articulate my final thoughts. 

Itâ€™s a weird world. It can be beautiful. But in my experience, itâ€™s been filled with pain and Iâ€™m simply not interested in anymore pain.
