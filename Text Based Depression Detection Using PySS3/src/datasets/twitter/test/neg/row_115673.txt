I regret not killing myselfEvery day I regret not killing myself I don't even know why I keep going on. Fuck this life. The people who say they want you around really don't. 

They convenience you not to kill yourself before the leave and abandone you. They say it's not that bad but they don't fucking know what your feeling the pain inside the suffering. 

It's not even hard to kill myself anymore. It used to be a feeling of what if I leave something or someone behind who cares. It turns out those people don't exist. The sooner I go away the better.
