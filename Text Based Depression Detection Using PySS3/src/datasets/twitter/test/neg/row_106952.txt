I don't know what to do anymore. I use reddit for nosleep and fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu but id decided to give this a try. 

Just recently my lost my best friend. She is still alive though. 
I've been suicidal before and she (I'm a guy) has stuck with me through thick and thin . But recently our friendship came crashing down . She told me how she doesn't believe me when I say "I love you" . How she doesn't want to be friends anymore . she said that I ruined her life emotionally. I have been trying to cope but each day gets harder. I have other friends but they aren't taking this seriously . For me I see only two options: reconcile our friendship or die . I need some damn above please I don't know what to do anymore
