Helping family graveHey guys, my life is pretty much shit and I've been contemplating suicide for years now. I explained my situation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/4sbueb/im_in_the_edge_and_dont_know_what_to_do/), if anyone is interested.
The only thing that has stopped me from taking my life is the emotional pain and guilt it would inflict upon my family. 
Does anyone have advices on how to decrease this possible pain/guilt?
