career disappointment... this is itI am not going to get the job I've dreamed about, and been training for, for over 10 years.... I am such a fucking loser. Everyone feels sorry for me. Even my boyfriend is scared of me. This is the most profound humiliation I've ever experienced. 

I want to disappear. Since I can't simply disappear, I want to kill myself, in a way that is minimally disturbing to the few people stupid enough still to care. I've disappointed everyone and need to stop disappointing people. 

I've been researching how to obtain a gun. That's the next step. This life is too hard to continue.
