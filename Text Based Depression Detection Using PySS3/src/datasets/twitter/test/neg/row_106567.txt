DisconnectedMost of my life iv felt like i live on a pedestal.  Iv done awesome things, iv been a leader, a member, a doer and go getter.  Iv traveled alot and iv had many adventures. Im putting myself through college, im buying a house, i had the dream wedding. I came from teen parents, we lived in a car, in crappy apartments,  i survived traumas and all the while maintaining the perfect grades. Most people i meet are amazed.  Some of my friends joke that im secretly a god.  They come to me for advice, they want to know how i keep it together, how im always so happy.  I try to give them good answers, and help them through there problems.  I cant tell them that its 70% luck, 20%knowing where the righttime and place is, and 10%effort.
oh i also cnt tell them that i abuse prescriptions, and teeter on the edge of suicide constantly. 

The only thing holding me back: the house im buying.  This house is the perfect size and location.  I will be able to move my brother in. He is autistic and still lives with my terrible parents.  I know hes depressed and hes afraid. I want to give him a place to be safe and comfortable.  
My best friend is also moving in. The location is close enough to his family that he can still be there within 5 min to help them.  I want to give him a freedom hes never been able to enjoy. 

I want to end my life but i owe them that house.  Im always afraid im not going to make it.  My drugs use has just gotten more dangerous. I take more risk.  Im waiting for an accident to take me away. 

I am not the person people see. Im so much smaller and afraid.  My accomplishments are not my own, they were all accidents.
