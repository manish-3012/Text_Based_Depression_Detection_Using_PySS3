What's wrong16 yo here. Long story short, last year during school I began having serious thoughts of killing myself(i had since I was 8-9, but I dont remember much) . I was really dissapointed with myself and my school progress (eventhought I got smth like 18/20). I felt like a failure to life. Barely ever went outside and my only social interaction was within school. During summer, these thoughts completely stopped. I was like "how the f.. could I think of that?". I even went to a therapist to give me a diagnosis for my anxiety, I lied about not having suicidal thoughts, cuz if my parents found out, they would freak out. Now, these thoughts are back and are stronger than ever. I also got rejected recently. I am really scared that I will do something on impulse and hurt myself. What shall I do? (Consider I am writing this a clear mind so I might change my mind later). I can't go to a therapist myself bc I'm not an adult and I'm broke. I also don't wanna speak to my parents. They won't understand anyways. They only care for my grades, so they would say their usual excuse, focus on school, so you get a good job and live life how you want it. I really feel like a failure and want it to end.
Thanks for reading. 
Sorry for bad english
