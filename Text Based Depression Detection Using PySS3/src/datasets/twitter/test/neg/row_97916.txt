Repressed emotions, feeling apathetic but thereâ€™s still an undertone of wanting to die.Title pretty much sums it up. I struggle with depression and BPD. Iâ€™ve been using drugs to cope recently. I feel apathetic and Iâ€™m repressing my emotions. However, I still think about suicide all the time. I feel like Iâ€™m very close to snapping sometime soon.
