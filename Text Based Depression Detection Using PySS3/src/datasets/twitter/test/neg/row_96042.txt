I plan to kill myself in less than a weekIn less than a week I'll be 23 years and 7 months old and I think that's as long as I can go.

It'll also be the week of my late grandmother's birthday, I've been missing her so much and maybe I can meet her again in the afterlife if there is one.

It's a good date since it's not near anyone's birthday or special occasion or vacation trip or finals exam.

It's towards the end of the week so it wouldn't inconvenience people if they were to have a funeral for me, also isn't an obvious significant date which is easier to make it seem like an accident and not planned.

I guess the reason why I am writing this is if this is how my story ends, I would like someone to know my story even if it is a stranger on the internet. Thank you for reading, I really cannot talk to anyone in my everyday life about this.

I plan to make my suicide look like an accident, not too sure how exactly but I have a rough idea.

&amp;#x200B;

The last six years have consistently gotten worse and I've come close to attempting about a dozen times but something always comes up to stop me but I think this time will be it. This year has taken every last hope, energy, will, everything really out of me. I'm four months into unemployment, sent out about a hundred applications, did dozens of online assessments, gone on about 7 interviews, half of which I thought went well but no offers. This could be due to my lack of experience, grades or interview skills but I feel it has more to do with institutionalised racism or luck than the others cause my friends seem to be doing just fine. OR I JUST SUCK.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if I get a job, I don't see how I can afford to live with that wage. I'd be spending half the salary on just getting to work. With the remaining I can barely afford the HPV vaccine and dental work and that's by starving for 10 months. Not to mention the commute and long work hours with no paid overtime. Is it even worth it? If I were to move closer to the city, I'd have less money after rent and now not even affording the vaccine and dental work and I'll be tied down further here when I just want out of the country.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I want out of the country is because I'm a queer POC in a supposedly secular but muslim majority country. I'm not out, I live in constant fear (probably more so my paranoia than anything, I mean I'm in Malaysia not Saudi or Russia), I don't date, I can't seek help from a therapist cause I'm afraid they'd try to treat me with conversion therapy and I just don't feel safe here. I am constantly on r/iwantout but I just don't see how it's possible without money or demanded skill.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been functioning by convincing myself everything will workout once I get a degree and am financially independent. I got the degree but with a lower to average gpa and I'm finding it really difficult to get a job. Getting the degree took a lot out of me and frankly I think it was a big waste of time and money. I was constantly broke and starving, sleep deprived and missed out on a lot of activities and events cause I had no money.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this is my breaking point and I just have no more to give. I've tried every thing I could think of, exhausted every resource I have and nothing is changing for the better. It's not an easy decision to make but I feel it's my best option. I have had to deal with this by myself all while finding it hard to get out of bed, cleaning and getting rid of stuff, coming up with plans to make it look like an accident, worrying about all the ways it could go wrong leaving me alive but dependent forever. It's just a lot for one person to deal with and I just had to tell someone.

&amp;#x200B;

I worry about leaving my sister alone with my parents once I've gone. I worry about the family and friends who'd be affected by my passing but I hope making it seem like an accident would be easier to deal with than the truth. I just want someone to know that I really did try. XX
