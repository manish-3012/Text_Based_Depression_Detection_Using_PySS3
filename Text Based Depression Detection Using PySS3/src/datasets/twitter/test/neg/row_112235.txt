16, depressed, feeling suicidal.I'd like to start by giving a bit of background as to why I'm in the situation I am in now. I grew up with my mum, step dad and younger sister. My step dad was emotionally abusive although he did sometimes get physically abusive. He was an angry, controlling person and he snapped a lot. I always felt like I was walking around on eggshells around him. My mum and him would argue a lot, he would swear at her and constantly bring her down. He favourited my sister and made it obvious (everything was always my fault and never hers, I can't remember her ever getting into trouble by him.) 

When I was 3 my mum left me alone with him while she went out to the shops. He made me follow him into the bathroom where he held me upside down and put my head in the toilet, afterwards he attempted to try and dry my hair off with a towel. When my mum got back from the shops she questioned my wet hair and I told her what happened. She left him after that but as he denied it, she ended up convincing herself that I had just imagined it and got back with him a while afterwards.   

Things just got worse. Growing up I got into the habit of spending all my time in my bedroom, doing everything I could to avoid being around him. I started begging my mum to let me just eat my dinner in my room as I couldn't bare sitting at the same table as him. I was miserable. I used to lock myself in the bathroom and strangle myself, only stopping once I was choking for air. I must have been about 10. I don't know why I done this. I feel stupid admitting it, even to a bunch of strangers on the internet. I remember once he got so mad at my mum that he ended up pulling her into a headlock in public, my mum panicked and was completely humiliated but she just laughed it off to stop other people interfering. He used to roll up newspapers and hit our dog. He turned him into a complete nervous wreck. 

My mum eventually decided to leave him just a few days after Christmas, I was 11 at that point. I thought things were finally going to be better but my mum went into depression and would go on about how much she missed him. He came up nearly everyday for dinner and this continued for a few years. He met another woman and my mums depression got even worse. She seemed to develop an obsession with him. She had a spare set of keys to his house so she went out and bought a voice recorder and hid it underneath his bed, she didn't seem to care that she looked completely crazy. She once cried that he didn't want her and that she felt lonely. I felt like she relied on me a lot and put a lot of her problems on me. 

When I was 13 I started struggling really badly with social anxiety and depression. I lost all my friends and no longer had anyone to talk to. The only person I had in school was my cousin but she liked to bring me down a lot. Everything became too much for me to cope with and I stopped going to school. I isolated myself from everyone and my depression got worse. I hated getting out of bed in the morning. I would wear the same clothes for months without washing them (disgusting, I know.) I stopped leaving the house completely. I needed my mum to be there for me but she was too occupied with my step dad. When I attempted to return to school 6 months later my step dad came over and literally tried to drag me out the door, pulling on my arms and hair while shouting about how I was a waste of space. I went in to school that day in tears. I only managed a couple of weeks before I stopped going again. 

I'm 16 now and things aren't much better. I tried contacting some old friends last year but they just ignored me. I've tried counselling a couple of times but never found it helpful. I'm currently working with someone who basically comes and takes me out once a week and I've also been taking part in group work (only with 2 other people) for my anxiety. Despite the fact that I am doing something to try and help myself I still just feel so incredibly unhappy. My step dad is going to be coming up on Christmas Day and I'm dreading it. Whenever I'm around him I start shaking uncontrollably and feel like I'm taking panic attacks. I can't bare it. My life is a complete mess. I feel suicidal and don't know how I can go on any longer, it's not like I haven't tried. I've been this situation for years now and i just feel so hopeless.
