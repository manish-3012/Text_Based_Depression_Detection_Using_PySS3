I think I'm crazy.I think about what a pathetic excuse for a human being I am all the time. I also think about wanting to die all the time but, I'm too afraid to do anything about it. I'm angry that I'm scared. I don't know what's wrong with me. I just feel so alone and I know I'm not when it comes to this but, I feel like I have no one and it really hurts.
