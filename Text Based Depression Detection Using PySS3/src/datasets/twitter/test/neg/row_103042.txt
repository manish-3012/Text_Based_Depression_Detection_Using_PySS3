Unhappy - Breakup- HopelessI haven't been happy lately. 

First, a two year long relationship had just ended. We were bored and tired of each other, but still hung on for the last few month. She told me that something was missing and I told her I'm not happy either. We have become so close and dependent of each other our relationship. I know our relationship is not salvageable at this point, but losing all those memories and starting fresh seems impossible. I don't know what to do...I feel so empty and meaningless without her. But this is so fucking pathetic as I write this...


Second, I'm not very confident with myself anymore. I'm worried about my future career as I will graduate soon. I'm afraid that I will not be able to find a job. 


I just don't know how I feel right now. Life seems so mundane and pointless right now. And the worst part is I have no one I can let my feelings out to. Whenever I talk to people, I always feel a barrier. I find it hard to truly connect with people now.


What should I do?
