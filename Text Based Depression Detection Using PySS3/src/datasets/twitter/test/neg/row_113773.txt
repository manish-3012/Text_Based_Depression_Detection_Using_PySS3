I can kill myself easily on mondayMy dad has his gun in the safe. The key is right there in the lock. It'd be so easy. So. Easy. I don't want to live anymore. I feel sick. I want someone to save me but nobody cares enough to see I'm in pain. It doesn't matter anyways I guess. I can be gone Monday morning.
