My friend called me a sissy and that no girl will ever like me and it made me realize heâ€™s rightI had an argument with a friend saying I like plants and cooking and I wonâ€™t stop it just because someone doesnâ€™t like guys doing it. He said thatâ€™s why youâ€™ll be alone forever because youâ€™re a sissy and lack testosterone and girls will never like guys like you. They only like assertive and manly guys and will never like you for more than a friend. I was mad at him for a while but itâ€™s true. All the girls I ever liked did the exact same thing he said they only wanted me to be a friend and they end up with guys who are more loud, extroverted etc. I feel like Iâ€™ll be alone forever and I hate it. I want to die because itâ€™s so hard to be alone. Iâ€™m not good enough to be a man so Iâ€™ll take my last manly act to kill my self
