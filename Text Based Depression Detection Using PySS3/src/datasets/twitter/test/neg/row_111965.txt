Back to cuttingI'm going deeper than before. I got a new knife after telling my partner to take my knives because i would hurt myself. Considering that our relationship is toxic, i guess it doesn't matter that i went behind his back and got a new one.

I wanted an xact-o knife but a utility knife worka. It's so much sharper than my pocketknife.

I'm so ashamed and so scared but also so relieved. I can finally make the pain stop. I can finally do what i have to again. It cuts like butter. I don't even have to try hard. It hurts so much to sleep on. I both hate it and love it.

I give myself 30 days. After that, if i don't bleed out or nothing gets better, I'm going to the bridge to kill myself. Because im never getting out of this relationship. I'm conditioned for abuse. I will never have anything better. Death is fine.

Its fine.
