it came in. one more week.half of what I need to kill myself came in the mail today. i will get the other half from a doctor hopefully next week, and hopefully will end it that night. it feels strange knowing that i am truly finally approaching the end. like, if everything goes right, exactly a week from now i will be uncounsious, never to return. 

no more hurting people. no more being alone. no more negatively contributing to the world. 

i can finally be free.

everyone in my life is gone now. anyone who i have considered a friend is gone. im only relevant to a few family members, but i hope that they too, just like everyone else, will realize i was a negative impact on them, and move on.
even if not, im still better gone, regardless of them realizing it.

my only worry is survival instinct. i can already feel it building up. its already trying to prevent this. i have thought about this for so long and refuted every reason i came up with to live. i know this is right. si better not take this from me.

there is absolutely no reason for me to be here.

peace.
