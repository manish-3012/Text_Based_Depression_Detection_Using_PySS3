Update on the status of my previous post from the other night.In case you don't want to check it, basically my friend was telling me that she waa cutting with a knife horizontally on the sensitive side of her wrists and said she might've slit a vein but that it wasn't bleeding too bad. She also said that she might continue to cut and expressed verbally multiple times how she wanted to end her life. She said if she had more of her prescription pills she would have taken them to attempt an overdose. I called the cops on her house and told them the exact same story, and this is my cross post from r/teenagers.



I think she's dead. Her last text was really ambiguous. Thursday night after a little while after I got off the phone from 911, I recieved this. 

"Hey I am sorry but I have to go I am ok now idk what I am going to do with out u I love and I will miss u I went to the hospital they checked me out I just got back home I love u good bye."

I barely knew her 2 weeks, we didn't even go to the same school. She hasn't opened her snaps or replied to my texts. I'm too nervous to go to her house because I'm afraid if she is gone her mom would be a mess. I texted one of her friends who I had contact info of and he doesn't know anything. I don't know if I should call the school or what. I have no way of knowing if she's alive.
