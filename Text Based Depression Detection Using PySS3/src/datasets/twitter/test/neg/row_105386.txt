Tired of the harsh reality of being an adult.I'm not too sure why I'm posting here. I mean I know I'm depressed. Anyone can see that. I think about death (mine in particular) often. Not too sure if I want to die. I've just had a lot of trouble seeing my future lately. I try leaning on my fiance or the few friends I have, but I don't feel like they understand. 

What sucks is I'm a giving person so I tend to their wounds more than they do mine. I'm constantly the shoulder to cry on and the one to call when you're in need. Then I hear nothing from them. I go days, weeks, months without hearing from my so called friends. Until they need something.

I used to have a plan. Everything I wanted for my future was waiting for me and I knew where I was going in life. Honestly now though I can't see my future. 

I dropped out of college because it wasn't for me. Now I'm in the process of a tattoo removal to enlist. I don't even know anymore if I can enlist because my medical bills have piled up so high I can barely breathe. While I've found a job as a full time nanny it probably won't cover my medical bills. I don't know what to do anymore. 

I asked my father for help and he shot me down. The last thing I said to him was, "I won't ask for your help anymore then." To which he replied, "Good, that would make things easier."

I don't know if I truly want to die. It's one of those situations though where everything makes me ponder my life. What the hell I'm doing. If I'm ever going to get out of this mess and be able to enlist.

I want to help people. I want to be a mom. I want to serve my country. As of right now though I'm staring at a brick wall wondering how the hell I'm supposed to get over without a rope.

I'm just lost....
