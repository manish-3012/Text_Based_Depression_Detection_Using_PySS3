Can't fucking take this anymore. I've come to terms with the fact I'm going to kill myselfI am done.  I had enough.  I am a fucking idiot.  I did this to myself.  I just want to die.  Fucking kill me.  I can't go on like this.  I literally have no other choice.  I have no control over this.  I can't keep living like this with the hope that it'll get better just to find out it never will.  Every single second of every day I think about killing myself and how I'm going to do it from the second I wake up to the second I fall asleep.  I have sat in front of the subway tracks and moved away at the last second.  I have put enough Tylenol in my mouth to kill me but only swallowed enough to be bedridden and nauseous for a week.  I have tried cutting my wrists but am too much of a pussy to deal with the pain.  I have sat outside my office window on the 21st floor and have tried to picture what it would be like to jump.

Fuck me.  I don't want to die either.  I just want to get a normal night of sleep.  I just want to be able to function.  I have to learn to live with myself on the days I don't sleep.  I have been unable to do so.

I was feeling depressed as a result of a concussion related to playing football.  On the advice of my doctor, I attempted to take zoloft to help with the depressive related symptoms.  Unfortunately before the zoloft was able to kick in, it fucked up my sleeping habits beyond all belief.  Now I can't stay asleep for more than 5 minutes at a time.  For the entire fucking night.  Every single fucking night.  For 4 months now.  I tried all the sleep hygiene bullshit.  I tried ambien.  I tried exercise.  I tried diet.  I tried all the fucking sleep shit.  Nothing helps. It's not that I can't sleep, it's that I feel so unbelievably fucking shitty on the days I don't sleep that I just want to die..  I can't think, I can't have a conversation, I can't be funny.  What's the point of living if I'm already dead?  What I'm doing isn't sustainable.  Sadly, I'm looking forward to leaving on my own terms.  It's the only thought that I find comfort in.  What kind of G-d would do this?  What the fuck did I fucking do to deserve this?

If I don't sleep again tonight, I am re-upping my ambien prescription and then downing the whole thing with an entire bottle of liquor.  I know it'll be enough to kill me.  I am 25 years old and have no other stresses to attribute this to.  Though I wasn't happy with my life beforehand, at least I was fucking functioning.  Now I am in my office delaying my assignments just so I can post about how depressed and suicidal I am.  There is no way that death is any worse than I am feeling now.  I already feel dead inside.  Just fucking kill me.
