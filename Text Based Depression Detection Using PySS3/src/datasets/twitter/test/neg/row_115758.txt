That horrible feeling when something from the future is brought up and you wonder if youâ€™ll be alive to see it.I already lost the ability to find joy in the things I have today. I donâ€™t have many friends (I pushed them all away). I never had a good relationship with my family. I have no job and no job prospects. And dating with depression has failed me every single time. But here and there I see something in the future and think how nice it would be to enjoy that.

The latest thing is the Fantastic Beasts teaser that came out. Am I going to be alive a little under a year from now? Shit. Am I going to be alive past Friday really. And you ask yourself, is it worth it to get though another week, month, year of suffering just for a movie? I have nothing in my life but a stupid movie to look forward to?

Pathetic.

Any of you have the same feeling? Something you would look forward to if you made it?
