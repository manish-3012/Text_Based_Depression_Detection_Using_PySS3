Do you sometimes feel like if you let yourself believe in God life would be more bearable?My mom is Christian and she always says everything gonna be alright. And so many people I'm friends with on fb believe in God and they seem so content and that God brings them strength to carry on. I feel like if I let myself believe in that maybe it wouldn't be so bad? I don't know just a thought
