Iâ€™m only here because of the feeling of guilt I get for leaving people behindBut how long will that last? Iâ€™ve been living in a new city for 3 years now and I have yet no make a single friend. Sometimes Iâ€™d enjoy doing things alone, movies, eating out, going biking, or parks, but now I just feel so alone, all the time. I have some extended family in the area who I am forced to be around due to work and the little contact I get from them is basically it. Iâ€™ve missed so many days of work these last few months being more depressed than ever, oversleeping even 12 hours at a time nearly each day. I just donâ€™t see any way out of it. Thanks for reading
