No reason to live.My wife hates me and wants a divorce. She doesnâ€™t want to spend time with me and would rather be with her friends. My temper always gets the best of me when she hurts my feelings. And that has caused my children to turn against me. 

I really see no other way at all. Iâ€™ve dealt with depression for a long time now and am just sick and tired of it. I spend days and nights laying in a ball Iâ€™m a dark room praying for death.
