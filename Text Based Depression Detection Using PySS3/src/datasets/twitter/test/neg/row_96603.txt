I am back, and sad.Hey, I made a post a little bit ago, and for a little bit I was doing, better. I got back to school, and finally got into a relationship, and I was happy, I also finally, and publically, came out as a trans woman.

I, like, really had a rough night. These past few weeks, I have been fucking pushed to the limit with school work, and I cried to my boyfriend a bunch about it. It was rough. I put in 36 hours, without any breaks, with a group of people who don't like me, and I got back some really bad grades.

Today, my boyfriend broke up with me. He cut it off, saying that he couldn't be intimate with a trans person, since he was gay. It fucking tore me apart, since I confided in him and he seemed very cool about it. I feel like a piece of shit, because it's my fault. 

My best friend was able to comfort me a little bit and calm me down, and she took my sleeping pills and nyquil, but I feel like I want to bang my head against the wall until I fucking vomit and die. I should have figured, this universe doesn't want me to be happy. Every single fucking step of the way, I get knocked back 5 and then kicked some more while I'm down. I hate myself, nobody can love me like this. I am so sorry.
