People only care when it's too late. I'm sick of everything. This will probably drown in the sea of comments. Please just overlook me.I have accepted that people will only care about me when I'm gone. To me this is just as bad as people who don't care about me at all, kind of like the people in this subreddit.

I posted on this sub yesterday saying that I was going to kill myself. I decided to push it off for another day because it seemed like a chore. Maybe today I'll do it, or maybe some other day idk yet.

I look and I see all the fake humans everywhere. And I cringe. Nobody truly cares. And all of the people that may have a shrivel of care for me, I've pushed away and ruined our bond.

Fake love hurts me way more than any bump or bruise

I should've ended up dying yesterday to be honest. Someone like me doesn't have a use in this world. I don't have any reason to be alive. I've tried soul searching. I've tried looking for a passion. But nothing will ever work. Nothing gives me joy. There's no way out but death. At least then I will be at peace.

But I'm still alive. I still hate that. I'm not good at anything and I will never be good at anything. I don't have the energy to do anything productive. All I do is feed off of other people's lives. My sleep schedule and diet are eternally broken. My mindset can never be changed because I'm a horrible, stubborn human being who cannot change. I don't care about progressing in my life, because I will not get anywhere. Other than deeper inside of a hole. Suicidal Ideation is my only comfort, the fact that I always have the wildcard of killing myself makes me very relieved. Feeling this low and down cannot last forever. I need to end it at some point. And it will most likely end up with my death.
