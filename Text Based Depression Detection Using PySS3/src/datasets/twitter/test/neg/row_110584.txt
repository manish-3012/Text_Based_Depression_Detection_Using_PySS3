Go big or go home.If you want to go out, Iâ€™d go out in the most epic way. For instance, Iâ€™d get a credit card with a high limit and use it to buy a parachute, some rope, a cinder block, and one-way ticket to Vegas. When I got there Iâ€™d rent a fast convertible and get an assault rifle. Id use the gun to shoot blanks in the air near the police station and then drive away fast. Toss the gun out of the car and the chase is on! When the cops tail me into the desert with the news choppers above, my time has come. Thatâ€™s when Iâ€™d put the noose around my neck and tie the end other end of the rope to the steering column. Iâ€™d place the cinderblock on the gas pedal, stand up and pull the parachute. My neck snapped at the end of the rope and my lifeless body is now on TV parasailing through the desert. 

For some extra bonus points, I might set the car on fire just before I  jumped, or write â€œRon Paul 2004â€ on the parachute or wear crotchless fur suit when I did it.
