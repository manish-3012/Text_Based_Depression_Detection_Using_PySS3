I'm so alone.. and finally I've almost got the courage to do it.yeah so I just moved to an apartment, alone.. and it's crushing me and I'm just arguing with the only friend I'm in speaking terms with and he doesn't even care if I die. The only thing is.. I've just got a pathetic amount of pills and liquor here.. and also.. I'm scared, I'm always scared. That's why I'm here.. I tried calling local mental health services earlier today too but their lines were busy and it's too late now.

I don't know why I'm writing a post in here when I should be gobbling up stuff.. I'm pathetic.. I still don't know if I want to do this, but then again I've always been bad at making decisions.. I'm sorry that I'm this pathetic.. I should just go but I find myself here lingering.. lined up the pills and stuff but the amount is just too small to do any proper damage probably..
