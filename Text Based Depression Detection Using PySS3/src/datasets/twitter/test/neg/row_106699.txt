I am worried sick and theres nothing i can doMy ex left me because of mistake i made in our relationship, the details dont matter but what does matter is the things she types on reddit.

My now ex fiance/girlfriend has always suffered from intrusive thoughts, when we were together she tired to OD on pharmaceuticals and she was found with a weak pulse. The attempt she made left her with some minor damage to her memories and i worked with her everyday to get some of them back. Only an intense fight we had brought back the rest.

She is extremely depressed because of her own mental health, the things ive done and our relationship ending. She writes things about suicide and it terrifies me. I want to do everything to be there and help walk her through her problems but she has blocked me, and threatened me with the police if i were to go to her house again unannounced. 

I tried to watch from the distance and worry without intervening hoping that most would pass, after weeks of watching and holding my breath i finally had to tell her i knew about all the different things she wrote and i am worried and i would take her to the emergency room if it ment she would go with me, that back fired and she pushed further away. I want to be her support system but she refuses. Im so hurt with heartache and terrified that i cant do anything.
