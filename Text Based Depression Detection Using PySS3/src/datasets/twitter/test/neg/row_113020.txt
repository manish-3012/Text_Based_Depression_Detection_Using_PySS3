Just to vent?I have people I can talk to about this, but Iâ€™m too embarrassed and ashamed. Also, if I did confide in them Iâ€™d end up in a facility, which I absolutely do not want to happen. Sometimes Iâ€™ll â€œjokinglyâ€ say I want to die, but I guess itâ€™s clear now that Iâ€™m not joking. I tried attributing it to stress from college, from my mom, birth control etc. I just honestly donâ€™t know anymore. I donâ€™t want to get out of bed and the minute I get home all I do is sleep. Today is my birthday and I should be excited but instead I slept all day. Now here I am questioning every single fucking thing. What am I doing with my life? Why did certain friends just let me go without a care in the world? How can my ex hurt me so bad? This isnâ€™t a poor me pity parade, but Iâ€™m really feeling it all today. All I want is the sunâ€™s warmth on my skin and a smile on my face.
