Why shouldnt i, why should i notI'm a belgian student in IT, i am growing up in a family of 7 people.
Theres a lot of stress in our house, money problems have been rising up as well, having trouble supporting 3 kids in college and 2 in high school.
I havent been doing well in school however everyone is expecting me yo do well because of me scoring a high score on an iq test. Everyone is expecting me to do well in school and life. 
Now , im not doing good not because its hard i have never put effort in school because nothing has ever felth worth it or fun and im tired of it.
Since 4-5 years ago ive been having trouble fitting in having trouble with every teacher even tho i never missaid a word , ive got the feeling im a stranger in this house as if i'm not really here either.
For the 
Ast couple of years some days are okay but every so often i feel horrible, espescially at night
Not closing an eye for the whole night, just laying there crying and why.
I've been throwing away life and i dont feel like its even worth continuing.
When i think about the future theres nothing i look forward to.
Studying is shit
After this i will be sitting at a fucking desk for the rest of my fucking life probably, whatever it is ill be wasting every fucking day of my life just as i have wasted my last 20 years.
Every day will be me doing fuckall, and for what , to "live life" ?.
I dont feel like there is a life for me to live or atleast non that im interested in.
Im a burden, i waste my parents time and money i dont feel like doing anyhing in life
If i wasnt here my parent would have thousands and thousands of euros more

I dont want to continue with this, every single day will be miserable as it has been for the last years
