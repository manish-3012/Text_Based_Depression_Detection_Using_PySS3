Help for a friendI have a friend that is having trouble with her boyfriend that sheâ€™s been with for 5 years and has a house with. She has been struggling with depression for just as long but itâ€™s gotten much worse recently and sheâ€™s relapsed on cutting as well. Sheâ€™s going through an extremely stressful time bc sheâ€™s not happy with her boyfriend and is thinking about leaving him. And sheâ€™s been having suicidal thoughts and has been telling me about them. About how she wishes she wouldâ€™ve ended it 3 years ago when she tried, how she just wants it to be over and sheâ€™s done fighting to be happy. She fought with her boyfriend today, then texted me and told me not to tell anyone but she wrote a suicide note today. What do I need to do to help her? I canâ€™t fucking stand not knowing what to do.
