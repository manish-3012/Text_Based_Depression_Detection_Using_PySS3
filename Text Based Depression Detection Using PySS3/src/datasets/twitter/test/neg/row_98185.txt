I have been writing out things I feel. It helped for a while, but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s helping anymoreIâ€™m moody as fuck girl and youâ€™re pressing your luck 
Iâ€™m angry all the time and I donâ€™t even know why
Maybe itâ€™s because I hate myself and just want to fucking die 
Why do I try to go on
I was ready to end this shit two years ago and people told me to hold on
Whatâ€™s happened since then?
Oh a heartbreak followed by more pain 
Why donâ€™t you shut the fuck up and stay in your own lane 

Iâ€™m doing the same things everyday so Iâ€™m confused on what the fuck Iâ€™d be missing out on
They say people will miss you when youâ€™re gone 
Thatâ€™s weird because my phone is dry and I donâ€™t remember the last time I had a good time 
Life is a game that Iâ€™m tired of playing
I feel like Iâ€™m always losing
Iâ€™m the character that no ones choosing
Even my fucking dad refuses to choose me 
People say Iâ€™ll always be there for you
But I constantly feel alone and when I reach out I get shot down
Itâ€™s got me feeling like a damn clown 
And Iâ€™m stuck in this shitty town 
With nothing to do full of people I donâ€™t even like 

If everyday is a new day why am I always feeling the same way
I look up at the clouds and all I see is grey 
Suicide isnâ€™t something I condone 
But Iâ€™m prone, it seems like my only way out
I hope you understand my tone 
This isnâ€™t a cry for help
See I do that shit every night 
And itâ€™s gotten me thinking maybe these nonbelievers are right 
I cry out every night 
But there isnâ€™t an answer in sight 
Iâ€™m losing my damn mind 
Why does the pursuit of happiness have to be so hard
