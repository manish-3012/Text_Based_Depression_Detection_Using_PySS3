I need adviceHello everyone.
So I am in a long distance relationship with a girl. She told me that before we met, she was feeling depressed. Now I fear she is going back to that state. I have no idea how I can help her, we live so far apart. She sent some very worrying messages this morning (how she is just a burden for me) and has not communicated with anyone since then. Please if anyone has any advice at all they could give me tell me. I fear that I will lose her.
