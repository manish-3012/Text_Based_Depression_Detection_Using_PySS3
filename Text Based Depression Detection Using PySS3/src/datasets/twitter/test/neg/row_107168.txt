It's Just Me Against My FeelingsA few months ago, I posted on here that I failed to kill myself. Ever since my attempt I have kept the episode to myself. No one knows. I don't have many friends, and I don't want the few I do have to know just how fucked up in the head I truly am. I don't need to lose anyone else. 

So instead I am just alone. Here with my feelings, and the knowledge that I could have been standing on that far shore away from all of this. Every day is hard for me. And I feel like the weight of my suicidal thoughts just makes going through the daily motions a never ending slog. I feel so alone, and I don't know how much longer I can do this by myself. I can't afford therapy. And meds only do so much.
