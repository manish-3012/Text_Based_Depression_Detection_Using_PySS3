I can't fucking understand anything.I'm so fucking stupid, I can't understand my textbook even though I made notes. I posted her before, and I was right, it doesn't get better, only worse. It's like my life is an endless graph of diminishing returns. I have a final tomorrow and I planned for an all nighter, and I have all these expectations and I can't fucking live with myself knowing I'm gonna let them down. I'm gonna wait till everyone's asleep and take the keys to the terrace.
