Not suicidal, how do I get over sexual abuse?Memories of sexual abuse I suffered in the past resurfaced, it brought to depression for almost a year. I do now recognize the abuse. It's been affecting the way I feel about being masculine. I am straight and it was male on male. I don't want to go farther, but is it possible to recover completely? I am trying my hardest to accept it and move on, but it makes me feel guilty and ashamed. What I can do to completely accept it and move on?
