lost my job and off the wagonI lost my job a couple of weeks ago.  I was 2 year sober and have fallen completely off the wagon.  I was drinking so heavily two years ago that I ended up homeless.  I drank a whole bottle of vodka tonight.  Iv'e been drunk every night for about two weeks straight.  I have $10 tro my name.  I keep listening to Everclear's song Strawberry.  Don't fall down now, you will never get up.  I feel down.  I will never get back up.  I need help.  Struggling with not downing a bottle of pills right now.  I think I need to be institutionalized.  I keep having fantasies about just commiting a crime to get put away for a while.   I don't really know what to do right now.  I can't go through all this again.  I guess I fucked up again.  Please help.  I have no one to turn to.
