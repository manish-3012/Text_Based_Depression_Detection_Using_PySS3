Think I'm just gonna be lazy til my heart stops beating.Seriously. I don't have to move or do anything. My heart's already skipping beats after a week of hardly standing up. It's easy this way. I mean it kinda sucks when I start to feel like I'm suffocating. Maybe I'll have a stroke. I hear people get that sometimes when they don't move for too long. That would probably freak me out a bit more than cardiac arrest though.
