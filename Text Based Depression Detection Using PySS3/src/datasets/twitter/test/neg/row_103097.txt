Will it be too harsh if I block himhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/jlho4g/any_chance_he_might_love_me/

He was suicidal recently.  And later that day he suggested this shit. Anyway he also hasn't talked to me for like 30 hours. I just want to see if he will bother to reach out again or no 

Note- He hasn't killed himself or something from the sort before 2 hours he uploaded on his business YT channel.
