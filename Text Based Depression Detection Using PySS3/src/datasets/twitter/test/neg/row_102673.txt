I can't take it anymore.I'm obese. I'm unemployed. My emotional issues cause me to lose jobs within six months. I've lost the love of my life because I was so paranoid and depressed all the time. The only time I feel okay is when I'm drunk or on drugs. What the fuck is the point of living? I have no degree, no friends. Nobody would miss me. All I want to do is die. If I weren't so afraid of pain I'd be dead but I know a few heroin dealers so I might just arrange my death very soon. I give up. I'm crying as I write this because I know I could've been so much more, but I'm tired. I just want it to end.
