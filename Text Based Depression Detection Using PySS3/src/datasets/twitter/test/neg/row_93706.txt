The EndI iSJDGFThrowaway for obvious reasons!?!?

Ok, so I do not know what I am hoping to accomplish here. I do know that I have less than 0% desire to live.  I can also tell you that I do things like; not wearing a seat belt, taking out the batteries in the fire alarm/CO2 detector, drink poison and make sure someone sees it while pretending it is a mistake (something like antifreeze or too many aspirins, but not as obvious), choke myself unconscious and make it look like I was doing the whole jerk off while choking yourself, and /or lastly doing any 1 of a number of things that (despite how small the percentage) have a chance of resulting in my accidental death etc....  Now I know most of you sick fucks are  thinking the only thing I was really doing was jerking off and choking myself and I don't care if you do, because I know I am being honest and I will be dead by the end of the week anyway.

As I write this, I realize that this is almost more of a general thank you to Reddit for all of those days and nights I went from page to page in order to distract myself from the RELENTLESS DEPRESSION AND RELENTLESS SUICIDAL THOUGHTS that I had as a result. 

I hate myself so so so so so much and almost feel like I have to kill myself before i hurt someone besides myself. I am also so ashamed of how much pain I probably put a lot of people through between my mother finding my first suicide note (directly leading to another new set of lies I have to tell.)  I know how astoundingly selfish killing myself is and I know you could never forgive me, and you don't have to.  I only demand that you all move on, because I was a waste of time, love, money and effort when I was alive and you all know it. I don't doubt that people will hate me after this, but as long as they move on, I am ok with it.  I have had plenty of women, fun, drugs, drinking, sports, vacation, friends, pets, money and more over the course of my life.  

I am not bragging, I only mention the good things from my past to help fully describe why I have no desire to go on.  There is nothing else to live for.  I don't need or want more friends, or more experiences, or more memories, or more help, and on and on. I only NEED to die.  Every day I wake up is now the worst day of my life.  I know I stole that from a movie, but it rings so true that I can't even describe it.  I just cant go on, I just cannot.  No exaggeration whatsoever, I daydream on an hourly basis of how and when I will kill myself and the relief it will immediately result in.  I think I know deep down that this relief may be something I have convinced myself so that I can work up the balls to pull the trigger. No pun intended.  

In conclusion, if anyone ever finds this and figures out it was me.  Tell whoever that my suicide note is under my bucket marked "dog food" but is actually full of bottle caps. Also tell everyone that I love them.  I do love most everyone and I just wish I wasn't so depressed and useless.  And the most important thing, that I know I dont deserve, is the love I always got from from friends and family and, more specifically, my father's love.  if you all figure out who this message is from you needs to tell my father that this is not his fault, not even close.  He always blamed himself for my failures, I know he did, 100% sure.  All he really did was love me unconditionally\\ and try his best to take care of me.  If not for him I would have been dead either by suicide or OD years ago.  My father's love single handily kept me alive for a few more years.  

Mom and Dad - like I said, none of this is even close to your fault and I am certain I would have been dead years ago if not for you.  Your love gave me reason to live and I wouldn't have made so many good memories if not for you.  I wouldn't replace you for anyone in the fucking world.

GF - I wish we knew each other longer, maybe things would have been different. We simply met each other a little too late in life. Your love is amazing along with the rest of you.

Brothers - younger brother please get rid of that permanent sour puss you have on your face. You have to be happier or you will be miserable forever.  Maybe letting a woman or man into your life would give you more of a reason to be happy.  older brother I'm very sorry that I was unable to attend the big day. You have been so much better as of late (as far as our relationship goes) and I need you to continue that with our younger brother.  You have to take care of him and always try and remind him how happy he can be.

godmother - I know how hard it is to lose a dog, but you really have to suck it up and get over it. It's probably been 9 months by now and you have more visible grief than a friend of mine that lost his mother in a car crash. HIS MOTHER! not his 4 year old dog, his mom that birthed him.  And he adored his mother so much.  You need to get another dog or move on.  I know that this is hypocritical coming from me,  but I also think that crippling depression is a much better reason to die.  

In conclusion this is all my fault.  No one thing led to this.  This is years of depression, hatred, blag blah blah. The main thing to take out of this is really to bury me and be done with me.  

Fuck You world I am done with you.  Hopefully there is a Heaven and I see everyone again, but I want to die so badly that I really really really don't care whether or not there is a Heaven. As long as I get to die.
