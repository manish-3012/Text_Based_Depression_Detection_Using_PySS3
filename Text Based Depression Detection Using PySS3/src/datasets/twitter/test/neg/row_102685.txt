I'm just so so tiredHey guys,

I feel so hopeless and unmotivated so sorry if this Kind of sucks?

Since August last year I had to live with Emetophobia (fear of throwing up for those who don't know) and this was the start of all this. Since then, so many bad Things happened. At first I could barely leave the bed because of this stupid irrational fear, now I'm able to go out as well, but my life just feels worthless. It controls everything from Eating (lost 18kg in the last months without wanting to) to even sleeping, going out or waking up. This phobia isn't the only Thing that makes me feel tired. Since then my dear grandma with whom I was really close with died unexpectedly, as well as my bunny. If that wasn't enough already, my stupid brain caught Feelings for my best friend (third time already yo) who doesn't even like me like I do. At first I was hopeful, I thought finally I could be happy again. That Feeling was so wonderful. Finally I was able to experience something other than fear, panic and hopelessness. However, haha, of Course it wouldn't last Long. I confessed and well you can figure how it ended. Now I'm at rock Bottom, one Problem occuring after another and I just wish I could Sleep forever. I wish I would've the Courage to end everything, but sadly I'm a Coward.
