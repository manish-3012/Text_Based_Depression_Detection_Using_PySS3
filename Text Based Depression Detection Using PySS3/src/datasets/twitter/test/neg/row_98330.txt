I want to kill myself, but I can't and this is killing meI really can't take this anymore, my college progress is not showing any positive outcome, my parent keeps pestering me for when I finish my degree, my boyfriend is not even care about my condition, heck even my dad blatantly said to go kill myself.  


I want to end it all, but I don't even have money or place to get the stuff I need it to do it  
Sorry if I look like an attention whore, but this probably the only place I think safe for saying it  


Thanks
