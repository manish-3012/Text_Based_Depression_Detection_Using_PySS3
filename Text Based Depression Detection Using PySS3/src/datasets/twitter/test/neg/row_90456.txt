I am a shitty teenager and I want to kill myself. I need help.Hi. This is not my first time on /r/suicidewatch and it won't be the last. I have tried to commit suicide almost 3 times, and I failed all of them, unfortunately. I am only 17 years old, yes, I am "young". Why do people feel like that just because I am young, I should want to live? Because I surely don't want to.

Why should I want to? I had a shitty childhood, shitty everything. I am just a 17 years old, kissless virgin who likes videos games and anime/manga. I have no one interested in me. I am probably mocked in my back. I am not interesting. 

No one is ever interested by me. Of course, it's not the only reason I want to kill myself. Life is just painful. I just get hurt and hurt others. I am not useful, and even when I am, no one cares. No one gives a flying fuck. 

Please, give me reasons to not kill myself. I already know I won't experience love, I am literally unlikable, I will probably be alone and single, also dying alone. I don't want to live anymore. Destroy me. **Erase** me from existence.
