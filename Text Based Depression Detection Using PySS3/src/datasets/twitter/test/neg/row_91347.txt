I started cutting myself today. And I told my mom. She didn't care.I've been breaking down regularly due to harassment and bullying for the last 5 months. I have started to lose everything I'm good at, from sports to subjects. I got my results back today and I just couldn't take it. I couldn't do anything. I keep breaking down every day when I come home. I've reported my harassers to administration but nothing is happened, only that the people who have been constantly harassing me were told I made the complaint. I don't know what to to do. I just don't know. I dug the sharp end of my metal ruler into my skin and I drew blood. I broke down on the phone to my mom and she came home half an hour ago. I told her everything that happened today, even showed her my cuts, and she just said "I don't understand what you are getting at" over and over again. I finally just burst into tears and told her that I was suicidal. She told me to stop "throwing big words around". Im genuinely at a loss. She doesn't care, the teachers don't care, no one cares. What am I supposed to do?
