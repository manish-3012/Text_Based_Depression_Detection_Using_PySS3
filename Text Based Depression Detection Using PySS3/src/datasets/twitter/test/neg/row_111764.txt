I know this sounds spoiledBut I canâ€™t get a car. I live in a car city Los Angeles, Uber is expensive but with my line of work, Iâ€™d rather not volunteer the info, I have shit to lug around with me and I have to Uber to work most times. They donâ€™t care that I donâ€™t have a car. Iâ€™m 19 I donâ€™t give a fuck about going out now, Iâ€™m a joke on reddit anyway and in real life. Thanks everyone for listening
