half suicide attemptsanyone else do things they know are dangerous not as an explicit suicide attempt, but hoping to die anyways. for example, i took about ten benadryl once. i knew it could kill me and i was hoping it would, but i wasnâ€™t specifically trying to commit suicide yet. i do stuff like this a lot. is it normal?
