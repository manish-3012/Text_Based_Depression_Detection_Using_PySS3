what do you guys do?Iâ€™ve had severe chronic depression for years and although iâ€™m always passively suicidal, every now and then something will come over me and I just wonâ€™t be able to take it anymore. It becomes all I can think about. Iâ€™m actively trying to find ways and methods to end it. I tried to slit my wrists earlier on impulse but the pain was too much to continue. I have been in bed since. I have work tomorrow morning and iâ€™m going to lose my mind. I canâ€™t seem to distract myself. I canâ€™t get my mind off dying. I tried watching netflix or reading but I canâ€™t enjoy anything. Iâ€™m in so much emotional pain and I donâ€™t even know why. Everything hurts. 

what do you guys do to calm your mind and find a little peace while going through something like this?
