A note to all struggling survivorsIt's been a while now, but once upon a time I was on the verge of committing suicide. I could've done it, but I held off because of what I called 'cowardice.'

That wasn't cowardice. Today I can look back and see that it was always hope. Not in clear form, but more of a 'what if' kind of thing. If 'cowardice' is keeping you from going through with everything, hold onto it, because it's the most valuable thing you have that can turn everything around for you.
