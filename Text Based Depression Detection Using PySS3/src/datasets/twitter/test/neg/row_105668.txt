To pussy to end itMy life's feeling like falling apart but I feel like a piece of shit because it cod still be worse and I'm still thinking about ending it. School's really stressing me out, I got no plans for the future and have such a shot temper, that I was nearly smashing my phone, because it couldn't take a screenshot. The only relationships I were in were shit and toxic and I still want to be with someone, even though I perfectly know that a. It wouldn't fix any of my mental problems at all and b. that probably now one's gonna start a relationship with me because I'm an interesting sack of sh*t. I'm still to much of a pussy to end it, so I can just wait, until I finally got the balls to do it.
