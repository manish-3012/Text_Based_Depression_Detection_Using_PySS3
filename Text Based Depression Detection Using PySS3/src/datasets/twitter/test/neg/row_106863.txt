I am submitting to the thoughts once again.I have never posted here before, but under other usernames I have tried to encourage others. Tonight, however, I need encouragement. For the past 8 years I have dealt with depression, self-mutilation, an eating disorder, and suicidal thoughts. For the most part I have ignored them for the past two years. Lately, however, I can't stop them. I feel like they are eating away at me. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm too old to call and wake my mom like I used to. I don't have anyone to tell these things to. I just want everything to end. Similar to 2 years ago, I don't want to wake up again. I just want to stop being. I feel so worthless and helpless and stupid.
