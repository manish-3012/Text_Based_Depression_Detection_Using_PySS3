I want to end it all, all alone, nothing to live for. Being alive IS hell17 y/o here. I have been depressed and hopeless for almost my entire teenage life. My parents don't really give a shit about me, and I hate my mom for letting her alcoholic boyfriend abuse me when I was 11 or 12. At school I have mostly no friends beyond simple "acquaintances" who I say hi to and leave. I have a lot of trouble talking about my emotions to people in real life, and I often drive people away from me. This summer I had a group of friends who I hung out with frequently, this was the only time in my life where I have ever felt accepted and loved. The girl who I love only wants to fuck stupid tinder guys, and she leads me on because I am worthless. I'm so much of a retard I fucked things up with everyone and now I truly am alone again.

Everyday I wake up I feel as though I am being tortured further with the weight of being alive. I can't stand the thought of living another day on this dejected planet where I am nothing. Unwanted is all I am. I wish I wasn't filled with so much rage. I've tried counseling, I've tried pills but there's nothing that can be done. I am hopeless.

At school all I can think about is how much I hate everyone around me, and I get strong urges to self harm (hitting my self, cutting, beating my head on things). I know that if my life continues like this I will take my life. I hate living in my own body. I just want to be loved and love everyone but I never will get any of that. I want to be free from myself and my mind, I want to at least feel some love or something good before I die.
