I hate my race 

I don't know where else to talk about this.. I hate my own race. Only recently I found out it's called Internalized Racism. I blame it on the religion ruining everything.

"We're a retarded backward hypocritical inhumane race.. we're losers." I blame Islam and whoever made sure to implement it and keep it going for political reasons.. the brainwashing.. the idiocity.

My own people make me ashamed! They're an embarrassment, wherever they go! It's because of their undeserved and illogical pride of being f\*cking Muslims and the chosen people for speaking the holy language of the holy Quran.

They think they're special. Chosen. Lucky.

The entire Arab race disgusts me.

Why did we have to have this dry, extreme, and invasive religion..

I'm in love with this amazing western man. But I'm afraid of having kids. I don't want to pass my genes, culture, or make little beings join a game of "we're muslims okay?".. what am I supposed to tell them? "We claim we're muslims so dad could marry me! we have to pretend we're still muslims because we don't wanna get killed"??

What if they sense my racism and hatred? What if I alter their sense of self? What if I damage them by mistake..? What if I cause them an identity crisis?

I'm sorry if this is boring and/or irrelevant.

I think I'm looking for.. similarity? I just want to get it out of my mind. Do I even make any sense...

Tldr; I hate my own \[Arab\] race because of how influenced my people and my culture are by Islam. I found out that's called Internalized Racism. I'm scared of having kids and passing my inferior genes and cluture and having to lie about their religion for our safety.
