Pretty severe suicidal ideation but I don't think I'm even depressed.Pretty much every night for the past week, while I've been falling asleep, I think about killing myself. I don't even feel depressed right now. I've always been depressed, and had suicidal thoughts, but more along the lines of "I wish I didn't exist." and always thought of suicide in the abstract almost; never something I'd ACTUALLY do. I feel like maybe I've just been normalizing suicide in my mind for the past 5 or so years.

Tonight I managed to knock the cup over on my nightstand while I was asleep. I threw a towel on it and tried to go back to bed. Ideations hit me hard af. I seriously thought of driving to walmart, buying &gt;!a utility knife and cutting my wrists.!&lt; I was almost crying because I wanted to die so bad. I kind of want to buy one and sit in my bathroom and think about it. Maybe the seriousness of the situation will dissuade me? 

I don't know if it's the stress from school, but honestly, during the day, I almost feel happy. Content at least. I put pressure on myself to get all A's this semester, which will be hard, but I don't think unrealistic. I have a huge problem set due in my class tomorrow probably worth 10%+ of my grade that's only half done. I'm 24 and still live at home. I quit my job to go back to school full time. I've given myself "permission" to kill myself if things don't work out in school this time, because I feel like it's my last chance.

I don't know what to do. I have no job and essentially no money. I don't have insurance so I don't think a therapist is an option. I'm a college student so there's my schools counselling services, but I'm honestly afraid to talk to them because I don't know how they'll react to what I have to say. Honestly I'm not sure what the point of this thread was. I really just ended up rambling about nothing.

I guess if anyone has any advice on who I can talk to or if you've felt alright during the day, but you're overwhelmed at night.
