Alcohol and a bullet... What a comboI've suffered under depression for as long as I can remember. I'm 29 now, but this bullshit started before middle School. My mother and father divorced shortly after I joined the server that it's Earth. My mom cheated on my dad with a worthless price of garbage, and my dad walled up like China, I was raised into this situation where, no matter what I did, someone important to me said it was wrong and that I should do better.
