A nihilistic approach to lifeI have posted this as a comment and would like to reinstate this in a post.  Please look at your desire to live closely. Its very likely infinite and futile. Futility of your desires depresses you but the often ignored infinite aspect of it is what drives us through the worst and the best of the days.  More money, more plans/family for immortalising your being after your death, more people to acquaint and stuff to learn about.  Neither your worst nightmare nor your *lifelong* dream would fulfil or diminish this. You will wake up the next day wanting more, no matter how long.

I am not saying suicidal feelings are a lie.  I know you've been hurt tremendously or you feel you've hurt tremondously. But if you could come to acceptance with the infinite aspect of your desires. Out of sheer vigilance. A vigilance in vanity.  Like you have just born and you just see/sense stuff like a newborn baby.  You have successfully upgraded yourself from suicidal to depressed, in the least.  

There is a haven between your grief/rage and outright despair/refusal to listen to your calling to live.  A coward, an asshole, a depressed or even an insane being isn't a dead person because it can be a "f**k the world" than just "f**k me".  Let the world show a sign of apology and correction.  Let it show a sign that your desires are still sought and could be fulfilled to some extent over and over again.  Let it show the real culprits who have fouled your being into guilt.  You came in this world without bias for anything and you deserve to go off without one.  

Just look around quietly and wait for a contradiction in this imperfect world.  Its a matter of time. Good reason behind the fact that this sub is called **Suicide Watch**
