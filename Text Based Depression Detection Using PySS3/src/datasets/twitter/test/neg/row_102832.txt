A very close friend with a CWP keeps threatening to commit suicide when he's drunk but then belittles my concern when he's sober. I'm scared for him and don't know what to do.I'm (24 F) really panicked and could use any advice. I'm going to try not to babble on too much, but I need to get this out. 

He's 29 with a steady job and recently bought a very nice 2 bedroom house. He has a ton of friends who love him unconditionally and a very fun and loving family. We have been dating on and off for about 2 years, and while we're not currently together (long story, but mostly because I'm moving across the country for school in a few months), we are extremely close and are very open about how much we love each other. In short, on the outside, he has everything going for him. But on the inside, he's clearly hurting and as far as I know, I'm the only know who knows about it.

It doesn't happen all the time, but about once a month he'll get extremely drunk with his friends, goes home, calls me, and has a complete meltdown while threatening to commit suicide. Regardless of what I'm doing or what time it is, I always drive to his house (about 30 minutes away) to be with him to keep him safe. I am in no way proud of this fact, but the most recent time I risked a DUI to get to him. But it only takes a few seconds for him to load his gun and pull the trigger, so in that moment I don't feel like I'm given a choice. Fortunately it was 3 am and I was essentially the only person on the road, so the only life I was risking was my own. Still, this has crossed a line that I simply cannot handle anymore.
All of that is stressful in and of itself, but then when he wakes up sober, he not only acts like nothing happened, but he questions why I would bother driving so far in the middle of the night to see him. When I gently explain what he said to me, he cuts me off (usually laughing) and says, "You should know I would never *actually* commit suicide!" I don't let him see it because he's obviously self-conscious about these meltdowns, but it does hurt that he almost makes me feel stupid for overreacting to his supposedly "empty threats". And I really don't appreciate anyone implying that a suicide threat shouldn't be taken seriously. 

The first time it happened I considered calling the police, but eventually decided against it. I discussed the thought with him the next morning and he got extremely angry and made it very clear if I ever did that it would be the last I ever heard from him. I believe him, and don't want to take the risk.

I don't know what to do or how to talk to him about this. I leave for grad school in just a few months and am terrified about what will happen when I leave. He gets very defensive and dismissive when he's sober and he completely shut down when I suggested a therapist. I feel like I'm just not talking to him about this the right way, so I am hoping someone here can help me out. I'm desperate.
