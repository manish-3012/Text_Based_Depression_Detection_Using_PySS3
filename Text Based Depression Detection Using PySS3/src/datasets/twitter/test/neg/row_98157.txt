no motivation leftItâ€™s currently finals season and Iâ€™ve already completed 3 out of 4. But I donâ€™t even know if I can pass 2 of the courses. I used to have goals, like going to dental school but now I know I will never get there because of how shitty my grades are.

I canâ€™t afford to fail 2 courses and I panic everyday waiting for my final grade to come out. I feel so unmotivated everyday, and just tired.

Iâ€™ve had a panic attack almost every night when I try to study because I donâ€™t know how to do it. My parents donâ€™t believe that my mental health is deteriorating, and they donâ€™t believe that depression is real or serious. I donâ€™t know how to get it through to them.

I dont have the money, and frankly just scared and anxious about seeing a psychiatrist. I donâ€™t know why but Iâ€™m afraid of being judged more.

Iâ€™ve thought about suicide so many times but instead I just self harm. I donâ€™t know what else to do. There are days where I feel like life is completely meaningless and since Iâ€™m gonna did anyways, why not sooner...
