A Year Thatâ€™s Felt Like My Life.On July 28th, I will be turning 21 years old. I was clinically diagnosed with depression when I was 14 and only recently had it completely gone away. Iâ€™ve felt rather happy, free of thought- it all felt like normalcy with my mental state. But it feels so foreign to me as I have evolved into a more significant version of myself.

The past two years have traveled in hyperspeed and everything has felt so short lived and rapid like the shutter on a camera. I havenâ€™t been able to live and breathe in each moment to itâ€™s true potential. I would argue and say that itâ€™s a post-high school crossroad Iâ€™ve been stagnant in. The past two years have felt like a glitch in the system- being my life and development. Unlike probably everyone I know or not, Iâ€™m freightened to turn 21.. Iâ€™m not ready and Iâ€™ve lost grip from the train of life and itâ€™s hundreds of miles ahead of me with having nothing thatâ€™s enough to close the gap. I feel the need to â€œmove onâ€ if you will... Iâ€™ve been referring to saying â€œpass myself awayâ€ instead of suicide because I cannot bring myself to say that is what it is, this time. Yes, when I was 15 I attempted and got freakishly close to succeeding. In its own way has this not been summoned by depression or thought as suicide, just a â€œmove onâ€ scenario in hopes of creating a place for myself other than here. I titled this thread the way I did because I think ALL of us have felt as though weâ€™ve lived through several lifetimes in 2020. 

all i want to know is when the world is put out of its flames
all i want to know is why our kind experience these trash mental complications
all i want to understand is the importance of life and why itâ€™s worth living until a natural death.

iâ€™ll be around... i canâ€™t say how many times iâ€™ve thought about passing myself away and never succeeding. this will probably be another one of those times- unfortunately.
