Why does everyone hate me?Someone that said they love me and care about me threw me away and lied to all my friends about what happened so now they all hate me. I am tired of the pain and suffering of people constantly telling me they love and care about me then throw me away like nothing. 

Nobody seems to care that I am around or want me around.
