Can't take it anymoreI just want someone to take me out of this misery. Every time I try to feel better, something always come and makes me feel worse. Not even drinking is helping me feel better. I don't want to be here anymore, it's not worth it. I feel like a failure to my family, no matter how much I try to make them happy, I always find someway to fuck up. I can't even focus on school like I want to. I want to disappear and not even tell anybody where I'm going.
