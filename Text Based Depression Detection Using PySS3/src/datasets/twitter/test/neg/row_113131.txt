Do antidepressants actually work?Iâ€™ve been changing my meds a couple of times and it seems like it doesnâ€™t really make me feel any different. I still get suicidal thoughts and my PTSD still happens even when taking the meds. I know I should ask my doctor to increase my dosage but Iâ€™m wondering if meds do even work. It seems like eating good food or going outside works better than meds idk
