Stuck at work because I can't trust myself not to drive off a cliffI'm so suicidal today and it's only gotten worse. I managed to get through work but I have an hour drive home and that is way too many opportunities to drive my car into/off of something. I want to be home in bed but I can't trust myself to get there. I don't know what to do.
