41 f niOthing left for meYa Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m too old to start over. Too young to not care. Broken marriage. I inlove with someone who treats me like crap. Always alone. And people say it gets better when you Leave an unhappy marriage. It doesnâ€™t. Youâ€™re just alone with your thoughts instead of the misery distraction g you. Iâ€™ve googled painless deaths so many times now itâ€™s not even funny. Donâ€™t tell me to live for my kids theyâ€™re practically grown. Iâ€™ve done my fill. I want out.
