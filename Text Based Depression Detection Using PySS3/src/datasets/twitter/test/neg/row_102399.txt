I don't know what I can do.I've been suicidal for six years. I don't want to hurt my family so I haven't even made an attempt, but I've come very close several times. First I had a complicated plan to drown myself with two fail-safes just to be sure, then later I considered finding something tall enough to jump from, but now I think if it ever comes down to it I'll just take off my belt and hang myself. I can do that just about anywhere. It scares me how easy that would be. I'm not afraid to die, I just don't want to hurt people.

If I really wanted to kill myself I wouldn't be typing this out. But still I worry that eventually I'll have an exceptionally bad day and decide that it should be my last.


REASONS TO KILL MYSELF:

-I am almost 25 years old, living with my mother. We get along very well but I'm sure at some point she will want me to be independent and move out. I feel like a burden.

-I have serious issues with anxiety that have kept me from being comfortable around people my entire life. I am deeply introverted, not shy. If I could figure out how hermits can afford food and a house I might not have any problems.

-I self-diagnosed myself with Asperger's Syndrome/Autism Spectrum Disorder (and am ashamed of being considered a faker for not having an official diagnosis). I almost cried when I realized that I possess nearly all of the traits associated with ASD. Now I understand myself in greater detail but that doesn't make life much easier.

-I have no job, no car, and I quit college because the social demands were giving me panic attacks. "It's not what you know, but who you know." Well I've never been good at knowing people. I would like a job, but I can't find one that doesn't give me panic attacks. All the good introvert-jobs are being replaced by machines. I've considered volunteering so that I can feel like I'm not a burden on society but I can't even muster the strength to go to school. How am I supposed to help people if I can't even breathe when I'm surrounded by strangers? 

-My one and only passion is something I can't make a living with. I make music, but the music I love is on the fringe of what people consider to be music. I like the kind of music that gets labelled "pretentious" or "not music". I couldn't write a pop song if I tried, and if I did I would hate myself. Popular music is just awful to me. There's a small niche for my kind of music, but it's very small. Unless the radio starts playing avant-garde noise, my passion is just a hobby.

-I feel like the world is very hostile to people like me. I'm not normal. Yes, I've heard every possible variation of the idea "there's no such thing as normal" but that's a lie. The world is more accommodating to people who are average. Money, sex, love, adventure... none of those things appeal to me. I don't like pop culture or sports so I can't really relate to anyone. My wants and desires are alien to just about everyone I meet.

-I'm weak. That's what it boils down to, I'm simply weak. The world scares me and I have no idea how to navigate it. I want to be a functioning, independent adult but every attempt I've made leaves me more depressed, anxious, and suicidal.



I guess I should see a doctor but the last thing I want to do is financially burden my mother any further. Of course, I'm sure she'd rather I not be dead.
