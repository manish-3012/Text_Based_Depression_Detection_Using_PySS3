Just a question. If itâ€™s in the wrong format/place/etc. just (kill it) remove it I guess:
When does ones right to die interfere with ones right to not to live through it? Think free speech. You can say whatever you want but I have a right not to hear it? 

If someone really wants to be gone how do we cope with that? Before and after? 

Drunk and rambling. Thank you for listening.
