How do I kill myself or my parents? There seems no inbetween.My parents have been emotionally abusive since I can imagine. This led me to cutting myself, hating myself, internalizing all the hatred. Also a big thing: clinging onto other things for love, such as cats. They gave my cat away to an asylum and made sure I could not get it back. Iâ€™m heartbroken. This is the last straw. 
I feel like itâ€™s either me or them. I canâ€™t take the belitteling anymore, the â€˜Youâ€™re stupid, we canâ€™t trust you, you are nothing like your siblings.â€™ What do I do? I love my cat. But he is lost. Iâ€™m panicking and cutting. Please help.
