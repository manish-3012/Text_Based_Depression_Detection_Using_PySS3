What Now?Iâ€™m not sure how to go about it. I donâ€™t want to make my sister and brother sad, but I canâ€™t do it anymore. They won't understand when I do it. They donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to feel this way. I have no money. Iâ€™m struggling so bad I donâ€™t even have food to eat. I have $9.21 in my account until Friday, then I will have to pay bills and have no money again. What kind of life is this? Living pay check to pay check. I work 40 hrs. a week and go to school full time. Iâ€™m exhausted. Even so, I have been looking for another job but I canâ€™t find anything that will allow me to work around the other 2.     

I hate myself. I have no friends, none. I could die and no one would come to my funeral except my siblings. Our mom died 2 years ago and I really miss her. Sheâ€™s was the only one who ever believed in me, loved me deeply, and supported me. She was my best friend. She never said but I think she knew. The way she would always point things out â€œIsnâ€™t that sweetâ€ referring to a lesbian couple shopping together. I always rolled my eyes and never saw what she was getting at. I didnâ€™t know until a few months ago. I finally realized she was telling me it was ok. Iâ€™m still confused and I donâ€™t know what to do. My family is homophobic and would never understand. I know they love me but they would never understand. I didnâ€™t really believe in a god, but I thought, maybe if I was really good in my life there was a way I could see her again. So, I got super religious and turned to the lord. I didnâ€™t feel like I was living my truth and stopped, religion is just not for me. Iâ€™ve been trying to hold on even after. My whole life has been me just hanging in there, waiting for it to get better. It hasnâ€™t. I try for my mom because I know she would be proud of how far I have come, but I canâ€™t. 

Sorry for the poorly writing story Iâ€™m fighting back tears. I really donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m depressed and I canâ€™t take the struggle anymore. My siblings have given me a lot already and I donâ€™t want to ask for more. What now?
