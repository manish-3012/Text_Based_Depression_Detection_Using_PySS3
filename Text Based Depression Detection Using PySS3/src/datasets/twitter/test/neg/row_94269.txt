I just don't know what to doI feel so lonely. I can't find the motivation to study for my exams (which I desperately need to do) because I'm stuck in the same routine of doing a set list of things that keep me occupied long enough that I don't kill myself. The worst part is that my life isn't bad enough to warrant these feelings, I live a fairly average life with a stable home etc. unlike many people on here, but I don't even feel sad, just not connected the world and people around me.

I've never had a partner, although I want to I don't seem to have the motivation to find a relationship. My parents constantly remind me of this fact and I don't know how to explain to them my difficulty in finding a relationship. Moreover I (stupidly) fell in love with my best friend who I know will never reciprocate that love.

My future is completely uncertain because even if I could motivate myself to study then the chances are I'd end up at university (which I think would make me happy in the short term) with insurmountable debt and no guaranteed job. If I don't complete my studies then I'll certainly end up in a dead end job and I have the potential to lose the friends I do have.

Although my current friends are all really nice to me I don't always get invited to things because I'm quite reserved and probably don't add much to the conversations they have, why would they keep inviting someone who has nothing to contribute? I also feel as though I have been left behind in terms of the fact that all of my friends are in long term, happy relationships and I'm being held back from achieving a relationship by my love of my best friend and my lack of confidence.

I'm sorry for the wall of text.

TL;DR I'm not all that sad or unhappy, I just feel that life isn't worth living because nothing makes me happy.
