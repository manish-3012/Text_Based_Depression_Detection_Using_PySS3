Diabetic suicideI deal with depression, it's ebbed and flowed over the years. At my lowest I connected the dots; I could kill myself easily with my medication, I'm t1 diabetic, and nobody would ever have to know it was suicide. 

(Brief aside, the suicidal stages:
1- desire
2-planning
3-gathering resources
4-action)

Knowing this is a such burden. Before not having a method devised made it harder to not kill myself. Anytime I feel stage 1 it's harder knowing exactly what stage 2/3 are.  And I'm afraid to talk to others about this because I don't want my medication management stripped away because they're scared I'd do it. And if I really wanted to kill myself I COULD DO IT SO SO EASILY and PAINLESSLY, and nobody would think of it as suicide. 

I'm feeling burdened, apathetic  about life hopeless. And just bits of stage 1. I'm not going to kill myself, I've always bargained with myself to give it a year. Yet I'm struggling just knowing how easily I could do it whenever a suicidal thought appears.
