Physical pain is about to be overwhelmingI'm already struggling with physical pain in my abdomen and I don't know how much longer I can handle this. I've been 'sick to my stomach' for 8 months. I've had a stabbing pain after eating for 10 years.  I have a pain in my lower abdomen if my clothes are too tight or randomly throughout the day. My stomach and throat sometimes feel on fire. Sometimes I feel like my stomach is full of rocks. Sometimes it's stabbing pain, throbbing pain,  or overwhelming tightness in my throat and abdomen. It's all kinds of different pains and the only way to avoid it is to not eat. I don't feel good. I'm scared of food.

I have drastically changed my diet. I don't eat anything high in fat. In fact I won't eat a food unless it's less than 5% fat. I don't eat a lot of food at any one time. I don't eat anything spicy, even going so far as to cut out bell peppers and ginger. I don't eat acidic food, including strawberries and tomatoes. I live off of mostly mashed potatoes, crackers, cheerios, and apples. Rarely more than that.

For a while cutting things out of my diet made me feel a little better. In February I gave up Alcohol. April I gave up fast food. Then soda, spicy food, acidic food, anything with a lot of citrus. No more milk. Every time I cut something I would feel better for a bit and then the pain would creep back in. Now I'm at a point where there isn't really anything left to cut out. I've already lost 28 lbs since May. I weigh 110lbs now. My stomach is still kinda 'swollen looking.' That's not to say I think it looks fat it just randomly protrudes more or less on different days. My legs and arms have lost the most mass.

I don't know what to do. I've had tests done on my blood. I've had x-rays and ultrasounds. They don't see that anything wrong with me. If nothing is wrong... what do I do?   


I don't want to live like this. What if this is forever? Am I doomed? A friend of mine killed himself after living with a chronic condition and I now understand why he did that a little better.
