I feel like I can't handle this anymoreI don't know who to talk to or what to say anyway. 

The only reason I can't actually go through with it is because of my boyfriend and my dog. Sounds stupid, but it's true. 

But they're the only things that even matter to me now, and I feel like I'm letting them down when I spend the entire day crying and on edge. 

I can't handle my new job, I can't handle the 500 different things my boss is asking me to do because no one else in this startup company has a fucking clue what's going on. I'm working from the time I get up until I go to bed, and I'm swamped. I'm broke, trying to move, stressed out. 

And everytime I drive to work I just want to run off the road, make it an accident. I feel like I can't go on anymore. 

I wish I were dead. Just to make everything stop. And I feel so alone saying that. :/
