I'm done. I just can't anymore ðŸ˜”I've reached my limit. I've waited so long and tried so hard to make things better, and my life is only getting more and more unbearable.  
My psychologist dumped me saying he can't help me.  
My new one saw me for over session and said she isn't qualified to deal with me. 

I told my ex-boyfriend that I had been harming tonight (he had always known I struggle with it) and that I am seriously considering ending my life... and he went to bed. 

He knows I've tried before. And succeeded, to an extent, until I was interrupted.  

My father, who was arrested a few weeks ago for getting violent, left a blade on my pillow.  

I don't even know why I'm posting. Maybe someone online might at least acknowledge that I existed and that I tried so damn hard. I just can't anymore. I'm sorry.
