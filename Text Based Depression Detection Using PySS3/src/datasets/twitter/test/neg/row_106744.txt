Tell my therapist?How the fuck do I tell my therapist Iâ€™ve attempted like thirty times. I want to tell her Iâ€™ve been actively suicidal for the first time in weeks for a whole week but I donâ€™t want her to break confidentiality (she will because of my past).
I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m able to tell her about taking unnecessary high doses of ibuprofen either. Which is with suicidal intent, I just canâ€™t bring myself to do it. (1200 mg within 3 hours)

Help. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore I have nobody to help me because my parents think Iâ€™m getting better and my therapist will get concerned and say something.

I canâ€™t go back to inpatient. Thereâ€™s a high chance Iâ€™m going to residential if I do. I will run away if someone tried to take me.
