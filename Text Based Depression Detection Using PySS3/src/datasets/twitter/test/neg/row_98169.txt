Nine months pregnant and want to dieHonestly I just donâ€™t know what to do with myself. Me and the dad rushed a relationship and me moving in bc I had nowhere else to stay. We hardly knew each other and I got pregnant within months because my birth control failed. 

I really donâ€™t want to stay with the childâ€™s father, I donâ€™t love him and itâ€™s not fair for him if I stay with him. Iâ€™m currently not working or getting unemployment bc of the virus. (Dr told me NOT to work, as did the babyâ€™s dad and my mom for months so I stopped, but bc it wasnâ€™t forced no unemployment)

I just want to leave but all the babies stuff is here. I donâ€™t want to be a burden to anyone. I canâ€™t afford my own place let alone for my dog or child. I donâ€™t have the earning capabilities at all. Iâ€™ve always worked low paying jobs bc Iâ€™m not worth more in the job market. Tried college like four times and Iâ€™m just not smart enough to pass. 

I donâ€™t think I could live with myself if I took off and didnâ€™t take the baby. Iâ€™m not sure where I would even go if I did take off (Iâ€™m not from the state I moved in with him at) or how I would take care of myself. I figured I could just go with the baby to a homeless shelter to the last state I lived in and try to go from there, but that would be cruel bc the dad makes good money and the baby has everything he needs here. 

Iâ€™m not depressed, but I feel stuck, worthless, and that I have no way out. I donâ€™t want to be a burden on the dad or live without my baby. Ive always struggled with suicidal thoughts and I think it would be easier for the baby if I killed myself now and he just never knew me. The dad makes more than enough to care for him and I think he would be a good dad.
