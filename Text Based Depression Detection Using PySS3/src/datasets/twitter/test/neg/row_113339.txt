I can't stand being alone at nightI don't know why. I'm 22 and when I try to sleep alone I start feeling uncomfortable and it passes into panic attacks. Sometimes it's do bad, that I want to stab myself.
I try to find girls on bars and clubs and bring them home so I can sleep, but today I got no one and I'm scared that I will do something to myself.
