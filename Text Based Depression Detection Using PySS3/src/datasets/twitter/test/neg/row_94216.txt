What opioid/opiate is the most painless when ODing?Been hearing a lot about accidental overdoses on opioids within the entertainment industry. So I was curious, when dying because of an opioids overdose, is it painful? If someone wanted to take their own life, what opioid would be easiest/quickest/most painless? And how much would you need to take? Fentanyl? Is anyone familiar with â€œpharmtrusted .netâ€? They sell Abstral (fentanyl sublingual) â€“ is that the same thing?
