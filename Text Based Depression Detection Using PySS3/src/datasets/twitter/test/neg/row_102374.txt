I blew it...I've been depressed since I was in middle school, but I managed to push through somehow. But somewhere in the last six months or so, I've been having thoughts of suicide more and more frequently, to the point where I'm thinking about it almost constantly even at the smallest thing. Dirty dishes are piled up in the kitchen? Maybe I should just die rather than deal with it. That kind of thing.

But today I really think I hit rock bottom, and I'm so scared.

The one thing that fulfills me and that I take pride in is my job. I was fortunate through hard work to get a decent job even after screwing up my college career irreparably. But I got a steady desk job with a great team, where I'm challenged, where I've been able to push myself and where my skill set has really helped the team move forward on a new software transition we've been undergoing. My job is my lifeline because I feel like it's the only place where I really have any control. I stay at the office long after everyone else has gone home, just so I can engross myself in work that much longer and not have to face anything else.

A promotion opportunity opened up last week, my direct manager resigned, so of course I sprang for the opportunity. I'd put my name in for other promotions in the past, but I never really held my breath. But this time I was so confident, I had so much hope, because this was my field, which I knew better than anyone else, which I already knew I had the tools to be successful in. The outgoing manager praised me up and down recommending me for the position, and I thought I aced the interview with the department head. I guess I didn't.

I just don't know how I can get out of bed and go back to that place tomorrow. I feel humiliated that I'll be working under someone who knows so much less than me, who I'll be essentially training to get up to speed on our clients, our product, our procedures, and everything. Ashamed that I ever told my friends and family that I was going for it, because now I have to explain why it didn't pan out. Most of all, angry at myself for daring to believe for a second that I deserved any of that.

I don't know where I go from here... I've put so much of myself on the line and it wasn't enough, and I don't know how much more of me I have left to give. At what point is it okay for me to say I tried, I did my best, you can stop fighting now and just give up? I think I've given it a good run, all things considered. I tried running from it for the past few years but in the end it caught up to me, the truth that I'll never get my life together, I'll never end up proud of myself. I just want to stop running for good this time and let it swallow me whole.
