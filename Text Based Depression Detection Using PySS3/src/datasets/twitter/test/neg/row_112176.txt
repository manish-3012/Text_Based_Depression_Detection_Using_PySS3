I called the Crisis Team today.Everything is too much. I wake up and immediately I feel sick and anxious and overwhelmed with dread and despair. My CPN is away for two weeks, I've run out of sessions for therapy, and I just quit buspirone. I called the Crisis team because it's been a week non-stop of constant anxiety and uncontrollable crying. I guess I was hoping they'd send someone out for me to talk to, but instead a woman on the phone advised me to make a cup of tea and do something nice for myself.

I know I live in a rural area. I know the NHS is stretched thin. But I feel like I'm drowning and I just wanted some support, and I can't even get that. I can't keep living like this. I want to die. I know there's no miracle cure, and I know I can't keep taking Lorazepam to take the edge off, but what am I supposed to do?
Everything is too loud, too much, too scary, and I'm just so, so tired of living like this. It's been 10 years, when am I allowed to just say 'enough is enough'?



Any tips on what to do? I can't even get out of my front door. I've been meditating which helps for those few minutes, and I'm trying to keep distracted but it's just overwhelming.
