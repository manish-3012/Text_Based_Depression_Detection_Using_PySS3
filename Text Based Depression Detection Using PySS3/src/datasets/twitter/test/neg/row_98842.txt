What is the point?Sorry for a depressing 1st post but what is the point of life? I am alone and haven't left the house or spoken to anybody for over a year since my mum died. The only speaking I do is to my TV. I am slowly gong insane and as I live in the UK a gun isn't an option.

I have been reading up and the easiest way seems to me to and pretty much 100&amp;#37; success rate is an exit bag, painless and no risk of me ever being caught. You just slowly go to sleep. I have ordered everything and it will be arriving hopefully on Tuesday. 

Has anybody you know used this method?

Thanks for your time

crossy
