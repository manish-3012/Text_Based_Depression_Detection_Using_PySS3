Sigh my body is so broken. My mind is dull.I cant sleep at night.
When i sleep during the day it could be for 2 hours or 14.
My dad wants me to have a bedtime of 12 but my body wont fall asleep.
I always feel so groggy.
Im a disappointing child, i had to leave school from being afraid. Im stupid and ugly.  Cat run or do sports, im not smart enough to do anything important. All i do is sleep eat and watch videos.
The only thing i can do mildly successfully is draw but even then its shitty
But im just and edgy teen, right?
Theres nothing wrong with me, right?
