rollercoaster ridei get hope. lost hope. happy again. lost everything. my life great two days ago. now i am thinking of selling my bed or something like that, just so i can survive. also, i am just bad at everything. nothing really makes me happy. and no family or anything like that. 3 minutes ago i considered going to our local bridge and just jump down but then i thought of the pain and trouble of the outcome. i just donâ€™t understand why live if you donâ€™t enjoy it?
