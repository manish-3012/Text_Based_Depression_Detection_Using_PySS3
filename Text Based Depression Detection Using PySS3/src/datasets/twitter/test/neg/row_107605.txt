I just saw a post asking â€œIf you committed suicide a year ago what beautiful things would you have missed?â€. I canâ€™t think of a single thing.When I saw that post it stopped my mindless scrolling instantly. I have been thinking for almost half an hour now with no luck. Even if I think of the year before that. Although I have been suicidal in the past with many attempts, that was so long ago and I didnâ€™t realize I still felt this way deep down. 

This last year has been be laying in bed day after day other than the few times a week I go downtown and waste my whole cheque on heroin. I guess I havenâ€™t felt like dying because Iâ€™ve been so focused on being high. My mom refuses to let me outdoors alone for more than 5 minutes because she canâ€™t trust me to not go downtown and pick up.

I considered finally dating my best friend of 4 years as a thing I would have missed happening, but if Iâ€™m honest, the relationship felt off from right when it happened. I donâ€™t have the heart to tell him because I do love him, but now after years of him being clean heâ€™s relapsed again (shooting heroin and popping benzos). Itâ€™s only been a week and he has already ended up in the hospital. Iâ€™ve been wanting to break up with him but now heâ€™s in a bad place and I feel stuck. Heâ€™s one of the 4 people in my life that I actually talk to. The other 4 are my family members.

My dad is across the country with his girlfriend and we rarely talk even though he reaches out. Itâ€™s the first year he has ever not gifted me something for Christmas or my Birthday, which are only a week apart, and it made me terribly depressed sitting at home with his gifts never opened and now stored away in my closet with all the other junk that doesnâ€™t matter. I know my mom is disappointed in me and so is my grandmother who, the same as my dad, I canâ€™t seem to get myself to call back or message. I have no friends. I am alone and broke and unhappy.

This all came out of nowhere. I donâ€™t know what to do. I have been trying so hard to get in touch with a psychiatrist but my office just ignores me and Iâ€™ve already called and gone there begging over 15 times in the last 4 months. There is too many things wrong and I canâ€™t solve them all. Every time I told my mom about being suicidal in the past she would get angry and call me selfish, so family is off the list of people I can talk to since they tell my mom everything. My boyfriend interrupts me when I tell him Iâ€™m depressed and goes on about his own feelings, so heâ€™s off the list too.

My mother wonâ€™t let me leave the house alone at all either, so I canâ€™t get away from her unless I want to leave for good. If I do leave, she will kick me out and not let me back inside, which would force me to stay god knows where. I know that is illegal since I pay rent and sounds crazy but it is only because she fears I will run downtown and pick up heroin. 

Unfortunately, all that is on my mind is getting high. If I do, Iâ€™ve got no home unless I go to treatment and there are no options for that currently with this virus that I can think of. Even if there was, I canâ€™t commit. Ironically, drugs are probably the main reason Iâ€™m not dead yet and why Iâ€™ve been so distracted from realizing I was still suicidal.

Iâ€™m feeling a million emotions a minute and I have nothing to stop me from making the â€œwrongâ€ choice. Iâ€™m sorry this story is so long, I just want to be as detailed as I can so if I do end it, Iâ€™ve left at least something behind. Everything else is dirty and messy and worthless. I feel that I deserve to end things after all the rape and abuse and hatred Iâ€™ve had to deal with in my life. I REFUSE to believe it is a selfish thing to do anymore. 

Iâ€™m so, so tired.
