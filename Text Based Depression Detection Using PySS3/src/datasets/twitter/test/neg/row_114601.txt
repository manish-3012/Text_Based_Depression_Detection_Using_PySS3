i feel like iâ€™m losing everyone i lovei feel like me and my girlfriend are getting further and further apart, all my friends are doing stuff together without me, iâ€™ve been home sick so i havenâ€™t been able to see anyone anyway. iâ€™m getting worse and worse everyday and i donâ€™t know how to stop it. life has just become something iâ€™ve begun to loath. i wish i could kill myself without it having an impact on anyone. i wish i could feel the sensation of hanging from a ceiling.
