Doing it to stop hurting othersI have an anger issue, and a carelessness issue. Usually I can keep both of them in check, but there's been a perfect storm between events insider and outside work. I keep escaping by having unrealistic violent fantasies about the people I run into. I hate living in the city, everyone is so fake and out for themselves. I fear that one day I will lose control on another, so maybe it's just best to take care of myself first.
