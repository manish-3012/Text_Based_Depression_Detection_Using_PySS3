Quote"Went from the chosen one to an outcast, unforgiving. And all the Hennessy and weed can't hide, the pain I feel inside you know, it's like I'm living just to die. I fall on my knees and beg for mercy, not knowing if I'm worthy, living life thinking no man can hurt me. So I'm asking; before I lay me down to sleep, before you judge me look at all the shit you did to me; my misery. I rose up from the slums, made it out the flames in my search for fame, will it change?"
