What should I do?This is a pretty dumb question, I admit. But I'm not sure what steps I should realistically take in my situation. 

For example, I'm not really in pain. People talk about how the folks who really commit suicide are in great pain. And I can't claim that. So full disclosure, I'm probably not a problem.

That said, I would like to know what I should do with myself. I find little value in my existence-- there really is no enjoyment from life. I'm having trouble understanding what I should do with my future / life, etc. What's the point? Folks often say "there is no point. Just do what you think is good and right!" But again, that holds no motivation for me. 

I guess I'll try to cut this short. What it sounds like I'm saying is that I don't really have a reason to die, but I wouldn't complain if I was dead. (for more than the obvious reason.) 

So, what should I do? Should I talk to someone? Just find some drugs? Is this what therapy is for? I can't really think that I'll have money to spend on such things. If that's the case, and life has no value or meaning, logically I should just check out, right?

tl;dr: cliche depression post. contribute if you like. (and p.s., yes I've certainly considered a few methods)
