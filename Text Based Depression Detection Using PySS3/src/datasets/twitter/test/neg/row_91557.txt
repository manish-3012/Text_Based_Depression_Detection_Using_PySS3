I just dont see the point anymore.I been suicidal for almost as long as I can remember, I'm a lonely college student, I don't really trust my.                   "Friends" I barely hang with them and I don't trust their motives (before anyone calls me paranoid I have very good reasoning behind this) I don't really have no one but the folks. I don't have any motivation, I just don't care anymore. I have no hope in humanity all I see is evil hypocrites, I'm no better than my worst enemy. I know it's gonna happen soon, I don't know what in waiting for. Maybe I'm just living on the small remaining amount of hope I have. I don't know how much longer till that runs out. 

I been thinking of writing a book about my philosophy and thoughts on humanity, reality, pyschology, and life before my departure. But it's just a thought
