I don't want to live.It's really just that. I'm 18 and I don't want to live. I don't enjoy living. I want to be with my girlfriend but we're seperated by thousands of miles right now. I can't afford to see her. I try for jobs everywhere but I can't find one. I want to kill myself but that would hurt too many people. 

If I was truly alone I would probably have offed myself by now. The only reason I won't is because I don't want to hurt anyone. My girlfriend would be devastated and so would my parents when they found out. I also have an 8 year old sister that deserves a good big brother.

I really want to kill myself but I couldn't because of all the harm I'd cause. I won't kill myself, I just don't want to live. I don't like telling people this because I'd rather them think of me as a happy guy. 

I don't really know why I'm typing this out now but I wanted to vent. It makes me feel a little bit better.
