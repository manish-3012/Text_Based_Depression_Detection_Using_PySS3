I feel bad, sorry...I don't even know how or where to start all of this. All of my emotions are stirred up. I don't even know what to feel anymore except of continuing being depressed about it.

... So, I am now currently a little envious of my friends. Starting of that I am a failure. Back in June, I've completed my IB Diploma programme, where I was sponsored and able to continue my study abroad if I met my sponsor's requirements. Yet, my results were bad and I'm unable to pursue my studies overseas. That's fine by me. The thing that kinda bugs me is that how I felt left out from my friends who were able to get great results and met their sponsors requirements. I felt like I was pushed away. 

I then mostly chat with those who are in the same boat as me, but not until recently, sort of. Now, most of them had already continue their studies in local universities. One of my friend had even did so without telling me at all. It make me feel alienated, like unwanted, like this is a proof where I can convince myself of how of a useless kinda friend I am. 

I guess being useless is like a trait. Every day when I'm feeling such a way, I always recalled back that moment when I was 12 y/o. I didn't get an excellent result back in my primary school final exam, causing my dad to  hate me. Even so, my family went for a holiday at the end of the year. I was twelve when this happened. Unfortunately, I smashed a ceiling light accidentally with a stick at the place where we stayed (I was kinda swing the stick while imagining like I was one of those guys in front of a marching band). The light piece was really expensive, I guess. My dad went mad to the point that he shouted at me something that I didn't cared at all back then, but as I grow I realized that it had left a permanent scar inside me. He shouted that I shouldn't have been born, that he had asked my mom to abort me even before I was born, that he know something disappointing like this would happen, etc. bla bla.

Now almost 10 years passed since then, I still remember those words. But now my dad and I don't really have a conflict. We sometimes talk (not really, since I was mostly listening), but not that much. He was mostly busy doing other things while my mother is working to feed the family. Yeah, as cliche as it is, we are that type of family that looks happy but is actually kinda broken. Maybe? Meh. The more I think about it, the more I want to hang myself up in a noose. 

Just to make things worst, I'm a closeted gay because it's against my religion, and being gay is a crime in where I live. I sometimes wondered that living in Pakistan would be better since I can at least become a Hijra. No, I know that I prefer men but I must hide it for the sake of name, and it's not really a big deal for me since I should just stay closeted. But that's not what really pushing me towards depression. The sense of needing to keep this upon myself that I think is actually making me feel suicidal.

Since I was small, I always had the tendency to hide my problems from others. Even when they forced me to tell them my problems, I always ended up telling lies or cover ups so that they would think I am ok, I am fine. Even most of the time, people just told me to tell them if I had problems, but no. I kept it to myself. It always comes to my mind that I shouldn't disturb other people with my problem. Enough of what they had to handle on their own. But  then, here again, showing how foolish, hypocrite, selfish, and egoistical I am. 

I can't handle this pain much more. Hearing people telling to go see someone is easy but they never really knew how hard it is for that. How hard it is to be trapped by my own mind, to only bear my problems alone, hiding it even from those close to me, feeling alienated just because I'm quiet. I cry alone most of the time for thinking about these stupid silly things, wanting for this suffering to end, but I can't. I'm weak. Worthless. Useless, as I am. 

Sorry for this long rant. Sorry for taking your time. Sorry for everything. But, thank you anyways.
