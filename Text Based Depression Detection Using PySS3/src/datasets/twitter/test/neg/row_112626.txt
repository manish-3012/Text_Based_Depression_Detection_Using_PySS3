Help(M/20)Over the past few weeks everything in my life had fallen apart, but after being cheated on for the 4th time by the fourth different girl today Iâ€™ve given up. Iâ€™ve reached out to people Iâ€™ve tried to get myself better but everytime I am almost out my life falls apart again and again. Iâ€™ve been dealing with this inherent madness for years and nobody has even given me a passing glance. Iâ€™m not quite sure what I did to deserve being treated like absolute dog shit because Iâ€™ve always tried to help people Iâ€™ve always tried to be nice Iâ€™ve always tried to make people laugh. In the end tho it really doesnâ€™t matter because nobody will ever reciprocate the same level of compassion or caring towards me because itâ€™s me and nobody not even my â€œfamilyâ€ gives a fuck. All I ever wanted was for somebody to reach out and say itâ€™s gonna be alright youâ€™re a good person donâ€™t let those demons get to you cause they will only bring you down. But I canâ€™t even get one word of encouragement from anybody around me they all brush it off like Iâ€™m not worth it. I guess nobody will miss me if Iâ€™m gone after all they couldnâ€™t even spare one kind word. Iâ€™m sorry to whoever had to read this because I know how stressful it is to help people in this predicament but know that by reading up to this point youâ€™ve put in more effort than anybody thank you for trying but Iâ€™m too far gone. Nobody loves me and nobody gives a shit either and no matter what I say or do I will never be able to change that.  Family means nothing considering that Iâ€™ve been beaten kicked out shamed manipulated and used as a tool all by the same brother sister mother and father. Friends only ever talk to me when I talk to them lol I guess when I disappear this time they wonâ€™t ever have to hear my annoyingly loud voice or look at my disgusting face ever again. There have also been way too many people that have acted as fake friends in my life. Iâ€™ve done therapy and all that did was make things worse so Iâ€™m just a lost cause that has nothing to look forward to in life and if I look back all I can see are my nightmares haunting me. Girlfriends; Iâ€™ve never had a relationship last more than a month and Iâ€™ve been used and abused in just about every relationship and time and time again they will get sick and tired of me being depressed and end things because I am depressed. Thereâ€™s no reason to live anymore since Iâ€™m in college with no idea what I want to do with my life and Iâ€™m thousands of dollars in debt that will take years to pay off. There really is no point to living thank you for reading this and with any luck Iâ€™ll still be alive tomorrow.
