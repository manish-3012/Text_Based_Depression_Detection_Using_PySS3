Heartbroken....16 y/o south of spain

After 2 years i've finally managed to get out with my crush we have been for over 4 months almost 5 already, what i didn't know was that she was suicidal, just because of me... i went to her place had a cute time hugging each other and that but she went to the bathroom i realized that her diary was on the desk i couldn't help myself i had to take it with me, and i rode it all....

&amp;#x200B;

learnt out she had been suffering to be with me for also some years, she really liked me and didn't want to lose me on the last pages i rode that she was that kind of person that gets tired of others fast even if she doesn't want to and some pages where you cant even see whats written because they're full of tears except some things that i could read were:

&amp;#x200B;

can't image not being with him , we probably wont last long because i know myself i will get tired of him and suffer even more than these years of wanting to be with him, nothing makes sense anymore i should't even be here...

she didn't realize i rode it all since i took it and brought it back the next day,

&amp;#x200B;

now everything makes sense she's been really sad lately can't even hug her im really worried and she doesn't admit she's sad, she is all i basically have , the only thing that wants me to wake up every morning call her talk with her, be with her

i guess this will all take an end the only person ive truly loved, im just constantly thinking of her crying 24/7 when im home or just alone i dont want to end this but its coming closer everyday the only person i can truly tell the truth to, someone im not scared of talking to asking for help anything this is just coming to an end and there is no need for me anymore just cant take it anymore
