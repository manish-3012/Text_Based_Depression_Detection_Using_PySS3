I hate my body and face.Thatâ€™s pretty much it. I hate them so much I want to kill myself. More so my body. Itâ€™s so disgusting, I wish I could take a kitchen knife and just carve my body to look like a model. Everyone says that looks donâ€™t matter. Lies. Iâ€™m 20 and have never been in a long-term relationship unlike my friends. All my friends are so pretty. Iâ€™m ugly. I feel myself going into a mental breakdown as I type this. I fucking wish I could take the sword thatâ€™s in my wardrobe and just fucking stab myself until I die.

Sorry for the rant. I just needed to get it off my chest.
