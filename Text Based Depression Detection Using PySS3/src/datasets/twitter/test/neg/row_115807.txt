Considering suicide...Iâ€™ve got enough of living as a whole. My grades are beyond unacceptable, and Iâ€™ve got mental disease (Aspergerâ€™s, to be precise).

I donâ€™t feel like thereâ€™s hope anymore...

Iâ€™ve got a rope ready to strangle myself. Just asking for some support, otherwise Iâ€™ll hook it onto myself and then kill myself.
