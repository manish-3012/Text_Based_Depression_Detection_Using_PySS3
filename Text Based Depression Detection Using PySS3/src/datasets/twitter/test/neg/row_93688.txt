I want to die. I have nobody who would care. I could do it guilt free.Iâ€™m in pain ALL the time, Iâ€™m in so much debt, I canâ€™t afford rent anymore, I go to sleep alone every night, there is no chance I will start a family, I have nobody I can talk to, Iâ€™m conditional to everyone in my life, Iâ€™ve caused death and deserve nothing but death, my death will have no impact lasting more than a few days, nobody depends on me, nobody would miss me.

I just feel bad ALL of the time.  I want it to stop.  Last month I tried walking through traffic with a blind fold, now Iâ€™m thinking of just hanging myself in my fucking closet to just get it over with.  I promise the world will be a better place.
