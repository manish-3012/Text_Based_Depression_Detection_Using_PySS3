DisposableI've been having a lot of suicidal ideation, and I don't think I'm gonna act on it, but I'm worried I'm on a bad path. I just came here to say what I'm too ashamed to tell my "friends". I feel disposable. I feel like the girls I love could never love me. I feel like a monster. I feel so very lonely. My friends either forgot to invite me to their most recent get-together or chose to leave me out. I feel like I should isolate myself so my friends don't have to expend the mental energy to hang out with me and my cringe-worthy depressive mood swings.

Things have been getting worse. I've been smoking weed more to try to calm my mind but I have to take long breaks because I'm in the reserves and get drug tested. I've had depression for many years but things have steadily been getting worse. I've tried meds and therapy and they've helped but not enough.

I don't even know if its true blue depression. It's like my mind can't reconcile how I want life to be with reality. I cling to fantasy and escapism to avoid drowning in my own agony, but it's slowly becoming less and less effective.

I feel empty and unloved and inhuman and all I have left to make me feel alive is my university's boxing club. Sparring and turning all that negative energy into power in the form of violence is cathartic and therapeutic, but It can't fill the void where love should go. I've never had a long-term (or short-term either, really) relationship so I don't even know what that would feel like. I dream about what I think it might feel like sometimes.

I take my first competitive organized boxing math in February. I keep thinking that if I win, I'll unlock some part of my brain that will allow me to shape my reality into my dearest fantasies, but I've had that hope before about other things like when I joined the army and when I lost my virginity. I'm terrified that once again all I'll feel afterwards is emptiness. I don't know how much more disappointment I can take before I snap.

I'm sorry for rambling but I guess the main takeaway is I just wish I could look in the mirror and see somebody worthy of both attention from his friends and love from an intelligent, confident woman. I know I'm not entitled to either, but I wish I knew how to earn it.

P.S. I just wanna say all you guys who take time out of your day to comfort the posters in this subreddit are really cool people
