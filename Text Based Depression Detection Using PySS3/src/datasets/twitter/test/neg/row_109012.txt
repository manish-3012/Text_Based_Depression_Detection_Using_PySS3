Gimme a hand?I'm a young man just looking for an outlet. I don't believe I'm depressed. Just very enticed by the idea of committing suicide.  Kinda wanna know what some one out there thinks about why that's a bad choice.  I'm pretty lonely, demotivated, lost. Suicide has become a fantasy for me and a pleasant one at that.  If you are interested, I would prefer a PM. Message boards give me the jeebies, I just wanna talk one on one. 

Thanks for your time.
