174 days of being a Shut-In. Failed Suicide last night.After being cheated on, abandoned by parents, lied to and used by college friends and failing courses from mental health. I shut myself out.

All my connection to this world is gone. I'm living off savings, now with only 483.36 in my bank account - not even including student debt!  I'll be homeless in the next month with no phone, shelter, wifi or anything. My therapist closed my file so I can't go back. 

This is it. I haven't ate food for 2 days because I tried to keep as much money there as possible. I'm 23, and afraid of everything, scared of everything and I couldn't even kill myself - I just threw up all the pills.

No one fucking cares. They only used me and left when I'm used up. 

I'm going to use a rope this time. For sure. Fuck. I'm so scared.
