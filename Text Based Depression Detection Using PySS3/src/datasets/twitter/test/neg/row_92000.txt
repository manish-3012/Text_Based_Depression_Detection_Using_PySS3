Anybody want to be "Don't Kill Yourself" buddies?I'm dangerously code to procuring an exit bag, and I think it may be a good idea to regularly talk with someone who wants to keep going but is close to the edge. I know for sure we'll have being suicidal in common, so we could start our new friendship with that! ðŸ™ƒ
