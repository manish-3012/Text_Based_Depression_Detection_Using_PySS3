Rant, feeling lost and needing advice and struggling with coping mechanisms and not to harm my selfTw(mentioning of misandry, reddit, quora, I am not like the other girls-phenomenon, physical, mental, emotional abuse, failed tryings for suicide, feeling lost in general and have read a few articles on how to handle the problem but did not improve much so I thought redditors who generally have more knowledge than me might help me

I will try to be short
So i used to be on reddit but i had some problems with some woman and 3 redditors basically told me to fuck off. I was in a pretty bad place mentally and told her that she had a perfect life compared to me and basicaly peolle told ne to die and that i am an asshole and should leave reddit. Altough one person on reddit and one person quora told me the same thing and told me how just because they went through molestation or rape and how their trauma is more important and valued than mine. 

I have had bad experiences with males, from kindergarten, to middle school and the hell that was high school i graduated from, and also my father who can be insensitive jerk at moments, these things in my life are physical abuse, emotional and mental as well as stalking from classmates. This made me suicidal and still to this day i am suicidial. Males made me feel like the ugliest woman on earth and abused me. Problem is that my mother has had cancer for a while and is crying, i am failing with tests and she always talks about how she wanrs to see me with children. Males have abused me. To me they are ugly, emotionless and rough and their dicks are ugly(i know cause for some reason when i was a minor sometimes i have encountered men who send me nudes and think they are cool) plus no one has had crush on me or was my boyfriend while those who were ugly in middle school glew up in high school or glow up now in college. 

I know how people will say that i am young but i have been suicidal since 4th grade but only started to try to kill my self ever since 10th grade to the point where my parents noticed. In my life i grew up always to be the nice girl and i do not understand how my classmates who did bully, harass and commit crimes were somehow liked and okay by the teachers but if i say "fuck" once everyone snitches on me, the world is ending, i am somehow worse than hitler and deverse abuse.

I am also the victim of mob mentality where i find it hard to make friends and boys jump on me, make me the common enemy and abuse me until i go away from that school and go to another, I have always been more mature than my peers but the adults in my life who are clearly stupid and blind did not see me as mature all the time

I feel like i have wasted my life, the only thing that is keeping me sane are my books and a few youtubers, i have had pretty lonely and rough childhood and i do not imagine my self as a bride cause the males where i live are dumb, rough, mostly curse and watch the stupid football(i hate sports because the bullies like sports so therefore sports are bad, plus i was never good at them, plus the people who harassed lgbtq and mentally ill people watch them so i did not want to be a bad person like them, the only thing i was capable of was running)

Hating boys/men only harms me. I isolate mt self and do not go anywhere unless my dad forces me to go out with him, my summers are not romantic and cool. I used to envy some girl cause she had the perfect life, only one girl bullied me in high school badly. Idk, boys just hated me even if i was a tomboy, why would anyone from the disgusting gender that only makes me cry want me as a bride. Men complain how they hate bitches yet are dumb enough to gravitate towards them. I do not want to marry but i do not hate the idea of being a wife with kids, problem is the man with his dick that will go inside me. I have thought about being a lone mother but those are subject to more abuse and laughter as if they were left and forgotten on the shelf or are some trash, I guess i wll just have to pretend to love some stupid persom with a dick and give birth and die, cause i no way in hell would love these stupid and emotionless people with the dicks.

I guess my fear turned into anger but the chances of me getting raped, hit or made fun of by males has always been higher in my experience since always boys and men make fun of me but only one or two girls have made fun of me or attacked me through out my whole life. That says something. You are going to argue that not all men are asses but they make me feel ugly cause apperently beautiful girls are never bullied and people have blamed me for my bullying and how i could not beat up all of them with my scrawny body. Even if i do(some girls i know did) they were punished or put into another school for "apprent violence".

I do not know. I hate men/boys and how they make fun of me, bully me, send me nudes, make me feel undesired and ugly, and tell me to "go on and die" 
In real life those boys/men who try to be nice to me do not understand why i act agressive or bitchy and just either give up on me or attempt to punch me, cause that is all males do. I know i sound like a stupid man being rejected by some girl who did not give him a quick fuck but ugly males are accepted,they are like the norm, but no one likes ugly girl. I am not ugly, it is just that I do not look Instagram worthy-which is the standart where i live-full lips, full on make up, perfect eyebrows, double Ds and full ass - cause apperently males like only one type of female, I thought men had a type, some like blondes, other brunnetes but that does not seem to be case where I am ((European poor country))

I know many of you would be salty but if you think you can insult me just know that i have heard every possible insult by now so save it, i am not looking to cause problems but for a solution since this male hatred causes problems on my mental health and daily life, i will even stop thinking about dating cause i am alwaus that ugly forgettable friend that is not even the second but the last option for everyone and the only boy that kissed me gave me a disease and i was too eager to get kissed in high school to finally be cool and not bullied and he later told the girl bully everything we talked about and his friends to laugh at me. 

I want to kill my self every day but i know i cant since "That is the right answer" i try to no longer harm my self and try to wash my teeth/body/clean, it can be healing but i tend to forget. I still cry my self to sleep because of my mother's cancer, tests and my trauma, i feel like it will haunt me all of my life, i do not even have 20 and i feel like i lost ny life, my life has been so boring and bad and i, i dont know. I havw thought about becoming a youtuber but do not want my bullies to see me. I do not know what to do.

Ps. I am better with my hygiene now but still struggle since in the middle of high school i completely stopped washing and eating. I try to love my self and even improve my self daily but sometimes the suicidal thoughts and memories get to me and i get the urge to take a knife and kill my self. Or buy poison, cause I know ever since I was 10 that no one would miss me.
