I don't know what to doI don't know what to do, I feel so lonely, I am wounded emotionally and physically, and when someone ask about my condition, I have no other option to lie, they would not like to hear my problems or how I really am, nothing seems real to me, do really people appreciate what is inside?, I feel we are in a massive human market, a liquid modernity, people receive validation from trivial things and they like it, the love to maintain the big lie and they support it, which fills me of thoughts related to vengeance, but at the same time makes me feel extremely bad, I do not want to hurt others or try to discuss with them, I always get insulted because of this, despite being respectful, despite they are doing bad things they are never going to face concequences, I do not believe in god or destiny which leaves me with this certain distaste where I know they are probably going to leave more and better than me, without any kind of regret, while I am here suffering because of my powerlessness, and I get to the point where If I kill myself I will let them win but at the same time If I remain with life, will I be able to get things better? I do not really think so.
