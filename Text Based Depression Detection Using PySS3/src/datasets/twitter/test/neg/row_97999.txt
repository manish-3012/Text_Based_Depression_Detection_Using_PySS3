Beautiful peopleBeautiful people don't have to sew their arms back together and wear long sleeves.

Beautiful people don't have to cut all their hair off because they couldn't take care of themselves.

Beautiful people don't have to sleep on a couch or the floor bc they are afraid of their bed.

Beautiful people have clean homes.

Beautiful people don't have to fight a panic attack just so they can walk outside the door.

Beautiful people don't have to convince themselves nightly "not tonight, put the pills down".

I am not a beautiful person.
