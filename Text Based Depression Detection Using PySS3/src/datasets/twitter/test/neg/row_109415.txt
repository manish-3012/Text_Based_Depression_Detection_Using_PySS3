A lost cause of a human searching for peaceWhen I was 8, I wrote in a notebook that I wanted to kill myself. My parents found out and sent me to a therapist.

Now Iâ€™m 18, Iâ€™m supposed to be partying,  enjoying my freedom and do whatever I want to. 
But Iâ€™m just laying in bed all day, fighting against my depression and anxiety for the last 10 years. The only one that keeps me company is the heaviness on my shoulders. 
My days are filled with anxiety attacks, crying and harming myself.

Iâ€™ve though about suicide a lot the past 10 years, but Iâ€™ve always told someone to save myself. But lately Iâ€™ve been planning my death and felt peace with it. I know I want to do it. Iâ€™m just afraid of the pain.

And people always tell me: â€œyouâ€™re still young, youâ€™ll have so much that youâ€™ll miss.â€

But what will I miss? My depression is 98% chronically, Iâ€™ve tried every kind of therapy this crappy world has to offer. So Iâ€™ll probably miss a miserably 60 years.

And maybe I would find someone if Iâ€™d stay. But I donâ€™t see any point of life. You live to die. End when you die, all your actions are literally forgotten by 99.99% of the world.

Yesterday I talked with a suicide-hotline. And after talking about everything, even she was helpless. 
And I realised: ending it is the right option. Itâ€™ll give me the rest Iâ€™ve been looking for for SO freaking long.

On one side Iâ€™m sad, that a 18-year-old sees nothing but dead for her future. On the other side Iâ€™m not, because Iâ€™ve peace with my own death. Iâ€™ve already mourned my own death.

The only thing that I hate is that even the last few minutes and seconds off my life would be painful, because suicide isnâ€™t pain-free.

Iâ€™m planning on doing it this week, before saturday. Tomorrow Iâ€™ve a tattoo appointment, and I want to die with a sunflower on my body. 

I hope that Iâ€™ll find my peace and that people wonâ€™t find out and lock me up in a mental hospital again.
