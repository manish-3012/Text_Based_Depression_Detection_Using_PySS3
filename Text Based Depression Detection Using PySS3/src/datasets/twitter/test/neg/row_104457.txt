im doneive struggle with depression for 8 years, and chronic nightmares
ive been living for everyone around mes sake for too long
my best friend and the girl who told me she loved me and shed always be there for me if i needed her help no matter what even if we were fighting stopped talking to me on saturday because ive been too stressful for her and she needs a break
everyone told me shes really upset but all i can see from her twitter is that after only a week shes having fun and going on dates and enjoying herself
this isnt why im doing this just
the straw that broke me
i trusted her and opened my heart and showed her my demons because she said she wanted to help, i havent done that in years
im done
im gonna see my mom for a fake happy visit one last time, then im gonna go see her one more time then ill leave the note i just wrote in her mailbox, then im not sure what ill do
maybe ill just jump off a cliff and wait for everything to just be done
