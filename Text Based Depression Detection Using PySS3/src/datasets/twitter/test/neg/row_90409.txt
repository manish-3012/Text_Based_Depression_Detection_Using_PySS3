I feel so alone?(22F)I was sexually assaulted in high school. I became an outcast was bullied about the way I looked and had horrible rumors spread about me. I was labeled a slut. I carry a lot of guilt around my sexuality even though I graduated four years ago I've only dated one guy since.

The party kids mostly bullied me. The guys would ask me to hook up but not tell anyone. My self-esteem was ruined for a while. I'm from the suburbs of a big city. My school had about 1,600 kids. Most people from my high school went to college. I moved states and haven't been back since graduation.

All those people who bullied me still hang out and are still friends. They all date each other, and when they come home for the holidays, they all hang out. They always post comments on each other's pics. After college, they all moved back to my area or the city. They are all roommates and got apartments together.


I feel so alone and weird. I ghosted and stopped seeing my friends after graduation. I got off social media. I live in southern California now I go to school and have an excellent job I've met some great people and traveled. I still feel like a loser because I don't have connections from high school years later.

Am I a weirdo for still not hanging out with people from high school? Is something wrong with me?

tl;dr: I was an outcast in high school and moved away, but most people from my high school still hang out
