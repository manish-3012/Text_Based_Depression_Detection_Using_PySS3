Shouldn't I know what's best for me?Why does everyone who wants to help me insist that they know what is best for me? I can't claim to know for sure, but surely I, the foremost expert on my own thoughts, desires, and beliefs, should be able to claim that I know better than anyone else?

If I say killing myself is the best option for me, where do they get off telling me I'm wrong? 

The moment you indicate that you might prevent me from killing myself is the moment you take away my worth as a human being. You take away my ability to think for myself, my agency, and reduce me to an object.

Anyone who would do that to me doesn't really care about me.
