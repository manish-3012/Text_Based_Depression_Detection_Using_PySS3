Somebody please help meI see my world coming down around me and it's really scary. I really want to do it but at the same time I'm afraid to die. I feel like I'm unlovable. I feel like I was set up to fail from the beginning of my life so what's the point of even trying anymore? Can somebody please talk some sense into me oh god please.

EDIT: I want to thank everybody who posted here. I've chosen to live and I think you guys helped out with that. You're wonderful people. :)
