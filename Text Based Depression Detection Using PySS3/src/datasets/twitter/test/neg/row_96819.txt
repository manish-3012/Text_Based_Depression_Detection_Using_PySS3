Tired of being tiredLife sucks. People suck. I'm sick of being part of this bs.

I don't even know what else to say here. That's all there is.

All I've done with my life is get increasingly good at video games. I have no other accomplishments to speak of, no one will care that I'm gone. 

Edit: I don't have anyone. I don't know why you would assume I do.
