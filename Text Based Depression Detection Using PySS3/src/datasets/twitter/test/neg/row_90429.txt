I'm at the lowest point I've ever beenI messed up everything. My relationship is ruined. I'm never going to find someone who will put up me the way my ex did and I drove him away with my paranoia. He won't even speak to me now. I'm moody and I feel terrible when I hang out with my friends. I'm not close with my family anymore. I have an unreasonable amount of jealousy that overwhelms me. I can't even go out in public without thinking how unfair it is that everyone around me is "so pretty," "so happy," "so normal." I can barely have a conversation without wanting to cry. My anxiety exhausts me every single day. 

How is any of this fixable? I don't understand people keep telling me to "hang in there" and that "it will get better" but it's just getting worse. Therapy has made it worse I think.
