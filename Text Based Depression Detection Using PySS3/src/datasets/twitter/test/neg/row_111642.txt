Fuck thisFuck you. Fuck everything. Iâ€™m so so tired of crying myself to sleep because I canâ€™t get the thought of you touching me out of my head. The feeling of you pressing into my back.. you didnâ€™t want to fall asleep together. You wanted to use me and you did.. I was so stupid. How was I supposed to understand? I wanted to be loved.. you wanted the opposite. I was your doll. I wish a bus would just hit me or Iâ€™d get â€œaccidentallyâ€ killed. Take me off this stupid planet. End this. You ruined my fucking life. You ruined me and your life is just the same. You donâ€™t have to live with the guilt and shame. You donâ€™t have to punch yourself to numb the feeling. I do. Dont you understand that? If you killed me, would you understand then? I feel like slicing my arms and drifting away
