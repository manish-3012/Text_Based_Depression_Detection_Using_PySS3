I have suicidal ideation but have been told I am manipulativeI feel awful I told someone I was trying to date I felt suicidal and he took it as a ploy for manipulation even though I feel this way a lot. He told me he found someone who had died from a suicide and they had a note and all to explain why they took my cries for help so badly. I know I need to seek professional help. I just feel like my expressions of feeling this way are taken as manipulative regardless of how real it feels to me... but I guess it does not matter too much I just need to address it if it is not too late. I do feel guilty saying that when itâ€™s not an emergency just a thought like I am a terrible manipulative person. I thought it is normal to live with these thoughts for a long time and to have times when it is worse than others. It hurts a lot feeling like I must seem to be faking to manipulate and I feel like thatâ€™s true because I donâ€™t want to hurt myself with a real attempt to prove them wrong but then I think i guess Iâ€™m a fake after all.
