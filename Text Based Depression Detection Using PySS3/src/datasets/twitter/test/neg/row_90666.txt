suicidal, but not depressed?So I've been pretty suicidal for longer than I can remember, and I've had countless attempts.. but - I don't really feel depressed though? I don't really show many symptoms, and it's never really about feeling hopeless or anything like that.. I just kind of wish I wasn't here. I don't feel like I belong in this world, if that makes sense.

I've stayed a psych ward because of an attempt, and I'm currently going to therapy, but I feel like I'm not really getting anything out of it. I just tried to hang myself again tonight, since I was in a bad mood, and I honestly just feel lost. I really wish I wasn't here, and I feel like there isn't anything to do to get better...  I feel insane, numb. I'm just not supposed to be here.
