I love you all.I become upset and depressed on occasion, but the sheer scale of the suffering here really puts into perspective my feelings. I simply canâ€™t comprehend the amount of sadness and grief. Itâ€™s like the notion of an infinity... itâ€™s just too large to understand. I donâ€™t believe in a God anymore, but if I did, Iâ€™d be praying for all of you. I love you and I want you all to know Iâ€™m holding you in my heart. It sounds trite but itâ€™s true.
