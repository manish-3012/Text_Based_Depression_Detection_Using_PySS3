My Mom hates me, but she won't admit it. When I was pissed off because my sister said some really rude things to me, I went upstairs and slammed the door for a long time just crying. I know I'm very immature please don't mention it. My mom went pounding on my door, and she just told me I'm miserable to live with and I act like a 2 year old. I can't blame her, even my own mother can't stand me. I'm really considering suicide since nobody really cares for me. My own mother hates me.
