I've been fighting for so long. I'm tired. I want to give up.I can't keep up this act for much longer. My mask is slipping and people are starting to notice. Everyone is leaving. Soon I will be all alone. I feel so empty. Like a ghost stuck on the outside of the glass, looking in; witnessing all the happiness and love that could never be mine. Why can't I be happy? Do I not deserve to experience joy for a measly second? Why don't I feel that anyone loves me? I can't escape it. I can't understand it.
