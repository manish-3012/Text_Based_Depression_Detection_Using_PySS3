I'm considering suicide...againLong story short, I got broken up with a girl who I love very very much and who initially helped me to stop self-harming.

Well my self-harming is back now and I am seriously considering suicide because I'm in so much pain. I want it to stop. She keeps giving me mixed signals about wanting to be together again and not wanting to. I haven't eaten anything since Friday morning. I tried eating Sunday but I threw it all up(not purposefully). I can't eat, can barely drink, I want to die, and my self-harm is back full-force. 

I just want her back man..
