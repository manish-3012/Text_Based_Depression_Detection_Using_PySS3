Suicide seems like the best option.I have lived for 20 years on this earth, and these exhausting, painful years are not something I wish to live through again. All my life, I have engaged myself into a fever of academic ambitions and perfectionism, I lived in total darkness, seeing only what I thought existed, burrowing my head further and further into the soil until I was completely buried. Yet when I was pulled out, I did not bloom and bathe in the light, I found these new sights and gaudy colours frightening. Yet, one way or another, I could not dig only again into the ground, I could only lie low, my brain stilted, trying to slip quietly through life. 

I have failed abysmally at this. I have been wracked with depression for so long that I feel nothing, my mind has lingered, coma like, alive but not responding. Then the loneliness struck, so there I was, an atom amongst billions, with nowhere to go, and no one to guide me.

I am scared of death, yet I also welcome it. I have never been religious, but, even if there were an afterlife, how can my mind be reprogrammed and my thoughts untangled? How will I be judged? Am I an evil person because I have dragged so many people down with my with my depression, and practically ruined the bonds of my family? Perhaps, the most comforting view is that of an atheist, I shall lie under the soil with my flesh consumed by maggots and my bones melting into dust, and my mind, and these locusts which plague it, will rot away like another insignificant piece of organic matter. Finally, peace in the form of nothingness. 

I don't know, and I don't care. Perhaps I am a coward because I wish to 'take the easy way out'. Perhaps I am selfish for tormenting my loved ones. But one feeling which overwhelms all reason is a profound desire, ringing from the depth of my soul, for this pain to stop.
