There is no â€œhelpâ€. There is no hopeGets bad enough, friends leave.  Girl leaves.  Work soft fires me and calls me names.  Ends my career.  

Even therapist says Iâ€™m fatalistic.  

There world made me like this - there isnâ€™t anything I can do.  My therapist canâ€™t give me the nurturing family I never had.  The psychiatrist isnâ€™t going to give me drugs that will make me forget how sick the world is.   Calling a hotline wonâ€™t get the girl who ghosted me to come back.

Iâ€™m 31 years old.  A third through my life at best, and it only ever gets worse.  What am I supposed to do?  There is nothing left to try.  All there is is pain.  Of course no one wants to hang out with me, as my therapist says theyâ€™d have to weigh the pros and cons of dealing with someone as depressed as I am.  

Everyone is a fake friend.  Iâ€™m done.  Why wait.
