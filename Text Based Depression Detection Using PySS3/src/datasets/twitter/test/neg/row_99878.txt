back at it againyup. got back about thinking the same thing again. things were preety good last year and than 7 days ago i got an e-mail that said i can't work for one company. i've talked with, what supposed to be my boss, and he said we like you etc. the e-mail came from the state saying that i don't have enough knowledge. the company isn't interested in me any more and basicly it's over. there were a lot of stuff that i've done for this job and it's over. last 7 days been tough. i don't smile to the regular stuff that i normally smile. if someone have please write something because i can't look up to people i looked up before.
