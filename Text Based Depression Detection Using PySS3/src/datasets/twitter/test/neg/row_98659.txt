Disgusted by myselfHave you ever hated yourself so much that you often questioned why youâ€™re alive?

I *hate* myself. I never fit in at school. I was bullied so badly. Iâ€™m a 19-year-old black girl and I fucking hate the way I look and who I am. 

I wish I were born a tall, attractive boy who had lots of friends and was athletic and mentally healthy. 

Iâ€™m so suicidal.
