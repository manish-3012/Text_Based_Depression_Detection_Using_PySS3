I'm thinking of overdosingI've been depressed for two years now. I've been baker acted twice so I'm using this rather then the helpline because I can't afford hospital bills. I want to overdose on Depokate, I don't know if it will kill me but id assume with alcohol it would. I'm a 20yo male and I'm just filled with regret after getting kicked from military for being a dumb ass and saying something I shouldn't have said. I can't find a job, I don't have any friends. Just nothing going on. I'm lost but I want help. I don't want an extravagant life. I just want a job, a gf, and pot to numb my pain.
