The only thing that's stopping me from killing myselfMy mom lent me her car today and I accidentally scratched the door handle on the driver's side while trying to park it. She screamed at me for 45 minutes straight. I ended up cutting and now have 50-100 cuts all over my right arm and right leg.

I texted my boss asking what the company's policy is for two weeks' notice. Half because of Google and half because I wanted to kill myself. She asked if this was for resignation or for change in availability. I asked what the policy was for an employee who is going to die. Then she called to check on me. I ended up telling her about Google. I work at a tutoring center as a computer science teacher, and our center also does college consulting. She reminded me that we always tell the kids they're not stupid if they can't get into Harvard, and it should be the same for Google. I couldn't help but think, *If only getting into Google was as easy as getting into Harvard.*

I'd normally kill myself but I have the final round of interviews at Google. I also have an internal reference from a Google employee who is famous enough to have a Wikipedia page. How could anyone throw that away?
