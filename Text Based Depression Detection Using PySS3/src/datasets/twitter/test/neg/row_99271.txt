Never been happier, never wanted to die moreF, 19, just moved from my depressing hometown to the beautiful city of Florence. Have gotten quite a few friends here, I eat good food on the daily, walk around looking at gorgeous architecture constantly.

And still, it feels like I have never wanted to die more than I do right now. The fact that Im still this fucked up after moving away from the bad situation I was in just goes to show that no change of scenery is gonna help. 

I don't know how to fix me. And I keep fantasizing about floating face down in the river. Or stabbing my wrists spraying blood everywhere. Or just drink myself dead.
Everything is gray and heavy, and I want it to just be over.
