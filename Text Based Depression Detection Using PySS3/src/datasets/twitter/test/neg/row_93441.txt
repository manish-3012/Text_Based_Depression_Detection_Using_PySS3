My mom refused to take me to the hospitalA/N: ok, I cant stand pretending this didnt happen. Im not sure what the guidelines are on a topic like this, but Im going to post it anyway. Sorry for any typos btw.

Trigger warning: suicide

I feel shaking writing this, but it tears me up inside. There was one night where I seemingly lost my mind. I honestly dont even know what went though my head, but I decided to start taking pain killers. I dont know why pain killers, I dont know why I just up and decided to, and I dont even know if this was a suicide attempt. I have no clue, I really dont. Well, gradually, I kept taking them. By the time I took 10, I was frusterated nothing happened. I dont even know what I was aiming for, really. So, I took more. I kept taking them until the bottle was nearly empty. It was then i realized I took around 36, all Im for sure about was I stopped counting around 25, but kept going. I stopped for a while, and went to lay down on my couch. Note this was around 9:30 or so, I started when the sun was going down and stopped taking them after it was dark. Again, I dont really remember anything. Eventually, after laying there for around 30-45 minutes, I stood up to go back to my room. I regreat standing up. Ive never switched between completely fine feeling to complete shit so fast. I felt horribly dizzy was the main thing I could remember. so much so I could hardly walk straight. I made it a few feet from the couch, before realizing that I fuck up. bad. I slowly walked to my room, glad my parents were upstairs (my room was on the first floor), and didnt see me like this. Of course, I began to panic. On one of my social media pages, I vaugly freaked out (this is an extremely important detail, actually). After searching around I came to the conclusion I had to do something. After flipping back though the site where I was full-on panicing, I had gotten a notification from someone I'd never spoken to before. She'd asked if I was ok, and even though I was suffering horribly at this point, I explained to her what happened. She told me I had to tell my mom. Crying, I walked to the stairs, and waited. My moms boyfriend was the first to come down, and I managed to say something to indecate that I was in trouble, not directly telling him that I took a fuckton of painkillers and was on the brink of dying, that is. He got my mom, and me and my mom had a short discussion. She told me we wern't going to the hospital. Eventually, I went back to my room and managed to sleep, hoping that I would get up again. That night was terrible, in the fact I threw up at least four different colors. I was mostly suffering when I vomited blackish-red. Panic. Amazingly I didnt drop my phone into the toilet as I shakily made sure black vomit usually indecated blood. After I could move without up-chucking again, I dragged myself upstairs. I was in this alone, it was 2:00 AM on a thursday, of course no one would be awake, I wish they were for what happened next. I was more than convinced I was dying, so after getting upstairs, I stood in my moms doorway and begged her to take me to the hospital, I believed I wasnt going to make it without. I dont exactly have commentary on what she told me, even after hearing I was possibly internally bleeding.
"go back to bed."
No comfort, just her telling me to pretty much fuck off. Even if I wasnt really dying, she could have at least told me I'd be ok, but no. I didnt even deserve that I guess. I didnt want to cause anymore touble, so I did just that. I spent that night alone.

Im not sure if im posting this to the right place, but I think writing it will make me feel better. thank you.

btw, I was 14-years-old if this story itself wasnt bad enough.
