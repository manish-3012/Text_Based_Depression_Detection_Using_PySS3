Do you guys/gals want me here.I was on this community as AntiBullyAnne &amp; deleted that account to make this one, a user wrote me thanking me for being so positive &amp; encouraging before I was banned then threatened by the mods. I was told if I come back they'll ban me from reddit.

I was Brumble on irc years back, and I was AntiBullyAnne here, and I was kicked from here for being helpful. I deal with major depressive disorder myself, no one has to believe me, I just want to know if I'm wanted here otherwise I'm on my way. Thanks.
