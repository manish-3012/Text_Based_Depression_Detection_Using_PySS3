I don't think I have depression, but I just wanna die.I've been self-harming myself to forget certain things and just to make me feel something. Every night, I couldn't stop the thought of killing myself, and has become sort of my lullaby that sings me to sleep. My ex-boyfriend left me almost 5 months ago and my life kinda went down the hill ever since. One of my friend knew that I have been suicidal and advised me to refer a doctor for help. But, I don't think that I'm sick of whatever. My ex-boyfriend has been my driving fuel for me. Before meeting him, I'm already feeling suicidal and self-harming myself since I was 17. 2 years ago, when I met my boyfriend, everything was mostly rainbows and unicorns, I even smile when heavy storms are passing through. Now, I don't know what I am. I planned to kill myself today at 2 am, where everyone is asleep but I couldn't find anything to hang my rope. It made me more furious. I did some more cuts on my forearms to chill myself down. I should've died when I was still a little boy drowning in my local water park. I would have skipped all the miserable pain.
