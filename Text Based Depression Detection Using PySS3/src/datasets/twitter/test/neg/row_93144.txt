I brushed my teeth today even though I wanted to kill myself.I know it seems pathetic and ridiculous, and my teeth are still yellow as hell but at least it's something, which is more than I've been doing.  I've posted here under multiple throwaways and I don't even know why I'm here telling you people this. But anyways, I also plan to go to sushi with the family tonight and possibly even take a shower. It's pretty sad as hell that my life has come to this, where I'm patting myself on the back for brushing my damn teeth, and I feel selfish and attention seeking even posting this. But I just feel like I need to share this with someone. Thanks for taking time out of your day to recognize I exist, I really appreciate it. Really. 

Edit: I just logged in tonight and saw all the support I got. This subreddit is amazing and you people are amazing. Just knowing that this many random strangers from the interwebs care about me is amazing. You just made my week, reddit! Thank you so much, all of you, even those who just upvoted and moved on. &lt;3
