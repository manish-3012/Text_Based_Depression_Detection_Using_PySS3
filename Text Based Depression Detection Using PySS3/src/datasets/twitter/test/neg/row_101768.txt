I hate myselfI hate myself and just want to end my life.  I've been here before, and I keep going back to this place.  My family loves me and always worries about me, but I always find a way to do the most hurtful things to them.  I put on this mask of lies after lies after lies to make them not worry about me, or to keep them from knowing the truth.  Now it comes crashing down. Again.  Why can't I learn?

My family is financially and emotionally spent.  Here I am doing the worse possible thing for the situation.

I have tried ending my life before.  Thinking about how much I would hurt my family snapped me out of it.  I knew I would inflict so much pain on them.

Then there's me.  I have nothing going for me.  I'm a physically disabled, 3 time college dropout, and have never had an intimate relationship.  I'm always in physical pain.  Doctors refuse to treat me.  Friends and family don't truly know the extent of my pain.  Thoughts are always so fucking jumbled in my mind that I literally want to knock myself out just to end THAT suffering.  I used to cry all the time just so I had something to focus on, some release of emotion.  Now I can't even do that.  I am past that.  I literally have NOTHING to look forward to in my future.  I can't remember the last time I was truly happy. 

I've sought help.  I thought I had this under control, but I'm beginning to realize the medication is just dulling my emotions.  It didn't "fix" me.  Worse yet everyone around me seems to think I am fixed (so I put on the mask to trick them).  I want it to be over more than anything I have wanted in my life.  I wish my family would let me free myself.  I wish they would just give up on me, so I can have my release.   But there comes a point where the pain I cause them on a regular basis is just simply less than the pain that would come from killing myself.  The would suffer a set amount of time, then simply move on.  


I wish I had the guts to just get it over with.  Why am I such a fucking pussy.  

I don't know why I'm even writing this.  Hopefully this is the last message I will write.
