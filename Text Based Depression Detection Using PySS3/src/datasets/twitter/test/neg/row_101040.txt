My mom is driving me to suicideMy mom is extremely emotionally abusive and has been since my sister was born. We were best friends and then my sister took my place. Recently, she took me to therapy in an attempt to make me feel bad about an argument i had with her but i ended up being diagnosed with anxiety and depression and the therapist acknowledged that my mother was the root of many of my traumas and she did not like that and never took me again, even though it helped me. My whole family lets her step all over me and they support it because sheâ€™s lied to them and turned them against me. I met someone who makes me very happy, and now (as edgy and ridiculous as it seems) she trying to separate us. I feel so trapped and absolutely no one cares. The only reason why I havenâ€™t killed myself is because i donâ€™t want to hurt my s/o. But i do think about it often. I think about it all the time. Part of me wants to just kill myself because iâ€™m so tired of living like this, and then part of me wants to stay alive to wait out the day that i can move out and never speak to my family again and see everything get better. I am so utterly broken at this point.
