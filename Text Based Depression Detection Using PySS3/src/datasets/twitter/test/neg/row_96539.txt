This might be my suicide noteI don't know if this will be my suicide note. I hope not. 

I hurt her. I left her alone. &amp; I seem to continue to do so.

I can't take this. I can't take the shame. I can't take the fear. I can't take hurting my most loved one. I want to die. I'm next to a window on a roof, I jump, I die. But if I do that I will traumatize everyone in this house.

I am a shitty boyfriend. I'm probably a shitty friend. My family hates me. I have a lot of people who hate me. I have hated me. A ton. I always want to destroy myself out of self-hatred.

She feels forgotten. Uncared for. I wanna end it all. She doesn't deserve my hurt.

I hurt her &amp; I feel like a monster

I want to die &amp; I know how to do it, I get ahold of some Perco's, I DIE, a peaceful euphoric death.

I just turned 16. Tomorrow is my birthday party. And I hope I make it.
