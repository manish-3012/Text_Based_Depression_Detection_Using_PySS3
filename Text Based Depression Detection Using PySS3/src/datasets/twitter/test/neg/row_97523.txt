Where is the exit?I feel like the epitome of failure. 

I'm currently in the progress of ruining a decent GPA, withdrawing from all my social circles and transforming myself into a zombie. The one thing I'm good at, apparently.

I don't have the power to fucking get out of bed. I don't have to power to go feed myself, let alone go to school or deal with daily tasks. I keep telling friends and professors at school that "I was sick" because no one takes depression and anxiety seriously. I haven't left my room in days (or weeks, if you exclude that one time I had to attend a compulsory lab session). I can't even enjoy time with my loving boyfriend without bursting into tears randomly or simply spacing out. 

After several suicide attempts as a teenager, I had managed to convince myself that suicide was for the weak. Now that my protective shield has fallen apart it seems like a reasonable option. I'm fucking my life up for good, and I can't even get myself to care.

About to lose everything that glued me to life, I suppose.
