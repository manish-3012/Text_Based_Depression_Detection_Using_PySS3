My lifeI am desperately craving love but can't let anyone close to me.

I want to get help but can't open up.

I want to develop new healthy habits but have no discipline, a non-existant attention span and everything is a chore.

I want to do something meaningfull but I can't see a purpose in anything. 

I want to train my mind but thinking about any topic just makes me more depressed.

I have so many issues and things to work on that I don't even know where to begin but my constant state of exhaustion and physical pain keeps me from doing anything.

I don't know what part of me is my personality and what part is my depression.

I can't take it anymore.

Thanks for reading, have a lovely day.
