My depression is a never ending story.. Iâ€™m trapped in a cycle and the only way out is to kill myselfIâ€™m so sick and tired of this stupid cycle, my mental illness consumes my life and I am always unhappy. Every night that I come home from work I am constantly trying to force out all the bad thoughts about what happened during the day. I donâ€™t have any friends that I can vent to anymore, they all got sick of my bullshit and stopped talking to me. I pay $500/month for therapy to see a specialist and itâ€™s not helping me. Iâ€™ve been going for over a year and in the middle of it my therapist had to go on maternity leave so I had to see a different therapist who I hated. I am a lost cause, all of this money could be going towards way more useful things. When I off myself I would love to be able to give my money to my family.
