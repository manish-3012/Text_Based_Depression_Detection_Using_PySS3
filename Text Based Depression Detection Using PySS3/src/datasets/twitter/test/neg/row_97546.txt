Lost $60k by investing in PG&amp;E. I want to dieA couple of weeks ago I invested $90000 in PG&amp;E (PCG) stock at $17.7 per share. This week PG&amp;E has filed for bankruptcy. The stock hit $6 per share toddy I'm almost at a $60000 loss right now. PG&amp;E is supposed to be a stable utility investment; somehow I ended up losing it all. I want to die. Maybe just blow my brains out. Just fucking kill me 

California Governor Gavin Newsome if you're reading this please consider bailing out PG&amp;E. I'm begging you
