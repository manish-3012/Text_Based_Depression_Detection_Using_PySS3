I'm LostWhere I'm from, there isn't anything to do and no one to meet. I have the natural reflex to be condescending or hostile now, and any friends I might have had are long gone, they've been ignoring me since 7th grade (I'm a Junior in highschool). 
I'm a girl, I've never been in love in my life, I don't like when people touch me, ect. To anyone who's heard of me, I'm the local downer. I tried to kill myself once though suffocation, didn't work obviously. Almost shot myself another time, couldn't do it. However I shot the wall, and my folks didn't bat a eye. They don't even know. It doesn't help that the pass time at home is to make fun of me, to gang up on me. 
I'm a only child and my mother was unmarried at the time. Her boyfriend was a abusive asshole so I have that over my head, that I am a walking mistake from the past. She has scars from him. I have scars from myself. When I was much younger, I would scratch at myself and now my arms and legs are covered in circular scars. I feel ugly because of it and I should. Now we live in a real house with my step dad, this is a real move up from the moldy one room one bathroom no kitchen thing from when I was 14.
I've already disappeared, I'm not living just surviving now. I'm largely ignored, I've been slipping in and out of suicidal rage since I was 13. Right now I am ok, I think. I don't know about tomorrow, or next week. It actually reached a point last year where I was failing all of my classes simply because I didn't think I would make it though the day. I have those angry voices in my head too, the ones that tell you to never talk to anyone or to just jump from the roof. 
I don't know if I am really suicidal anymore, but every day that I didn't die in my sleep always brings me back to how much it hurts. I feel guilty for wanting to die and for not being dead. I don't know what to do. I am tired of this.

*edit:
I've actually been doing a whole lot better thanks to this sub reddit, I just needed to tell someone. I haven't been in my previous mood for a really long time now. I'm happy, for the first time in a long time I've been several weeks without being soul-crushingly negative. Reddit's just good for my health. Thank you
