I have no title

Sometimes I wonder I ever will live normal again.  I feel like I see the world in a different way for years. Thereâ€™s only snippets of time that pass where I feel like I truly enjoy and feel like I belong. My friends and family think they know me, I donâ€™t want to scare or burden  them with my thoughts. I have achieved and experienced desired things but find myself back in the same position.  I donâ€™t cry for myself anymore I cry for my family and friends. They might never get the chance to know the real me. For now I suffer, my hope is constantly draining but the impact I have keeps me going. I believe I can do amazing things. I live my life alone, Iâ€™m closest to myself, closest to my biggest enemy.
