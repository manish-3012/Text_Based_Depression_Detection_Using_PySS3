Im dead on the inside...helpIm getting tired of not having emotions, iv been on antidepressants for almost a year.  I cant function socially and my mind eats itself constantly.  Before a person cries they feel an unbearable level of discomfort and stress; i cant cry so that is where i am stuck and i cant leave.  Every social interaction i have is completely fake, i act out everything.  I don't ever want to die but i cant live like this anymore, i don't know what to do.
