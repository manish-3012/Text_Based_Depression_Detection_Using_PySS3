I've made a descisionI have multiple tests in 2 weeks in my uni. I cannot pay attention in class at all and I cannot start studying on my own. It has been 7 weeks since my uni started and I know nothing about it. This test will represent my performance for the rest of my uni year, and if I can't pass at least one of the test, then I am done with my life, because why bother continuing this for a whole year if I'm just going to fail everytime. If I'm just going to fail in life. Passing, on the other hand, will represent a glimmer of hope because it shows that I can still be productive despite my situation. But I doubt I'll pass.

I've been feeling shitty for 5 years and I'm so tired of being miserable all the time. I don't remember the last time I'm happy, my emotions do not feel genuine and recently, things got worse, as I started to cry at random times during the day for no reason. I used to be able to barelyhold my shit together, but not anymore. I do not desire to live in a world where I'm like this till I'm old. I have no access to therapy and even if I do, I'm not sure it will do me any good. I will never be better and my state will only deteriorate with time, so I do not see a point in prolonging my suffering. I'm so sick of feeling sad and miserable whenever my brain is not distracted by games or movies. Sometimes not even then.

I have considered how my actions will make my family and my close friend feel, but honestly, feeling guilty for causing them grief is better than feeling dead while remaining alive. I have fantasized about killing myself for years, nothing fancy, just a simple bullet to my head or slice my arms open with a knife and I'm finally going to do it. I think I'm going with the knife.

Fuck this shit.
