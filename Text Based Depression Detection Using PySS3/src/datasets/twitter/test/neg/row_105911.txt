my suicide letter(long)I don't know how I ended up here. This is nothing like how I envisioned my life to turn out to. I feel like such a failure. I can't do anything right. My whole life has been a lie. I am just here rotting wasting away the days. I don't know how long I can hold on. I've wanted
to end my life so many times. I just don't feel like I belong here. This isn't my life. I don't think there is anything anyone could do. I 
would stil feel this way. This is no one's fault. The choice was mine. I wanted to feel useful, I wanted to be something people could be 
proud of. I didn't want to feel a burden. Yet, that is all I am. I have nothing, I will never amount to anything. These last few years 
have destroyed me. I have nothing to look foward to, my hopes, my dreams they all amount to nothing. I would have been gone a long time ago,
but the impact on my mother/grandfather have kept me tethered here. I can't put this pain on her. She has done nothing wrong, yet I can't 
shake this feeling. For the last 15 years I have felt like this. I would have been gone a long time ago if not for you. I am so useless...

I am sorry Mom...This isn't your fault.

All I ever wanted to do was make a difference in this shitty world. To be someone and do something...yet I haven't done anything...I can't 
even go out without fear of being able to have fun or get home safely. I constantly think what I could have done different to save me from 
this predicament. What, if anything, would change my future? I feel so alone...People constantly check up on me but I can't show my true
face. The constant creeping of loneliness, the day to day filling of simple pleasure just to get me through to the next, the unyielding 
feeling of being truly alone even though you may go out or talk to others. They would simply not know of the true heartache that I was 
feeling. I just wanted my pain to end. I constantly abuse drugs whether it be alcohol or weed just to forget about my troubles, just to
be able not to feel nothing.  I stole away my future's happiness for today's sorrow. I just can't shake this feeling like its all my fault. Life
is passing everyone by and yet I am still stuck here. No future, just simply living for the present. No goals to look foward to, nothing to 
keep me motivated. I am simply filling up the time to keep me out of my own mind. I am just so depressed. I constantly abuse marijuana just to feel "normal."
 If I don't I am moody, I am unstable, I am hardheaded and hurtful. I 
just want to be normal.

I want to change, I want to feel useful, but I am scared. If he doesn't need me what am I? My whole identity these last 5 years have been
his caretaker. What am I without him? When he dies, what am I? Would I have a stable job or just work some shitty job just to make rent. I feel so alone.
 Am I even me anymore? Do I even still want I used to want? What are my dreams for the future? I do not even know anymore. Do I stil want the things I used to look foward being? Am I at all usefull? If 
he wasn't this predicament where would I be? Would I be still the same piece of shit who does nothing, who lives for nothing, who has nothing?
I have nothing to look foward to. My days are simply looking foward to meeting the baby and making her smile. I won't or can't do anything else.
I don't know how long I can feel this way. It hurts so much. I know I shouldn't compare myself to others, but yet seeing everyone progress in their lives;
 buying a house, buying new cars, going on trips, and having families, and
me stuck in the same position for so long , it just hurts, It breaks my heart. I never thought I would be so useless. I always thought that
life had something bigger for me, that I could make a difference or at least feel like I was. Yet, here I am just a simply scourge on my family.
Every day, I am simply just lying to myself. I don't want to be here anymore. I hate my predicement and yet I hate myself even more.


I just want to be free from this. I can't shake this feeling that everyone is making fun of me or laughing at my expense. And yet what could I do,
I can't prove them wrong...I am everything they believed to be. I am useless, lazy, stubborn, hardheaded, wounded, depressed, angry, and a 
mutlitude of other things. I don't want anything to do with anyone anymore. Even my own family. Let them live their own lives, let me be
allowed to waste my own. I don't want anything from them anymore, if possible I wouldn't want to deal with them anymore. I know I am useless
yet I feel like I am being taken advantage of. I know you wanted better of me, I am sorry that I didn't turn out how you wanted. I am sorry
for being useless, for being an asshole, for being nothing but a burden for these last 30 years. I have nothing to show for it, I have nothing
to live for. It justs hurts everyday, what is wrong with me? I don't want to feel this way. Every day I look to get high just so I don't 
have to feel this way anymore. Smoking makes me feel content, it makes me forget about my life. It makes me "content" with my life. And yet
I don't. I simply smoke to numb the pain. I wish someone would save me from myself...Everything falls apart...

I tried to hide it, I tried to deal with it myself, I tried to keep it hidden in the dark and yet its there clawing and breaking me down bit
by bit. All these are excuses are for my cowardice. I want to end my life yet I am not sure if I can. I want to find something I can live for 
and yet I have nothing. Nothing to keep me here in the present save for my grandpa. I have nothing to look foward to. I have no money, no credit,
no savings, no job prospects, I will never own my own house, I will never have my own family, I simply have nothing to live for. I don't want
to go my cousins gatherings, I simply want to stay home and be alone. I can't just wait til I am alone. I have nothing in common with anyone.
I don't want to keep making excuses for my own ineptitude. The only things that keep me sane these days are smoking and playing with the baby. She is so
innocent. She doesn't know any better. She doesn't know the true me.I kept blaming myself. I know I should stop smoking and yet I can't. All I ever wanted was the best for her. I loved her,
I wanted to see her smile and laugh. And they kept her from me for a year or so. It hurt and yet all I could do was smoke the pain away. I
simply wanted to keep the pain away for another day. To forget all about that and just live in the present happy. Yet all I did was steal tomorrow's happiness 
for today's. When they kept her from me it destroyed me, I really had nothing to look foward too. I can't fault them. I tried to hide it
with a hoodie. I guess it didn't work. I just wanted her to smile and laugh, it helped me forget about my troubles for a few hours, and yet
they wanted nothing to do with me. I guess I can't blame them. I was a bad place in my life...HaHaHa, I've always been in a bad place. 
Those few small moments of happiness didn't overweigh the constant feeling of embarassment and shame.

I don't know if you will read this, I don't know why I am writing this. Maybe it's to give you a look through my eyes after I am gone. How I
wanted to be so much more than I am. How I wanted to useful, how I wanted to make you proud. And yet I am nothing more than a dissapointment, a nusicance,
a simple leech destroying your happiness. If I was never born then everything would be okay. I would never be a problem for anyone. I would 
never be the black sheep. I wouldn't make you embarrased, I wouldn't make you get angry or cry. I wouldn't have caused so many problems. I
am nothing more than a burden. A useless son. Nothing more than a piece of shit with no reedeming qualities. I have felt this way for too long. I have hid this from everyone, I have no one to confide to.
I cant escape feeling this way. These last few years have destroyed me. I am now 30 with nothing to show for it. What has happened? Everyone
is moving on with their lives and yet I am still here stuck in the same predicament. Often times I go out just to escape reality and what happens
when I go home. I see him crying and wondering where I was. WTF am I supposed to do? All this does is make me feel guilty for going out. Whether if its
for 2-3 hours or 6-7. My whole life is revolved around his. I don't even know who I am anymore. What excites me? What motivates me? What makes
me happy? I don't know anymore. I have no answers. I just want to feel useful. I hate my life. I hate me most of all. I want to change, I know I should, but I can't.
Maybe I am afraid. Maybe I am scared. Maybe I am lazy. Maybe all of the above. If he wasnt around after for so long who am I? What am I? I have no identity anymore. I have no one to help. I
am so alone.

And yet I can't even do this...So many times I have wanted to and yet I have failed. Just another thing I can't do right. I have so much
else to say but what does it matter...I'm too much of coward to end it myself.

And now hes gone...The only thing that kept me tethered here. The only thing that kept me wanting to live, so I could take care of him.
And he's gone and its all my fault. My baby deserved better. I feel such guilt...This is all my fault. My Grandfather didnt deserve this. I couldn't help the frustration and anger, I lashed out like a petty child.
I never wanted to hurt him. I did this, I caused this. IF I could have just waited 30 minutes...He would have been fine. I am such a selfish 
asshole.  I never deserved him. I am nothing but a cancer to this family.I was so mad. SO angry and frustrated. Him peeing on the floor 3rd time in a night
, the last thing he remembererd is me yelling at him. He never deserved that. I was just so tired and burnt out. I did this. This is all on me.
I was his caregiver for the last 6 years and It's all my fault. I don't want to be here anymore
I just want this to end. I dont deserve my life. I miss him so much and yet I caused this. HE still had time left. I fucked up. I killed him. I could have done so many things
different. Why do I feel like this? HE would have been here still if I wasn't so selfish, so stubborn, so goddamn fucking stupid. This is all my fault.
Please just forgive me. IF for nothing else that I have done in my life at least this. GIve me this. I need to know it wasn't my fault, yet I
can't help feel that it was. I am sorry. I am sorry for being so useless, I am sorry for being so stubborn, I am sorry for being everything
you didn't want me to be. I am sorry for being so useless. I am sorry that I destroyed this family. I never wanted to. I just wanted to be 
left alone. I caused so many problems, I just feel so useless. I could never live up to my standards cuz I always failed. I always looked
for the easy way out. I destroyed myself and it's no one else's fault. This is all my own fault.

Grandparent...What can I say? It's all my fault...I could have stopped it. I am sorry Grandparent please forgive me. If only I was there. You deserved 
better. I failed you. I feel so much guilt. My depression has gotten worse. He needed me and I failed him. I killed you. I am so sorry, you deserved
better and I failed you. I love you so much. I just can't move on. The guilt is destroying me. I killed you. I miss you everyday. I miss
your smile, your laugh...the way you used to look at my food and smile knowing you would eat it too. I stole your last few years from you.
You would still be here if it wasn;t for my own selfish reasons. I love you so much. I am so sorry. Please, please forgive me. This is all
my fault. I am a selfish addict. I didn't deserve you. If I just stood by you, for just 5 damn minutes you would still be here. I...I hate 
myself, I have done nothing useful, I am just a burden to everyone. Nothing but a black sheep to the family, but you, you were the only
good thing I have done. TAking care of you, being with you gave me a sense of purpose. And now that is gone, I am back to being a burden 
to the family.

I am sorry, so sorry. Please forgive me my baby... YOur last 3 weeks of live I made more miserable. I was so frustrated and angry
and just so tired. 12-14 hours in the hospital, your dementia getting worse. I just felt so useless. I kept getting angry for no reason.
I just needed a break. And I killed you. I love you baby, I am so sorry. This is all my fault. You deserved better and I couldn't do it.
I was a selfish bastard. There is so many thoughts racing in my head. I failed you. If I was a better person you would still be here.
I miss you waking me up, I miss your smile. I miss everything and I can't help but feel I failed you. I just don't want to be here anymore
but I am not strong enough to do anything about it.

If you can hear me Grandfather, please forgive me. I am sorry. I am sorry I wasn't the person you wanted me to be, I am sorry I wasn't a better son,
I am sorry I was such a waste. I am sorry for just being a dissapointment. You deserved better, something I could never give. I was so selfish
I made your last moments miserable. I love you. I still kiss your picture everynight and say goodnight just like I used to do you. I hope
your at peace. I'll see you soon. Sooner if I can muster up the courage to end this farce.
