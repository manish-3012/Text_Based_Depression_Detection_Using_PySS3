That's itMy abusive mom took away my only distraction from my suicidal thoughts. My Computer. My mouse anyway but I can't use my Computer nonetheless. She also left the house telling me that she is gonna get me locked away in some psych ward. So all i can really do is lie in my bed and think about killing myself. Also I won't get anything to eat today as some kind of punishement. Guess i'm going to the nearest train Station today :)
