This is so stupid but I just saw a mouse in my kitchen and I feel like its pushing me over the edgeOur upstairs neighbors whose house is attached to ours have had a severe rodent problem for a long time and this one mouse means a lot more are coming. The rats up there used to keep me up from about 3am-5am it got so bad. My landlord did nothing about it but we are in a sensitive financial situation right now and we don't want to rock the boat.

Everything is bad right now. My only real friend lives 8 hours away and I hate school and my job. My mom can't pay rent so I am using my savings to pay the rent for a disgusting house that I hate but moving is not an option. 

I have been suicidal since I was a freshman in high school and I am a freshman in college now and my situation is worse. My family is very financially unstable. We have SNAP but I know I am going to start wasting my money on fast food after this.

I get somewhat obsessive about cleanliness and contamination and have tried to make my house, mostly just my bedroom and kitchen, feel like a sanctuary but I know I am not going to be able to feel that way again after this. I also have a lot of food related anxiety and I am unable to put on weight and it is going to be a bigger issue now. I am just so overwhelmed and I am an adult now so my problems feel more intense and real and I am not ready for it, i'd absolutely rather just be dead.

I am being over dramatic and a brat but I feel like that stupid ugly mouse is gonna be my breaking point.
