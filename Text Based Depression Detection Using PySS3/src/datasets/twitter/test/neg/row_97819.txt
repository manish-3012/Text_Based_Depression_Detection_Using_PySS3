I donâ€™t even know anymore    My upbringing wasnâ€™t ideal. Sexual abuse, rape, manipulation, and abuse. I have been suicidal more than half my life. Here I am with a 10 year old with autism. Iâ€™ve been in a very controlling relationship for almost 13 years. I canâ€™t count on both hands the number of times Iâ€™ve tried to die. 

     Last year I cheated. I was done. I got caught and wanted to go but itâ€™s hard with having a young child. I thought we could make it. If we both could change. At one point he was my best friend. 
    
      At the beginning of summer I left for a couple weeks in a trial and I realized that I couldnâ€™t be where I went. We ended up in a situation with him yelling and screaming at me in front of my son. He refused to be left alone with him and was afraid of him after. I went elsewhere a couple weeks later and fell in love with the place and also someone else. I had a plan. 

    I came back and got a job and my own car. Iâ€™d never been allowed to work until he realized I was serious about leaving. Then he finally allowed me some freedom in hopes of making me stay. I didnâ€™t want to and it all turned into threats. He finally stepped up and tried to be a father and we are a few months into that. 

    Iâ€™ve been working my ass off with this plan in mind to leave but the person I fell in love with tried to force their hand to make me leave faster and cut off all communication. 

   I am making really good money at my job now and busting my ass and could actually make it here however Iâ€™m heart broken. I cry all the time. Iâ€™m still in my husbands house because heâ€™s sworn if I leave he will take my son and he follows me constantly trying to â€œtalk.â€ He keeps trying to touch me.

   With all this going on I gave in. I tried. It repulses me for him to kiss me. I let him have sex with me on the condition he doesnâ€™t kiss me, look at me, or try to touch me otherwise. He has his needs....

    More recently Iâ€™ve tried taking entire bottles of benedryl and then both that and Tylenol. Iâ€™ve sat with a knife up to me wishing I could just put it in me but we are designed with reactions to resist that. 

   As a kid my parents found out Iâ€™d tried to kill my self and my father told me the best way is to cut the artery in my neck. No counseling.

   The last time I thought maybe I just needed to hang myself. Something that canâ€™t be undone. I didnâ€™t choose a sturdy enough base. 

  Now I sit here with rope in my pockets and alcohol in my hand fantasizing. I donâ€™t really want to do it. I have a little boy. But I feel like thereâ€™s no end to this never ending torture and I know I wonâ€™t survive it in one way or another.

   I looked up trying to find if there was somewhere I could go for assisted suicide. 

   Him stepping up has only served to hurt our son. Confuse him. Heâ€™s 10 and has had a dad for maybe 3 months. I donâ€™t think me leaving and taking him is in his best interest. 

   I honestly feel like heâ€™s better off with his dad. They are both super smart and like the same things and can bond through that. Heâ€™s autistic and doesnâ€™t really need the love and emotional support I can offer but I canâ€™t handle the judgement if I left him here and started to try to stabilize myself elsewhere. I have zero family support.

   Iâ€™m really struggling to stay. Just in life in general. I feel like I have no way out. Iâ€™d decided I was leaving before I left the first time around. I was just figuring out a plan. Now Iâ€™m just trapped. He wonâ€™t stop trying to touch me and I canâ€™t handle it and cry. I work every time I can and am working crazy hours like 17 a day just to be gone. 

   I feel hopeless and like itâ€™s only a matter of time before it works. I feel like the only way that will work is getting super drunk and hanging myself or finally it working when I just take handfuls of pills. 

   Iâ€™m afraid my son will see me. Iâ€™m afraid to hurt him. But Iâ€™m so tortured and miserable that Iâ€™m not being what he needs. I donâ€™t know what I have to even offer him. Heâ€™s no longer a little baby that loves to fingerprint alphabet letters and learn to spell. Last week he was talking about quantum physics and asking about stuff I have zero knowledge of. 

   I know Iâ€™m on my way out and mostly venting because I truly am hopeless. This isnâ€™t just a spur of the moment thing and no thought behind it. I hate when young people end it with everything still before them. So much life and opportunities ahead of them. I wish for more for them. A life full of greatness. 

   Iâ€™ve lived and Iâ€™ve traveled. I have had the opportunity for many things most would die for. Everything Iâ€™ve been through I feel like this marriage has been the worst of it all. He took me away from me. He destroyed me as a person and my son too. He never thought heâ€™d lose us and now heâ€™s trying. Not because he wants to but because heâ€™s so damn selfish he wants us here. He doesnâ€™t love us. He just canâ€™t stand to lose us. 

   Iâ€™ve thought about just driving away and staying gone til I can clear my head and feel okay. Iâ€™ve thought about just staying and roughing it for my son. Iâ€™ve hoped and dreamed for happiness. Itâ€™s never going to be possible. Either I walk away without my son or he takes him. Thatâ€™s my options. Idk what happens tonight but heâ€™s woken up and starting shit. I just cannot handle anymore. Iâ€™ve had all I can take.
