i promised myself never again...i have suffered from depression and anorexia for half of my life and i used to cut myself but i promised i wouldn't do cut myself ever again and i had been good for a while. i promised myself that, my friends, my family but i let them all down and now i cant deal with life anymore. i have tried to commit suicide an extreme amount of times and i havent tried for a few weeks and i have been better but i dont want to deal with life anymore.
