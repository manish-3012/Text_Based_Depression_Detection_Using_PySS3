Whatâ€™s the point to life?Itâ€™s just a cycle. You go to school, get a job, then literally work until youâ€™re dead. Some people have better jobs and make more money, but still have to work. Is it really worth staying alive so that I can just continue to make money? Sure maybe I get married, have kids, but whats the point in that? The world we currently live in just doesnâ€™t make sense to me, and Iâ€™m about ready just to figure out what is on the other side. Itâ€™s just going to get worse and worse. I doubt any of you can really help, but I just wanted to share how I feel at the moment.
