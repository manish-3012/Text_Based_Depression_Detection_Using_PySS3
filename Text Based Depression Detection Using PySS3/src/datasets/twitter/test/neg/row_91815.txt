Literally cannot remember the last time I was happyIâ€™m a male 26 years old. Last 6 birthdays, no one by my parents remembered. I cannot hold on to friends because I lack the social skills to do so. 

I have a decently high paying job that I donâ€™t think I can hold on to because my ability to continually working itâ€™s based on pure randomness (not kidding here) 

I feel empty, depressed and have had constant depression for the last two years. And I feel the happy memories are all being taken away from me because I genuinely do not remember the last time I was happy. I had a couple of two faced friends who used me and literally said they donâ€™t want to hang out with me anymore. (I double checked with reddit to find out if I was a â€˜nice guyâ€™ but apparently not)

I could always â€˜seeâ€™ my future up to this point. But I canâ€™t see past next year. Iâ€™m constantly unlucky in hilarious ways to the point where Iâ€™ve had bouts of laughter followed by severe depression. 

I donâ€™t think I add any value to anyone or possess any value myself.  I have some savings that Iâ€™m sending to my family. Giving away my steam account and computer hardware to my brother tonight. 

See you in the other side
