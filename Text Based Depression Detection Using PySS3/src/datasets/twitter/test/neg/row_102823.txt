Afraid of dying, but I hope I doI am and always have been afraid of death. While I'm not sure if I'm at the point yet where I would take my life, i wouldn't mind it so much if, say, an oncoming semi swerved into my lane. I just don't want to be alive anymore, and the fact that so many good people die when I could easily take their place is an injustice.
