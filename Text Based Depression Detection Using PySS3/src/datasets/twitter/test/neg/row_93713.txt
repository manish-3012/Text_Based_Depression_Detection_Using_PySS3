Why is reaching out so difficult?I'm in a difficult situation. I'm being treated for mental illnesses which I've been struggling with (undiagnosed) since I was a child.

I get suicidal ideation a lot. It sucks, I hate it, and I hate my mind for making me feel so weak. I get so frustrated at the idea that people expect me to be okay just because I'm on meds and therapy and it isn't that easy. 

Sometimes when I feel at my worst, and I want to hurt myself the most, I think that I should reach out to more intense services but then I get scared and I feel sick. I live with my parents, I'm literally in my mid 20s, and I feel like it would ruin my life if I did.
