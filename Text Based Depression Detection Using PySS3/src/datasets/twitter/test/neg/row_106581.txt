Ex gf is suicidal, headed to inpatient soon, I don't know what to do. Child Custody and relationship problems.Sorry for not being specifically focused on suicide, I just am having a hard time finding a sub that I can get some help on. 



ExGf, let's call her Kim, her daughter let's call d. 
   
&amp;nbsp;  
Kim was going through a tough time before our breakup. We were a very very codependent as a couple with myself carrying the load. ( raising d, cleaning house, working full time and paying all bills, Kim mostly addicted to Netflix and occasionally helping out)  

&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Kim's support:**  
&amp;nbsp;  
Kim's parents are selfish sacks of shit. Her grandma is sane and kind but always takes the tough love approach. This doesn't work well as Kim has a very low self esteem and is sensitive.  
&amp;nbsp;  

I've seen the shitty way that Kim's mom treats her dad and the way they both treat kim... and started to notice some patterns.   

&amp;nbsp;   
* They only help Kim if she is having a full on crisis. I now realize that in our relationship a lot of things that weren't a big deal were escalated into crises before she asked for my help... because that's what she was used to doing her entire life.  
&amp;nbsp;  
* Her dad is super controlling so her mom lies to him about anything and everything so she can live how she wants to. This is where the lies from Kim started. Her mom suggested 'just lie, he won't find out'  

&amp;nbsp;  
I'm not a controlling person but I set clear boundaries.  
&amp;nbsp;  

* Kim's dad has always been mean to her... She has very low self esteem and when I met her she had a group of friends that all insulted her a lot... when I helped her stand up to them they got nasty. My therapist says that people like this tend to seek out people that are mean to them because it is what they are used to.
  
&amp;nbsp;  
* Kim's relationship with her mom is textbook emotional incest (look it up) and I've been trying to get Kim not to lean on d for support but she often wants to. (Do you love mommy? Am I your best friend? Will you hug me? I'm sad...)
  
&amp;nbsp;  
* Kim's mom uses her. If Kim has money they hang out every day. Since I've know her she lies to or let's Kim down and causes her to cry at least once a week.  

&amp;nbsp;  
I think Kim needs to distance herself from her parents, especially her mother if she wants to be happy and for d to have a normal life.

&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  

**Our relationship:**  
&amp;nbsp;  
We went through a miscarriage over a year ago and Kim started falling apart. Panic attacks, too depressed to get out of bed, unable to follow through on the helpful things I would arrange for her.
   
&amp;nbsp;   
We have both been unhappy since then but have still had some good times, it was like we were both waiting for and trying to make a better future.  
&amp;nbsp;   
She started counseling but only follows through 1 of maybe 4 times.  
&amp;nbsp;  

I am in counseling and look forward to going every week.  
&amp;nbsp;  

I've been supporting Kim because of the mc but I can only carry her so far. It got to an unhealthy level.
  
&amp;nbsp;  
As I said before, we broke up because I lost my ability to trust Kim. I don't believe anything she says now and found myself constantly wanting to snoop. I'm questioning all the things she told me throughout our relationship.
  
&amp;nbsp;  
Before we broke up, she was struggling with a depression medication change and had suddenly for the first time talked about suicide, increased her drug abuse, and was starting to lie to me a lot. She also cut herself on 3 different occasions.  
&amp;nbsp;  
After the breakup she said she wanted to die and I had to physically restrain her from hurting herself and take a couple of hours to calm her down.  

&amp;nbsp;  
She immediately went to her mom's house with d and said it was too painful to be around me.  
&amp;nbsp;  
She decided that she wanted to go to inpatient treatment or rehab. Great idea. I thought she was going immediatley. I helped her find a bed date and told myself I would not help her any more until she is in treatment if she didn't follow through on the bed I found. That first place didnt work out and she has been having trouble finding a place but now has a check in time for a good place on 8-25.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I told her that I would try my best to find a way to trust her again, but that I thought it would be nearly impossible. So she thinks there's a chance with me.  
&amp;nbsp;  

Truth be told, I'm done. So done. 0% chance. But I'm afraid that if I tell her that that she will kill herself.
  
&amp;nbsp;  
But then again, I want her to go to treatment for herself.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Do I tell her now so she doesn't have false hope? Or do I wait until she is in treatment? It's only one more week but we have already dragged this breakup out for almost 2 weeks. I'm miserable but looking forward to a new lease on life where I can consciously try to improve myself and my issues once we stop talking.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I want to cut contact but she has almost no support system... twice this week I didnt sleep because she was calling/ messaging me saying she was going to kill herself.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I've been very conflicted because I supported her so much for so long that she isn't very strong so to speak. When we broke up I wanted to help her as a friend but that has been imo too confusing for both of us.  
&amp;nbsp;
What should I do?  
&amp;nbsp;

My best idea so far is a letter, a long one explaining what's going through my head, what I think she should do to help live a happy life despite her shitty parents, how and why she should let me go... etc etc
   
&amp;nbsp;  
If I do a letter, should I give it to her before or after treatment?  

&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;  

**Whole side issue with d:**

D started calling me dad when she was 2 and we decided to go with it and for me to be her dad, and to explain what a stepparent is when she is 6 or 7. Kim and I agreed that I would remain a parent if we broke up. I legitimately planned to be with Kim for the rest of my life... I even bought a ring shortly before the mc. Neither of us thought that we would break up but here we are...
  
&amp;nbsp;  
My family thinks I should cut ties with d for several reasons:  
&amp;nbsp;


* Staying will tie me to kim for life and make her unable to move on for much longer. 
&amp;nbsp;  
* Being a parent to a non biological child of an ex gf will set off alarm bells with any future woman I might want to pursue. Especially considering we didn't even date for two years.  
&amp;nbsp;
* Likewise for any man that Kim may end up with.  
&amp;nbsp;  
* D's bio dad recently got in touch and suddenly wants to be a part of her life. If he does and I stay, d will eventually have 3 potential father figures to look to, this might be too confusing. Kim doesn't want him involved but him and his wife seem like nice, stable people.  
&amp;nbsp;  
* I hate kims parents and the road it looks like kim is headed down... I don't want have to associate with them any more and I certainly don't want them responsible for 50% of the custody of any child I am responsible for. I have already felt for months that the one night a week she spends with them now undoes 80% of the good habits we teach her during the rest of the week.  
&amp;nbsp;  
* I have felt increasingly distant from d for the last 6 or so months as Kim has gotten worse, d has spent more time with Kim's parents, and I've been working a lot.  
&amp;nbsp;  
* If I were to stay in D's life then Kim's parents would not be welcome around her. I do not think that this would be actually possible but that would be my rule. They are bad news and I do not want the cycle of misery to continue.  
&amp;nbsp;  
I know I promised to stay in her life... but that doesn't look like the best option. Would I be a terrible human being if I cut all ties? Isn't admitting that I made a mistake better than causing problems in all of our lives for years to come?  
&amp;nbsp;  
What would you do and how would you do it?  
&amp;nbsp;  
Her grandma thinks I should wait until she is in treatment and that I should cut ties.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Also, I lost my temper after Kim's mom pulled yet another selfish move and refused to drive her to treatment making her her walk 5 miles on a road with no sidewalks at night alone to check herself into treatment.   
&amp;nbsp;  
I told her all about how horrible I think she is, why none of her siblings want anything to do with her, how much of a narssisit she is and how she should reevaluate her life. 
  
  &amp;nbsp;  
This obviously went over very poorly and both of her parents messaged me telling me that I was not welcome in d's life any more.  
  &amp;nbsp;  
So that's it. I'm screwed, my brain is fried but I can answer any questions. 
  &amp;nbsp;  
**Please help**
  &amp;nbsp;  
Tldr: girlfriend started to show traits of her shitty parents. We broke up, she is suicidal and thinks not only that we have a chance but that I will be 50% guardian to her child. We dont have a chance and I'm having second thoughts about custody. Not sure what to do and if I should do it now or wait until exgf is in treatment.

Update as well: she tried to cut her wrist and then made a plan to hang herself yesterday. She decided to check herself into the hospital and is under 24/7 watch. I went to visit and encouraged her to stay there until inpatient starts.
