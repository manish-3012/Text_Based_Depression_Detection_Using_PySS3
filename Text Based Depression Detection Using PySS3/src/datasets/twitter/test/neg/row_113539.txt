Why am i like this?I wish i had more of a will to live. I think about people who have so much less than i do. But yet i still want to die. Why? 

I have these thoughts almost daily. For at least 15 years. Now I have 2 kids. And theyre the ONLY reason Im still here. My friends and family and my therapist are all aware of my feelings.

But i really wish i could just die. I hate being me. Its a fucking nightmare. But it could be worse so why cant i just appreciate what ive built for myself?
