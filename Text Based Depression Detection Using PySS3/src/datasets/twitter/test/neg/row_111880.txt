Little sister commit suicide 11 days ago.  This is my story.On January 7th 2013, my little sister O.D'd on prescription pills and drown herself. There were no signs of depression, no clues leading up to the incident. Family events over the holiday season were great, she didn't show any signs of sadness. The week leading up to the incident was family oriented, a happy time. The night before she even went to Cirque Du Solei with my parents. Nobody picked up on it.
She loved to help people. Talking with all her friends now, I realized she was helping many people overcome depression and avoid suicide. All her friends said she was anti-suicidal. We only realized she was taking anti-depressants the day of; when we found the bottle next to her body. She had been taking them for a month and a half; late November. Her friends knew. They told us that Aggie said the anti-depressants weren't working anymore but she didn't want to switch because of the initial cycles of the drug made her sick.

I want to say that the anti-depressants caused the death of my little sister but I know there is more to that. I discovered through chat conversations that she had been depressed for quite some time. But we never knew. She had a previous case of depression when she was 14 but things got better and better for her. She was more physically active, outgoing, and started making more friends. I just don't know how it got so bad without anyone noticing.  I keep thinking to myself, if only she told us, if only she showed us some signs of depression we could have been able to help her.  She didn't.  I believe it was because she didn't want to burden us, didn't want to let us down, didn't want to be monitored and treated differently.  But without us knowing, we were never able to help.  Every day was a normal day, for us.  If you have depression, please talk to some one about it.  Don't think that you will burden them by bringing it up. People are generally kind hearted, they will help if you seek it out.  If you really can't talk to anyone, please excercise regularly.  Find a hobby or a sport, something that is completely out of your normal routine and persue it.  That's what my little sister did.  She of all people started taking Kickboxing, Jujitsu, public speaking classes and she seemed much better during this time.  It was when it all stopped during the holidays.   

People with depression, past and present, can you tell me what it was like? Were you able to talk to family about it? Did you keep it a secret? Did the anti-depressants cause an increase in suicidal thoughts? What happens when you the anti-depressants suddenly stop working?  

I posted the entire sequence of events leading up to when we found my little sister in the bathtub that night in the link below.
