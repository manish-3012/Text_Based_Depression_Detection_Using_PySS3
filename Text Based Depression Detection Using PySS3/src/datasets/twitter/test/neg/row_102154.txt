Worried for a friendMy friend has had a rough semester she is struggling with a depression, she hadn't really shown signs of suicide but I worry. We have just passed the 10th grade. Its summer and I haven't heard a word from her in almost two weeks. I have sent a message on every social media account of hers that i know of. I know it might be like I'm smothering her but it was over those two weeks.

As someone who has attempted suicide I always expect the worst and try to help. I hope she is okay but I don't know what to do to help.
