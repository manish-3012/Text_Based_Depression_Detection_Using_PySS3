There is no recovery now.... I was asked today how many suicide attempts I have had. I paused for a moment, mentally trying to count, before I just said, 
"I don't know, I lost count after 15." 

98% were in the past three years. Hanging, Overdosing (on everything, you name in, I tried it.), Jumping, antifreeze, various household poisons. 

Recently I drank more anti freeze and an de-icer (It is a myth that antifreeze is sweet. It is gross and bitter. The de-icer however was fine) I was hospitalized. While in the hospital I ran from nurses and security and threw myself down a stair well. The middle part, not the actual stairs. I climbed over the railing and tried to fall down the five or six flights of stairs. I don't remember falling or landing, but clearly I lived. Don't know how far I actually fell. I woke up in the icu, with broken ribs, back, a bleed in my brain, and a broken hand. 

Now I am back in normal life (after all of it, I was in a mental hospital for less than 24 hours). I am alone, mildly drunk in my apartment and in so much pain. I am trying to go back to work, but I am in so much pain it is hard. I walk with a cane now, so everyone is like "what happened?!" I lie. Because "I tried to kill myself" is not an acceptable answer. 

I need to be dead. I know that, but I don't get why I keep living. 

I want to hang myself. Well try again. I still have a scar on my neck and no memories of the first time. But the method is more contained and supposedly reliable.  

The mere fact that I am alive now is stupid. There are people who are sick, in pain, etc... who have families, friends, happy lives and who WANT TO LIVE. Why can't I take their place? Why do I keep surviving. I don't really believe in god / a higher power, but at this point, if they do exist, they have a sick sense of humor.
