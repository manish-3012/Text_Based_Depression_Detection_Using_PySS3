Suicide Attempt Story, and also suicidal thoughts are coming backThought I should share this just because tonight, memories are flooding in. Now Iâ€™m telling this because the thought of attempting is starting to come back. So I remember maybe I was 17 or 18. I went through quite a struggle because Iâ€™m also a alcoholic but couldnâ€™t get my hands on them because (of course) I was still underage, Iâ€™m currently 19 about to turn 20 next month. I remember it was like maybe 11 or 12 at night and I waited for my sister to fall asleep because my family was out of town (just me and my sister) so i went to go grab my momâ€™s prescribed pillâ€™s and took about maybe only 15 pills because I couldnâ€™t stand the bitter awful taste of it, but maybe a few weeks or so, I decided to do it again but around 30+ pills and of course, I was devastated when it didnâ€™t work (believe it or not) so I waited about a month or two, I just went for it and went for 61 within 30 minutes if I remember exactly, and that was the final attempt and I hit up my friend about what was happening and how I was feeling numb and shit, and *sigh* it was hard to tell him about it. It was three attempts in a matter of 3 or 4 months. Something nobody knows about me besides a few friends is Iâ€™m a alcoholic because I want to numb my depression, And now because of the thought of it is coming back, I really wanna go back trying to attempt some more just because of family issues, &amp; also tired of feeling like shit, alone, and whatever
