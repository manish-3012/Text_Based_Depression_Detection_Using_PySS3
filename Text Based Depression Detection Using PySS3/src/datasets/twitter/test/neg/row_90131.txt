I should be happy but I'm just gonna commit tonightAs a second wave approaches and my city is back under full lockdown. I have to say I'm tired of this shit.

I literally don't have the energy to continue. I should be happy, I've kind of been keeping busy during quarantine. It's just not enough.

Everything feels 10x more annoying and frustrating. Ive not seen my friends for months.

This isn't worth it. Im done.
