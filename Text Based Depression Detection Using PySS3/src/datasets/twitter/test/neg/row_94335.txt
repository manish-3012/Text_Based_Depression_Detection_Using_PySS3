I have been feeling it for a while... Idk.... I don't think I'll make it to 2021, and maybe that's ok....Things just get worse and worse no matter how hard I try... Hell.... Sometimes BECAUSE of how hard I try.... It just seems like maybe I wasn't meant to flourish, and was made to wither into nothing
