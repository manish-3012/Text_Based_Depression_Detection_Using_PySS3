I have a impluse to commit suicide by overdosing but not intentionally, more of an â€œaccidentâ€.Instead of disappointing my family members from committing suicide, I want to do it but overdosing my accident so itâ€™s not like they knew I was suicidal in the first place. Im 17 and ive had this feeling for awhile now.

Does that sound like a good idea?
