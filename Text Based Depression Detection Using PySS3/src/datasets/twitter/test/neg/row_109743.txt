I cannot do anything anymore.i can't study. i left university in february and i'm meant to go back in october but i cant even consistently hold up a job for more than a few weeks without taking time off to be depressed. how am i going to be able to complete my degree? if i can't get this degree there's literally no point in me being alive. i hate myself so much, fuck. i'll never be loved. i'm disgusting. i hate myself. fuck my existence. jesus h christ.
