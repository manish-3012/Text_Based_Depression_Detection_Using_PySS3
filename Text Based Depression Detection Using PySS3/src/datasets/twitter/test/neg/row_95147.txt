UghAnyone have a bad month where youâ€™ve fucked up a lot at work? Iâ€™m supposed to be a leader at the office, but itâ€™s hard when you work yourself to death and the quality of your work suffers. 

It doesnâ€™t help when the previous manager who gets to work part time as sheâ€™s in retirement is still pulling the strings, and, criticizes you behind your back for the same mistakes sheâ€™s made.

If I wasnâ€™t in debt, Iâ€™d quit. If my body would let me, id get a second job. This one doesnâ€™t pay enough. 

I want to die. I have to wait a week to see my GP for med adjustments, and I donâ€™t know if I can make it
