fuck this fuck you fuck me fuck everythingiâ€™ve failed and woken up in the care of my parents. people say most people that attempt suicide regret ever doing it and to that i say my ass. iâ€™ve been daydreaming about how it felt to finally think i was going to be free when i counted the pills and made sure it was a lethal amount and gobbled it down. the extreme nausea didnâ€™t even bother me. i thought the abyss would be scary but even tho i was unconscious i remember how peaceful i felt. i felt content. i regret failing and seeing how it affected them. the only things that was bad about my attempt to die was the part where i survived.
