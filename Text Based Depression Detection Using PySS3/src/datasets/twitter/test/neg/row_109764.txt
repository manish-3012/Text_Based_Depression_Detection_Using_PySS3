For anyone struggling. 

Life is difficult. It's a pain. We all get hurt. We all suffer. I acknowledge that sometimes we wish to end it. Take this from someone who has contemplated suicide and who's adolescent sister has actively tried to. There are people out there who love you. They would rather you be happy and live. The existence of the Suicide Hotline and this page is proof. If you feel terrible, simply speak with someone. It doesn't have to be a therapist. A good friend will do just fine. No matter what happens, remember, you are alive. Your life is important. It has value.
