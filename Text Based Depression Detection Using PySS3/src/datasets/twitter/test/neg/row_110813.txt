I need helpI'm seriously considering taking my life right now. I'm so tired of life and all it's bullshit. I've tried talking to friends, but they don't get it. The thing is, most people would look at my life,and wonder how I got this way. My life is what most would consider pretty good, I have friends and family that care about me, I have a full time job and low debt, but  I just can't shake this feeling of emptiness inside me. I can't find a reason to go on, it all just seems so pointless.
