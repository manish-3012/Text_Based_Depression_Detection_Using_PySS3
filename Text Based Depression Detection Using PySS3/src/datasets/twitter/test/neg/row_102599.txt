Suicide helpHey everyone, please no hate.

Iâ€™ll try to keep this as short as I can since it could be so long.

Several times within the last few years my brother and sister have separately let me know they have been contemplating suicide. It has gotten much worse lately. Both of them have screamed and yelled at me wishing they werenâ€™t alive during conversations where they have confided in me and not liked my response on how to help them. Honestly I struggle with these feelings myself but feel that I would never follow through. We grew up with an agoraphobic mother who also has her own struggles and has threatened suicide to us on multiple occasions. I am 27, my brother is 30 and my sister is 25.

Iâ€™m making this post because tonight it got out of hand. Both my siblings are going through severe times. I met with both of them at separate times today due to their plea. I believe I was able to help my brother feel better for now. My sister however drove away in a roar of pain and madness after i tried talking to her.

 Iâ€™d love some advice on how to help my siblings. I have assisted them both through counseling in the past years. 

Thank you
