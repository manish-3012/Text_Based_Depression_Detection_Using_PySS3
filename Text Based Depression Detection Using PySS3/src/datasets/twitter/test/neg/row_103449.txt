I can't handle this worldEvery single one of us is a disgusting, selfish fuck. Every time I shower I think about all the fucking kids that don't have access to clean water. Every time someone hates someone else based on their religion or skin colour I think about one specific image of Jews in a concentration camp from WWII. I'm the kind of person that neo-nazis would want to suffer in same kind of conditions, just because I respect human lives despite religion or skin colour. 

I'm wasting resources, I'm wasting this planet, I'm wasting this life I was forced to have. I wish I'd never been born to see all this shit, all this suffering, people eating fucking meat and throwing plastic in the sea because hey, that shit makes the money happy. 

Seriously, fuck capitalism, fuck this world we live in, fuck this hate and suffering. I can't go on. I've done everything I physically can to help to ease the suffering of others but it still doesn't do shit, alt-right people are strong as ever and the refugees my country sends back because "it's safe enough" get killed. 

Doctors can't help. Everyone is focused on healing one individual instead of healing humanity as whole, and going to the roots of the problems which cause that individual human suffering. I'm not able to make this world a better place, I'm not able to inspire other people to do so either, so why would I be here, wasting resources and seeing myself deteriorate with time?
