I never thought Iâ€™d post on hereHey people.

I gotta admit, Iâ€™m facing one of those teenage life crisis. 

I hate to say this but the fact that Iâ€™m not getting truly loved and genuinely cared by anyone is killing me. It is eating me up every day and I honestly have no one to talk to. I do have friends(like what they all say) but itâ€™s just that I canâ€™t really tell them about all these stuff. I think in other words, Iâ€™m lonely.

I know loneliness seem like a mild issue but itâ€™s really making me very depressed and unhappy with life. I just donâ€™t know what to think and do anymore.

Also, to make matters worse, my school grades have been horrible. However, thereâ€™s something good though. Iâ€™ll be migrating to Germany next year.

Iâ€™m sixteen by the way and a gal.
