why do i try.i love this girl with all of my heart. every bit of it. i put all of her wants and needs before mine. yet she fails to act as if i mean anything to her. as we speak, shes getting all dressed up, to go to a club, and claims "their just friends" when i ask her not to dance all over guys... i want so bad to give up. many times ive thought about just ending it. my life i mean. i dont like my life without her, and when were together shes the most amazing girl ever. but when were aprt. shes the most selfish.. i do all i can for this girl. i go out of my way for her. i just put out 500 dollars so we can spend the summer together, since we both got a job at yellowstone, but she just doesnt seem to care about me...
