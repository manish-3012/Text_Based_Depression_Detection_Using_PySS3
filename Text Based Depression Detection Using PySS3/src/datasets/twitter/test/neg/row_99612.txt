I've made a mistake recently and the guilt is mixing with a lot of other pressures.So I goofed up this past weekend. Did something I'm not proud of, and have some friends mad at me. This is the first time that they've seen me at my moral lowest, and it really feels ugly. I'm super ashamed of what I did, and I regret all of it, but some of my lifeline friends are extremely pissed and it is coupling with the pressure of finals and some family drama to create a very difficult whirlpool of emotions for me. This is easily the most depressed I've been in a while, and I don't know what to do outside of continuing to apologize, which I've done already.
