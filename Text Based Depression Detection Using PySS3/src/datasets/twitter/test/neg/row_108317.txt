Every week, I get the motivation..."I'll go out and buy a gun this upcoming Saturday! I can't wait for it to end!" Then Saturday comes, and I can barely even muster the motivation to get out of bed. Then hope is renewed for a day or two, then I'm back to looking forward to Saturday. Rinse, recycle, repeat.
