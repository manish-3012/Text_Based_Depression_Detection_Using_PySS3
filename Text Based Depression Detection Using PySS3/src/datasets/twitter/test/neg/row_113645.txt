I feel like nobody wants me around and I'm just uselessFirst time posting here. 

I don't know how to start this. I'm 23, and I feel like nobody really wants me around. 
My parents love me, but I feel like sometimes they wish I were an easier person. We differ on a lot of things and I can't let the small things go sometimes. I love them so, so much but I feel like I weigh my family down and they would be so much better off without me.

When I try to change, the minute I revert to an old way, it's always thrown in my face. "You can never take a joke." "Why do you have to be so 'politically correct?'" "Why can't you let it go?" 

This doesn't even make sense.... I have many positive aspects to my life, but I can only focus on the negative lately. I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up, and that my family would be relieved without me around. 

I think the only thing keeping me going is that I'm too scared to actually kill myself and the thought of my parents finding my body. I also have a dog that I love so, so much and I can't imagine leaving him.
