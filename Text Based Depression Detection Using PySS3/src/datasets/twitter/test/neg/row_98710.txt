Anyone feel like they are just existing, biding their time until suicide?Each day I wake up with dreams of something great happening in my life, and then find myself swamped with all the regrets, failures, mistakes, and circumstances surrounding my life.  Every aspect of my life is in shambles, and I can't even get out of bed most days.  I feel like I'm just existing, hoping, waiting for some kind of change - and the only thing I have on my mind is suicide.  I want to end my life so badly - to be free of the horrors of my inability to survive in the 'real world'.  I don't know why I'm alive ... it's really just an inability to kill myself with a gun - if there was a button to push, I'd do it.
