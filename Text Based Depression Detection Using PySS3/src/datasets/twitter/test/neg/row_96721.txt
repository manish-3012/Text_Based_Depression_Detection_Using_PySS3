Thoughts about itHello there. First time actually posting on Reddit. I am 17 years old and I recently watched a show called 13 Reasons Why. Some of you may have heard of it but for the ones who havent it's about a girl about my age who commit suicide (I dont want to get into details). Well a couple years back something happened (I cant really recall what because it wasnt important, but I thought it was back then) and I was really sad. My parents were off the house and my little brother was out playing with his friends. I sat on my bed thinking all about the negative things that has happened to me throught the years and I grabbed a knife while I was thinking about all this, life, death, how can I be strong for everyone etc. Well for a moment I thought why the f*ck not? Probably everybody is better without my bs in their lives. I started thinking the reasons I should do it and I was so close for a moment. My mind blur and my hand was kind of shaking. Then I saw my little dog. Fairhful company since he was little, he came to me I cried really bad and I started thinking about the reasons not to do it. I realised that I have to fight no matter what, and that life will always be hard one way or another. I never thought about doing it ever again. At least not until I watched the show who reminded me of how bad it is for someone to do something like that and the impact that has on other people and that there are a lot of people who care and love you and they can help you. I now know for sure that I have to stand up and fight and if you can't handle it alone (which is totally normal) to get somebody to help you. I wanted to let anyone who thinks about something like that, that by doing this there are so much too lose and that there are options no matter how bad things seem /are. I am sorry for any spelling mistakes I am from Greece so I don't know how to write that well. I am really happy that I found somewhere to write about this kind of topics without having to tell my name etc. I am considering visiting a pshycologist because even tho I am passed these few moments of suicidal thoughts I had i still want to figure some things out and try to manage my anger and hate that I have sometimes. Thanks for reading and if you ever want help or someone to talk to, now you know who to messege.
