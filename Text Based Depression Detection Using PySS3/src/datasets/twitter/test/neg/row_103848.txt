I just want to end it all.Maybe tonight, I have roomies moving in tomorrow, but I really don't want it. Thing is it brings our rent down by a lot utilities included, so it's really hard to say no.... Especially when they cannot afford rent in the area. Fucking housing crisis! If we said no, they would literally be on the street tomorrow. No figurative/hyperbolic speak here, just on the street and nowhere to go.

I don't know where I'm going with this. I just wish it would all end already. If I have to go through 10 more years of this shit... It just isn't worth it. Life just isn't worth it. Nothing I do makes living worth living through.
