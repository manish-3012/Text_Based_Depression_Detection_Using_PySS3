Feel fucking hopeless. Need someone to talk to.Iâ€™m in love with someone who Iâ€™m sure will never actually be with me, despite her telling me sheâ€™s in love with me. I feel like my job is slowly sucking my soul out of my body whenever Iâ€™m there. Iâ€™m a 30 something college drop out with no real accomplishments to speak of, no career, no friends. 

Iâ€™ve battled depression and anxiety on and off since I was a teenager. Iâ€™ve had times in my life where Iâ€™m ok and maybe even happy, but it always always comes back to this dull, numb, sick sinking feeling of just being so tired of existing like this. 

The one thing I could say despite dealing with depression for so long is that I never felt suicidal. But that has changed in the past 5 or so years. And for the past few months, I think about it on a near daily basis. The only things stopping me are being afraid Iâ€™ll fail and feel even worse and my mom. Iâ€™m positive sheâ€™d never fully recover if I killed myself. 

I know there are things I can do to change the things Iâ€™m currently unhappy with about my life, but it all feels so fucking overwhelming. And then itâ€™s also like whatâ€™s the point if it always just comes back to feeling like this in the end?
