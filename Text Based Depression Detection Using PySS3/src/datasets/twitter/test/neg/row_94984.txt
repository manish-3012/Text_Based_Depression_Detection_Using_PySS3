Why am i always a fuck up?I've tried everything, I tried making everyone happy, I've tried to hide my feelings from everyone and just make everyone happy, but it never seems to work. Everyone is leaving me alone again. Everything I do I mess it up every close relationship I have everyone ends up leaving me and pushing me away. I can't deal with it anymore. The feeling of being alone is over whelming I just can't do it
