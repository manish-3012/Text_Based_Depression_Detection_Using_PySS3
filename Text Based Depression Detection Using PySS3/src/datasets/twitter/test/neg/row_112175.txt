Family is breaking apart. I don't know how to survive this.I just don't.

I don't see any way I can continue to live, after losing my mother, my home, and my dog I've had since I was twelve.

I have lost everything and my life and spirit is broken.

Even if I don't kill myself, the weight of my grief is going to kill me. 

I honestly can't see a light at the end of this tunnel. How can I go on without my family? *My brain can't process this shit.*
