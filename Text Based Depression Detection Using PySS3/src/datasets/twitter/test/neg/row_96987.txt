I probably need help. But I hate getting itI feel numb. I want to puke. I feel everything and nothing at once. I have a voice inside my head telling me what should I do, but I cannot do anything.

Iâ€™m not high or anything, this is just my everyday life. Now I know that I should â€œget helpâ€, but honestly I canâ€™t. I hate the idea of spilling my guts out to some old person who cares only about money. I am not really strong enough to risk not getting the right psychologist on the first time.

I know I can talk to someone online. But what for? All I get are empty phrases. â€œYou deserve betterâ€, well how can you know. â€œEverything will be okayâ€, again, how can you know. â€œYou can do thisâ€, you donâ€™t know me. 

I am aware that empty phrases are all I am deemed to get. I know that since I seek help online, I can never get anything real. But those shouts into abyss make me feel slightly better and listened to. Even though nobody cares nor knows. And I swear that if someone tells me to â€œget helpâ€ one more time, I wonâ€™t be able to control myself.
