well here I am about to leaveI am tired. tired of the lies tired of the pain tired of feeling the same my brain is broken the government broke it when they sent me to that hell hole. I was once whole you see no depression no bad thoughts but now the only thought in my head is it will never be the same you will never be normal again you will never be whole again no one loves you they tolerate you at best and a worst make fun of you when your gone. I am alive but I am not living I feel like I am a waste of space I have violent outburst and quite frankly I'm surprised my wife puts up with but I see her shes afraid of me now I'm no longer her special someone she fell in love with . Now i'm just a shell of the man I once was I can't hold down a job I'm angry all the time. I can't provide for my family. I think I will drive my car into the bad part of town and just wait to get car jacked. that way she can at least receive the life insurance.
