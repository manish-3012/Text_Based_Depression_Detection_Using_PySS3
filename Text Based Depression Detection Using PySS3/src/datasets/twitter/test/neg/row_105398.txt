ConflictedI know if I leave I will hurt the few people I have left that still care about me and that's the last thing I want to do. I know how much it would hurt my parents and some of my family members but I have virtually no friends left and I don't think the ones I have would care if I died. It's all I want. I have no self worth. I could care less what happens to me. I don't even want to be alive anymore.  I'm such a screw up and I hate myself more than anything, I can't do anything right and I don't even want to try anymore. I want to make it look like a freak accident but I can't figure it out. I just want to die. And it scares me, more than anything.
