I cry over everythingI cry very easily almost everyday over everything. Iâ€™m constantly overthinking and very small things can trigger me and make me cry. Itâ€™s very annoying and embarrassing that I canâ€™t control my tears.. itâ€™s ruined many relationships with friends/partners/family. I donâ€™t know what to do to stop this. I have depression and anxiety but I donâ€™t think this explains why my tears flow so very easily. I really just want to disappear at this point. Itâ€™s taken a huge toll on my life.
