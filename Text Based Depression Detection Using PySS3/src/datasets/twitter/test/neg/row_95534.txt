I wish I was brave enough.I feel so terrible about having actually got to this point, but I am now at the point of really wishing my life would go away - but not being brave enough to do anything about it. 

I have BPD, but since I live in the UK getting help for it is pretty much a massive fight. I have been waiting 3 years so far for therapy and I am not classed as being "serious" because I have not actually attempted suicide yet. The reason for that is my mother told me if I ever tried to do it she would be furious with me and I can't deal with the thought of dying with her hating me.

So now I'm stuck between "living" and nothing being able to kill myself, and I hate it so much. Living in this stupid country also means I am unlikely to be able to get any help for at least 2-3 more years. I have been on so many antidepressants, none of them worked (most I reacted badly to), I am now on Lofepramine but they say if this doesn't work they will take them away from me too but offer no other support.

I don't know what to do anymore. I can't live like this but I can't die.
