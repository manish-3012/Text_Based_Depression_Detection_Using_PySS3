No real relationship in 10 yearsI haven't been in a relationship in 10 years I have been rejected 5 times this month I am at the point I know I will never have that person to come home to, no one to ask me how my day was, no one to hold at night. 

I just want basic human contact I want to cuddle I want to look deep in to someone's eyes and know they love me. I want to look in their eyes and let our souls talk to each other.

I don't know if I can go on anymore this loneliness is going to kill me. I almost ended my life 9 times in the last 6 months each time was interrupted or malfunction of some sort. 

I'm afraid I might succeed I don't want to live in loneliness the rest of my life I'll end it first.

Help me.
