I just don't want to live like this. There's no point.I realized that I have been staying alive for people who I don't fucking want to stay alive for. My family moves between telling me how wonderful I am and telling me how much of a fucking failure and disappointment I am on a daily basis. Sometimes I wish they'd just come out and say that they wish I wasn't here so that I don't have to be betrayed because I thought they loved me. I'm never going to get anywhere. Being smart has never fucking helped me. No one gives a shit if you can think critically about social issues in the real world. There is no place for me. I'm a useless, cranky, unmotivated, ugly fuck and am a drain on the resources of this world. My accomplishments mean fucking nothing. My degrees mean fucking nothing. I mean nothing.

I don't even like to leave my fucking room. I refuse to hang out with my friends. I'm avoiding someone because they just got a job, and I don't know how to be happy for them because I'm too busy hating myself. 

I have two friends and three family members who would be profoundly affected by my death. Sometimes I just think that, for a couple of them, I don't mind the idea of them suffering after I die. Suffering after all the shit they put me through. That's fucked up. I feel bad for writing that. It doesn't mean it isn't true.

I've been contemplating suicide for about a year, thinking about it seriously for around four months or so. I guess I'm waiting for it to get bad enough that I actually do it. I guess I'm waiting for a trigger. I haven't been afraid to die for a long time, but I am terrified of failing. I'm scared of disability, disfigurement, losing my mental or physical capabilities. I'm scared of having to live with medical bills and not being able to finish the job. I know we're not supposed to go into details of plans, but I have an outline.

Now I'm waiting.

I just feel like a whiny piece of shit. I feel like I shouldn't have breakdowns over the stupidest things. I feel like I should be able to get over this constant anxiety, this constant misery and exhaustion. But I can't. I can't. Everything just takes up so much fucking effort. And I've been told my whole life that I'm smart and capable, but I'm honestly not even capable of leaving my fucking room, of talking to people without wanting to die. When I say I don't like people touching me, they all just roll their eyes. But it makes my fucking stomach turn. It makes me want to crawl under my fucking desk and never come out again. Everyone yells at me when I say I don't want to work in service. I hate talking to to people. I've literally had to go to the bathroom and try to silence my sobbing because I had what normal people might call a pleasant conversation with a stranger. I have panic attacks over conversations I had ten years ago.

I don't want to live like this. I don't want to be like this. I just want to die. I shouldn't have even been born. This is not a life that is worth living.
