Doesn't even matterEverything on paper seems to be going well. I'm going to be a junior at good University in a good major. I just got a summer job. I'm fit and have my health. I have friends and family. And yet, here I am. I come here a lot to read about people who feel that same way as me, in some sort of hope that there is an answer to fix this feeling in the comments. I'm not sure what to do. Everyday I wake up hating life even though it's great. The things I once enjoyed, no longer. I get irritated by social interactions. Everything seems so pointless and insignificant. I hate how fucked up this world is. That nothing matters. Seems like everyone else doesn't seem to care though. It doesn't bother them. Yet here I am rationalizing suicide because of it. They say you're suppose to talk to someone. I've talked to many people about it. From my mom, girlfriends, friends. I don't think there is any combination of words that will change how I feel. Talking is temporary relief at best. But maybe that's all we have. Temporary distractions to escape our lives. Except, for me, my escapes no longer work. I feel miserable. Maybe I should take anti depressants? But I fear they'll just make me numb or worsen how I already feel. I know, how can I help myself if I'm not willing to try? Fuck. The only reason I don't put a bullet through my head is because no matter how much I try to deny it, there are people that care about me. Whether I believe it or not. But everyday is torture. This is no way to live. It's so hard to ask for help. What am I supposed to do? please.
