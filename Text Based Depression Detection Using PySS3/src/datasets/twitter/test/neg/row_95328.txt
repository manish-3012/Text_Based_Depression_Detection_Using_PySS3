Going to see my T at noon today.I don't know why I am posting since I am having a hard time feeling anything right now. I literally feel dead inside. Totally dead. No emotion at all...Spock would be so proud of me. Sorry Star Trek reference there. 

I still am not eating, and the numbers have dropped significantly (as in I lost that 5 lbs. I had gained in the hospital in less than a week) on the scale. That is good. Less of me is good. Slowly starving myself. I have to say that most of that weight loss was within the last 2 days. 

No point to this stupidity. Just ignore me.
