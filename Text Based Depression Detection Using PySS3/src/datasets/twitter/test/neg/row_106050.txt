suicidal girlfriend.guys, i need some help. im worried about my girlfriend, shes not suicidal now. but before she met me she was. she nearly killed herself multiple times before she met me, its been 1 year and 2 months since i met her, im kinda scared that if she gets depressed she'll get those thoughts again, she told me that because of me, she has never been happier. i saved her. but im still scared, im scared that if i disappoint her she might get upset and have thoughts about killing herself, she means the world to me, and i mean the world to her. i need some help on how to make her forget those thoughts, i try my hardest to stop those thoughts, ive bought her many things to make her happy, ive focused more of my time on her more than anything else. i try to have dates with her as much as possible. etc... i even kissed every single one of the cuts she had on her wrist (41 cuts),ive shown her my family and they all love her. please give me some suggestions. if i posted this on the wrong place im sorry, its just, she used to be suicidal and im not sure if she still is and if she is im trying to make her forget all those thoughts. thank you, ill appreciate any type of answer really, anything is good enough.
