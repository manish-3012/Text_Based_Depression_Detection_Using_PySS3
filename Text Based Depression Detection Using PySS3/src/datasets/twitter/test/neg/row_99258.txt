I've tried 3 times in the past but I might actually have the strength now8  months of a depression and med switches.  I live for two people who I love.  I can't honestly say I love my parents anymore.  They are away at some camp and its just unbearable this new med switch has me feeling on edge unless i'm asleep.  I wrote a suicide note for the first time.  I don't think I have much time left.  I just want escape, living is hell and none of the suicide chatlines or anyone I talk to know what to do.  I'm really hopeless.  I'm sorry
