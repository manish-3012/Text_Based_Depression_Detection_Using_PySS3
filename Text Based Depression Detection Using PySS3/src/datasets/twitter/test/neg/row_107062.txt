Not sure I thought that I was just in a bad time in my life when I was younger so I did nothing about my anxiety and depression but over the last year things started to turn up for me.  I got a job that while didn't pay the best wasn't that bad.  I did decently at it and my boss spoke highly of me yet everyday I had to push myself to even go.  I continued to go for the fact that I wanted to keep the one thing that I felt happy with , my girlfriend . I started to hangout with her about the same time as I began my job.  It started about the same as any of my other relationships have in the past .... Drunk sex .... but it was more than that I felt something for her that I had never felt before for anyone.  Anyway we began to date and it was amazing.  I wasn't numb I was happy.  It went that way for about 6 months and without warning I slipped in to a depression that I could not shake at all.  I went into probably the darkest place of my life and had every intention of ending it.  I came up with a plan on how to do it and even a time and place.  It was a weekend I knew I'd be completely alone without any contact from anyone other than maybe text. It was in February that Firday after work I took all of my money out of the bank and put it in an ammo box and left a note saying for my brother to pay for as much of his first year of college as he could with it. I got up early that Saturday morning and packed everything I would need for that day . My last day. Nothing like putting a 12 gauge shotgun , box of shells , and a bottle of Jack in a bag and walking into the woods at 4am with the plan to never step foot out of there again. I began to walk and drink.  I soon made it to where I had decided to end it. A small cliff that had a creek at the bottom of it.  I sat with my back to the edge of the cliff in hopes that when I sent the buck shot threw the roof of my mouth and into my skull if I didn't happen to die I'd fall backwards and the that would do me in and as a last resort I'd drowned in the creek below.  I  sat there for hours in an odd almost silence. Just thinking how I'd be better off dead .  I continued to try and get the balls to make all of it go away by forcing more whiskey down my throat.  I said to myself that I had to do it soon before I either talked myself out of it or  passed out .... I loaded a shell into the chamber and took one last drink before put my teeth around the barrel or the gun.  I put my finger on the trigger .... then just sat there ... I started to cry.  I hated myself for it.  I remember punching myself as hard as I could in the face. I felt the blood come out of my nose yet I still couldn't end it.  I tried to bring myself to do it but I didn't have it in me. I felt so hopeless at that point. I headed back home and just stayed in bed until Monday morning.  I knew I needed help then real help.  I didn't want to tell my family or friends about what was going on so I went to therapy and paid with cash.  I got about another month in and broke down again I quit my job and moved back home.  I told everyone now what was wrong and they all seemed to want to help.  I started to take anti depressants and talking to people.  I had two more suicide attempts after coming back home but then I felt somewhat better and really wanted to change my life. I got a new job with the help of some good people and thought it was all going to get better.  Well I started the new job a week ago and I couldn't do it. Out of the 5 days I went there I had what I think were 3 panic attacks.  I couldn't stop them and quit the job yesturday.  I feel horrible I lied to my girlfriend about what happened.  I told her I was fired ... So here I am not sure what to do I feel sick.
