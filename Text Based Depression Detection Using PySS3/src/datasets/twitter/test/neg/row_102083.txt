i dont know what to do(15 ys old)
i never could get along with my family
i started to be unhappy when i entered highschool because i had no friends and i always had trouble making friends 
but when i was 14 i realized that the thing that made me miserable was my family
that year i got so bad that i had to remake the year 
a couple months before i got a boyfriend and he is one of the few things that make me happy
now i just had one of the biggest fights with my grandad and i dont know what to do now
he told me that i had to leave the house (my house is like a double house, sorry english its not my first lenguage and i dont know the world)
so now i have to move to my parents hose sice i used to live with them because their hpuse was bigger and they were less people
now my father told me that he is coming to work and he says that he is going to beat my grandad (from my mom side) because when i was in my room after the fight he tried to break the computer in the livingroom wich my brother uses too 
so that pissed my mom and they fight too and now shes crying
i also dont know how to handle things im too scared to kill myself, and i alredy talked to my school caunselor but my family told me their are going to take me to a phycologist (thing i ask them sice the year started) but they wont do it because it too expensive
i just want to dissapear 
feel free to ask me questions, at least it will keep me distracted
