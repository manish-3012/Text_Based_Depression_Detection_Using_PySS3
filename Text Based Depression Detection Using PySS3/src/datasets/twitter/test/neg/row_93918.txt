I don't really want to move on and keep on living.I've been in a relationship for the last six years, which turned long distance last year. We finally met after a year of not seeing each other in person, and while we had a good time, apparently the spark was gone. She decided to break up with me after our trip, so basically I don't get to see her in person ever again as my girlfriend. 

I understand most people will say that eventually you will move on and get past the grieving phase, but I don't want to. I just can't find the motivation to go on with my life, I'm basically a depressed person as is, and I found strength to go on in the fact that we had a trip planned and that we would meet again, but now that that's gone I just can't find enough of a reason. It's not that she's the only thing that keeps me motivated, but without her the rest doesn't hold up. I don't want to 'get over it' and move on, just thinking about it makes me want to die. I just don't see the point. 

I don't want to live regretting what I didn't do to keep the relationship alive, even if we were in a rough patch, it feels like I'm losing a limb. I just want to throw myself in front of a train.
