End is near...Can't even explain anything...15 years... Number of issues resolved... Tired to start afresh... End is near... If not helium or nitrogen then let it be drowning or hanging... Want to go for drowning... But my family should atleast get my body for the last time... And I'm sorry Papa for not feeling sorry and thus to stop... I just want to rest... Rest in peace... Not every life is meant to be... Let this one be thar one...
