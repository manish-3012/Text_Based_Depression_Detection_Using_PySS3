HelpIâ€™m 16 years old. The other night I made the worst mistake of my life. I messed up. My parents found out and went batshit. They took everything Iâ€™ve ever had and made me begin to lose contact with my friends. They say it is to help me but it just makes me more mad at myself for what I have done. They have shown my relatives what I have done and have told me that I am a mistake and I am no good in life and a flat out disappointment to everyone. I just donâ€™t feel like living I have been depressed and have not wanted to eat anything. I feel sick all the time and want to just run away from everything. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
