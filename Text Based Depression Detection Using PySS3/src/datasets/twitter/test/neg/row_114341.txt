I mean is there really a point to any of this at this stage of FUBAR?Well, I found this subreddit for a reason.

I can't go to the girl I'm dating (she broke up with her last boyfriend due to his depression) so that's a bust.

I can't go to my family. They just don't want to listen. Trust me. I've tried talking. At this point my best friend (my little brother) ignores my phone calls that I would give him every couple of weeks without response.

I never tried to put it on him either. I would try to talk about him and school and avoid how fucked my life was.

I knew he has a lot on his plate and with me being disabled last year, I know he just doesn't want to think about it. I hope he just hates seeing me this broken.

And friends?

Let me tell you about friends:

When you have money or some sort of power, they will do anything for you.

When you lose it all, even your best friends who you never saw leaving your side when shit hits the fan will forget your name before you can say it.


I'm 26, partially blind, unemployed, college drop out in 100k in college/medical debt, a victim of sexual assault, survivor of a stroke and right now, I'm seriously trying to figure out a reason besides my dog to live.

Please.
