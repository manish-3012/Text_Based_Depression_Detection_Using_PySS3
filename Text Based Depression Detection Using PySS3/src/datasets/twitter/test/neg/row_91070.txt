I'm a failure of a human beingI'm a 19 year old student who has zero friends outside of the Internet 
Haven't had an offline friend in 3 years now
I'm ugly and despise everything about my appearance 
I know I will never date again because I can't even make friends in the first place 
I'm too anxious and not confident enough to party and go out and act like other people my age, I spend my weekends staying up until 4 am browsing the Internet 
I thought these were supposed to be the best years of my life but I've wasted them and I'll never be happy 

The people who have bullied and abused me were right to do so, I'm scum who doesn't deserve any good things
