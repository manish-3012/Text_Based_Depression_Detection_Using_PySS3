Anyone have a cut-off date?I'm not really like actively suicidal but I definitely have something that I call a "cut-off date". I don't feel like I'm going to get past like 25 at maximum. Anyone else that like isn't really like actively suicidal in the moment but know for certain that it's in their future relatively soon? I mean like 25 for me is like in four years. So I've got like four more years of like fucking around before I can call it quits.
