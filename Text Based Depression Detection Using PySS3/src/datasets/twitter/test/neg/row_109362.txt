16I never had many friends. I had 1 until 5th grade then he moved. I went into 6th grade with no friends and thats when the depression hit me. I sought out love i sought out companionship. There was none. I looked to my family and they did nothing. My dad was always at work my brother offered me nothing except for a "go away" and if i didn't a punch to the face. I told my mom that i was going to kill myself. She told me to do my homework and stop crying. I resent them to this day for that. They were not there for me when i needed it most. I have suffered from depression on and off since them. I am currently a sophomore in high school. I am failing clases I should easily pass. My teachers resent me for my apathetic attitude and look down on me for not meeting the abilities of my brother(william and mary attende with a 4.2GPAish who is an state debate champion). I met a girl who made me want to live. A few months ago i finally had it planned out. I would ask her out on a band trip to NY city. I sat there and watched her fall in love with someone else for that whole terrible week. She still would rather be with him then me even though he has sexually assaulted her and clearly just wants to sleep with her. I told my friends about how i "used" to be depressed and they just laughed. I already know what my family will do if i tell them how i feel so i decided to go and ask random people on the internet for help.

BREIF VERSION: Im fucking worthless i cant succeed at anything i do. My friends are not really friends and my family dosent care if i live or die.
