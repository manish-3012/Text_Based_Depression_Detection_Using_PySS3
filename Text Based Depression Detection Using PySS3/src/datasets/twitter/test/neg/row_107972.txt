This could have been preventedIt really could have. In freshman year I went sent to the counselor because I wasn't talking to anyone and basically looked like a walking corpse. I was fucking dead. I was on the brink of tears in front of this woman begging her not to tell my parents that I was depressed. 
And she didn't. 
Three years later and it's even worse. This could have been prevented. I could be better now. I could not be on the verge of ending it all. But that's not the case. This fucking piece of shit looked at a kid talking about his depression about to cry his little fucking eyes and said "Fuck it, he'll be fine". God fucking dammit all.
