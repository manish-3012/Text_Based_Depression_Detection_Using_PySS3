I have come to 3 conclusions1. Is i just need to move on from her and forgive my self for the way i treated her and focus on my illness And personal growth 2. Is to just attempt suicide again and get this shit over with 3. Is to tell her how sorry i am and how much i love her and how i will never treat her that way ever again and treat her amazing. Fuck idk what to do but i am so sick of this cruel world. I cant deal with my illness and all my problems anymore.
