I ain't doing good (but I'll be fine?)So I know that what I am feeling is pretty "run of the mill" around here. This isn't a throwaway, but instead I'm a lurker as of recent. And honestly, I am not looking for someone to 'help' me out of this anymore.

For about 16 years I have been dealing with depression. And in that time, I have even succeeded to a point.... (I am still here)

But for the umpteenth time, I find myself sitting here alone for weeks wondering why I bother. Is a life spent alone worth living? Really. That's a legit question. 

I know some of you will read this and want to comment that you're here. But that's the thing... you aren't either. I have been living a life alone for so long that I don't believe that \*anyone\* is there to help. I have reached out. I have let my close "fiends" know that I am walking the line. They were kind enough to let me know that they were there to talk if I needed to (lol.)

They know me. I don't reach out for help... like ever. And the fact that I came to them looking for solace of some sort was a warning by it self. But then I also told them that I am ready to give up on life. The conversations naturally led that way because I am normally a happy-go-lucky kinda guy. I love to make people happy. But as of late, I can't even make myself smile unless I am thinking about ways to get out of life.

I am having a hard time finding a reason to continue beyond family and the (seemingly) persistent lie that things will get better. I have been trying/waiting for things to get better for the better part of a decade. And I just don't see a point in suffering anymore.

I don't know that I am presently suicidal. But I have had some actions and many, many thoughts that would leave a healthy person to believe otherwise. I am just so tired of feeling like yesterdays newspaper that everyone wants to throw into the trash and never think about for the rest of their lives. I want to be someone that is cared about.

And I don't know if that'll ever be the case...
