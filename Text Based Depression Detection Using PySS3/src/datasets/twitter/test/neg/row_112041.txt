What's the pointWhat's the point of getting up every day when you don't love yourself. What's the point of being unsatisfied when every problem you've ever had can be solved with one action. What's the point of living when nobody hears you or takes you seriously. 

The fact of the matter is, the world is selfish. If you're not mentally equipped to handle it on your own, you won't get help. Nobody truly cares until you're already gone.
