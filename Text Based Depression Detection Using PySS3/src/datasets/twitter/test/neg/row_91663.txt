Okay... idk if anyone here has a disorder/disability...while Iâ€™m a person who stutters and it has caused me to have social anxiety...Since Iâ€™m a person who stutters itâ€™s had caused me social anxiety and depression. Having a disorder sucks makes me feel less than human or makes me feel like I donâ€™t have any worth. Idk if I can keep going like this...tbh. I just feel so alone and hopeless like Iâ€™m a lost case.

Besides stuttering I have so many other pressures I. My life like college (speech therapy major) and I dint see myself doing something like that. But my father, his family, and other ppl around me are pressuring into pursuing something like this because of the stability and pay. But I donâ€™t like it and if I donâ€™t do this what else can I do as a career. Iâ€™m just lost asf in my life and itâ€™s giving me tremendous amounts of stress to the point where I feel like I donâ€™t want to be here
