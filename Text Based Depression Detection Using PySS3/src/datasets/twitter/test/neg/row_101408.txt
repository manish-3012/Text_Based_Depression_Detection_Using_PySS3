All I can think about is ending my lifeAnd I feel so alone on this. I've tried sleeping my thoughts away or going to class and keep myself occupied but nothing is helping. I haven't told anyone I feel this way, because I haven't cut in so long. My boyfriend told me if I ever did it would be the end of us. I just lost people in my family and I didn't feel anything. I just feel like I'm nothing to everyone, I've been betrayed so many times - by my own father. My heart is so hollow and my head hurts from crying all day. I just can't do it anymore. I don't want to live.
