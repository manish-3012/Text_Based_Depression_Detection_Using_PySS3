I've been talking to mom about, still doesn't get it.Depressed since 14. 19 is coming soon.
Still this black moon hangs over me. I want to hang with it.
there's a lot of nevers in my future. But I've made my mom cry and i'm glad I won't be alive to see the next occasion. The question is- do I write a letter? Do I record one last love song? Do I stick a middle-finger up and retreat into abyss?
