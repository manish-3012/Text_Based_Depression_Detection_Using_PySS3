Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem?Iâ€™ve never really bought about it whenever someone said this to me but now Iâ€™ve been thinking. how can someone be so sure that itâ€™s a temporary problem? I couldnâ€™t possibly imagine being happy while Iâ€™m alive. They say itâ€™s not that you donâ€™t want to be alive itâ€™s just how youâ€™re tired of living like this. I guess itâ€™s true.
