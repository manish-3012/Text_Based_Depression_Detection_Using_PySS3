HelloI'm posting here...well, I guess it's obvious why I'm posting here.  I really need to write, but I can't seem to make myself.  There aren't any eloquent words, there's no poetry or plot, it's just hatred.  I have a degree in creative writing and I can't even write anymore because it's like trying to push a whale through the eye of a needle.  I feel like if I tried to vomit it out it'd break my body in the process.  But I want it gone, I want it all gone, everything, and I have for so long, for so, damn, long.  As long as I can remember, and I'm almost thirty.  Every night.  Just lying there, trying to sleep on wet pillows, hoping I don't wake up this time.  Just sitting there, listening to every beat of my heart, and thinking, "Please just stop it, I don't want it anymore".  I get mental images of attacking my brain stem for the perception it gives me.  I don't want that anymore, it's not worth this.  It physically hurts me, feeling this way.  Last night I was nearly crippled with a headache, and my friends all advised me to take migraine medicine.  But it wasn't a migraine, it was reality, pounding in my head, the ever-present foreknowledge that comes with rational thought.  There's just so many questions, so many stupid questions with no answers, questions I can't even ask, much less answer.  I don't want the answers either, I want something different than the descending stair I see before me.  I know what's at the end of these stairs, and it's not pretty.  And the worst part is I have to speak about these things, even here, in such vague terms that nobody even gets to know what the hell I'm talking about.  I mean, what is it like to live with questions you can never ask, knowing that just asking them will invariably make your life a hundred times worse?  They'd sit like million dollar bills in the pockets of the starving, burning, weighting them down.  Sure, someone else could come provide food, could derail my future.  But they don't, or rather, they won't.  Nobody wants to.  Here, people are supportive, nice, and generally good to one another; leave, and it's like stabbing myself in the chest just to interact with another human.

I feel like love is the only thing left strong enough to save me.  But who would love a creature like this, awkward and jerky, unable to support its own weight?
