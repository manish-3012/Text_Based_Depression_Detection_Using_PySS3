Read this or don't. Everything's meaningless and I'll probably be gone before you respond.I'm 20 and i've been depressed for as long as I can remember. I've been suicidal from a young age (11), and it IS finally time I follow through with my decision.

The only reason I've made it this far through life can be put to one word... "Mum".

Mum, If you manage to see this please know that I tried for you. I promise that I never wanted to leave you like this. I only ever wanted to make you proud and love you forever. I can't take this anymore... Please believe that I tried. If it wasn't for you, I never would have made it through highschool and I will always love you for that. I just wish I had the strength and stability to continue... Goodbye Kelly ðŸ’™
