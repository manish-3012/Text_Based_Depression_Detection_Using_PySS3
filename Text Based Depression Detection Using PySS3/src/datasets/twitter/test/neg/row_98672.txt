On the run right now - helpI was seconds away from killing myself via jumping in front of a tractor trailer tonight. I just got out of a 28-day program for DBT, and am diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and BPD. My wife left me earlier this year, and the subsequent relationship I entered afterwards ended two weeks ago, terribly. Iâ€™m in love with my wife, and asked her to take me back. Her response, tonight, was no, not even if the alternative was killing myself. 

I was out of my car, on the side of the interstate, and I began taking a step towards a semi. I immediately got afraid and stepped back. Then I just started letting them go by. Then they stopped coming.

Iâ€™m currently driving around, and parking in random office parks; out of the paranoid fear that the cops are after me.  I am SO CONFUSED. I canâ€™t live, but I just canâ€™t take that step either. I was also planning to look into gasses that would let me do this painlessly at home.

Carrying on just means more suicidal ideation in a couple of weeks. Iâ€™m tired. Therapy and meds only take me so far. I am so tired, yet I canâ€™t take the step.

Help.
