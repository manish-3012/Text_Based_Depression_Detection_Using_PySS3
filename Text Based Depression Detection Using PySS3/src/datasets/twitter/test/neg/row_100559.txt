Should I check myself in a psychiatric wardI'm in my final semester of my undergrad engineering course and I've been struggling with depression for the past five years. I've attempted to end my life seven times and I've tried various methods but I'm still here. I really really tried to find the happiness in the smallest of things but I'm tired all the time and I can not do anything to help myself. I have been on medication too but it doesn't really help. I keep thinking that my parents would not be able to take it if I took my life but yesterday my sister gave birth to a daughter and I'm an uncle now. There's a reason for everyone to be happy in my family and my parents are really looking forward to taking care of her. I think now is the perfect time to end it all. I've carried a suicide note with me in my bag for the past four months and it just kills me that I have to live this terrible, tiring life. If I check myself into the hospital, they'd just keep me for as long as the feeling temporarily goes away and I feel that the feeling will come back once I'm out and faced with a obstacle. Please help me
