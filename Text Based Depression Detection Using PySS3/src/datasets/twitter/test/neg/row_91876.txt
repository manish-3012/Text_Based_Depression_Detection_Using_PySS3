Can a child recover from a parents suicide?Iâ€™m well aware of the downsides and negative effects of a child losing their parent to suicide. But Iâ€™m looking for personal experience/ statistics / anything ... that gives some hope that maybe, just maybe, the kid will turn out ok? Wonâ€™t be traumatized for the rest of their life? Be able to live, find happiness, etc. 

Anyone have experience / advice with this?
