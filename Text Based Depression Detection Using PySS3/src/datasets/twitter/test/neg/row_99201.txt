What is even the point?I don't want to just die, but I just can't find any sense or meaning behind life. Music is boring so I stopped listening to it, people have their own lives so I don't bother them with mine, I used to have so many friends but now I feel so alone and left out, I had people care for me deeply only for me to hurt them and again and again. Time keeps passing and all I can think of is how late it is getting to do anything, but still can't do anything because why bother? It's not like it matters. I'm just so tired. I want to know if it's all inside my own head or if I'm really going crazy and turning into an outcast. People still want to do stuff with me but I just don't want to, they bore me, I bore myself, the world is full of nothing. I feel like I'm just waiting and passing time before I decide to pull the trigger. I hope I either do it soon or find a cure. I feel more and more like I've got nothing to lose.
