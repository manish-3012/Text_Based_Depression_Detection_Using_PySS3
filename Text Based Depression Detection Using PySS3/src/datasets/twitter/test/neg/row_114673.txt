Iâ€™m pretty sure the girl I thought was my girlfriend cheated on me todayI dont know what to do I have no one I can talk to and  I feel so numb, why has my life been so shity Since I was born why do people hurt me so bad is it because Iâ€™m not attractive?  Is a life of Constant sadness really worth living?
