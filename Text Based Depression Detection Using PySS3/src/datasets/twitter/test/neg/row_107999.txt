Seriously think I might do it in the next week or two. Nobody cares about me. Facing this reality is unbearable most of the time. 

Because of it, I never really feel alive anyway, and now it's been a number of years where I've done absolutely fuck all but lie around feeling sad in front of a laptop, and I've ruined my physical health too.

Nobody cares, so it's a constant (and I mean EVERY SECOND) fight to keep my own life going, just under my own steam. 

To be honest, I've had enough of that struggle. I won't miss being alive. Nobody else will miss me. Maybe the world will run a little smoother without me in the way.

Merry Christmas. I wish everything had gone differently.
