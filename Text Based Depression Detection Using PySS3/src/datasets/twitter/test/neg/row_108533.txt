Can someone explain to me why one would get mad that other people care about them?I'm more of.a.drop in visitor from time to time in this Reddit. What I don't understand from a lot of the posts here is why so many people get mad because random people tell them that life is worth living.

These aren't paid or going to send the cops to your house like the hotlines will. Not everyone in the world is a jerk, and although most are...it's wise to realize that there are some good people out there that genuinely care.  They don't claim to know what you're going through half the time, so why take offense?

Anyone care to explain?
