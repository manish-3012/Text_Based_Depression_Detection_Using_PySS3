Hey.... My life before i actually die.Ive lived my life to 20 ive dated my own blood and ive smiled like it was halloween. Im a guy whos a gamer just another person right. This is my second time ive bit the barrel of my gun this week. Im alone. Just so very alone. Noone likes me for who i am and i have to pretend to be someone im not. Im 20 and never had a gf never kissed anyone nev' er hugged a non family member never cuddled never even held someones fucking hand. Girls all the time say *How youre so cute* or *Youre voice is sexy wtf* IF THATS FLIPPING TRUE THEN WHY DO YOU STOP TALKING TO ME IN 12 HOURS. Everyone just ghosts on me for no freaking reason. Its so dumb IM SO NICE TO PEOPLE I GIVE THEM EVERYTHING THEY WANT. I HAVE NEVER HAD ANYONE THERE FOR ME NOONE EVER. Why do i feel pain when i smile. Why do i cut and then i smile. Why do i wanna die and see if theres light why do i wanna cry instead of continuing on h this fight. Whats it like to actually have someone in your arms. Im in virginia usa. Im a guy. Everytime i try to seek help all people do are like call these people thry will help. YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT SUICIDE HOTLINE DOES? THEY TRACK UR NUMBER AND SEND POLICE TO YOUR HOUSE. THEN THEY PUT YOU THROUGH ALL THIS SHIT THAT THEN PUTS U IN FUCKING DEBT. How about instead of pushing someone off like that you freaking talk to them yourself. Im bleeding a fucking river here and legit if someone saw me bleedingto death in public theyd probably dial 911 on my phone and then walk away while i was laying there bleeding to death. Thats how fucked up people are. Legit noone out there who gives a fuck about me anymore, so why the hell not end it. I bet anyone who says im here for you will leave within 12 hours. So im not even guna bother. Ill be the one to leave within 12 hours this time
