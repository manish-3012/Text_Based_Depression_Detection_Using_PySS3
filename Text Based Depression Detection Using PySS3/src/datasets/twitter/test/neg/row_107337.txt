I've decided I'm ready to die.I'm 23, still living at home. Been unemployed for over a year to work on myself but I'm having no luck getting hired. I know I'll be unhappy at any job I do. I don't think I'm meant to be an actual adult. Don't think love is for me. I know my mom will be devastated but I don't feel like living miserably for anyone. Too impatient to wait till I'm in my 30's or later to find something I like or someone I'm happy with. So I think I'm ready to down my 100mg worth of Xanax with alcohol.
