I donâ€™t know what it real and my perspective feels messed upI know that I had to go to court as a child, but it wasnâ€™t a very big deal to be honest. I was forced to expose myself as a child to my older brother even though he did not want to see it. I mean, I was told to choose who to show myself to but I didnâ€™t want to do it with my brotherâ€™s friend. they didnâ€™t believe that I showed my brother, so I had to do it again. they were watching from a closet and I remember watching from the closet too. it wasnâ€™t that big of a deal but we were threatened by some older kids. it honestly wasnâ€™t even about me and I think my role was just to be embarrassed. I never really thought much about it until recently. 

after that, another neighborhood boy was curious about girls bodies so he convinced me to change in front of him. I was probably in early elementary school (1st-3rd grade?) I donâ€™t know, but I felt special being given gifts and attention by an older boy, especially when I was brushed off by my older brothers and the other neighborhood friends. I asked him to please turn away while I changed, but my mom walked in on it. I donâ€™t think anything happened - I donâ€™t know - but things become blurry at that point. I just donâ€™t know what really happened, but I swore to her that nothing did. Maybe things got weird, but I cannot confirm anything.

in middle school, when my mom asked if my dad raped me, I said no. I really donâ€™t think he did. she said I would come home from his house very lethargic and would lash out, but I was also very, very depressed at the time. I only had one instance of where I woke up with an article of clothing missing but I genuinely donâ€™t think any foul play was involved, honestly.  she asked my boyfriend about it around a year ago but he only knows my perspective. my parents never fought in front of one another so I donâ€™t know why this was brought up. 

I donâ€™t think I have any reason to struggle. sure, I had to take my clothes off but who knows what is real. Iâ€™ve always been hard to be around and I could be imagining much worse than it is. 

I cannot be over-dramatic forever and I need to be a better, more stable person. Iâ€™ve always been a burden and I cannot handle it anymore. None of this has ever been a big deal. 

Iâ€™m sorry I donâ€™t think this deserves to be said. I just need to get my shit together and grow up.
