Unbelievable amount of sufferingI just really can't cope very well anymore. 

I really just see suicide as an inevitable thing. Maybe not this year, or next year. But soon. 

I just can't deal with all this anxiety, and depression, and suffering. I can't do it anymore. All because of one mistake, one person. All because of that, so many aspects of my life are ruined. 

I can't deal with this pain.
