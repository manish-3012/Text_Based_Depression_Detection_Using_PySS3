I can't stand being just a failure.I'm probably going to lose my job because I'm picking school over it, but it doesn't change the fact that this is my fault. I shouldn't have changed my school schedule, because now it will interfere with work and I can't do anything about it. Back in high school, I tried killing myself because I was overwhelmed with all my classes, and now I feel the same, and no one can help me through this. When I need people the most, they are all silent, but at least I have the courage now to ask for help anonymously this time. How do I get through this? How can I feel optimistic about my own life when all I see are my failures?
