How am I supposed to find the will to live when even my family doesn't want me around?Since I've been a child my family members have made it clear that I have no value and that they wished I wasn't alive because my existence was a mistake. These are the people who I thought were supposed to love you and be there for you no matter what, I feel there must be something terribly wrong with me if these people don't want me around. Even though I have people in my life who said they would be saddened by me dying and that it would destroy them I still have trouble believing them. I feel as if they may feel sad at first but after a while their life's will become significantly better when I am truly gone.

I don't know how much longer I can hold out. I wish I had some kind of value, I wish I didn't feel like such a horrible and evil person. I don't want to make anyone suffer anymore yet I am selfishly still living which only causes their suffering because I am simply just existing.
