Time to go.I'm really done with it. I dont understand it anymore. Just everything. I acted fine for a long time but really I can't take it no more. Being drunk everyday to numb the pain, wanting to hurt people, afraid to get out of my house, no job, messed up school, keep failing at driving lessons. Then my girl going to some rave tomorrow probably cheating on me or something. I wanna leave her but i can't live without her. I hate her. She seriously should have never been bore with her fucking drug problem and thinking it's fun going to this raves and leaving me at home, cutting myself up and trying to drink myself to death. I'm so sick of this shit. I wish everything would've been different and i would get into heaven and live a happy life. But it can't be like that. Dont know what I did wrong but yeah. Should probably just end it. I think in hell i have less pain then here, and honestly I just wanna leave this planet. So I'm sorry, and if you read this, i really hope your rave party was worth my fucking death, but you caused this with your BS and ignoring my feelings. Yeah i might be a little crazy and different, but i try my best. I just hope and pray and pray god will still let me into heaven...
