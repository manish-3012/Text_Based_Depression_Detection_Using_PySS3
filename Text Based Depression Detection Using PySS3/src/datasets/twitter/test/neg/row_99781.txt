Today might be my last day.Im FTM transgender and I have been depressed and suicidal for a long time. I'm 19 now and i have not accomplished anything significant. I graduated high school and moved to another state to live with my mom. I thought I would go to the community college here but I ended up working at McDonalds. I wrote my suicide note and will a week ago because I felt the end coming. This morning my mom snapped at me for waking up 5 minutes late. At this point I feel as if death is better than coming out to everyone, disappointing everyone. Not to mention the cost of hormone replacement therapy and surgery. I feel calm and anxious. I dont know what comes after death, but I guess I might find out tonight. I dont want to die, but I dont want to live this way. Help.
