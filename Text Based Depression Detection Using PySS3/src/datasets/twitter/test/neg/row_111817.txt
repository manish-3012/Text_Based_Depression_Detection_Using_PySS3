Why is it so hard to convince people that death is a million times better for me than living as a trans person (closeted or not)?I'm not desperate or hopeless, no I'm just pissed off because I have to spend another day on this cursed planet in this cursed body because people would feel sad. Like god damn it. It could all be so nice and easy. I could just have my peace, but no, I have to wait for a "natural" death so it's not MY fault and everyone is satisfied. I should probably ask to increase my antidepressants so I feel less emotional about this situation, but it doesn't make anything better.
