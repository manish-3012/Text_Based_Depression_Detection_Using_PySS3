Eating disorder &amp; drug addictions are destroying meThrowaway for obvious reasons

I've had anorexia since I was in my early teens [Im 18 now], and I've resorted to diet pills and speed to get me through the day/ to continuously lose weight &amp;amp; it's draining me and my SO's income.  I tried marijuana when I was 15 and whenever I start feeling like I want to "recover" I just get really stoned and binge eat only to sober up and get really pissed at myself. I had to quit self harming because my husband doesn't approve, but before that it was a huge part of my life. I got caught with weed in high school [I was supposed to graduate this year], and I got thrown out. I had a 3.9 GPA and I even made a 31 on my ACT. Biomedical engineering was what I wanted to do. I'll be lucky now to get into a community college. I don't know what to do anymore, death just seems right, you know... Like the cozy blanket of comfort and acceptance I've always wanted. 
I hope my SO understands.
