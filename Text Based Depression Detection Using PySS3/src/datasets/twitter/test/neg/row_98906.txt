I canâ€™t take it anymoreI went to see a doctor to get my medication changed and she said that some people in the connected subacute hospital were uncomfortable with my texts. I know itâ€™s my fault, but it hurts so much. They were all so nice I had no idea. Serves me right for wanting connection, even just superficial connection. I just want to die, this has validated all my â€œparanoid delusionsâ€. Iâ€™m good at hiding it but it hurts so much.
