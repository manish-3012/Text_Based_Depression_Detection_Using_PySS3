Only living to keep my mom sane except now I'm starting to care less about her feelingsNothing is wrong with my life. I've always been incredibly spoiled and everything I wanted has been handed to me. People would kill to have my life, except I'm in so much pain. From the moment I wake up every morning, all I can think about is how I want to die. I'm so miserable having to live that the idea of permanent nothingness is the only light I can see. I want to die so badly but I've been putting it off because of the guilt of knowing I'll be putting my mom through the same pain I'm experiencing if I were to die. She begs me all the time to not hurt myself and makes me promise never to end my life. I don't know what to do anymore. Lately I've been feeling less guilty as if her feelings don't even matter.
