I don't know if this is the right place, but I just need to talkI don't know if I'm suicidal. I don't know really what I think I want to do. I don't even know if that makes sense. I just know that I sometimes am scared I've irretrievably messed up in my life and should just cut to the chase and end it. It's irrational and it makes no sense with just a moment's thought, but still it nags at me.

I'm 21. Going to be 22 in March. I feel like my life is going nowhere. I have no motivation, and it's making my school performance abysmal. I've been stuck in community college for nearly four years now, and I fail or withdraw from most of my classes. It's not because they're hard, or because I'm stupid or anything... It's just... boring. Doesn't motivate me. It's simple and non-stimulating and draining. And every week it gets worse, because I look back, and see how my laziness, my lack of motivation has screwed myself over, and it just gets harder and harder to try.

It's probably not helped by the fact that I have precisely two friends in my life, neither of which go to school within 500 miles of me, and both of which I'm terrified to speak to about my problems for fear that they'll see me as pathetic or something. In my years at this college, I have not made a single friend. I feel like I have no one to talk to, even though rationally I know I do, but I can't bring myself to talk to anyone because I'm afraid of how they'll see me. 

I'm just rambling now and I don't even know what I want, but I just feel like I'm going nowhere and every day I just get this niggling feeling I should just take the easy way out. Maybe I just need to talk to someone but I dont know how.

Sorry if this is the wrong place for this.
