In NoctemI am alone.  I have many a few friends, most of the people I meet I never talk to after some time has passed.

I have been slowly losing faith in God, and Iâ€™ve been growing to spite him.  Spite him for giving me such a horrible life growing up, watching people who did sin and who did do things I was forbidden to do.  I watched all of them succeed in life.  Every time I get a chance to do something I ruin it for myself.  Iâ€™ve never accomplished much, if anything in my life.  Itâ€™s always been â€œnot all the way but almost...â€, almost is never good enough.

Iâ€™m writing this because in case I do die early, in the chance I do not live a filling life, I want those who did know me to understand that while I have always felt alone, Iâ€™ve had hope.  Iâ€™ve always had hope, and dreams and just imagined a life that wasnâ€™t me.

Last night I dreamed I was back visiting my old elementary school.  When I woke up from that dream I realized those were the happiest moments in my life.  The part of my life when I barely had anything compared to now.  I was happy then.  

I only reason I havenâ€™t committed suicide yet is because of the shame Iâ€™d feel for my family.  The feeling that theyâ€™d have to cope with it.  Things would never be the same if I did.  That same shame is the reason I want to leave this life.  I have been nothing but a failure throughout most of my life.  I havenâ€™t drunk a sip of alcohol, never tried any drugs, and Iâ€™ve havenâ€™t even kissed a girl before in my life.  Iâ€™m almost 25 and I havenâ€™t done any of that.  I try to meet people, I try to be nice but at the end nothing works.

On nights I just pray that I do die in my sleep, just give me another chance at rolling a nice life.  Just let me restart my life Iâ€™m in right now, give me the chance to start my life from the start in the hopes I donâ€™t fuck up again.  Iâ€™d be fun you know, maybe Iâ€™d make the same mistakes again, maybe I wouldnâ€™t.  Itâ€™s better than this.  I just feel so lonely and so tired all the time.  

Iâ€™m not afraid of dying, if it happens then so be it.  The only ones who would be really hurt would be a few friends and my family.  I wouldnâ€™t bring my family shame, and they have another kid who will be destined to soar beyond the bounds.  Iâ€™m content if I was to die.

I just donâ€™t know what to even write here.  No one will ever see this and in turn no one will ever know.  Maybe in that space of infinite data, in the far future someone will find it.  What message would I bring to that person?

All I know is that I canâ€™t die because I signed a contract and I would work until the end.  I would give this my last shot in life and I will keep living this chaste life.

When I do meet death, Iâ€™ll ask him why he took so long and Iâ€™ll greet him like family.
