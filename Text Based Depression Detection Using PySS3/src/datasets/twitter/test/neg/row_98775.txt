Can crisis/suicide hotline chats track you?Throwaway because people irl know my main account. 

Basically what the title says. I'm in the US if that matters. I want to call (well, chat), but I know that sometimes they'll trace it and call police if it's a serious enough risk, and I can in no way, shape, or form afford being institutionalized. I'm already scared enough to get help (last time I tried the therapist more or less told me everything was my fault...), but I want to try again before I do anything drastic. 

Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask, thank you for your time.
