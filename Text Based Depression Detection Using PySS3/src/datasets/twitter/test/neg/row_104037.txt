I feel like life's not worth it...(I'm not extremely suicidal, but I consider it a lot) My friends treat me like shit (excuse my language), my family is too defensive for me to point out flaws or really have my own opinion of anything (sometimes I feel like I don't even have a family), and I have trouble with my crush so I feel like I should just give up.

I feel like no one really cares about me. From my friends clearly hating me and finding my existence annoying, to my family who is only ever mad or using me, and my crush which to be honest probably has no reason to like me.

I'm pretty sure I'm just a waste of breath and energy for people, so I really wish I could end it, but I'm not sure I could bring myself to do it. Plus I'm afraid of pain, and I'm afraid I may regret the decision. I just don't really have any support in my life. I really am sorry if this even bothers or distracts other people on this website from getting help they need. I just want help too, but I feel like I'm selfish for it (no, I don't think someone else on here or even in my position would be selfish, only I am).
