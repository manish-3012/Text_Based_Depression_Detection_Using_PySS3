I'm losing hopeI feel everything slipping away and im slowly becoming detached to this miserable life of mine, every day I cross my fingers and hope that I can finally give myself that final push and end my pathetic fucking life

Nothing is worth it anymore

I don't know why i keep trying

I give up

Im tired
