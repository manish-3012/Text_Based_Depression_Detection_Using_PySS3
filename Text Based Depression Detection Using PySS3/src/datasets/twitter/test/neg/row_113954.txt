i am ready for the next realityi have had enough, life can be a wonderful thing, but when your heart is fractured and your health is gone it is time to return to the stars from when we came

i have lost everything my partner of fifteen years has left me, everyone has shunned me and is afraid of me because of my poor mental health

i am trapped living with the memories of unresolved child abuse, living with my abusor i must pretend it never happened my health is too poor for me to escape

there is only a small part of me that is still alive, i am in pain every day

i never belonged here 

it is time to go
