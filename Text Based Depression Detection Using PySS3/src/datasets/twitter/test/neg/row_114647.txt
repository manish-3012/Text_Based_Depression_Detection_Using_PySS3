I have to make up my mind soon. Since high school and throughout college I've steadily alienated every person I've had any connection to. A part of me is self destructive and I constantly sabotage my own plans. It's been so long that it doesn't bother me anymore. I live alone during the school year. I sit through classes silently and spend all of my free time in bed. During the summer I stay with my parents and rarely leave home. Debts are accumulating and I don't have a future in my planned career. I don't feel anything anymore. 

Thinking about my parents is the only thing that has kept me from seriously considering suicide but now it's becoming harder to ignore my impulses. It feels natural that an empty and selfish life should be concluded with a selfish act. 

I've been planning my 'departure' for months. Soon my family will be out of town and I'll be able to go peacefully. I just wanted to talk to someone before I made up my mind.
