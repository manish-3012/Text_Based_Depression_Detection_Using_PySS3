Itâ€™s slowly killing meI donâ€™t even know what i do now, i canâ€™t eat. I canâ€™t sleep. Im just sad all the time. I donâ€™t feel safe to open up to my friendâ€™s either and i do not want a therapist at the moment. Ive tried so much. Im so stressed out and i feel really empty. I feel worthless. I feel like i have no value anymore. It would feel good to talk to someone but im really scared to open up to my friends.i canâ€™t do this anymore.
