Think of all the possibilities!I can't help but think how everyone that I know, their lives would be improved, their days happier.  If my life ended, the life of others would be more ideal without me. Days far happier, crushing sanctions lifted!  I would leave relatively few things behind.  The people I would know would put on their show of emotions, and then get over it quickly.  But more importantly, no one else would notice, besides the few people that I am forced to deal with day to day.  One thing they just don't seem to understand is that they simply cannot talk me out of it, should I decide to.  No one can.  It is just the way I am, and nothing can change that. But most importantly, I cannot stand living.  If you happen to read this, have a good life.
