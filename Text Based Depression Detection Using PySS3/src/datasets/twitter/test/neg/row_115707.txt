Iâ€™m tired.Iâ€™m looking for help.

Iâ€™m sorry. I typed a lot more, but I felt stupid over sharing about my issues and sorta started over.

The most important thing is that Iâ€™m a father. Iâ€™ve always tried to be there for people in my life. Iâ€™ve always been someone people could depend on, but I donâ€™t share what Iâ€™m going through because Iâ€™m afraid of what people would think of me and I donâ€™t want to burden anyone else with my problems.

Iâ€™ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts since I was in my teens. The mental image of my siblings finding my dead body was what carried me through. I didnâ€™t want to do that to them. Iâ€™ve tried to cope. It just seems like the longer times goes on, the stronger the darkness gets. Iâ€™ve been struggling to stay afloat, and my daughter has been the only thing keeping me on this side of the dirt for the last decade. Lately itâ€™s getting harder and harder to stay afloat. Iâ€™m tired. I keep telling myself I can make it till sheâ€™s 18, and moved out, and established, but I donâ€™t know if I can make it that long.

I tried to open up to my best friend, but we didnâ€™t really have time to talk, and he just told me that I would be ok... that Iâ€™ve always been a fighter. Iâ€™ve been fighting my demons my whole life. It seems like they never stop, and Iâ€™m tired of fighting. Now I just feel stupid for trying to talk to him. I tried therapy for a couple months, but I ran out of free sessions and I canâ€™t afford to keep going.

Iâ€™m struggling to find reasons to keep going. I donâ€™t know what I hope to find here. I guess Iâ€™m just hoping to find someone else whoâ€™s been here and listen to why they kept going. I havenâ€™t told anyone how broken I feel or how exhausted I really am. Iâ€™m afraid of what they would think, or that they would see me differently and that would just make things worse.

Please help me.
