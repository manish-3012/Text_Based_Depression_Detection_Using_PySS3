Someone I know is actively killing themself and I don't know what to do**TW/ OVERDOSE**

I don't know if this is the right place to post this or if it's even worth it anymore but I don't know what to do.

Someone I follow on Twitter is actively killing themself. Almost 4 hours ago they confessed to being on the brink of overdose, and over 2 hours ago they were already feeling the effects. They haven't been active online for the past two hours. 

I've been continuously reaching out to help and keep urging them to call the Suicide Prevention Lifeline but they haven't responded to any replies from me or anyone else. I would call the lifeline myself but I only followed this person, I don't know them personally at all. I could find their name, birthday, and the city they live in, but I don't think that's enough information to actually *do* anything with - they're still practically a stranger. 

I'm worried it's too late. I'm worried they're already gone. And I don't know what to do. I know I don't have to solve every problem, maybe there's nothing I can do, but it has been horrifying watching this slowly unfold all night. 

Is there anything left or is it over?
