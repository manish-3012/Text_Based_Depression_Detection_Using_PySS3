Help. Iâ€™m fucking drowning here.I posted here a while ago, but didnâ€™t really get much response. I guess Iâ€™m just hoping for someone to read this and have some kind of helpful suggestions. 

Iâ€™ve been off work because of severe mental health issues for most of last month and all of this month so far. I tried going back for a week at the end of January, but it was a disaster. I definitely couldnâ€™t do my job - itâ€™s hard to talk to hold a coherent conversation with a customer when youâ€™re completely unable to concentrate and keep bursting into tears at random intervals, you know?

I just got my medical EI in place, so I have a small income coming in, and I just celebrated one year sober, so I thought things were finally on the right track. Now my roommate is talking about moving, so Iâ€™m facing having to find a new home. I seriously doubt there are many landlords who will accept me with no job and my poor credit. Iâ€™m in debt, and canâ€™t even pay enough to stop the collectors calling me. 

Iâ€™m on meds, but Iâ€™m pretty sure theyâ€™re not helping. I have a psychiatrist appointment next month, but thatâ€™s so fucking far away. 

Iâ€™m just feeling so at the end of my rope right now. Iâ€™ve been struggling with this for most of my life, and Iâ€™m getting worse, not better. It seems like every time I solve one problem, two more appear. My life is such a mess, and I donâ€™t know how I can even start to tackle it when I can barely even manage to shower and feed myself. I just want off this train wreck of a life, and it feels like suicide is my only option. I just donâ€™t want to hurt anymore. Iâ€™ve spent all morning sitting in my room sobbing, and I honestly think Iâ€™m going to get drunk out of my mind tonight, or kill myself, or both. 

Iâ€™m so fucking tired, and Iâ€™m so ready to be done with this pain.
