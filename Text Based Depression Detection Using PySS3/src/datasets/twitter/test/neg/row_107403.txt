A life of suffering ahead.
In just under a year, I have gone from a high functioning person with a job and a full life to a person who has: two suicide attempts in one month, abuse-related trauma from reckless sexual behavior, a restraining order pressed against her, an arrest/a year of mental health jail diversion, and many destroyed relationships. I started becoming very ill right when I turned 24 and have been diagnosed with BPD. 

Iâ€™m in so much pain and donâ€™t know how to rebuild my life. I am starting a DBT-certified program on Monday, but it is only for 10 weeks, and there are very few options for treatment afterward. Only 11 residential hospitals in this country can effectively treat BPD, and many of them are self-pay. 

I want to die, but my family loves me so much. It breaks my heart to think about how much sadness and grief they would have to go through if I were to end my life. It is so hard for them to see me completely dependent and debilitated with no idea how to help me in a way that will last long-term. 

My fear is that I will be in and out of hospitals for the rest of my life. Iâ€™ve started researching the best ways to end my life. Iâ€™m tired of being in constant agony.
