super sadAlways been depressed since second grade 15 in high school now and it is getting worse. I have no friends(where i live just online people) now my family sees me as more of a problem than anything else. So far I've tried to kill myself 3 times by hanging I also have tried drugs like weed and painkillers. I see no point in going on anymore I am miserable every waking moment and want it to end. I just wish i wasn't ugly and weird and someone actually cared about me. I have no self esteem or confidence I also have no hope in myself or the future shit just seems to be a constant spiral down. The worst thing to ever happen so far is the girl I liked called me a "fucking loser". I don't blame her though because so far it is true especially since I failed this year of school pretty much. I just can't take it anymore honestly I am considering suicide again and I just want to finally be at peace. Also I have tried to talk to my parents but they just get mad at me. :( (i wrote this at 2 am so sorry for shitty typing I am gonna sleep)
