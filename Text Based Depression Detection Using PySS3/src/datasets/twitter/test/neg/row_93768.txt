Prefer to DieI have been seriously depressed for a really long time, and I'm not entirely sure that's going away, but I'm on medication and have been for awhile. No matter how I feel, I would prefer being dead to being alive. 
Being alive is just such a waste. What point is there to go through this whole shitfest? It would be so much nicer and so much easier just to be dead. I don't want to have to deal with all of this, and I can't see myself living long even if I did decide to stay alive. 
I guess I'm just wondering if any of you feel that way as well? Death just seems comforting to me.
