A Friend in NeedHey - so a friend of mine really needs help getting to and from a doctors appointment to try and get on medication for chronic depression and worse. He's very suicidal, and I keep telling him that just because his brain doesn't produce enough neurotransmitters, that it's okay to use prescribed ones - he just needs to get to the doctors office to do so.

What i'm requesting is any assistance any of you could recommend, any services or reach-out programs, organizations, etc. They live in northern Colorado, 970 area code, He is twenty years old, N.E.E.T., and is in a toxic, abusive household they have extreme difficulty in getting financial independence. I can provide more information if needed
