stop trying to fucking guilt trip me*â€œyour family will be so distraught if you hurt yourself!!!â€*

*â€you have NO IDEA how much of an impact suicide will have on those around you!â€*

*â€œimagine the reaction of your parents! imagine them reading the note! receiving the call!â€*

wtf,,,, i know you have good intentions but *please*

is this really supposed to make me feel better? 

all it does is fill me with guilt,,, and fills me with the realization that i have to live in fucking pain until the day i die,,, or until everyone who â€œcares about meâ€ will die.

*goddammit*
