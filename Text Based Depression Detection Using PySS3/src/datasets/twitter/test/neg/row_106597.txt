What Would I Not Want to Miss Out If I am Dying soon?Can anyone just suggest what are some nice things I can do for myself before my time is up? What are some awesome things/exeriences in the world that you think I should give a try? I almost never enjoy myself and never had been happy, also have missed out a lot of eye-opening experiences in life. I will do it for myself if any of it is do-able with my circumstances.
