Into the void...I don't know why I'm doing this.

Maybe I do.  I can't talk about the way I'm feeling to anyone I know, because they'll just cart me off to the hospital again, and I *cannot* go back there.  It was awful.

But that means that I'm alone, and have no one to turn to.  I have these fantasies of killing myself.  I work at a pharmacy, and there's insulin there, and I wonder to myself, can I kill myself that way?  But then I'm afraid of pain, and I don't know if I could stick a needle in me enough times to inject a lethal dose.

Then there's the bridge I pass over every day on the way to school.  Is it high enough that if I jumped from it, I would die?  Or would I just injure myself horribly, ending up in a worse position than I am in now?

I've tried suffocating myself with a plastic bag over my head, but at some point I always panic and rip the plastic off.  I wish I could just make a decision, you know?  I don't even care which decision it is at this point.  I wish I could decide to live or to die.

But as it is, I exist in this nebulous in-between state, where I'm too tired for life, but too scared to kill myself.  I know suicide is a selfish option, I know that makes me a horrible person - but I just don't care anymore.  I just want it to be over.  But I'm too weak to end it.

I have family visiting me in a couple of months, and I don't want to see them.  I am so ashamed of the way my life has turned out, and I can't watch them judge me.  And they will - my sister's kids are bitingly honest.  So I have a month or so to decide what I want to do.

Is this the month that I finally do it?  That I finally take the plunge and kill myself?  I hope so.  I hope I have the nerve to take that last step.

I don't know why I'm doing this.
