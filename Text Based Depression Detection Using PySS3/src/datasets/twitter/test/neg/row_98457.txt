This is my goodbye.In an hour, I will die. I will do it on purpose. I donâ€™t care anymore and itâ€™s all over how much? 

Doesnâ€™t matter. I wonâ€™t become homeless again. Iâ€™ve done everything to survive. Then the government literally fucks me over, I canâ€™t pay like $35 for one night of where I live so I can make other arrangements. 

Iâ€™m not packing all of my shit again. 
Iâ€™m not gong to starve again. 
Iâ€™m not going to be attacked again. 
Iâ€™m not going to worry again. 
I wonâ€™t let them worry anymore. 

Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion some of us are supposed to die. Some of us are supposed to fail. Some of us are supposed to lose. Why? Otherwise the world doesnâ€™t work. People all around you need to see disaster in order to stay in line or whatever you wanna call it. I think some of us are either arbitrarily picture just picked I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m a father of grown children the youngest sibling have a big family and she tell you all some thing that I canâ€™t turn to any of them. Am I bad guy? No. I donâ€™t think so. No no I think so but can I find a reason? Beside being worthless? Dealing with depression my whole life? Going through such an abusing divorce that Iâ€™m not myself anymore? 

But it had to be something I did right? Otherwise why would I be sitting here messaging a bunch of strangers who arenâ€™t going to Think about this after the time they read it? Have I try to fix this? All day. But itâ€™s not gonna happen this time. So I look at it as maybe one less depressed person on the streets Iâ€™ll Iâ€™ll make it my best to make it look like it was an accident . Hopefully will help my kids. And I feel horrible one of them. But I canâ€™t think about it. If I do all I am doing needlessly suffering from something I canâ€™t fix and that is my being a failure. 

Im so sorry, baby girl. 


Sorry I canâ€™t write anymore. This is killing me alresdy.
