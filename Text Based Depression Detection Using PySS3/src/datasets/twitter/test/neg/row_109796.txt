Please change my mind.I am finally leaving. All the planning, all the thinking, and today is it. I feel at rest, determined, but part of me wonders if thereâ€™s is something I missedâ€”something I didnâ€™t consider. So I am asking anyone here to change my mind. 

I am leaving because I am nihilistic. I donâ€™t see the point of living. I have friends and family who love me. I am good at school, I have a good future. However, I donâ€™t find satisfaction in these things, I donâ€™t feel anything at all. Iâ€™m bored and tired. Human existence is only meaningful to themselves and I donâ€™t find it meaningful. But I believe in God, and Iâ€™d much rather be in heaven than on earth. Even if thereâ€™s no God, I donâ€™t find existing attractive. People will be sad, but I wonâ€™t be there to witness it (yes Iâ€™m heartless and selfish). They soon move on, they will be okay.
