I have no desire to live anymore.I lost my best friend the love of my life. I'm blocked on all social media platforms. Zero communication can occur, I miss the dog we got together. I've been trying to get better since the breakup, but I just can't. Every day is one day closer and by the end of this year I doubt I'll still be here. I miss you so much.
