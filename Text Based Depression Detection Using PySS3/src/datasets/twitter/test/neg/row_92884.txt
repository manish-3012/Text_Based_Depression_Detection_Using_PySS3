I just cant anymore.I have no drive to do anything anymore. I've been depressed my whole life but has always been able to push myself forward. The past year has been the worst though. I have no motivation to get anything done at work, and cant finish a semester at school. 3.5+ GPA and now I cant pass a class. I'm likely going to lose my job soon. My wife is fed up with me too. That she is at the end of her rope and cant be the "cheerleader" anymore. I just feel like a massive burden on everyone around me. That my existence is a net negative. 

I've always had the idea that I would never kill myself so long as there was even a faint glimmer of hope. But over the past year, I have struggled so much and have fallen so far, I don't think there is hope anymore. I have worked with so many therapists and tried so many medications and nothing is bringing back.
