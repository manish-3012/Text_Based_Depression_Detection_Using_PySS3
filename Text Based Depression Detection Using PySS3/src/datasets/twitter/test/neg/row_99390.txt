I don't think I'm meant to get helpI posted here a few days ago because Lifeline Chat turned me away while I was feeling overwhelmed and suicidal. I didn't think I would try again because it was such a bad experience, but I was feeling desperate tonight, so I did.

I waited an hour in the queue, and when I finally got to the front and clicked to enter the chat... boom. I get a pop-up box telling me there's been a technical issue and my only options are to start again at the end of the queue or to quit.

so I just gave up. there's no point in waiting again. something else will go wrong, like always. all I wanted was to talk to someone, but I'm not meant to get help. no one can actually help me. they just turn me away. I want to die. I can't do this anymore.
