I don't want to existI don't see a point in life, I'm considered moderately successful by my friends and family but I do not value my life at all. I am never going to find someone to share my life with (I'm gay) so there's no point in carrying on. I have bought my own house and I know which room I'd do it in and exactly how but I don't want to upset my family. This is my make-or-break year: if life doesn't work out in 2011 I'm not going to see 2012. How can I make sure my family aren't too upset?
