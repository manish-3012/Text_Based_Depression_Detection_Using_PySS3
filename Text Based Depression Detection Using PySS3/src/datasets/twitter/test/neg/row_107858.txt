March 14I've decided
Match 14th is the day I will die
I get out of school early Wednesday's so I'll get home and then I'll walk near the tracks and wait for the train
I've already been working on my suicide note since December so I just have to finish that and I'm set
My parents tried to send me to the emergency room for the third time today
I've already been hospitalized and I convinced them to let me stay but I'm meeting with my therapist tomorrow
I'll tell him that it was just a bad week (which it was) and that's all
