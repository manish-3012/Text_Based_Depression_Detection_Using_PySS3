PlanningI've recently become homeless after being kicked out by my mother (not before telling me I would burn in hell after I gave back her book about heaven saying I didn't believe in). I told her how I hoped it weighed heavy on her when I kill myself and she responded by calling me a coward...

I am staying at a "friends" right now. We have a very complicated relationship. We are both very depressed at this point so when he came home tonight I expressed how bad it was for me in particular tonight, showing him my journal entry detailing how it doesn't really matter if I died and all the steps I've planned so far. He responded by saying "I don't know what to say" Absolutely no reaction or attempts to help. I've gone into the downstairs room and I don't know how I could feel any worse than this. My supposed best friend has also abandoned me in my time of need. 

Anyway, my plan is to go back to where I had been living for years until one year ago. There I plan on seeing my friends and then OD'ing. 

I wanted to do so much more but it's just unbearable at this point. My dad is dead, my mother is dead to me, and I'm an only child. I'm distant from most of my family. All of my close friends are junkies so it's not like it would be a big surprise another one of us kicked the bucket. 

I'm just done.
