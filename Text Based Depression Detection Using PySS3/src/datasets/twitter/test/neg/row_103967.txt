I feel like I can't make it through every day without getting hopelessly discouraged about myself, and I'm circling suicidal thoughts.I've always felt alone, I have good set of friends, and some that would offer help if I asked it, but I don't think they are the naturally compassionate kind, and outside of a few of my immediate family, I feel starved of love. Compared to a few years ago, I'm miles better in my life situation, I have my own place, bought my dream car, have a job where I enjoy the people I work with, but I can't seem to find ambition to love myself. I see my life here as temporary, so a passing thought at becoming something significant in the cultural norms seems irrelevant, insofar as I have enough for myself not to be starving and can stand up on my own. I've never had a serious relationship, and within the last few years have definitely retreated into myself, I can't confide in my own true nature because I'm too deterred by insecurities, simple things I feel as if I already have the ability to fix given some effort. I don't want to sound verbose, but something in me, just instills a natural doubt over myself, and it looms heavier after each instance of it, like some call to the void. Perhaps its covid, or something from my past depressions, but I can't really remember being really happy, I can recall many times I've have jovial conversations or enjoyed the lack of seriousness in a moment, but not honestly sit there and thank God for satisfying my dailiness, and I'm ungrateful, and every day seems like a missed opportunity better taken by someone else.
