yAaAy!My dad brought me a new room(everything is new and I kinda miss my old room) and EVERYONE thinks I should be thankful and happy but I don't feel anything at all. I know some people would do anything to have money for this and thats why I feel like I'm being selfish and ungrateful. Even my mom said it to me. 

I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I feel like my depression stole the life from me. I also have bad migraines and I'm in pain rn. Emotionally and physically. Suicidal thoughts are the worst.

Sorry this post is messy but I don't really care.
