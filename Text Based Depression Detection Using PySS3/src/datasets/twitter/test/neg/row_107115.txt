Meaningless lifeI feel no significant desire nor purpose. No matter what could happen, I could be the luckiest person on Earth but I would still feel unhappy. I don't want to be an individual, I want to feel part of something greater. There's nothing worth experiencing for me, if not shared. But we are bound to be alone, aren't we? We are still imprisoned in our selfishness. Our perceptions differ from those of the others, though we reject any perspective beside our own. When I feel the desert inside I want to turn into sand too, but would that be of any use? Even if I killed my own pain, it would continue to linger in the hearts of other people. I hope someday mankind will widen its tunnel vision and escape this cage.
