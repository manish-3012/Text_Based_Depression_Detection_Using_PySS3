Mental health helplineToday i feel worse than the other days and im not seeing my therapist until the 30 of this month, i was thinking of calling a helpline my country has for mental health issues, i was thinking of telling them also about my suicidal tendencies but im afraid it'll cause a mess, like the police coming to my house, does anyone has experience with this kinda thing?
