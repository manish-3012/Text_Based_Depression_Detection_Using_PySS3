2:00pm and I feel like I want to die alreadyI was awake all night staring at a knife to my stomach and hoping I gain the strength to do it, to push the knife hard and fast and hope I die.

I know tonight I have a chance of doing it again.

How do I feel happy enough to not grab a knife, or a handful of pills, how do I resist the temptations and tell myself it gets better. 

I fucked up really bad yesterday, another part of my life where I dont succeed and just fail, i failed again and dont know how to stop failing.

Always getting fired, always losing friends, always getting into arguments, how do I stop, and how do I not kill myself over my failures.
