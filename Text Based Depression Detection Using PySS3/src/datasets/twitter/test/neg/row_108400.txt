i can't handle rejection anymoreRelationships undeniably are a human thing to do, and not having access to them feels inhuman. I think it is understandable to feel worthless when I am not worth for anybody. It really feels horrible to see all the people around effortlessly having nice things in their lifes and then seeing myself, alone in the corner, unknown and unnoticed.
i got rejected today again , i can't take it no more
