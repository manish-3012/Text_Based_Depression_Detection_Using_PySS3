No interesting titleIâ€™m so close. I will be fine all day. I will talk to people and feel happy, but it is short-lived. Everyday I am physically alone. Everyday I face alone. Alone with no change on the horizon. 

The people who I talk to, who care, are far away. They are lovely and I look forward to our conversations, but they only know what I can show them. Only hear what it is I am saying. In real life, where I live and breath, I matter to no one. 

If I died my body would be decomposing before someone found me.  Thereâ€™d be not point to a note accept to save the poor responders time.  Maybe I can just write â€˜I did itâ€™.  Now Iâ€™m laying here thinking where would be the right place to lay myself out. That would be the least amount of clean up as I do not wish to bother anyone.
