I feel like a failureI'm extremely sick so I had to take a whole week off of work, my boss told me that she doesnt want me to be in any of my future references anymore.because of this. Its the first job I had where it was so hard and I pushed through and tried my best, and it feels like for nothing. My other jobs I never kept contact with and aruptly ended and in uni I dont have any profs I feel close enough to ask for a reference. I feel like anything I do it always ends back in square one. My uni is starting next week and Im still so sick my.ears and head are pounding. I dont think Ill ever be able to succeed and both my parents are retirement age and still working. I just want to od on some of my medicine because it feels like no matter how hard i try its never good enough, i dont have enough discipline to do anything properly. This is going to be my second year of uni and I almost failed last year without even doing any extracurriculars. Being less than mediocre sucks but I realized im usually at the very bottom for everything i do whether its my job or education, if I go at least my parents will have less of a burden. 

Im so sick now I just want to od on my medicine and finish it off instead living a life where i keep failing no matter how hard i try
