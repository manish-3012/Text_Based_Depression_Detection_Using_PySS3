I feel trapped in my head and suicidalI suffer with on and off depression and anxiety. I thought I was getting better, but since last week my dark thoughts are back and I feel suffocated.

I'm stuck in a rural shit hole, I work as a coder from home. So dont have much social interaction. I desperately want to move away from this shitty place that I grew up in. But I'm so depressed I cant even think properly.

I've got a 13 year old son, and only my parents and sister. I've lost my friends and I'm terrified I'm going to be left in this place old and alone.

Its sucking the life out of me. My anxiety and compulsive thoughts are wearing me down. I'm so mentally tired I cant even think of how to make positive steps to get out of this place. I need help.
