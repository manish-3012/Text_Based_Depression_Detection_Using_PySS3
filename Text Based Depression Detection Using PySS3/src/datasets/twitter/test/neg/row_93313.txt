I want to be open about my suicidal thoughtsI don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I absolutely need to put something out there rather than keeping it to myself. Throwaway account because I don't want my friends seeing this or anybody identifying me. I may either monitor this post with this account or another that  I won't name. Either way, I don't think I'll reply.

I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for over five years now. While I have never made any proper attempts to kill myself, suicidal thoughts were commonplace for me to the point where I've been admitted into a psychiatric ward twice. I also have self harmed through various means in the past, but never to the extreme. After hospital, I managed to steady myself with meds and leisure activities that have kept me alright for about two years.

As of recent, these thoughts of suicide and hopelessness have become rampant yet again. I don't feel like talking to anyone about it. Not my family, not my girlfriend, not my friends, not even calling a suicide hotline or talking to my psychologist (who has recently discharged me due to no visible improvement or worsening of my mood). I can't imagine putting the burden on my family and friends by telling them I find absolutely no greater meaning to my life and that nothing matters to me because I'll end up dead. I get complimented about how I could do great things if I just tried more, but to me, I have no purpose. School is a fucking slog - it reminds me constantly of how everyone around me is set up for a great future with aspirations while I sit back moping like a fucking idiot. I can try as much as I want to improve my life, but the overarching existential dread will never go away, and I can only distract myself until I die, whether I die naturally or forcibly. I don't want to tell my psychologist because, since I'm under 18, telling him the wrong thing or anything he deems as harmful to myself will end up with him telling my mother and most likely have me sent back to the shithole inpatient unit. Plus, I fucking despise him and his weak approaches to trying to figure out what eats away at me. Being too lazy and hopeless to take my meds that I keep running out of doesn't help either.

I'm trying my absolute hardest to suppress the thoughts and act normal. I go from being depressed and numb, to furious with myself and destructive, to then being uncomfortable, anxious and nervous. I don't know what to do.
