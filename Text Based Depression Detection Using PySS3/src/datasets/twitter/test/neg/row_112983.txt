Made the decision.Last night I was in bed and thinking. I've been toying with the idea of ending it for months, just sort of imagining and idolising it, but never had the energy to say that it was what I was going to do.
 I was thinking about my future. I'm in uni now, going into 2nd year. 1st year was great,loved the course and the lectures and everything. I've come to the realisation that I have just lost interest in everything. I can't look at anything like that. I used to play guitar, but I don't have the energy to play anymore. I don't know what happened. 
I now realise that if I pass or not, which is irrelevant, I'll end up in a shitty flat with a shitty minimum wage job, no friends, no relationships. No one likes me, let along loves me. I made the decision last night that I am going to do it. I know when, where and how. I cried myself to sleep, not in fear or worry, but just in the knowledge that my life is over.
 I'm sorry to everyone I've hurt over the years. You can forget me now. I'll soon be in a different kind of hell.
