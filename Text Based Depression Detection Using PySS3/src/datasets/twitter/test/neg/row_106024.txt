It's not even that I'm all that sad......it's just that life feels like it has no meaning. Life just sorta bores me. Every week is the same shit over and over again. Welcome to the rest of my life I guess. Nothing to surprise me, nothing to be excited about, and the good feelings are always the ones that dissipate the fastest while the negative thoughts and emotions linger in the background, if not at the forefront. I say the words "I hate my life" and "I'm gonna fuckin' kill myself" at least once a week, probably more often than that, and while I'm usually exaggerating because my job pisses me off and stresses me out, there's truth to that statement.

I don't really see the point in *not* killing myself. I'm not actively contemplating suicide so feel free to ignore this post and help someone who actually needs it right now, but I know some day, I don't know when, I'll create a to-do list for the day, go shopping for myself, and by 7 or 8 at night I'll shoot myself in the head and that'll be it. Just needed to say how I feel.
