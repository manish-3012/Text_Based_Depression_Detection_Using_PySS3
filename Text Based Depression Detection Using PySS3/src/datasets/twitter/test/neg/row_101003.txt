I feel horrible everyday anymoreCollege starts in a week and I don't think I can handle the pressure. College was a last option for me from the start and I got pushed into it by my parents. The only reasons I'm still alive are for my girlfriend and the fact that successful suicide is incredibly difficult to pull off. I have been feeling this way for awhile now but the ever approaching adult life is making it even worse. To top it off I only have $1000 of extra cash on hand with a crappy job that I only work an hour a day for. Please help me, I need to be here to take care of my girlfriend.
