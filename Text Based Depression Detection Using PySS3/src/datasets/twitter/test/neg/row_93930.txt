Going to sleep now, hope to be in a better place once I wake.Iâ€™ve been severely depressed for about 8 months now, currently Iâ€™m behind in school because I was dealing with a funeral for my grandmother who passed. Now that thats over Iâ€™ve contracted the flu, I just keep getting kicked down and see little reason to continue putting effort into my life.
