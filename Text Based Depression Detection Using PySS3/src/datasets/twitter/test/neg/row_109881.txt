Love is a Lie.Everyone's a fair weather friend.  They make a whole lot of noise about love this and love that, but when I seriously (and I mean seriously) need help, they just scatter.  They get mad at me.  They feign helplessness so they don't have to feel bad for five minutes.  I have never wanted to die this much, I really don't see it getting better, people have treated me like absolute garbage since I was a child.  Can you imagine, grown ass people bullying a little kid.  Your species makes me sick.  I don't need a therapist, I don't need medication, I need to not exist in this Hellhole anymore.  Keep your fake love, your pointless hierarchies, your phony bologna jobs.  Have fun destroying the only world you get, you dumb cunts, I AM DONE WITH YOUR LIES.
