Can't work anymore than I do, but too many bills.Can't do any more work than what I do, need a flexible schedule so when I'm suicidal I can just leave as needed and I can't work more than about 16-20hrs a week.  The only thing in my town that I can find that fits that is ride-sharing.

I have about $450/mo in static bills, but now my credit cards are kicking in the interest and it is about to go up to $670.  Before expenses like maintenance/gas/taxes* I only make about $900-1k/mo.

My original plan with the cards was to enjoy a year then kill myself last December, but my dad kept crying so i decided to not until I ran out of money.  He knows I can't pay, but even knowing I can't work any more he said I should work more.  Is that him saying it's ok if I die now?  Kinda feels like it.

Looked into bankruptcy but it is way too complicated and just does not seem even close to worth the time. Not to mention it looked like I could lose the few things I own that being me even an ounce of enjoyment (like my computer from when I could work). I have $400 in the bank right now, over 250 in bills hitting this week and the car needs an oil change.  Probably looking at jumping off the parking garage by the end of the month. 

I considered just not paying the cards anymore, but they will probably just come after me in a couple months (5.5k on one, 2.6k on another I doubt they would just let it go) and I'll just be right back where I am now.  What is the point in leading people on that I'll be in their lives anymore?

Thanks for listening to me vent.


*Oh yea, I'll probably be fucked when the irs comes after me next year when I can't pay self employment taxes
