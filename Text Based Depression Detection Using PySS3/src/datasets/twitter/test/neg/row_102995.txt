Suddenly feeling this way for no clear reasonHello,

Sorry to be posting here. I donâ€™t want to inconvenience anyone by making them listen to me. I have had problems with bipolar depression on and off for years. Usually it comes on really gradually, but tonight it went from 0 to 100 in a matter of hours. I just keep remembering how not even my parents could love me and how Iâ€™m a huge burden on everyone else. My boyfriend is going to tire of me like me friends are tiring of me. Iâ€™m never going to finish school like I want. Iâ€™m only going to cause others trouble in everything i do, and I feel so incredibly guilty for it. I think that the only way I can hope to have a positive impact on this world is to end my life as quickly as possible. I donâ€™t want to do this, but it feels like the only reasonable option I have at this point. Iâ€™ve started thinking about the specific ways I could kill my self, though Iâ€™m not in imminent danger of doing so tonight. Which is why Iâ€™m sorry for making you read this. If anyone has tips on how to stop being a burden without killing myself, Iâ€™d be happy to listen.
