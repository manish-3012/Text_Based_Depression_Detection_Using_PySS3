I am seeing a psychiatrist in a few hours.I can't sleep, i'm scared to face thoughts i haven't thought about in so incredibly long, i have been depressed since i was maybe 8 and my memory of all these years is quite blurry. I am 20 now.

I scroll through this sub often, as it makes me feel less alone in terms of suicidal tendencies, knowing that so many other people struggle through this like me made me realise that I'm not weak, or pathetic. I'm just... Depressed. Like the rest of you.

Thanks for the perspective, but as of today i am unsubscribing and i am going to do everything i can to stop wanting to die.

One last question, is it normal to be scared of seeing a psychiatrist?
