I really need a break from living, maybe permanently, maybe for a while. Just a break.I'm absolutely shattered. I feel like i'm so tired from life, and it is just absolutely relentless.

I constantly think about attempting suicide, although I feel like I just need to make a cry for a help and do something just enough that I can have a few days and so people know my situation. I feel so selfish and such a burden, I wish I could disappear. I don't know what to do - I think I might go to the hill up my road and take a few pills and call an ambulance, but i'd be letting my colleagues down tomorrow. It's inescapable.
