everything is a god fucking jokeYada yada yada, I give up, yada yada yada, tried everything, yada yada ya. You know the drill. I don't have much time so here. I am: a bisexual living with extremely homophobic parents who would disown me if I came out, an anorexic in recovery who feels like a god forsaken tub of lard, a terrible friend who only makes snide remarks about people when she talks, a liar who can't tell her therapist what's wrong, and an all around waste of space. I have absolutely no one left, and my friends are beginning to disgust me as much as I do to them. School is killing me, and it's all A's or nothing with my family. I probably won't even make it to Christmas this years, and I have a stack of suicide notes in my binder. The pills are upstairs and the knife is a few seconds away.
