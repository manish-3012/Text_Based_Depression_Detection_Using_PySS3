WhyWhy should I continue to be on this planet when all I can manage to do is be a burden? Iâ€™m failing my uni classes, my girlfriend is upset that O donâ€™t want to move in with her so she found a male coworker to live with, I donâ€™t have a job. Iâ€™m just so fucking tired of feeling insecure and depressed and like Iâ€™m always doing something wrong. Iâ€™ve never been good enough and I never will be. I have no purpose other than to cause problems for those around me.
