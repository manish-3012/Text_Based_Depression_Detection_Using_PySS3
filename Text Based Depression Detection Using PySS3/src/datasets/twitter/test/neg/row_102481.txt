too ugly to liveI'm 26 and have been feeling suicidal since I was 12. This post is pretty much last resort for me since I've already tried nearly every suggestion imaginable including medication, exercise, adjusting my diet and circadian rhythm, and therapy.

I have persistent negative self-thoughts about my appearance. It's impeded my ability to work, attend school, or hold down a long-term relationship. Whenever I try to get help the usual response is, "Every girl feels that way," or, "You're not ugly." These oversimplifications usually make me feel worse, but it's all I can get from health care professionals, friends, and family.

I've been fired from jobs. I've lost literally all of my friends. I've been alienated from my family as a sort-of black sheep. I've failed out of school, even after numerous of medical leaves following suicide attempts, because I consider myself too ugly to be out in public. I've become an alcoholic and addicted to psychotropic drugs and painkillers.

I don't know what to do. I'm familiar with body dysmorphic disorder, but I'm not inclined to believe that's what I have. My nose is objectively crooked following an accident as a child. My breasts are objectively small. My feet are objectively big. My skin is riddled with scars, most of which are self-inflicted. I also have stretch marks on my stomach and arms from a growth spurt during puberty.

I've tried looking for help online thousands of times but have never found anything other than platitudes that are usually geared toward teenagers or soccer moms in a mid-life crisis.

I want to die.

edit: I'd prefer no PMs. Also telling me "it doesn't matter" is not helpful. I wouldn't have come here if I could believe that... I guess I'm looking for a miracle or something that doesn't exist
