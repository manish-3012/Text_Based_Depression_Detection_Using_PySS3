Everything seems fake and pointless.I feel like there is no point in existing or going on with my life. Everything in the world seems like itâ€™s a movie and not reality. I donâ€™t have a motive to live anymore, and the only thing thatâ€™ll stop me from killing myself is hurting my friends and family In the process. Life has nothing to offer.
