Tired of lifeMy situation is very complicated. Extremely very complicated. It seems like I'm always screwing things up and I don't get along well with my family. I already live 300 miles from my parents place. I thought living away from the city in a rural area would help which it did for a time but I feel that I'm at the end of my rope. I've already got a note on my computer for all the people I care about (and some that I don't) I'm not sure when exactly because I promised this girl that I know that I would get Sims 2 running properly on her Windows 8, so I have to do that before I go. The people around me don't like me going to see her because they say "you're just slitting your own throat when you go over there" He doesn't know it but that's not a good analogy for the situation. I'll show him what slitting my own throat is. I'm just tired of being a burden on everyone.
