Apathetic hermit. Why do I have to keep on living ðŸ‘ŽI remember how as a child I really resented being human and Iâ€™d always pretend to be a horse ðŸ´ or something. There was such a strong urge to be anything, but not a human. Back then life sucked, as it does, but I still had my friends, I still had video games to keep me going trough the hell that is this fucking existence. I didnâ€™t question anything, I just â€žlivedâ€œ. (More like I survived)

Quarantine, the final straw, ended my ability to feel literally anything apart from occasional nauseating loneliness, although that numbed down too. I realized that feeling is useless too. I have always been mostly apathetic, and didnâ€™t really care, because thatâ€™s the nature of apathy - you donâ€™t care about not caring.

I literally cannot feel emotions anymore and no one understands, to them I seem normal. Because I can function. But I canâ€™t relate to anyone at school. I literally canâ€™t do it, I feel like an empty shell, devoid of any personality, devoid of anything I care about, devoid of life. I am a ghost. Nothing makes me laugh anymore. 

For some fucking reason, life is not wonderful, even though it could have been. 

I could have been totally normal and happy. But nope I am fucked for life. And my entire being knows that, every cell is convinced, hence the inability to feel. I do think that life in general is worthless..


I am a shut in. I only ever saw people at school and that was good enough, or was it? I think it definitely wasnâ€™t, I barely made it.. then quarantine hit - no one texted, I was already depressed and it just spiraled out of control hard.

Nothing is funny, at all. Itâ€™s like being brain dead. Nothing is interesting. Nothing means anything. No one gets me. 
I could just lie in bed all day and be ok with it.


I will never be a normal social butterfly person. Itâ€™s far too late to repair this kind of damage, Iâ€™d need about 20 miracles. Jesus has been sending me weird ass signs, but they donâ€™t fix my issues..
