I donâ€™t want to die, but living isnâ€™t an option.Long story short.... I [F26]got diagnosed with an autoimmune disease last year. I got a severe depression and threw myself in debt of over 20,000 in payday loans because I didnâ€™t care. 

My girlfriend[F25] of 4 years left me 4 months and 15 days ago. 
Iâ€™m struggling with studying and most of my friends vanished. I go out and get drunk and party with them but go home crying and breaking things. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide before and everyday I struggle with not breaking down. 

Iâ€™ve gone to therapy and seen my doctor a million times but nothing seems to work. 

I wish someone would give me a hug and tell me everything will be fine. I wish someone would offer me their shoulder to cry upon. I wish my friends would visit me and not always be me that initiates.
I honestly just want comfort and love.
