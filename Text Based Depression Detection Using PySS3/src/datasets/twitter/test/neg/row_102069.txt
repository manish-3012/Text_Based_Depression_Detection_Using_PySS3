I wish I could sleep and never wake up.Ive been starting new meds and it just seems like after a few days they always make me feel worse. I got prescribed Hydroxyzine for sleep and as needed anxiety, I have 180 pills of it. I just want to take a lot of them, go to sleep, and not have to wake up. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore.
