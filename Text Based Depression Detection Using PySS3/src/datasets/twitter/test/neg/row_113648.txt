Should I kill myself for not wanting to work(doesn't matter which)Everyone says I need to go do work because I can't live without money and I end up homeless. I doesn't want to be poor or go do work. I worked in many jobs  and I absolutely hate it.  every single one. So is the only solution to kill myself ? Maybe the afterlife is a very nice place. Or maybe there is hell so I'm fucked. 
I hate this world. I hate this system. I just want to die and don't want to live. I feel am burden to everyone.
