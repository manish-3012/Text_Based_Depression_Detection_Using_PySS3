Am I subconsciously preparing?2 nights ago I got really drunk at my boyfriendâ€™s house (despite being 36 days clean), said awful things to my friends there, then went upstairs and cut myself because I felt awful. I even tweeted I wanted to die and received really concerned messages (including a professor from undergrad). Big what the fuck moment... Iâ€™m beyond embarrassed.

My boyfriend is really upset with me but I honestly donâ€™t care. I just want to be alone. I messaged him today basically saying Iâ€™m sorry and donâ€™t think Iâ€™m in the right place for a relationship. Iâ€™m definitely pushing him away. I just want to be alone. I donâ€™t want to talk to anyone and hearing â€œIâ€™m here to talk!â€ and â€œItâ€™s not worth it!â€ is just annoying the hell out of me. What is there to talk about? For some, I do think suicide is worth it and staying on this planet with self-destructive tendencies only hurts those who value their existence. Iâ€™m a burden.
