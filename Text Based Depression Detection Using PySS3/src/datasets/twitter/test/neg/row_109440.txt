PTSD is killing meI have dreams and wants, but the terror is what is killing me. I can't do what is required to improve my situation. I can't do a damn thing. I can't study, I can't work, I can't go shopping, I can't shower, I can't speak. I can' do anything. There is no help available - I've spent 7 years trying to get help but I'm done now. My life has been 22 years of living hell, and it feels right to die now, since I can't try any more. I'm done fighting just to keep breathing.

I am so sorry to anyone else who feels this too. This is no existence. There is nothing worse than this.
