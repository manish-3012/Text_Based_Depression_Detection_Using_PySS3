Boyfriend just broke up with me.I don't know what to do anymore. I've officially lost everything. I almost crashed my car on the way home from his house. It was a weird feeling, like something I can't describe. Although it wouldn't have been on purpose, the thought of knowing I might die or at least get seriously injured felt... nice in a way. Like I'm finally going to be free from all of this pain. Or at least have physical pain to distract from the mental pain and heartache I'm feeling right now.  

I can barely think straight.  

I'm just so tired. So fucking tired.  

I just want to sleep. Forever.  

I wish I had crashed my car. I really, really do. I know it's such a shitty way to think but right now... that's all I want.
