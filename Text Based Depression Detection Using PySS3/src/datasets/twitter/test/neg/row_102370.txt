I've done everything I know how to avoid this. Nothing works.I've been on so many different antidepressants, and other medications, for over a decade. Nothing works. I've seen multiple therapists, multiple times per week, for over a decade. Nothing works. I'm in an intensive outpatient program through the hospital here, teaching me skills from CBT, DBT, and collaborative assessment and management of suicidality. Nothing works. Chronic pain, disability, and unemployment aren't going anywhere. Staying at a hospital won't change my life. I'm trapped and there's only one way out. It's the most comforting thought I have.

I've fantasized about carbon monoxide for about a year now. I think I'm going to buy a hose, and attach it to the exhaust of my car. Etcetera. First, I'm going to drive to a remote location, since I don't want the carbon monoxide to endanger those who live with me, and I don't want to destroy the market value of the house.

I've written down a list of people who will be really upset about it. A grand total of five. I was staying around for my cat, who I loved with all my heart. He just died. Anyway, they'll get over itâ€”not quickly, but eventually. They'll heal and move on. I'll do what I can, in the suicide note, to comfort them and give them closure.
