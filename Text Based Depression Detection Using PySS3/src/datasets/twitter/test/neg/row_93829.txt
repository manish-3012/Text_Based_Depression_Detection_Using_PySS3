Iâ€™m done livingIâ€™m 17 but already fill like Iâ€™ve had my fill on life. Ever since the fifth grade Iâ€™ve had this sense of already knowing whatâ€™s coming next - pain, suffering and, the biggest, people. 

I have a boring life. Wake up play video games, go to school, come home, masturbate and repeat. Video games donâ€™t please me anymore, theyâ€™re just something I play out of self hate. I try working out but I always end reminding myself that Iâ€™m not worth the effort. 

I want to hate myself for wanting to die. But honestly whoâ€™s gonna remember or miss me. I hate my brother, sister and father. And even if my mom misses me sheâ€™ll forget soon. The school will probably have a couple moments of silence and maybe a mention at graduation. The few friends I have will forget too. 

I tried to think of a few reasons to live. But theyâ€™re inconsequential. Live for the cute girl sitting next to me? Live to keep my family â€œhappyâ€? Live for a bright future? 

Iâ€™m curious too. Iâ€™m an atheist but I still want to know what comes after death, if thereâ€™s anything. The sooner I die the sooner people stop talking behind my back. Plus no one really cares about mental health. â€œJust pray it awayâ€ or â€œGet over itâ€. Hell Reddit or someone at school can make a joke about me committing suicide later. I just need the right combination of pills to OD on or a tall tower to jump off of.
