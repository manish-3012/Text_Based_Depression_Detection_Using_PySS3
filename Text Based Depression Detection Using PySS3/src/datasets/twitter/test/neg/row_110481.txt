I want to kill myself. :27fI am completely terrified of messing it up, and surviving with a poor quality of life. I donâ€™t want to hurt my mom, but I canâ€™t talk to her about it. I tried to tell my boyfriend, but he doesnâ€™t take me seriously. No one is taking me seriously. I have tried asking for help. I tried explicitly telling my boyfriend how down I feel, and â€œitâ€™s always about me- always about how I feelâ€. I guess heâ€™s sick of it. 
The only way anyone will finally realize how bad I feel is if I try it- but Iâ€™m afraid. Iâ€™m a nurse, I know how badly it can turn out. 

Please someone listen.
