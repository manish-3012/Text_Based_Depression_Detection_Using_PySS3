I spend my entire day thinking about suicide, and suffer from constant nightmares.The trauma just never ends. All I can think about anymore is how much I hate my existence and life, and I'm miserable. I just think about ending it all. I'm tired of people telling me things get better, when in reality it may for them, but not for me. Things just get progressively worse, and I'm tired of popping pills to get a synthetic happiness for about an hour during the night. I'm just so tired of it. I wish I was dead.
