Moral quandary; terminal illnessI have been experiencing a lot of pain linked to a rare genetic disease myself and my family have called Huntingtonâ€™s Chorea. This disease targets the brain, and therefor the rest of the body as well. Symptoms include but are not limited to; involuntary muscle movement, all over burning pain, memory lapses and changes in personality that can be violent, hallucinations, slow of cognitive abilities or speech, etc. It is like having brain cancer, Alzheimerâ€™s and Parkinsonâ€™s all at the same time. 

I can see my personality changing, noticing more pain everyday, and the ever looming feeling of complete doom hanging over my head. There is no cure, it actually only gets worse from here and I am at the best I will ever be right now with steady decline for the rest of my days which in early onset stages, will likely be 30-35. I am 25 now. 

My question is this; is it evil to want to end my suffering before I am no longer able to be myself, before I hurt the ones I love because I have holes in my brain and say things I canâ€™t even understand, before I am not able to swallow or even shit on my own, or even be able to go outside and recognize when the day is beautiful. 

Is it so wrong to want to take my fate into my own hands before my disease does?
