I can't live with myself anymoreI've done so many horrible things in my past. I don't see any road to redemption in my future. At this point I really don't have a choice but to end this. 

Today it came out that I've been deceiving someone that cares about me. I couldn't even be honest about it, it was a result of snooping. It feels like this is the last straw for me, I can't stand myself anymore. All I do is fuck things up and hurt people. I can't even be mad about it because it's my fault.
