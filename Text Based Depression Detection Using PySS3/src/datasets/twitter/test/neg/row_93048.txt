It doesnâ€™t matter how hard I try, I donâ€™t succeed. Iâ€™m sick of the pain.I canâ€™t keep a job, I canâ€™t support myself, I never get the girl, Iâ€™m sick and tired of competing with people. Society is set up for people like me to fail. I feel like Iâ€™m going to do something really bad, hurt myself or someone who hurt me before. 

Iâ€™m sick of wasting my time and watching people surpass me in every way imaginable, it really doesnâ€™t matter what I do.

Why shouldnâ€™t I just end this pain? I never asked to be here in the first place and I canâ€™t even have a decent life, people have gone out of their way to make me miserable.

And then people will say â€œeveryone experiences painâ€, why do you keep bringing people into this shitty world then? Stop, please.
