I had a miscarriage.Previous related post: https://www.reddit.com//r/SuicideWatch/comments/4d529h/i_know_my_husband_and_son_need_me_but_its_getting/?sort=confidence

I found out the in the day after my initial post. It helps explain some of my emotions but I can't say it helps how low I am feeling. I know my husband cares but we're so stressed about money that it's hard for him to show he cares in the way I need him to. I hug and kiss my son as much as possible so that I can remember my purpose. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my post.
