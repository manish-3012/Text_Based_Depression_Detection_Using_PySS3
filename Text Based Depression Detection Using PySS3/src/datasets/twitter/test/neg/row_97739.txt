Itâ€™s Been Getting WorseMy friends recently found my account where they found some of my suicidal and depression stuff. I have not really been open to any of this information to them, so it came as a surprise to them. They now all act weird around me. I told them that I would try to be more open about my issues so I donâ€™t hold in all my emotions, but I just donâ€™t know how. Iâ€™m not used to telling people about my personal problems and I feel like everything is getting worse.
