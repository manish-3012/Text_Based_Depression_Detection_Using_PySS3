Today I was about to kill myself, the only thing that stopped me was the thought of my girlfriendI'm good.

I have friends, I have a loving family, a girlfriend, a nice pc, I'm curious of a lot of things, student debt is not even a thing in my country (even if it was, I'm only 16), I have pretty much what everyone wants at my age.

School is the only thing that isn't going well, and hasn't been for 2 years now and it has become like a black hole that sucks all my hope and my happiness.

I know a lot of you will think this is some petty 16yo bullshit (and that's OK) but to me school is the only thing I MUST do right, and yet the only thing I can't do right and it's so heavy for me because I feel that if I don't do well in this school I won't be able to get the degree I want and the job I want.

I fell like I've done nothing but deluding myself and my parents for the past 2 years. 

Truly smiling is a rare occurrence with my friends, it has become hard even to put the fake smile on while I'm out.

She's just the only person that makes me truly and wholly happy

I just can't do it anymore

Thanks for listening
