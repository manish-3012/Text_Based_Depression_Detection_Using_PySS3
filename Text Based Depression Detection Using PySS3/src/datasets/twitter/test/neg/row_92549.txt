I think I'm going to do itI've been feeling suicidal a lot lately, the last time I felt like that was one and a half year ago. I just can't take it anymore. I started working to fill my mind and it just sucks, now I'm tired mentally AND physically. Everyday I've hide to cry. It hurts so much, I don't think I even have a future. I can't talk to any of my friends because they're tired of the same talk. And my therapist is on a license. I'm tired of saying I'm fine for everybody to just leave me alone. I'm sorry for rambling, I'm feeling really f*cking alone.
