i wrote a note and i'm ready..buti know there is a very, very small part too far back for me to listen to that is scared to leave life. the thing is, life has treated me horribly. i am suffering so much on a mental and physical level. my story is heartbreaking and too horrible to even believe...i'm only 20 years old but i feel like an old woman from the suffering and pain i've been through. i strongly believe it's all over. i think for some people it really doesn't get better. and time and time again the world seems to be telling me i am one of those people. i know life could be amazing if i was only born someone else :(. i'm very scared to leave. but it is even more painful to stay...i can't come up with any reasons any more. why do so many good people have to suffer?
