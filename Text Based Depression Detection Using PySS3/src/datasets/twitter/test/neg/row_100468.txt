Today I give upI got stabbed in the back..hard... by people who, to be fair, arenâ€™t very important to me, but close friends or not it sucks to be treated like youâ€™re completely worthless. Iâ€™m an extremely sensitive person and it just set me off so badly.  Iâ€™m not going to kill myself today, but how the hell am I supposed to have any will to live when other people need me out of their lives in order to be happy.  Iâ€™ve spent too long wanting to die and I thought I was doing better but now I think itâ€™s just a matter of time
