Bad thoughtsI am in college, I may get in trouble for academic integrity violation for cheating on a test. I feel like if I get in trouble my life will basically be ruined. I might get expelled from my school, my parents will disown me and I wonâ€™t even want to face my friends if I get expelled. It would be too embarrassing. I just canâ€™t stand it, I donâ€™t want to go on already and I donâ€™t even know if Iâ€™m getting in trouble yet. I have a meeting with my professor tomorrow, if it goes badly idk what Iâ€™ll do. Iâ€™ve been having problems with depression and suicidal thoughts for a while, Iâ€™m on medicine... but this is too much. My life will go from on track to ruined.
