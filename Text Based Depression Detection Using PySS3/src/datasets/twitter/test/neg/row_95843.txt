Help, i don't know what to doSo im a 21 year old guy, and I've graduated from highschool a while back and haven't decided what to make my career so I've been working here and there trying to figure it out. 

I was engaged to my long time girlfriend of 8 years until last June, and we parted ways. Needless to say I miss her everyday, and wish things were different. My father passed away when I was 13 due to cancer. 

Anyways, I feel this constant feeling of anxiety, restlessness, and I'll admit I've had suicidal thoughts for quite sometime now. 

If I sit and think to myself, I can see potential in myself, great potential to acheive great things. But then when I snap back into where I am at the moment I just feel like curling up into a ball in my bed, and staying there all day. I've noticed that I've been in this rut since last year or maybe even a little longer, and now I'm just so desperate to change where I am.

As messed up as this is, I have thoughts, terrible thoughts of suicide everyday. Right now, I don't know if I would act on them just yet but I just really am not happy where I am and what I've amounted to at this stage in my life. It's really unsettling.

I feel so alone, and I honestly don't believe anyone can understand fully to what extent I'm hurting. I want the pain to go away but I don't know the best way to do that.

Please help, what's wrong with me?
