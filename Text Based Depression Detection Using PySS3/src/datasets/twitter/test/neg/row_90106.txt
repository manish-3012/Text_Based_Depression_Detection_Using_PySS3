My mom died last night at 8:10pm PT from an apparent suicide. The grief is overwhelming.She was 66 and the only member of my family who didn't shun me for my depression, OCD, and GAD. The rest of my nfamily are highly toxic individuals. I haven't seen her since 2007. My aunt (one of her sisters) also died of an apparent suicide. I tried to end my life many times. I guess I'm currently living proof that suicides run in families.
