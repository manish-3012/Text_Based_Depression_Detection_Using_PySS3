Everything that makes things â€˜betterâ€™ is just a temporary distractionIâ€™ve been having a really nasty prolonged breakdown the last week, Iâ€™ve definitely acted out against my family when I perhaps couldâ€™ve been a bit less harsh when weâ€™ve argued. 

Anyway itâ€™s Saturday, Iâ€™ve just been on a really lovely hike around the fields, Iâ€™ve not felt so mentally fresh in a very very long time- absolutely thriving you could say. 

I come in, excited to clean my room and have a long shower and my mum goes in on me about me having to move out ASAP if I canâ€™t â€˜change my behaviourâ€™, absolutely no regard for why thatâ€™s behaviours happening even though she KNOWS Iâ€™m not doing okay and has found a suicide note before when she went rooting through my stuff one time. 

We had a massive row and now Iâ€™m just sat in my room crying and drinking. Might take some pills later, might not, who knows. My only reason for living was to go hike the AT and then I could kill myself if I still wanted to, but clearly hiking just doesnâ€™t do anything because at the end of it you still come back to the same problems.
