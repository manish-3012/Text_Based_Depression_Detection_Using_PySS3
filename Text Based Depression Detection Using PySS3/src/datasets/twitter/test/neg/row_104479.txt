I want to help my friend but don't know howMy friend has had enough of her family. They constantly overwork her and treat her as the odd one out. Whenever she's out, having fun her parents ruin her mood by asking her to do something for them. Whether it be buying groceries, paying the bills, forcing her to work for extra money, she barely gets any time to herself. It doesn't matter if it's 8pm and she's doing her homework, her parents give zero fucks about her studies and forces her to do whatever they want done either way. This has really been showing in her grades lately. She used to be such a great student but now she barely gets time to study. Also, her parents don't care about her as all they care about is money. Furthermore, they're always giving her the unfair treatment too. Say her sister wants something, she gets it immediately. However, if she wants the same thing she gets shunned, yelled at, cursed at etc. This has been going on ever since she was born and she has reached her breaking point. I want to help her. I really do. She doesn't want this to cause a whole scene if she reports it to the authorities but other than that, I don't know what else to do.
