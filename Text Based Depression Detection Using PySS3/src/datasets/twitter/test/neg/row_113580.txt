i have add and borderline personality disorder and a whole lot more but not worth mentioning.

iâ€™m tired, and it get worse by day. i watch myself hurting others and myself and i canâ€™t do anything about it.
i canâ€™t do anything anymore, i cant keep up with talking, listening, personal hygiene, daily life etc
iâ€™m so tired of my mind, feelings and thoughts.
i cant control anything about me, if i let off a little smile or laugh , i instantly want to cry or i get mad and agressive towards myself.
every day keeps getting longer and longer and iâ€™m exhausted, i want to vanish, dissappear.
i donâ€™t care what happens to me, i dont watch out or look around if i cross a road, i run through red lights with my bike, i dont clean op wounds or anything.
iâ€™m feeling lost and lonely because no one is able to understand me because of myself. i canâ€™t explain this shit because i barely have words for it.

i wish i could vanish from myself
