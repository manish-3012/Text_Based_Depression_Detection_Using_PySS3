I'm feeling low and alone, too much abuse and hurtI just feel like I'm going through so much recently and I've been neglecting myself a little. 
I was an abused child. In every way possible. My various members of my family and then early relationships too. My sexuality was repressed as a result and so I've never fully explored it despite believing I may be bisexual. The reason could be tied into my abuse which makes everything so much more confusing too...early memories of both abuse by male and female family members.  My whole sexuality is repressed and sickly feeling. 

I am no longer in touch with my family. I find friendships hard because I can't allow myself to show vulnerability. 

I started dating a nice guy 11 years ago and now we live together. Hes been my rock and my world. Hes been loving and patient. He has just come out to be as potentially being mtf trans and has started exploring this. I'm fully supportive if that's the route he'd like to take but there is and small selfish part that's grieving and also very scared of change. I've really abandoned my own issues for and while now because he's needed my attention and support. 

But every now and then something will come up and it overwhelms me. I realise how broken I still am. I feel so lost and alone, I keep finding myself researching what I can hang myself with. Or painless ways to die but I don't think I can bring myself to do it through fear of not existing! I mean nothing can't be too bad, it's just nothing. I'm 28 and I just can't imagine myself dealing with this mental battle for another 50/60 years. I'm not sure what I'm looking for on here, I think I just needed to vent.
Thanks for your time
