Nothing else to fixEverything in my life is falling into place now. I have my own apartment and finally get to live alone, my dream, I was offered a position with a professor in my grad program that I've does the work I really want to do, I have a wonderful partner who loves, cherishes, and respects me, I'm seeing a therapist, I'm taking medication, I'm trying to talk to friends more. 

So why do I still feel so shitty. I've been depressed for four years now, anxious all my life, and it just gets worse. I've kind of adapted to my anxiety over time, but my depression morphs and never gives me a break to learn how it's going to get me next. 
I'm just really tired of feeling like this and I don't know what else to change in my life to make it better. 

I want to kill myself. It wouldn't be difficult. I know it sounds stupid, but I'm not too afraid of death. It's just a natural part of our cycle. I just want my time to come early. Thinking about how I've only completed a quarter of a decade of my life and that I still have so much to go makes me so exhausted to even think about. 

But I can't do it, because it would destroy my family. My parents would not be able to handle it, they would commit suicide too, and I can't do that to them. 

So my own life isn't mine, and ill continue living my life until my parents die.
