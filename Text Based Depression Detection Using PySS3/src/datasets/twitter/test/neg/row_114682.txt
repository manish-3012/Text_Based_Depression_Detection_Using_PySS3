One questionWhat do you do when you have a problem, you know the solution, but for you, it is an unattainable solution?

Edit: What if you lead an empty life of misery and disappointment? You were denied your childhood, abused by nearly every adult in your family as well as the people near your age. Imagine getting through that and then having another crushing blow...only this time there's no way out. There's no solution and you're obsessing? You're on your last leg and just when you start to see where you could bust your ass and fix most of your problems...you realize you have a problem that can never be fixed? Wouldn't suicide, then, be the logical decision?
