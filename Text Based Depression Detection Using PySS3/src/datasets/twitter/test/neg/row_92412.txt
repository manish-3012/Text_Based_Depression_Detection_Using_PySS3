Tonight may be the nightIâ€™ve been discharged from my therapists office because my new meds have messed with my sleep schedule so much that Iâ€™ve missed too many appointments. They wonâ€™t see me without making me speak to the person in charge of admissions. They arenâ€™t in until Monday. It feels like Iâ€™ve been given up on.

Iâ€™m so exhausted. I donâ€™t think I can make it until then. I just want to rest.
