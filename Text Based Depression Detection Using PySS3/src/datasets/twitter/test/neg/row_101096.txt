If you're reading this, I am dead.If someone were to write a novel about my life, it would be titled: "How To Fuck Up A Sure Thing". 

Contrary to many of the posters here, I was actually dealt a really fucking good hand in life. I had loving parents, a comfortable upbringing, I'm intelligent and I actually turned out pretty attractive post puberty to boot. If someone were to ask me why I'm as miserable as I am, i would say its because at some point in my life I just stopped giving a shit... about everything. It was really fucking nice for a couple of years. However, when I finally started to try and and actually care about my mortality again, I had already fucked myself over past the point of no return. 
  
Mentally I am GONE. It is impossible for me to derive any sort of existential meaning or some sort of happiness out of any action I take. I WANT to give a shit and actually aspire to be something, but I just don't. I can't even describe it, its not that I just feel apathetic, its more like that I don't know if its possible for my emotional range to go beyond apathy anymore. 

I just can't go on like this, I'm just bringing everyone down with me. At this point I know my life will end in suicide, the only question is when. I know it will hurt the people who care about me, but I'm only going to keep hurting them more by giving them false hope in continuing my own existence. From my point of view this is the humane thing to do.

I believe in the idea of the Eternal Return. I honestly don't want to think that its what's actually going on, but out of all of the possibilities it seems to be the most likely and the academic in me won't let me lie to myself about what the facts appear to be. In the end Im just damned to this outcome. Such is fate
