In a very dark place right nowSo, I am in a really dark place right now. I hate everything. I hate my job so much. Every morning I wake up and feel like barfing. All I have to deal with at work is problems and more problems. I am so sick of it all. My life seems like one duty after the other. Everything I do is a duty. I haven't felt happy for ages. Every work day, I just want to call in sick. I don't because I know I will really have a bad conscious  if I do and will feel worse. I feel like nothing is ever going to get better, ever. Feeling this way is the worst of it. Objectively, I have a good life, and I see that, too. But I just don't know how to make things better. I am so bitter and negative, it's horrible. I smile at work, help everyone else but am so sick of it all on the inside. My "mask" is slowly but surely slipping away. There is no way I can quit my job. I just wish I could be happy with all of the blessings I have, but right now, I just see despair and trials and tribulations that I can't deal with.
