i'm tired of it allHello guys, I've been reading through all of your posts silently, and I decided it was time to share something about myself. 

To get down to the point, I'm tired of everything and I've fallen into deep depression. I just don't see the point of living if I'm going to die anyways. I feel like it might have to do with my major sensitivity to comments and severe bullying in the past. I just feel so alone, even though I'm surrounded by people. I feel really isolated. 

My grades for the past three years have been extremely high. Now, my grades aren't that great and I don't even feel like trying anymore. I purposely cut off contact with my friends. I don't want to go to school anymore. Everything that used to make me happy is worthless at this point. I just want to leave. I want to die. I know this sounds stupid, but I feel like this is my only hope. I don't want to kill myself because I have a little bit of hope for the future, but sometimes, when the super depressing thoughts come back I just want to end it all.

I want to tell my parents that I'm really depressed and this is a seriously life-threatening, but I'm scared because I know what they're going to think. They're going to think I'm spoilt and I'm whining about nothing. 

And maybe I am whining about nothing. The problem is, I've never whined this long about anything for as long as I've been alive. I've never woken up in the morning and wanted to end my life until now. I've never hated things like this. I've never wanted to actually die. This has been going on for months, and I really need help, I just don't know what to do. 

sorry guys. that probably made no sense but at least I got that off my chest.
