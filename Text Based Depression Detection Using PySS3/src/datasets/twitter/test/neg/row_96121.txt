Forgive Me For This Post(Drunk Rambling)First of all, forgive me; this post is extremely spontaneous. I just suddenly feel the need to vent. It probably won't be very organized because I am drunk at the moment. 

 I've had about 13 shots of whiskey tonight. Plan on more. Drinking and binge eating is the only thing I've been looking forward to all week. I ordered 2 pizzas, 2 orders of 10 pc cinnamon rolls with a shitload of extra icing, and some pasta from Pizza Hut, spending nearly 50 bucks -- I feel guilty but whatever. I forced myself to vomit a few minutes ago to eat more. 

Binge eating &amp; drinking are two habits I use to distract myself from the thought of suicide. It used to be smoking weed, but I haven't smoked since September 7th. I used to smoke every day, but now I get drunk about once a week. 

I've been trying to read, meditate, exercise, all that good stuff... but it's *so* hard to upkeep those habits. I got drunk last weekend and thus wasted this last week by eating, gaming, watching youtube videos, and otherwise distracting myself until I could repeat that behavior this weekend... and here I am. Drunk, stuffing my face. 

Sober, I often default to thinking suicide is the best option. My sober mind is plagued by thoughts of what I am doing as I type this; cravings to binge eat and do drugs for the brief rush of feel-good-chemicals, distracting myself from it all - life in general. Drunk, I find that all thoughts about life are nulled, the stressful ones in particular. I know when I sober up they'll only resurface. Ha.

But deep down, I have some inclinations to live. I want to make music -- I really enjoy singing and playing guitar, as well as writing, but I am such an amateur at each. I am young. I have potential, I think. All my friends are off in college, pursuing their lives, ambitions, futures. 

I miss my past, all I have is my future, though. I keep getting wasted and setting myself back physically by binge eating, while my friends are getting ahead in life, advancing their academic careers, I am rotting at home with my mother, who looks at me like a degenerate, I feel. I have no job, I don't go to school. I'm just depressed, down and out. Alone. I pretend that I'm doing alright for the sake of my family members. I barely talk to my friends anymore. I'm rambling too much now.

As if it matters, I'm listening to Classics by Ratatat, and I'm gonna keep binge watching Youtube and The Office on Netflix. I'm going to keep drinking as well. Bless anybody who's read this fuckin' post. I have no idea what compelled me to write this - probably my reduced inhibitions. Sober, I'd be smart enough to know nobody gives a *fuck*. 

Forgive me. Thanks, sincerely, thank you if you read this. I don't know what I'm looking for. I don't know what I expect. I'm just so sad, vulnerable, and willing enough to reveal some of my thoughts to an open internet forum. 

I get drunk to pretend I'm not so sad - so depressed. When I'm high I'm all too aware of what I really am. When I'm sober, I feel a strange depressive-apathy, where I'd like to take care of myself, but suicide is all too appealing, and it's just a pathetic tug-of-war battle between two polar attitudes. Neither wins. 

I'm in limbo. Sorry for the post.
