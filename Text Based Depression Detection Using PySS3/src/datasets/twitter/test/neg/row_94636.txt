August 3, 2015 12:00amI said I wouldn't post here anymore but this isn't a plea, it's just a goodbye. I've set things up so that my body won't be found by any family members. I'm going to do it outside of my home with my gun. I've thought about this to the details so everything should go as planned. I am ready, just 2 more days and it will all be over.
