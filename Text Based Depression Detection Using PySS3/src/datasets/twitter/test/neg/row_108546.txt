I see myself as selfish.Everyday I think about committing suicide, even though I have wonderful opportunities.
I feel like Iâ€™m being ungrateful for wanting to die after all I have worked for.
Part of the reason I want to die is because of the flashbacks I have from PTSD, but I also have chronic migraines which take over my life. I canâ€™t go to school some days because itâ€™s so bad. 
I donâ€™t want to lose everything Iâ€™ve worked for due to migraines, and if I do, I would probably end my life.
