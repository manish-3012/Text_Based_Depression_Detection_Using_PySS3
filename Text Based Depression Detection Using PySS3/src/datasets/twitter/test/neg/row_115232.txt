I didn't think it would get this far...I've always lived a relatively normal life, middle class, not rich but not poor, decent grades, got into a uni.
Except its not been that straightforward. For the last 5 years (I'm 19 now) I've had suicidal thoughts, at first thinking they would go away, when they've become progressively worse.

I was a mute towards the later end of secondary school and in college (or high school), being separate from people, silent, made, and still makes me, feel better. I worked throughout, getting only average grades, but the work keeps me stable as to keep my mind off of other things. Due to this I never had much of a social life, and in turn never having a love life.

Fast forward a few years, I get into uni, I'm not really excited, more anxious. The first week I spend as I normally would, away from people, away from all the fun that usually happens in the first week. A group of girls, which I now hang around with, I guess felt sorry for me and talked to me, and I guess from then I've burdened them with me.

One girl, I love to death (excuse the pun in this sense). She's taller than me by about a foot, maybe slightly less, but I would be lucky to ever go out with her. Recently, as a joke, she posted on Facebook that we were engaged when we were working together, and has since blown out of control. I'm too anxious to say anything, but its obvious that it should never happen, due to some reactions she gives.

I've tried reaching out before, to a friend that then said 'oh if you need just call'. I believe the part of me wanting to get help is also dying, slowly wanting less help. I'm arguing with myself to try with my uni friends maybe Wednesday, and that may be my last attempt.

At this current moment I'm writing my final letter, to my family, my 'friends' and whoever else I can think of adding. Apologising for everything I've put them through. One of my grandparents died last year on the 9th February, I never felt like I was really that close, but since it has become clear he was a wise man. As much as it's my first death, it's weird, other than initial shock, nothing. No feelings at all. I'm shamed that for such a loving, kind man that I can't even feel anything.

I plan to finish it Saturday, on the 9th. I can't bear it anymore. I write this in a clear mind. I feel like I should have some feeling, or if I ever did write this that I would be in a crazed mood. Whereas, my mind is clear, I'm calm. I don't fear it anymore.

My family have decided to go out for a meal on the Saturday, in his memory. I'm going to decline and go to his grave. Say what should have been said a long time ago.

Sorry for a long block of text.
