Thinking of ending it.I don't know what to do, everything seems impossible. I have lied to my entire family for a year, telling them I am going to college to progress in life. In reality I have no idea what I want to do. My lies are catching up with me, and everyone found out. I feel like such a disappointment and a waste of human life. I have no purpose anymore.
