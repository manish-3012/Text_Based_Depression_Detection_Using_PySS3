Hopeless and helpless*Sorry if my English and redaction is not that good*

I feel helpless, hopeless and abandoned, i just want do feel better but I feel like I have lost the only one person in this world that I trust, the only one who have been there for me every time I needed for three, she said that if I ever felt bad I could just tell her and she will help me, but I think I will just annoy her, this just happened yesterday, she told me she was feeling a little low and probably won't be able to talk to me for a time, and I know that's okay, but I don't have anyone to talk, I just don't want to be selfish but I just need to talk to her, I want to tell her all things I have been doing today because thats help me to get distracted of all the pain I have inside.

I have been thinking of ending my life today, but I don't want to die and I don't want to be selfish with her and just let her get better but at the same time I feel like I need her and don't know what to do, I have been crying for like half an hour, and I feel so stupid, I'm probably overthinking everything and this is not that bad but I can't control my thoughts.
