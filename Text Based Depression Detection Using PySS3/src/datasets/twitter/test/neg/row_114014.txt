25, my fears, self-loathing, depression, social anxiety and immaturity have ruined my whole life, and feel like ending it tonightNext Tuesday I was supposed to start my masters in education program that was full-time. But I had a breakdown about it for the SECOND year in a row. I deferred last year which was okay because you could do that. This year I withdrew. My adviser probably hates me and thinks I'm crazy. I told her I need to see a therapist, which I do. But now I don't think they'll accept me if I reapply next year.

They must think I'm a person who doesn't go through with what they say. So many things have kept me back and I've been calling therapists but they were all booked last week. I feel like I'e failed at any chance of having a house, good career, wife and good benefits. I did want to be a teacher and still do, I was just struggling to motivate myself to do the work and I out off seeing someone for so long, I've been on and off depressed since high school.

And I'm immature and need to grow up on top of my insecurities. All my mind was thinking was will I have time to play video games if I do this? They have been my crutch all my life, and I'd go to them when I felt sad. And I kept telling myself it was impossible and I would fail. I was crying and shaking all week until I had to call my adviser I needed to withdrew.

The program directors think I'm crazy now. They'll never let me back in even though I want to try again and actually improve myself. I can barely eat, shave, or shower now. I ruined my future because of my laziness and selfishness and not willing to sacrifice to do this program.

Tonight I just want to hang myself with my bed sheets tied to my bed post while jumping out my window. I've fucked up so bad.
