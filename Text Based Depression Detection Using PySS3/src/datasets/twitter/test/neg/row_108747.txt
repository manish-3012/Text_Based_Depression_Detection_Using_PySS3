I want life to be less crushingI don't want to be alive anymore. Everytime I close my eyes, all i imagine is my mutilation, diving off of a dam,  swallowing a bullet.  All days are doses of torture.  My childhood is steeped in abuse, in pain.  My first marriage is nothing but the same.  My psyche and my body have been ravaged over the years and I'm exhausted of trying to claw my way out of the dark.  Progress in the form of better paychecks, better relationships, reaching for education goals all are sickeningly stressful.  Every day feels like a drawn out panic attack,  a weave of dream like states,  forgetfulness, sadness, anger. Even happiness comes at a price because experience has taught me that joy isn't sustainable.  But every time I've tried I've failed.  The pills, the gun,  the river.  Add it to my list of short comings. I feel indescribably alone.  Maybe this is my second life.  Maybe this is my hell. I just want it to stop.  Please.  How do I make it stop?
