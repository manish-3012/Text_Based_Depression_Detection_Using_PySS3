My best friend might kill himselfMy best friend (17m) has just recently discovered that he is not gay, rather he is a girl. he doesnâ€™t feel comfortable in his own skin, and this has caused him to spiral down into a suicidal state. He has a history of mental issues and he has had plans to kill himself before. He is actively obsessing over this and i know he needs professional help but he refuses. he is so damn stubborn itâ€™s killing me.

I love my best friend, and as someone who has also gone through struggles like this, i feel hospitalization is best at this point but i really donâ€™t think he will take it seriously. i just donâ€™t know at what point do i tell his parents and family so that they get him help. Too early   and it might not work, too late and well...too late. 

Please help me. iâ€™m really confused and itâ€™s a lot of weight to carry. thanks.
