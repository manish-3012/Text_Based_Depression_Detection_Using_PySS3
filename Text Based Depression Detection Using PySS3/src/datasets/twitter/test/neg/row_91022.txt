If I see one more empty platitude I'm actually going to kill myselfIt pisses off so much seeing shit like "it gets better" or "suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"
like fuck off !!!! you don't know if its going to get better or if my problems are temporary. people just like to assume that people who are suicidal are irrational or something idk. but it doesn't get better for all of us
