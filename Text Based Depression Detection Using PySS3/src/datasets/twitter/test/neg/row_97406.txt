Guys. I need help. Iâ€™m confused.Itâ€™s a long story. But... Today my mother threatens me with a orphanage. Again. She screams at me. She called me a bitch, moron, crazy. 
she looks at me disgustingly... when she does it I want to hit her. I really donâ€™t know what to do! I really tired. And now I really want to die. Iâ€™m 15. Yes. Also my father calmly looks at it all. They are sure that they are doing the right thing. I hate them!!! I have the opportunity to jump off the 9th floor, but I'm not sure I'll die for sure. I cried because of this several times. Thanks for reading.
