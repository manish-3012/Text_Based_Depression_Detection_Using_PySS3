I just want to commit suicide bc of anhedoniaFuck the PT-141 melanocortin. Ive had this only for 1 month and was normal before but I already just want to commit suicide or wish I was dead in a tragedy since thats essentially what happened to me. A tragedy with a peptide gave me anhedonia. 

Now I do not want to live. I do not feel like a person when I do not have emotions.

Mindfulness exercises are useless as fuck and do not relieve my symptoms.
