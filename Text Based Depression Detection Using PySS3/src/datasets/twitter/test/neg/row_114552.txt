I can't talk to people when I know they don't actually care. I have nobody I can talk to. I am truly alone.nobody cares what I ever have to say, they sure as shit don't care about my problems. I can't even talk to a therapist because I know they don't care about my problems, they're just doing their job. I can't talk to people when I know they don't actually care about what I'm saying. and no I'm not gonna PM any of you because I am fully aware none of you care either. nobody on this planet cares about me. I might end it tonight.
