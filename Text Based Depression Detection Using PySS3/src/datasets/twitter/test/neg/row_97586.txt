Introspection from a suicidal individualI've made a post the beginning of the year that I'm considering committing suicide at the end of the year. Well, it is the end of the year and unfortunately I still don't feel much better. I still can't stop watching porn. My addiction is fueling me to kill myself, but I think I actually fear quitting porn as strange as it may sound. Quitting it and finding out that I still want to die will suck. Right now quitting porn and masturbation is my last resort. 

I just feel numb and sometimes keep people at a distance. Life just doesn't excite me anymore. I procrastinate like crazy with my studies and loaf around because at the back of my mind I'm thinking the end is near so why bother. I've even told a girl I liked her, I've never done that before. Again, feeling like the end could be near makes you fearless. 

Truth be told I have been thinking about the effects my death would have on others and that really saddens me. I've even tried to think of ways where I can die by homicide, but that would just be suicide in disguise. Losing someone is losing someone, but suicide affects loved once more. I've definitely been lower than I am now, to the point where I can't even realize how my death would affect others. So part of me feels I'm probably not depressed enough now to kill myself. It's just so difficult to enjoy life when you have zero motivation. 

In any case, just felt the need to ramble a bit on here, maybe you can relate. I'll keep fighting, but sometimes my arms get tired of being up and throwing punches all the time.
