I think I'm ready to seek help but I don't even know how.On Friday, I received a slip in the mail saying that I missed a certified letter from my employer. I had to wait until yesterday to see what it could possibly be.

In the span of one weekend, I convinced myself that the workers comp claim I filed in September was being denied, that they were going to make me pay for the treatment I received, that they thought I faked my injury and were going to sue me for fraud, that I wouldn't be able to hire a lawyer to defend myself in court, that my fiancÃ© was going to leave me over it, that I was going to be poor and homeless, and that I should kill myself to avoid going to jail.

It was just a copy of the paperwork I had filled out and they wanted me to sign for it to make sure I got it.

I don't actually *want* to die most of the time, per se, but my anxiety has gotten worse over the past five years and minor inconveniences send me into horrible negative spirals of worrying and depression that make me think I have to. I constantly worry about whether I fucked up a social interaction or not even though I know deep down that most people I see day to day do like me. I can't do anything if I know someone is actively watching me. I have a horrible food addiction and I had lost 30 pounds this year trying to shake it but I gained 40 back by snacking when nobody is around. I get excited planning all kinds of things, from road trips to weight loss to home decor, but when it comes time to follow through its impossible to motivate myself to stick with it.

I know only I can change this. I want to. I'm ready to. I want to seek help but I don't know who to ask. My friends are aware of my anxiety and depression but don't know who I should talk to. My parents got pissed and screamed at me that I have nothing to be depressed about and should feel bad for asking when I broached the topic a few years ago when I was still in high school, so reaching out to them is a no-go. I don't know what psychiatrists and therapists there are in my town or which is best for me (I don't want religious therapy and this is a smallish, conservative town). Should I just waltz into my PCP's office even though he treats physical illness? How can I even get actual help?
