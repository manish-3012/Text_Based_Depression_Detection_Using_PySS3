I hate myself.Everyone I trust ruins that trust, all my friends find me as a last resort, and the only good friends I fine always end up leaving me behind. My mom doesnâ€™t have a job, and suffers from Bipolar Depression. Sheâ€™s started abusing prescriptions a few years back leading to a car crash, and the car being totaled. My mom just stays at home, and I feel like I have no relationship with her. My dad works all the time, so I never get to have time with him except for holidays. Iâ€™ve gotten taken out of therapy because my sister felt she didnâ€™t need it anymore, but my parents only took her opinion into mind and removed us both from it. I feel like my mother specifically has favorited my sister over me, which makes me feel like I mean nothing to her. I sacrifice everything for everyone, and I get nothing in return. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore, but I donâ€™t want to break my dads heart. Itâ€™s fine if you want to call me dramatic, or to man up, I just wanted to get this out of my system.
