I feel like my first gf is about to break up with me and I just wish I wasn't alive anymoreI'm 20 and I've never dated anyone before but I feel like what I thought was a healthy relationship is about to end. It's been 3 weeks since we've seen each other because of the quarantine and it honestly feels like I'll never see them again. They don't seem like they love me anymore, they're slowly not responding to me, every sweet thing I try to say gets ignored, and it's like they don't want to do anything with me. I might be overreacting bc I don't see why anyone would ever want to date me in the first place but for just a while there it felt like I was worth something to someone and I don't know if I can go without that again
