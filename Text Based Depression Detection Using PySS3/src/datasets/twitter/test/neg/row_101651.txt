Anyone else just want to die?I wish every day Iâ€™d be given the news Iâ€™m dying and it makes me feel terrible as there are so many people in the world that want to live. I donâ€™t know how to get this feeling out of my head or have anyone to talk to about it. No one cares; loneliness is a killer.
