I donâ€™t want to die, I just no longer want to existI donâ€™t have anyone anymore. Estranged and complicated relationship with my parents. In college doing classes Iâ€™m not passionate about. Have a job making decent money and itâ€™s good for my resume but itâ€™s so mentally draining. My partner left me to find herself and has fallen into a large friend group that is always there for her. I have not had that same luck. The other night I was in a really bad spot and hit up all the few friends I have anymore. No response or they were busy. I live in Buffalo, NY and took the quick drive up to Niagara Falls in a bad snowstorm. I parked my car but left it unlocked so someone could move it easily if I went over the edge. It was late at night and no one was around. I just watched the rapids leading to the edge of the earth. All I had to do was hop that railing and itâ€™s not my problem anymore. One swift decision and itâ€™s over. I screamed and I cried and hit myself in the head because my piece shit brain doesnâ€™t even know what to do. I couldnâ€™t physically do it. I couldnâ€™t do that to my mother. I couldnâ€™t do that to my ex who would blame herself for life. I have no one to understand me but 50 people that would show up for my funeral. Thatâ€™s why I canâ€™t die. I just want to disappear from this existence. Wipe everyoneâ€™s memories, everyoneâ€™s pictures and videos, any evidence that Iâ€™ve been on this planet for 21 years.

Universe, just let me go, itâ€™s my final wish.
