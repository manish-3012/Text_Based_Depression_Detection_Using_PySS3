Fuck I just want to go.My mom cried talking about her parents and the things she regrets. I hate so much that I'm going to cause her even worse pain, but I really can't go on like this. I fucking hate consciousness. No one in my family suspects anything. It's going to hit them hard. I wish when I died I could just be immediately forgotten. I don't want anyone to have pain over me. I'm not worth it.
