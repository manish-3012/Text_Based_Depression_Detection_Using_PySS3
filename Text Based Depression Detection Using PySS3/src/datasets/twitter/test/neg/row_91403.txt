I don't know what to do anymore.I'm 18 and been struggling with depression ever since I was 14. I've kept it hidden from everyone except for a few professionals. I've only recently been diagnosed though. I thought finally getting a diagnosis would help, but I feel even worse.

I was referred by my GP to a professional around 2 weeks ago. I was assessed by a mental health nurse that didn't take me seriously at all.  I told her about my self harm and suicidal thoughts. I told her that I think about suicide every single day, but she didn't seem to care. She told me that I don't need treatment, since I'm apparently just stressed, although my college counsellor disagrees with her. 

I've got really close to killing myself in the past, but I feel like now it's got to the point where I'm actually going to do it.  This is the most unhappy I've ever felt.  I was suppose to kill myself when I was 15. One night when I was 15 I was at someone's house looking after their kids. I looked in one of the cupboards in the kitchen and found numerous different prescription drugs. I decided then that I would take an overdose. One of the kids I was looking after came to the kitchen while I was about to start taking the prescription drugs, so I stopped what I was doing. I regret not ending it all that day.

I don't know what to do anymore. Whenever I think about my future it just seems to be completely hopeless. I don't see a point in anything anymore, and as a result I've reached the point where I've given up on trying to get decent grades. 

I don't want to live with depression for the rest of my life. It doesn't seem like I'll ever be happy again. I'd rather be dead than to live like this. I'm struggling so much but not even professionals take me seriously, so suicide is the only solution I have.
