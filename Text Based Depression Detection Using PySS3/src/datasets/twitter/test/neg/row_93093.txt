I'm concerned for myselfSo I (14F) am in high school and I'm ignored a lot and not invited to things in my "friend group" so I feel like I really only have 1 friend (15M), we've been very close for a long time but his other friend (14M) will be coming to our high school next year. I know how them two are together and I know that he's going to forget all about me and his other friends to hang out with him. So my biggest fear is that by the end of sophomore year I'm going to kill myself. Idk what I'm supposed to do.
