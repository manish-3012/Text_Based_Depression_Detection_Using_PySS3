I want to do it later this afternoon, but Iâ€™m still not entirely sureMy friend has attempted suicide. Iâ€™m constantly afraid that someone else will. So I know this is going to sound extremely selfish and hypocritical when I say that I want to do it later.

My grades are all going down the drain and I used to be a straight A student. Iâ€™m probably going to fail several of my classes. Itâ€™s too late to do anything about it. I have a project that I havenâ€™t done at all and is already late. Itâ€™s all my fault because of my own irresponsibility.

I had a text argument with my mother this morning that led to me saying I wish I was going into custody with my dad instead of her. I havenâ€™t gotten back a response yet, but I know when she gets home Iâ€™m dead. Unless I actually am dead by then.

Everything else has gone to shit already. I canâ€™t even do anything except sleep.

So later this afternoon Iâ€™m planning to do it. I have several hours before either parent gets home, so Iâ€™m gonna snatch the bottle of ibuprofen and several water bottles, go outside, hide in bushes somewhere, take it all, and while Iâ€™m waiting Iâ€™m going to say goodbye to everyone I have a contact for.

I donâ€™t know though. I donâ€™t know anything. But Iâ€™m only a freshman and Iâ€™ve already ruined my whole life. Thereâ€™s really no going back now.

The only problem with my plan is that my little brother whoâ€™s in 5th grade gets home only shortly after I do. So heâ€™ll notice that Iâ€™m not home and probably let my parents know, or come looking for me.

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore
