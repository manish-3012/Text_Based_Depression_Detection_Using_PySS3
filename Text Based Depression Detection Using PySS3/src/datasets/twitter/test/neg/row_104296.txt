Thereâ€™s nothing for meIâ€™ve been depressed all my life. I think I used to have dreams and goals for my future.. theyâ€™re all gone now.

I remember a time where I was completely fucking alone. Alone. And all I wanted were some friends and some support. Nearly 2 years later, I have 4 supportive friends.

I always thought if I got the support, Iâ€™d feel better. No. I feel worse. Maybe itâ€™s just too late for me. Maybe if I met these friends 2 years ago, I couldâ€™ve gotten better. But maybe now Iâ€™m just too warn out. Itâ€™s like nothing satisfies me. Nothingâ€™s enough. I hate that. I wish it was enough.

I think even if I wasnâ€™t depressed right now, I still wouldnâ€™t wanna live. Thereâ€™s nothing for me. I donâ€™t wanna go to uni, I donâ€™t want a job, I donâ€™t want a wife, I donâ€™t want a house, I have no dreams, no goals, no hobbies, no talents. What the fuck do I do

They say â€œitâ€™s not that you donâ€™t want to live, itâ€™s that you want the pain to endâ€. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s like that for me. I donâ€™t want to live. Simple. I wish there was a way I could live and be happy but Iâ€™m really sure there isnâ€™t.

Now I have people who care, who would get hurt if I leave. What do I do? Iâ€™m stuck. I canâ€™t live. I canâ€™t die.

I finally got a proper diagnosis and medication for depression. Iâ€™m at a cross road right now. I can chose to get better by taking those meds, or I can leave by jumping off that bridge. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m scared of the future. I donâ€™t wanna try and get better. I donâ€™t know what to do.
