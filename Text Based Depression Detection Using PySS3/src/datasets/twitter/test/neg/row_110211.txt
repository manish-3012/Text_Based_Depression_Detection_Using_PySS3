Is it weird that Iâ€™m kind of scared to take my own life this weekI canâ€™t stand the pain of living anymore. Iâ€™m to much of a burden on my family. Iâ€™ve got it all planned out. How and where and when Iâ€™m going to take my life. But Iâ€™m kind of scared that when I go to kill myself I will fail. Iâ€™ll just flop in the water. Iâ€™m scared that someone will see and call 911. I just wish there was some way to know if so will succeed or not. One time after an attempt I was allowed to have visitors. And if I ever end up in the historical again I will never accept visitors. I still remember what everyoneâ€™s face looked like while I sat in the bed. Everyone looked at me like a was some helpless case. Like if they touched me they would break me. Everyone pretended to be nice in the hospital and then as soon as I was released everyone was the same again. No one gives a fuck
