I need help, please...Hi, I'm 17 years old and I've had depression since I was around 12 years old. It started when all of my friends at my old school began not to like me, within a month of starting middle school, I had no friends. I tried making new friends but it never worked. I got constantly bullied for being overweight and different. I attempted suicide in Grade 8 but failed. I then went to a different high school thinking things would get better and they did for a bit. I am now in my senior year of high school and this is supposed to be the most important time of your life. All of the people who I thought were my friends are now all excluding me and not liking me anymore, my home life is very rough due to me not doing well in terms of marks and not being able to find a job which I've been looking for for the past 2 years. I met an amazing girl who I've been with for a long time and we actually planned on spending a really long time together and eventually getting married. Problems have arisen between us due to her religion (Islam) and she wants to start wearing a hijab and I dont really support the meaning of it and I would not be allowed to continue the relationship with her if my parents found out and she is not willing to compromise so it's basically over. I am failing 2 classes, I cry myself to sleep every night, no one has been able to help me whether they're my parents, family or therapists. I just want to end it all because I don't see any way out of it. Nothing makes me happy at this point and I can't handle all the stress, anxiety and depression anymore and I don't see myself ever being able to recover and have contemplated suicide multiple times over the past month. Please I'm open to any suggestions because at this point I'm willing to try anything. Thank you all so much
