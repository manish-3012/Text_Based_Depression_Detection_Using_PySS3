I don't even know what that's aboutSome days are better than others, but overall life seems to be a burden to me. I wish I could just disappear, not that I want to kill myself, I just wanted to vanish, suddenly turned to nothing, bodyless, like I've never existed, so I just wouldn't hurt the people that for some reason loves me. For me the world, or at the least what humanity made of it, seems to be a fucked up disgusting place, I honestly thing the universe would be better if without us. It is not that I don't see joy in living, I can spot many wonderful things about life, about the universe, they just seem unreachable and secundary in our currently way of life. Humans right now value work and money above anything, and life just goes around it. We are supposed to be born, go to school, go to college, work our ass off and then die, that's it. And even though I know those things I'm saying, though I believe it to the bottom of my heart, though I wanted to be free of it, to do something different and meaningful to me, I just can't. I can't find a way out of this, i'm not strong enough to change the things in life I can't stand. I wasn't like this before, I used to find joy and meaning in my life, I used to love and be inspired by med school, i used to dream about making something out of it, wanted to help people, wanted to achieve something and now I just fucking hated to the point I'd rather literally die than keep up with it. Some days I don't feel like doing anything at all, some days I just feel like this towards college. But honestly I still thing I should just vanish, death sounds comfortable, less complicated, seems like it suits me better. I'm just tired of all of this. Is pointless. Is painful. Existence is pain and I don't know what to do about it. I'm too much of a coward to kill myself, and such a weakling that I can't gather strength to actively change my life.
