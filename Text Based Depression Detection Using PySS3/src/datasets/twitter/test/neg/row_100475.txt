Why is suicide so difficult?I feel completely empty inside. I had a girl that loved me to death and I fucked up and let her slip away from me. Now I realize just how much I actually needed her. I have anxiety and depression. When I was with her she made me feel so comfortable and strong enough to overcome normal things.

Now shes gone and I feel weak and empty. Simple trips to the store leave me shaking and speed walking the whole time. Being at work I just want to break down and cry in a corner. I want to end these feelings. I have written my notes and just want things to end.

I keep trying to buy xanax off the streets hoping some are laced with fetyonal but everyone is dry. My health insurance doesnt start still next year and I dont think I want to be around that long to get it legally. I just want to sit in a hotel room, drink, take some nyquil, mix in some xanax, and sit there with my gun and hope that if I dont die from od I can at least muster up the courage to shoot myself.
