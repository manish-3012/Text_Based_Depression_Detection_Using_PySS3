Today's the first day I seriously wanted to dieMy parents have a horrid marriage. I'm 24 and live at home with them because I didn't get into medical school last year and I'm reapplying this year. I constantly have to live in a house where my mother blames herself for every "mistake" she's made, and often lied about the career choices she made because her anxiety made her see no other way. Yesterday as she spoke to me, I looked at her the way my sister and my father do. For the first time in my life, I realized my mother royally fucked up, and that I wasn't even angry at her, just disappointed. I have no idea what to say or do to her, but I told her I unconditionally loved her and whatever decision she makes, I will support it 100%, provided *she* makes that decision, and not any one of us. It kills me to see what has become of her, and my family. 

My father is a typical insensitive, passive aggressive South Asian dad. He puts a lot of unspoken pressure on a lot of people in the house, and if they don't live up to his ridiculous standards, sometimes which aren't necessarily based in reality, his sadness seeps into me and kills my self-worth. While he is financially supporting everyone in the house, I am beyond angry at him for his total lack of emotional support to my mother, and especially me, when growing up. My mother laments that my dad's parenting is the root of my problems, every time I vent to her about how my anxiety and emotions get to me and cause me to overthink and stay in the past. 

I am also dealing with a breakup that happened 5 months ago. After 2 years of on/off again behavior, my ex and I got back together for the 3rd time last April, and we made it last till early January, even with bickering and fighting every 2-3 weeks about my lack of "showing love" and inconsistency, and her ridiculously high standards for love and affirmations in a relationship. I see now the fault of our ways, and I don't blame her or me for ending the relationship; we were just not ready to deal with the difficulties of such a partnership, and I guess that it had an expiration date from the beginning. While I am working to improve myself in the areas she wanted me to (on my own accord), I decided yesterday that she requested the space she needed before going abroad to "ho out", and then got back together with me a few short weeks later because she felt guilty. Then, the whole issue with differences in love came up again, and we broke up in late March and she's been suggesting we be friends since. She had 2 months abroad in Europe to travel and live her life, and she recently signed on for a full time position at Goldman, so her life is pretty flush with happiness, even though she deals with a lot of depression and health problems. As I'm trying to figure out where she fits into my life, I see that she attempted to keep me at arm's reach, without ever letting me get close. The ball is in my court now to reach out and make our eventual meet up happen, but I'm not sure I want to progress. 

All of this weighs heavily on my shoulders as I contemplate whether medicine is the right path for me. I do not have an incredible, undying passion for medicine, but a general attraction towards it because I know I am good with people, and I am a decent scientist. I never really focused on my studies *consistently* when I was younger, and I scraped by on my testing scores and writing alone. Now, I'm faced with the task of elaborating why I want to go into medicine, and it feels like every essay I write, the admissions committee can see right through me. My insecurities about this festered in my former relationship, and was a big part of my problems with my ex. 

This morning, as I considered all of these issues, I just wanted to kill myself. I told myself to focus on the thought of suicide every day, and it is strangely comforting to know that I can end my life at any moment to earn the blissful peace of death. It is scary to me to think at 24 I am considering ending my life, but at the same time, I feel so alone, so depressed, and so stuck in a box, that I have no idea what I want to do. I want to kill myself, but I also want to feel free. Live life with a focus on myself without having thoughts of my ex, my parents' shitty marriage, or my clueless future come at me. I thought this was just called being an adult, but I'm realizing it's more than that. Much more. Maybe I do kill myself, or maybe I don't. I just wanted someone out there with the patience to read this 5 paragraph essay to reach out and tell me I'm not alone. 

Thank you to those who read this. I appreciate it.
