I just want death to take me.Nothing seems to get better for long, if at all. Every day I face an insurmountable amount of unhappiness and I am exhausted by pretending that I am alright. Taking my own life has always been difficult for me, so I don't know how to die. No family member will help me and hiring a stranger invites a host of potential issues. It is impossible to put into words how severely I want my life to end, and it hurts me even more knowing that I don't have the gall to do it myself.
