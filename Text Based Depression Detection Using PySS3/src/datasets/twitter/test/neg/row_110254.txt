I'm questioning if I'm even depressedI'm 13, and a couple of days ago I wrote a suicide note. I'm not sure if no really intended to do it, but I really wanted to. And I found that music really helped me through it ( I think it last minute helped me not do it) , anyways. Now whenever I feel depressed or like I want to kill myself I always feel like for some reason I'm forcing the emotions and I just want to feel sad, and the part that scares me is that that I don't know if its entirely untrue. I'm really scared and I want to be able to talk with people about it bit every time I cut myself and every time I think of killing myself it just feels like I'm forcing out emotions and I don't need to be helped because I'm not actually depressed or suicidal and Im just forcing emotions,and this just makes me want to kill myself more, it's so fucking paradoxical.
