I want to die but I'm too scared to.This all started when I was 6, yes 6. My parents never loved me, not one bit. All they wanted from me was good grades! They never cared if I got bullied or if I was hurt. The only thing they cared about is grades. Whenever I try my best my parents always think it's not good enough. My best isn't good enough for them, and it will never be. Not only my parents, but some people at my school are very rude to me as well. I get picked on for being ugly, and I already know I'm ugly, they don't need to point it out. Other than that I just feel trapped and lost. It feels like there's no hope anymore. If I tell my parents I want to die they wouldn't care. How do I know? I asked them, guess what their response was. "So?" I cried my self to sleep that night, knowing my parents didn't even care. I had no friends, my parents hated me and I was just depressed. I want to die, but I'm too scared. I'm scared of the pain of dying. I don't want to suffer any longer but if I die, it'll hurt in more ways then just emotionally. This went on for 5 years. At least I gained one friend, her name I can't point out because of privacy reasons but she is the best. Whenever I go to school it feels like I'm happy again when I'm hanging out with her, and that made it harder for me to commit suicide. If I died, how would she feel? I don't want her to be sad. I've started to cut myself, but I've been clean for about 3 months. Please, if anyone will spare the time to talk with me, please do... I'm still very lost..I want to make new friends... School is almost ending and my friend doesn't have a phone so I can't communicate with her over 3-4 months... Thank you for reading this, I'm glad to know you care...hopefully
