Doing it tomorrow or this weekend.First, you have to even afford to off yourself because just existing sentences you to owing thousands of dollars. 

I owe thousands. A professional license I can't afford to renew, my car (taxes..even though I own it, tag renewel and inspection). That's 2k right there.

I am so SICK i could puke. I can't keep up with this life. I can't afford to live. My bank account is -19 and I don't even know why. 

So yeah, I'M NOT LIVING THIS FUCKED UP HELL anymore. I owe for my belongings and even what I went to college for. I have NO MONEY. 

I am absolutely NO DOUBT ending it in the next few days. Life is SLAVERY AND HELL. 

I AM 39. AND KIDS, IT NEVER GETS BETTER.
