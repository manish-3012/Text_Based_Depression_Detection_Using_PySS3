I want to get better but it is so hardIt's hard enough not being able to control my own thoughts. Actually, I can't even think. My thoughts keep interrupting each other. Should I check myself in to th- I can't leave my job, I need mon- I NEED to get bett- This is taking too long, I don't think I can make it to next week- If I go to the psych ward they will be like every other doc- I will be pushed to my last resort- I dyed my hair blue, I don't even like blue- Mom said I need to clean my room and change the litter boxes- Dad said to get over it 6 years ago and it still hurts- I have called into work 2 days straight, they hate me- My friends are busy- My cousin Jaedon gets married in January, better book the flight now before its too la- Going to the hospital will get me regulated on my medications but I'm so scared to be away from my room and Do Not want a roommate- How far can I go with asking for help and getting help until they take my freedom away from me and will I have to earn my parent's trust again?- My dad doesn't even know what is going on- I have no coping skills- I need to just get over it- but I can't and it's too hard trying that I might as well give in- 

Yeah, my emotionally absent dad and disabled mother and how they raised me has a lot to do with how I am today but everything is fine in the real world. I'm a prisoner in my head and am tortured every day. I have a good job and great friends. I have goals and potential. But I can't even get my head to stop spinning and all my failures from this point on will only be because I didn't listen to myself when I said to blow my brains out. I am defective and am no longer capable of functioning in society. How did I get this way? Is this really depression or something else? I am a bug in the system that needs to be removed. Will I make it to work tomorrow? If I keep taking time off, will they replace me and when I realize I'm just being a weak ass pussy it will be too late? It would help if I had the energy for anything. If I had the energy to actually follow through with the exercises my therapist gave me. Or would it? Am I even capable of getting better or am I just wasting my parent's money that could be used to move to a better house and my mom's medical bills? If I keep this up, they won't have enough for my funeral lol
