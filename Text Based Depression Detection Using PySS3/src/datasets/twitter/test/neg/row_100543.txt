About to blow my head off, in Missouri, family if you are reading this I am sorryI don't know if this is gonna work. I've posted so much to this sub the past few days. I am sure my phone will be looked at while I'm dead and my family will find this. I am so, so sorry it had to come to this. I tried so hard but I failed. I made so many mistakes and suffered in silence. I hope you aren't the ones who find my body. I have to do this for the greater good. Don't worry about me. I want all of you to have good lives without worrying about me. Please, keep my belongings. I have 206 dollars in my wallet, please keep 100 for yourselves and the other 100 for my dying ex. Bury me with the lasting six bucks, since it defines the last time when I enjoyed life, when I was six. Please take in my pets, don't put them in any shelter. Take all of the electronics and keep them for the younger people in the family. Wipe them clean, so there's no remnants of my depressed ass on there. 

I was supposed to be an abortion. I almost died at birth. I was always ready for this. I was born to die early. It's my time now.

Sorry you had to read this stupid shit, it's so pointless. Family, you can read my other posts for the motive. I am going now. Thank you SuicideWatch for letting me vent. I hope what's on the other side is better than this.
