I want to throw upI can feel anxiety and paranoia coming back rapidly at this point and I already know I probably wonâ€™t make it through this time. the last time it was this bad was a year ago and it made me feel like killing myself was the only way to get it to go away. It subsided for a few months but itâ€™s coming back and i already feel worse than before. For reference iâ€™m a teenager and canâ€™t get help for myself and my family is skeptical of mental health. i told my mom about my anxiety years ago, when it really started getting bad, and she essentially just told me to live with it. but i canâ€™t this time and i have no idea what to do and thereâ€™s nobody else i could talk to about it.
