Things to do before killing myselfOkay, I'm delineating a plan for my death, and I need to know what has to be done to have everything in order before the last day. I'm a minimalist, so I've already given away, or sold, most of the things I owned; I'm decluttering the last excess of my stuff in these days. But I need to know what I should do from the legal and economic point of view, like writing a will, or saving money for my funeral. Please let me know in the comments below, any practical suggestion is very welcome. Thank you!
