Why do people do this?I've had my fair share of relationships and i've only slept with my first partner after 2 years or so, she always compared me with all the other guys she slept with in the past, after a few months or so you dwell over the topic of i've slept with blah blah blah people, atleast 9 of the women i've been with (if i remember correctly) have slept with more than a dozen men, i was always too afraid they'll judge or compare me to someone else!
All of my relationships have ended because i couldn't sleep with my partner, i've tried to commit suicide twice in my lifetime because i was never enough, every morning i think that i've had enough and that today's the day i can finally pull the trigger, all i want are some kind words from someone who wont be disappointed at me for not being able to do something
