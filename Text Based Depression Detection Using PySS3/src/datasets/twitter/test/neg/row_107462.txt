Is it my fault?It's weird. I've always viewed myself as smart enough to see how feelings trick us into believing things. But it's like with age I can't take it as well anymore. I feel like I've gone completely insane. I feel frozen out by my friends, my family doesn't bother engaging with me in a respectful way and treat me like a manchild, and my girlfriend just doesn't understand. I've been longing for a deep connection for so long. My father was the closest person I've ever come to, but he had issues of his own and his outbursts and emotional abuse lead me to distrusting everyone and making me sensitive to stressful situations, which I've tried to avoid all my life. I want to engage in important topics with people. Talk about dreams. Life goals. Plans. But it's been in my head for far too long. And now i feel this weird stimulation in the middle left part of my brain that's making me anxious, panicky, depressed and I feel like this is it. I feel like nothing will change. Nobody understands me.

Somehow I feel like it's kind of my own fault. I've always been an outsider, and gravitated towards unpopular opinions. Being vegan, drug-liberal, interested in horticulture and being smart about resources towards the coming climate change, and a heavy gamer- it feels as if all this has put me into such a small box that I can't be understood by anyone. Constant discussions about "why are you vegan? Why are you okay with cannabis-use? Why do you care whether I recycle this plastic trash or throw it on the street? Why can't i smoke cigs in your face? Why can't we, your parents, get drunk as fuck and turn our speakers up to a volume so that the whole house is shaking, in the middle of the night, when you have a night shift in two hours and can't sleep?" All leading me to think "Why should anybody care about *me*"?

It's fucking hard. This weird stimulation in my head wont go away, and I can't call anyone cause nobody will understand. They'll tell me "you smoked yourself stupid"  or "you're just nutritionally deficient, i told you to eat meat! or "you were always that weird child".

(I rarely ever use cannabis and lately i don't do it at all cause i'm scared of it exacerbating my mental illness and i track my nutrients to make sure i meet my goals)

I can't take it anymore. I've never victimized myself before like I am doing now. I don't know what to do to feel happy anymore. If anyone here understands, that might make my day a little better. I'm really not feeling well right now. On the verge of psychotic. I thought I'd grow up to be a smart and successful individual. But it feels like this is it right now. I have a test in three days and I've barely read half of all my course literature. I feel lonely.

Sorry for being so depressive but I needed this rant. :(
