Today is my death day!!!This will be my suicide note seeing as though I have no friends or family. Somehow during the course of my 26 years of life, everywhere I go Iâ€™m either labeled as the outcast, the bad guy, or whatever and Iâ€™m over it. Sure Iâ€™ve made mistakes what person hasnâ€™t, but Iâ€™ve felt this way ever since I was 4 years old after I was molested for the first time. It really hit me at 8 when I invited over 100 classmates to a birthday party of mine and nobody showed up. I donâ€™t know how anyone can hate a kid but somehow I pulled it off! Iâ€™ve failed at everything Iâ€™ve ever tried to do. No matter how hard I work or try doesnâ€™t matter I suck at everything! Iâ€™m unemployed, homeless, a convicted felon (7 felonies from one crime no priors or anything since 7 years ago). All theft related and I admit I did it. I was a stupid kid then never lied once about it first make it justifiable though. Never owned a drivers license, no sort of an education outside of a GED. Iâ€™m the definition of a loser. I try everyday as hard as humanly possible to make something of myself but all the rejection has taken the fight out of me. IM DONE! I canâ€™t take it no more. This last year has been one of the worst. I get ran over with a car and broke my foot and had to do 5 months of PT after which I now have a limp and canâ€™t do certain stuff the same anymore. Everything I try to do, go, get hired, education, apprenticeship, doesnâ€™t matter Iâ€™m getting rejected everywhere! I donâ€™t got the brains nor the mentality to make it in this society obviously. Hell my own family wants nothing to do with me and Iâ€™m the baby. Iâ€™ve had it. So tonight I will enjoy my final meal alone and after which I am hanging myself deep in the woods! From the words of Societyâ€™s Real Outcast I say â€œit hasnâ€™t been a pleasureâ€.
