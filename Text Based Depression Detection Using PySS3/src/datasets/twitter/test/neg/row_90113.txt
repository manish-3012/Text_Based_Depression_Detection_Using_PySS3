My mom wants me to become someone globally famous but wants me to stay with her until she diesI'm a Canadian woman in my mid-twenties, and she tells me every day that I am wasting my life. She says I could have been a professor or a famous figure already if I just tried harder. She is calling me a failure and a waste of time and money, even though I worked and paid for my own tuition. I paid back everything I owe them.

She prevents me from going to any international field schools, internships abroad, practicum, or foreign exchange program courses. Today I carefully brought up a short summer course in Berlin, and she sarcastically said, "Fine, go ahead. I don't care if you get killed there or not." I begged her not to get angry or upset, and she started yelling even more. She said it's one of the most dangerous places in the world. She began yelling I don't know how to do anything and that I am wasting my money and potential. She then yelled at me for not being a famous person already.

I am living with my parents, and she won't let me move out. I stopped mentioning that years ago. Whenever I mention moving out, she sarcastically says I will end up prostituting myself for rent, work at Walmart and come back to my parents. But she also sounds like she doesn't want me to look after her. She keeps muttering every day that I will place her in a cruel, horrible nursing home as vengeance.

I just want to go ahead and jump from a bridge or hang myself. That'll show her. I'll write a long note that details why I made the decision, and my picture will get plastered all over the newspapers and social media. I will become *famous* as she wanted.
