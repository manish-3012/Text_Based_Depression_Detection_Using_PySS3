I can't believe I'm doing thisHey guys,

It's not a big deal, but my old suicidal feelings are back. I won't do anything. I'm not that kind of guy. But boy do I wish someone would kill me. I'm so tired all the time, I'd welcome to release. 

I don't relate to anyone these days. I dislike every single piece of art I see - music, movies, tv, even social media posts. But I'm a success. I've got friends, a girlfriend, a son, a great career. I just abhor myself and everyone else. I want to be left alone, to forget my responsibilities, to stop being so tired all the time. I just don't know how. I work out every day. I eat well. I meditate. I'm in therapy. None of it helps. I still go home every night to a bed where I don't sleep, wake up to a girlfriend I can't stand and go to a job that I hate so that I can support a son I don't love. It makes me feel like a monster, saying all of this. I've been like this for a long time now. I don't think it will ever get better, and even if it does, it will only be temporary. I won't kill myself because the people in my life deserve better. They're able to enjoy things. I don't share that, but I don't wish my state on them. I'm envious, but understanding. I'm fairly certain that I know everyone in my life better than they know me. It's lonely. So I have to endure all of this, one day at a time, until I die. It's just so damn depressing. Can anybody lend me a hand? How can I get over this? I'd like to change, but nothing has worked so far. I'm open to trying anything, but not everything. I just don't have the energy.
