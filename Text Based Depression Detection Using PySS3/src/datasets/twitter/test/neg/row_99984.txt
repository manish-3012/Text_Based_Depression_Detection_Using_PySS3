Why am I still alive.So... I guess I'm posting this for an outside perspective. I've tried to **** myself twice so far, when i was 21 and then again on my 22nd birthday. I'm 23 now, few months to 24 and in the last couple days I'veu fallen deeper then I have ever before into my constant depression. I am out of money, dont have enough food to make it to my next check, it feels like everyone around me hates my guts so I've gone back to being silent and alone. I even made a list for and aggainst suicide... 11 to 3. My only resons for living are my niece and 2 of my friensa. I dont think I am in crisis tonight, but I will be amazed if I make it another week.

I should mention my first attempt got me an honorable discharge from the Army. I even had an NCO tell me she wished I had succeeded. I still wish I had.

I have insurance for a therapist, but no time as I work night shift. I KNOW I would benefit from inhouse treatment (again) but I dont know if I would lose my job over it. It seems worth it to attempt and fail just to get put in there and have a medicsl leave or something. (I work at Walmart)

Seriously in ttouble here...
