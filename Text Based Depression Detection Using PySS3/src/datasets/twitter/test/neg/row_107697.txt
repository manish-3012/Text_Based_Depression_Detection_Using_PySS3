Note DraftDear everyone,

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry mom for not telling you I loved you the last time I saw you. I'm sorry Dad for not calling everyday like I used to.

I'm sorry love that I broke things off without trying because I was stressed. It will haunt me for my limited days. I'm honestly only counting the days until lockdown ends to see if we can talk again once we can potentially meet in person to see if you change your mind because I know long distance with no idea of  when we can see each other makes 'us' unappealing after I walked away. I'm so sorry I love you. But I know that its probably never going to happen- you told me you were certain you didn't want to talk. I can't blame you, I hate me too. 

I'm sorry to my friends who I let down after not giving it my all. You all said I worked hard, but I know I could have done more especially when I let my emotions drag me down and only do what I absolutely needed. I'm sorry I let someone influence my time with you too.

I'm sorry to myself. I'm sorry I haven't created a set of principles to live by yet, I didn't think I needed those because I thought I was smart, hardworking, and kind. Those come natural with those qualities yes? No, apparently not because I messed up. But then I pushed my best friend/love away and I'll probably never see him again. Sometimes I think about writing a will and giving him every cent in my bank account; to make up for the pain I caused and show his family how much I appreciated their presence in my life. I missed having a family who cared. 

I miss spending time with you. I don't think I can live with the regret of walking away and not trying again. If this continues this note will be more than a draft. 

I wish I didn't care so much.

Apologies, 

Suicidal Girl
