My Psychiatrist Said No :â€™(I just saw my psychiatrist today. He said no to ECT. I burst out in a fit of crying and any ray of hope I had was flung out the window. ðŸ˜­ He said that ECT is highly controversial and he doesnâ€™t want to risk it. Meanwhile, I am so depressed from my total insomnia, dysphagia/trouble swallowing and whole body parathesia. But doctors canâ€™t find nothing physically wrong w/ me. Theyâ€™ve done MRI and EEG. I had a chemical reaction to CBD oil and Flonase nasal spray combination that canâ€™t be proven. I think of suicide daily. I just want to f*****g die if I canâ€™t get better. If I canâ€™t get better there is no point in living. He said I can get a second opinion. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to do that and Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m still going to get no.
