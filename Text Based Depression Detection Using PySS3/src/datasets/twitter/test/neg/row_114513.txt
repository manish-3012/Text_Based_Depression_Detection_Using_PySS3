I want to kill myselfI have no reason to live.  I'm trying to put together a plan but I've been hitting walls.  I don't have any money so I don't feel like I can procure the means to do it.  I'm 42 years old and have lived with my parents ever since I got raped 10 years ago.  I spent yesterday looking up methods.  I can't go on like this.  I went to a rehab once where one of the counselors said that if I did not have a creative life I would not make it.  I have not had a creative life.  I'm Bipolar.  I don't work. I have no money, no car, no husband, no children, no job. 

It's time for this end.
