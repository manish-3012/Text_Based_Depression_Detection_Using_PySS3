Royally screwed up at work, canâ€™t get suicide out of my headI royally screwed up at work. I misrepresented myself to an outside agency to try and help a client and now it has allow blown up in my face. Iâ€™ve probably broken some major privacy laws. My boss says donâ€™t resign, will probably just be a reprimand but she also says she doesnâ€™t know how series things are. Canâ€™t get suicide out of my head . This job was the last foundation I had in my life and Iâ€™ve most likely let it slip away. My life isnâ€™t a good one. I have major health problems, Iâ€™m overweight, I have no love life. I work two jobs and barely get by. I feel like everything is pointing me towards me finally doing it.
