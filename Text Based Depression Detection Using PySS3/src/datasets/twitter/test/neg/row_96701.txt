Good bye everyone thanks for tryingJust wanted to say good bye to everyone on Reddit. I made a post on this sub asking for help. You can probably find it by looking at post I have made. Any way I was trying to find a way to say good bye properly to the only person that has ever understood me. I did recieve some advice and some people did message me and try to help me. I was suppose to hang out with said person on the night I posted it. That did not happen. Was suppose to hang with said person tonight but I was bailed on again. It has crushed what little bit of hope I had left. Granted I was going to off myself some time soon any way. All I wanted was to say good bye to her. Any way thank you Reddit for being there. I use to go to the funny sub to cheer myself up or would just look at the front page to find new and interesting things to read or learn about. I wish I had known about this sub years ago. O well. Best of luck to anyone out there that is down and is posting on this sub. Hang tight. The people on Reddit will try and help you in any way they can. Keep doing what you do Reddit. I am at the location I had decided to do this at. Going to smoke a couple bowls and a few cigs and then I am calling it quits. The people who help on this sub keep doing what you do. Best of luck to everyone. Good bye.
