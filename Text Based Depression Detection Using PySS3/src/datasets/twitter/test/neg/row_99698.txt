I'm scared of the futureI told my counselor that I'm afraid of the future and she asked me what I'm afraid of. But I'm afraid of everything. I'm too scared to know and walk and live the future. I'm scared of messing up, of failing, of having to go through hardships, of not having the future childhood me was so sure I would have.
The issue of my graduation thesis is coming up quick. I'm stressed out by my assignments already and all the drama of a particular work group. I feel so insecure and scared and stressed and I don't want to go through that. I don't want people to know I killed myself and I used to think that I should wait until I'm independent and can "disappear" after cutting contacts, but I'm really stressed by the near future that I want to do it right now if I can. But I have no quick access to things that can help me do that, nor am I alone in my home. My maids will find me immediately and it would just cause me more drama that stresses me out just thinking about it.
