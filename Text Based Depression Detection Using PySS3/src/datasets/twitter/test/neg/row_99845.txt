I seem to get further away from the idea of suicide every day and it's making me feel very uncomfortableI was always thinking that I'll never make it to 20 and I'm 22 now. Every day I become more conscious of the fact that suicide can never be an option for me because there are people who love me and I don't want to ruin their lives like that. And it devastates me. I feel like I don't have any control over my life and I can't do anything to get out of this situation.

It just keeps getting worse and worse and it really depresses me that I cannot avoid these feelings. I feel very confused.
