I want to dieI want to die, my girlfriend just dumped was the final straw. 

I have been depressed since Iâ€™ve been 12 years old, I have hated myself for mistakes Iâ€™ve made and have had many demons for years. Iâ€™ve thought maybe I should just carry on through life not to upset friends or family. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™ve felt this way for almost ten years I just feel numb. I canâ€™t describe how crippling the depression has been through the years, my girlfriend gave me life really made me feel special which has been amazing but now itâ€™s gone. I have no more to live for, I just canâ€™t do it. I have thought about suicide for so long. I enjoyed life at times but the darkness is just there in the back of my head. I canâ€™t do it anymore
