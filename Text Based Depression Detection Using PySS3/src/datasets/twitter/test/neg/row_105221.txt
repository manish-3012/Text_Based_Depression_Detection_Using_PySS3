I don't have anything to say~I have a lot of things to be happy about, and many good memories to be fond of, and nice memories that I continue to make.  My mind is slow and I'm not sad, I'm just fine.  I've consumed as much information about my own disorder (and others) as possible and tried as many therapeutic interventions as I could.  I've talked to people I love about it more than I should have.  I don't have anything left to say.  I want to be let go, happily.
