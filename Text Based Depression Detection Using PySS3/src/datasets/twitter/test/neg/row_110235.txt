My mom committed suicide 3 years ago in September and I donâ€™t want to be here anymoreNot sure if this is the place for this post but my mom killed herself in September of 2017 in her early 50s. She shot herself at her house and it has really fucked with me ever since. Ive always held inside how shitty I feel about life, and to find out she felt the same is just fucking awful. Her suicide has left my life feeling more hopeless and empty then it has ever felt. 

I make a fuck ton of money doing a stupid ass job for a big company (real descriptive), I have a wife and two kids, and I feel like Iâ€™ve tried just about everything to stop the feeling like I canâ€™t wait for my demise to come. I have pursued a life of hedonism at times with hopes that alcohol, food pleasures, video games, and weed would just let me coast through life. Hedonism makes me feel shittier. 

Iâ€™ve tried the discipline route by running, lifting weights, hiking and I even lost 50 pounds (and kept the weight off) and I still feel like I canâ€™t wait for this shit hole of a life to end. 

The one thing that has remained constant with me for decades since I was a kid is that I hate my fucking life and donâ€™t know what to do to make the suffering end. My mom made her choice and look at how it left me. How can I do it to my own kids? Am I destined for a life of suffering just so my kids donâ€™t have to deal with what Iâ€™ve dealt with? I donâ€™t know what else to do to find happiness with my situation.
