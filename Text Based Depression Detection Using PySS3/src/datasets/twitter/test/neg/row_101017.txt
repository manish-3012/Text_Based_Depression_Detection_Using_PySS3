Suicidal KidThis is kind of a long story but I really need help so please read.

Ok so I have this friend who lives about an hour away from me and me and him and his younger brother all play PlayStation together.  I am 18 and he is 14.  Sometimes his friends play with us and they all sort of look up to me and I've always been good with kids so I just kind of went along with it.  They are upper middle class white kids and all recently got into drug use.  I myself use drugs, but have always kept a good handle on it.  I did really well in school and get scholarships so i figured that if they are going to do drugs since their parents won't now I might as well give them advice to make sure they don't get themselves killed.  So this went on for a while where they would tell me stuff and i would give safety advice, but this one in particular always way overdid it.  He was seeking out harder drugs really quickly and doing things like getting so drunk he'd puke and pass out.  As they all started to trust me more they opened up to me about personal stuff they would never tell anyone else.  Andrew, the kid I'm worried about told me that his dad beats him.  I asked about the severity of it all and he told me he just hits him sometimes.  But it seemed to be a rare and minor occurrence and he told me he thought they could work it out.  So i proceeded with caution and a few weeks later he told me he just found out that his dad is addicted to pain pills.  This is when things totally derailed.  He started getting in trouble with his parents more and more.  He would always have his phone, or ps4 taken away and would just sneak them back.  Then a few days ago he got drug tested by his parents and failed for marijuana.  Over the next few days he would snap at me all the time and just say "fuck you" out of nowhere.  He finally told me that his dad had attempted suicide a few days ago because he was so upset that his son was getting into drug use too.  He told me that he was really depressed and was gonna just drink tell he passed out.  I begged him not to and he agreed to sneak onto his ps4 to talk.  At first we just talked about other stuff trying to take his mind off it but it just seemed so fake like we were ignoring a serious problem.  So I asked him some questions about it like were you home and he said no.  Then I asked if he has visited his dad and he said no and he doesn't want to.  And I asked what his mom said about the whole thing and he said he hasn't talked to her in two days!  So he is completely grounded and can't do anything and is basically just sitting in that environment getting more and more depressed because he can't do anything to take his mind off it.  He started drinking anyway and got really sad and would leave the mic every couple minutes and just be gone with no explanation.  Then he got off completely and i was texting him and he started talking about wanting to kill himself and saying noone would even miss him.  I talked him down from it and promised to come visit him tomorrow.  This was big for him because we have never actually met.  But before long he again was back onto the depression and how there wasn't a point in living any longer and then he stopped answering completely.  I was about 10 seconds from calling the cops and giving them his address when he finally responded.  We talked for a little longer and he seemed a little better.  He told me he just needs to think for a while and that he'd see me tomorrow.  Now at this point idk what the fuck to do.  My parents don't trust me that much because of my drug use so I have to lie about and where I'm going and drive like an hour away and idk what the hell I'm supposed to do or say.  Should I avoid the topic?  Should I seem open and supportive or cool and normal.  Should I recommend something professional or family?  I could really use some advise right now thank you all.
