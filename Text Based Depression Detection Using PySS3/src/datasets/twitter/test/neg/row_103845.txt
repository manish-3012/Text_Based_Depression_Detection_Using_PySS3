I get this sort of way, this depressed, miserable way, and I get trappedI just want to end it.. be safe. Be more.

The demons are creeping up on me again. Seeing things out the corner of my eye. Whispers and screaming, the kind of screaming that sounds like the person is so terrified. It doesn't go away. 

Then there are the screams in my heart. The unsteady, rage-filled heart that is an object to a pedophile. 

Nothing here is real. Is it? I can't tell. I can't know for sure. 

I love my family. Some of 'em. It's all I've got. These people that will never understand me. They're all I've got.

But I doubt that they're real, right? Nothing here is real, nothing here is right. 

Please forgive me. I'm begging. Let go of my death as it doesn't mean what you think.

I stand alone in this. The blood dripping down my arms in memories is the only peace I can get, and I can't even do it anymore.

I have no savior, I am no savior.
