In the middleI want to die. I donâ€™t want to live with my anxieties, depression, phobia, and suffer through life. I donâ€™t want to have to slave away to just live even though my living is miserable.

But at the same time Iâ€™m scared to die. I donâ€™t want to leave my parents, little brother, and dogs behind. Iâ€™m also scared of what might happen after death as it is unknown and the pain/suffering that comes with hanging which is the only method I have available. 

So yeh Iâ€™m in the middle lol
