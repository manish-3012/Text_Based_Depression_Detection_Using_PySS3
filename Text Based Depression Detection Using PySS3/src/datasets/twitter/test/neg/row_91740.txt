Struggling to keep going... Not sure if I am doing this right... I am a 30 yr old mother of 3. When I was in 1st grade, I was sexually abused by an older student at school. I pretty much buried that until I was continually abused by my now ex husband. I first attempted suicide at 15. I began cutting a little before that. Over the last 15 years I have struggled with self harm, depression, eating disorders and suicidal thoughts. My kids have kept me here for the last 8 years. The sexual abuse by my ex started about 2 years ago. That brought the memories of my childhood abuse front and center. I filed for divorce and jumped into a relationship with another man. I abandoned my religion and previous life, went through a rebellious/college phase I hadn't gone through previously, and started drinking and smoking weed heavily as self medication. When my divorce was finalized I made plans to marry my new love. Two days before our wedding, my 15 year old brother, whom I basically raised, committed suicide. This started a huge spiral of depression for me. Then my husband of one month deployed. I became more and more depressed, and self medicated, and self harmed continually. I reached out to the wrong people, and cheated on my husband. (while he was deployed! I know, I am a horrible person. you don't have to tell me.) This only served to bring me to rock bottom more completely. My husand found out and was leaving me. I realized I needed help, quite drinking and smoking, started some much needed therapy and anti depressants. Fast forward almost a year. My husband came home in oct and we are trying to work it out. It is of course, insanely difficult. I struggle with guilt constantly, but am sincere in the changes I made, and wanting to be with him. We experience insane ups and downs. I am slowly getting worn down. I find myself obsessing over suicide, despite knowing personally what it would do to my family, and my kids. I am just so tired of life. Tired of struggling with my emotions, tired of having to check myself so I won't damage all my relationships. I am currently discussing a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder with my therapist. I have major depression and a co-dependant personality. I am 30. Its incredibly depressing that its a daily struggle to regulate myself, not to mention stress from outside sources. I do not look forward to another 30 years of this intense struggle. I feel like I am making progress in therapy, then bam, I am cutting and back to square one. I know I am rambling. I am just so tired and feel so alone. I don't want to scare my family and stress them out because of what happened with my brother. I feel I can't turn to my husband because I have hurt him so badly. He is simply to angry to feel sympathy, which I don't really blame him. Sorry this is so long.
