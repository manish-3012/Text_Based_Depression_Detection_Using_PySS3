Been suicidal on and off for a few years and now getting tired of everythingHi, everyone. I appreciate you for stopping and giving my post a read. I will be giving as much information as I can, but I'm worried about giving too much just in case.

I live in the UK, I'm a male, and am 20. I've wanted to kill myself for about 5-6 years on and off, but right now I very much feel like going through with it finally. I feel like my life is a very useless, pointless life, and that I do nothing but take up an extra space on this planet. I'm only alive still because I know how much it would devastate my friends and family, but now I've reached a point where I just want to die anyway, regardless. I also think it's a very selfish feeling, and feel guilty for feeling like this.

I used to self harm, as growing up I used to feel a kind of rush from it. Very few people in my life know I did this. I stopped because of gaining a girlfriend, and began to feel on top of the world. We've broken up since but are still friends, but I know I still love her and there's not much I can do about that now.

Now because I'm alone again, and because I feel like my life is extremely pointless, I feel as though suicide is nothing more than just speeding up the process. I don't think anyone would ever want me again, especially since I don't even want anything to do with me.

I've spoken to friends, doctors and helplines about suicide, but honestly I don't feel as though it helps that much.  Because of that, I'm not really sure what I wanted in posting here in all honesty. I guess I just wanted some advice in what to do, or what steps to take? I don't know how to move on from my breakup and I don't know how to go about killing myself, and if I should do it or not. I almost feel like I need to be told to do it, but I honestly don't know anymore.

Thank you.
