My bday is monday, I think I will go thenWill turn 33 and I think thats the day I'll do it. Will be perfect, born and die on the same day, a great way for it to end

I don't even know how I got to this point. I do actually, it's all because of medication. Accutane. That fucking drug has ruined my life.  


One of the side effects is depression and suicidal thoughts but when I took it, I didn't think much of it. I had my life, my mind completely together. Everything in life is easy.

  
I wish I'd taken the warnings more seriously. It has destroyed my life, my brain, everything about me. I no longer see things the same way anyway. My mind seems damaged, I was always high IQ but I feel like I've regressed into a simpleton. 

I can't form thoughts the same way anymore. I can't speak the same way anymore. My personality has completely nose dives, I had so much character but this fucking medicine has killed it.

I can't recover. i've tried everything, therapy, psychiatrists, none of them help. I don't want anti-depressants. They have their own side effects.

  
Fuck doctors, I hate them all. A bunch of shams have ruined my life, fuck all you bastards. Trying to treat acne has killed me. How fucked up is that.

  
So anyway, TLDR, I'm done with this world. I'm not living a life with a broken mind that can't recover. Monday, my birthday, will be my final day. I've not decided the method yet but either jumping off a bridge or driving off a cliff should do the job but it will 100% happen.

  
Thanks for reading if you bothered, I wouldn't bother either if I saw this much text but fuck it, had to say something before it was over.
