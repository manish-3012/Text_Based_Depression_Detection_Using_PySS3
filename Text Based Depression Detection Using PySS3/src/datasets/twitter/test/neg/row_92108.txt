Do you ever plan out a suicide for a future date?
Iâ€™m $50k in debt, my startup launch has been delayed, the love of my life left me without warning this summer, my social life is in ruins, and Iâ€™m so stressed Iâ€™m barely making it thru my days.  I literally want to burn everything down in my life right now (including myself!).

Iâ€™ve been suicidal since high school and Iâ€™ve survived several rough patches almost this bad so a little voice in my head is telling me to keep moving and that in six months my business could be off the ground, I will have forgotten all about this painful breakup, and life  could be better. 

So Iâ€™m planning my suicide for my 40th birthday in six months.  I have the place, method, and the materials all dreamt up in my head.  If life is no better then, Iâ€™m not sure why I would keep going. 

Does anyone else do this? Does it help or am I just fooling myself?
