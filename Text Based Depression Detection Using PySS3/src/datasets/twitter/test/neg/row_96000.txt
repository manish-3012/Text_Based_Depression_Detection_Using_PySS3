I don't know what to do.I feel worthless. Everyone hates me and I understand why. I'm not only being pressured by society but by myself as well and I'm being bullied at my high school. I've been contemplating suicide and have been self-harming lately, but the pain won't go away. I want to get help, but I can't get myself to find any. Even then no one will listen. No one cares about me. I think I should just end it all. Then no one would have to deal with me.
