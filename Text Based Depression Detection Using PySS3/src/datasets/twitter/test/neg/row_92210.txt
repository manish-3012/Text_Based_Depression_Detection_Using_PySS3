HypocrisyItâ€™s ironic as fuck how my mom says she loves and cares for me while telling me that depression is stupid and she puts down my problems at the same time. The few times I have tried to talk to her about my problems, she gets angry at me and she tries to shove religion down my fucking throat. 

I just want to jump off of a bridge so fucking bad. If I ever live long enough to move out of the house, I am cutting off all contact with my family. I canâ€™t trust my parents. I really wish I could. 

It hurts so much when you ask for help from your parents and they just put down your problems and try to use religion as an emotional band aid. She explicitly told me that depression is stupid and that I have no reason to be depressed. It infuriates me to no fucking end. 

Iâ€™ve got absolutely no one to trust in my life.
