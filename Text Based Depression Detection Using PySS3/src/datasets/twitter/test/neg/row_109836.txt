Iâ€™ve decided in two years, if I canâ€™t change my life Iâ€™m biting the bullet.Iâ€™ve been depressed since I was a child. Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was a teenager. Iâ€™ve been extremely depressed since I was about 18. 

Itâ€™s been a long time coming but Iâ€™ve finally decided that in two years time, if things donâ€™t work out or get any better, itâ€™s time to leave this party. Iâ€™ll play a nice record, pull a few from a handle of good whiskey, and send a few friends the address for the cops. 

I want to make it clear Iâ€™m not advocating suicide. Suicide is an option, but itâ€™s the Taco Bell of life decisions, thereâ€™s a lot of other options before you go â€œfuck it, Taco Bellâ€. The best options take the most work, but theyâ€™re worth it when you can sit back and enjoy something you made yourself. 

The truth is, I donâ€™t want to die. I like being in a world where new things happen and I can enjoy those things... but that glitter has faded for me. I donâ€™t want to die, but Iâ€™m tired of being alive. Iâ€™m tired of being at this party and watching people have fun while all I want to do is grab my coat and leave. 

My friends Iâ€™ve confided in tell me they wouldnâ€™t respect me if I ended up doing it. That it would hurt them, and theyâ€™d feel responsible. I canâ€™t live my life for other people, and I canâ€™t continue to suffer for them either. I owe myself some peace. 

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m giving myself two years. Two years to make major life changing decisions, to put effort into all the hobbies and dreams I have to see what floats. Two years to move across the country, meet new people, maybe have better romances. Two years for my brain to age, my body to mature, and myself to grow a little wiser. 

At the end of that Iâ€™ll be in my mid-twenties, the prime time of my life. Iâ€™ll have struggled with depression, self-hatred, dysmorphia, anxiety, and abuse, for literally two decades of my existence. If it doesnâ€™t change Iâ€™m not going to waste away becoming more bitter and misanthropic as the years go on, I canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve been on medications, Iâ€™ve gone to therapy. 

Iâ€™m not going to waste my time at a party I donâ€™t want to be at, but Iâ€™m going to try and make it a little more entertaining while Iâ€™m here and see how I feel about sticking around in an hour or two.
