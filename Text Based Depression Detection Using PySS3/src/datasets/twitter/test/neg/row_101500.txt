i just want to goi wish my boyfriend didnt love me so much so that i could kill myself and have no one that really cared about me grieve. a lot happened today and it made me want to self harm really badly. i just couldnt stop thinking about killing myself. and right now the thoughts keep coming back, less intense though. does anyone else feel similar? like you wish you didnt have people that loved you so you wouldnt hurt them?
