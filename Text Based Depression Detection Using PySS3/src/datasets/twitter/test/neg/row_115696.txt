I think I'm a threat to womenSince like five or six months ago I'm experiencing a terrible situation. I'm some kind of a lonely guy and I was about to graduate at university. I was finishing my thesis and I had a lot of free time. I became nostalgic about my friends that I had on a previous college I attended (I left because of depression) and somehow there was a girl whom I remembered, she was like my sister there and we are very good friends. Well I started to think about her differently, like I had a romantic interest on her. Years ago I became obsessed with a girl from my high school (Not the same girl I have currently interest with), to the point of basically stalking her (Something that causes me a lot of shame and guilt until today) after she rejected me, she was a friend but I was very "in love" (obsessed, in reality, but I thought that way when I was feeling that obsession) with her. I had outbursts of anger and once I had one with her (I didn't threaten her physically but I told her a lot of things one should'nt ever tell a woman). 

In the city where I live now for work I'm attending yoga, a gym, even a chef course in order to have my mind distracted, still I think I'm a serious threat to women because I believe that what happened in high school could happen to me with this girl or with another one in the future. I haven't told her about my interest because I fear a lot of my reaction to rejection. I think I could seriously kill myself, fall into depression or do some crazy thing if she rejects me, so I preferred to cut most of the contact. The strange thing is that I saw her some days ago and I somehow blocked my feelings, I didn't really think about how I felt about her. We greeted and talked and that was it. But if I start to think about her or another woman when I'm alone, I become very anxious and start to remember that incident from high school.

I really love women and I want to read about feminism and all that stuff, because I think they deserve a life free of violence but I fear that once I am "in love" I could lose control of my emotions. It's a terrible feeling and I have suicidal ideations about that. I don't really think I will ever have a happy relationship (I'm virgin at 25, it's my fault, I'm not trying to gain sympathy on that).

I don't know if today, or tomorrow or in the next 30 years. But I think that I could be a threat to women and I feel very bad about that. I somehow want to stop breathing before something bad happens. That's all I wanted to say.
