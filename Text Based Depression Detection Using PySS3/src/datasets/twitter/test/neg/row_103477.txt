Tired of being alive....This will probably be a very long post, just as a warning.

I don't think I am really suicidal, I don't really have an urge to kill or even harm myself, but I am just sick of being alone and seeing everyone else so happy. Yeah, I know not everyone in the world but me is unhappy, but we all know we don't see all the other unhappy people when we're depressed.

I have had a long battle with depression, and it's been kicking my ass since I was about 12. So going on about 11 years now. I have been checked into a psychiatric facility twice (once when I was 18 and when I was 21), been to numerous doctors since it started, been on countless medications that didn't work, and I have been in my longest stretch of therapy coming up two years now. So pretty much everything shy of ECT's. The only thing that even slightly helps is the therapy, and only because of my therapist. But it only works on days I go. I go once every two weeks (down from once a week for about the first year), but it only helps on the days I go. I have discussed this with her, but there isn't much she can do. I am not her only patient and she basically works for free clinic, so there are A LOT of people she sees.

But this last year and a half has been the worst. I was totally single until I was 19, never even had kissed a girl or even held hands. That all came from the depression and lack of confidence. I was sure I'd die a virgin. Then I met her, let's call her Kate. Kate was the first woman to ever come on to me, so that took a lot of pressure off. We fell madly in love with each other. After we had dated a little over a year, we moved out together. We didn't have a thing in common, except we loved each other. I think we were both just desperate to love someone. Anyway, she was very good to me, but I wasn't so much to her. Not at all actually, I treated her like crap. I never hit her or cheated on her or anything, but I wasn't open-minded and we fought over any little disagreement until I got her to submit. I am a horrible person, I know, but I truly loved her with everything I had. 

Kate and I had an agreement that we would get married after we had moved out and stayed together for six months. I didn't even bring it up until 8 months later. She said she changed her mind. She said she still wanted to be together but she wasn't ready for marriage. Of course me being a stubborn dipshit (who in his own mind didn't see that he treated her badly) broke down. It tore my heart in half. It collapsed my already fragile psyche. The fighting got worse after that, and I constantly brought up the marriage thing. A little while after, I started becoming obsessed with another woman and started sending her sexually deviant things in the mail and, as I got worse, emails, all while I was still with Kate. The emails is when I got caught. I was arrested and spent a night in jail before posting bond. When I got out, I came clean and told her everything. She was of course shocked and disgusted, but after awhile, she decided she would still try and make it out. My crime was published in the paper the next morning and she was going to leave to stay at her dad's awhile. I made the mistake of saying I was going to kill myself when she left. She convinced me to check myself into the hospital (my second trip).

I was in the hospital a little over two weeks, and she came and saw me just about every other day. It made me so happy. Then I get out and we're back to living together. Everything is ok for awhile, awkward, but ok. Then after a week she decides she can't handle it and leaves. I was going to kill myself again but younger brother just happened to stop by about ten minutes later....I had half my note written. But she kept in contact with me and we seeing/having sex with me about once or twice a week for about three weeks then she just cuts all ties.

It's been about a year and eight months since I have spoken to her. I have seen her car a few times in town and she was at next to me at the stop light a few weeks ago, trying hard not to look at me. I had to pull over because I was crying so hard.

I never one time put any sort of blame on Kate for what I did or said a foul word about her since. I can't blame her for, as much as I would like to blame her or anyone else but myself, I can't. It was all my fault and I have to take responsibility for it.

Unlike me, Kate has moved on. I got the courage to look at her Facebook for the time since she left and she has a boyfriend now...I had to cry my eyes again. I just hope she is happy. I never deserved her. I feel so bad that I put her through all that, not just the stalking incident, but the whole relationship. "Kate", if you're reading this, I am so sorry I wasted almost three years of your life, especially after all the times I said I would never hurt you and put you through what your ex did...and I did it worse. Not to mention I completely terrified another innocent and clueless woman.  

I can't move on, something is not letting me. I don't really deserve to move on. I tried the whole internet dating for like ten months (multiple different sites) and I didn't so much as go on a date. I never even met any of the women I talked to, one only lived 20 minutes. We talked for two months and never met, I guess that's a sign.

My only grievance towards Kate is that she didn't let me kill myself. I still to this wish she would have just let. I shouldn't have told her I was going and just did it. I treated the love of my life less than human (that I waited a long time for), put her through a mess, terrified another woman, and lost everything I had at that point. I don't deserve to keep living.

Yeah, I could have killed myself a million times now, but one of my best friend's brother killed himself in January and after seeing all the pain it caused everyone, I can't put my friends and family through that. I still hope every night when I go to sleep that I just won't wake up, which is more peacefully than I deserve to go. Or get murdered, or accidently get hit on the highway or something. It would still suck for everyone in my life, but I think it would be easier on them than if I did it myself.

So here I am, almost 23...I had to move back in with my mom, I wrecked my good car last October so I'm driving a rust bucket, crappy dead end job in a crappy dead end town...no love, just loneliness. Not even a pot to piss in. I am a terrible human being who has done terrible things to people, the world would have one less loser sooner if I wasn't too chicken shit to kill myself. 

"Kate", I'm sorry. I love now and always will. I hope I never cross your mind anymore. Forgive me if I do.

 If only I would just die.
