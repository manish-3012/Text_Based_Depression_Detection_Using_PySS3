Writing this feels wrong and necessaryIâ€™m 22 (Male). I compare myself to others constantly and I canâ€™t stop. I truly do not need any other friends. I have 2 close ones (my gf counts). But my stupid ass self still wants them even though in reality I donâ€™t want more friends.. they tire me out. Iâ€™m disgusted by the culture I live in (North East, Minneapolis). Disgusted how vain people are including myself. Nothing feels real here. I donâ€™t feel real. Itâ€™s hard living with myself knowing that Iâ€™m a mediocre human being in almost every aspect. I donâ€™t understand people. I canâ€™t stand social media. I want out. Thereâ€™s a really easy format and layout in order to be a person other people are interested in (and Iâ€™ve used it most of my life) but it doesnâ€™t feel authentic. Itâ€™s a lie. I want out. I feel so alone in the way I think. 

I need advice. Literally been depressed the past 6 years.
