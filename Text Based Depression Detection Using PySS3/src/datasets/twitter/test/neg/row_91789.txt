SlippingThe absolute only thing keeping me alive is knowing the pain I'll call cause my kids.  Last week my GF starts a fight and long story short disappears for the weekend and ends it Monday afternoon. Tonight I find out she's already with someone else. This has happened to me more times than I can count in the last 10 years since my divorce. What is so wrong with me that I'm not worth being truthful to? Maybe my kids would be ok in the end if I wasn't around. I don't think I'm a good role model for them. It hurts to write but I know how I'm going to do it I just don't know where.
