Can't handle the stressSo I just want to preface this with some facts about myself . I just moved to a city with some friends into an apartment . First time on my own practically . Started going to university like a week or two ago . Anyways that's just some facts before I go into why I'm breaking down right now . What put me over was missing a class this morning . Still have to go to one this afternoon but I don't even think I can get out of bed right now . My student loans haven't come in , I assume because of my own fault for putting in documents too late or something . Stuff has been in process for over a month now with no notification or anything . Deadline for tuition is this Friday and if I have to pay out of pocket then I can't support myself in my apartment . So might have to drop out of uni . Which that fucking sucks because it's my fault . Wanted to go to the finance center and beg for an extension but I can't blame them if they say no as I'm late asking for one. I don't want to let my friends down in my apartment either but I don't want to quit . All of this hit me a while ago when I noticed that I missed my class . Everything is awful right now . I don't want to have to ask my family for hell either as I'd just look like a deadbeat . And really I am . I'm fucking useless and worthless . I think all of this is hitting a bit harder because I'm off my meds on my own accord . I can't get out of bed . I'm trying to cry as silent as I can right now so my roommates don't hear me . I just can't do this . I wasn't designed to live .
