I feel like everything i have is gone and i cant get it backI'm not suicidal by all means, I am just having a very hard time in life and I need some help before I'm too far gone. Ironically everything started going wrong as soon as 2020 started. This girl I had a crush on and I thought liked me too all of a sudden acted like I didn't exist. I still pursued her and ended up making lots of mistakes. I was used, rejected and lost many friends. Then my uncle and gramma die. Then one day while I'm helping my dad with yard work my mom comes out and starts berating me about being pitiful and does it again a few weeks later. I've been having mental breakdowns a lot and don't know if anything will get better, I've ruined relations with a good 90% of my friends and lost any hope of dating anyone. Then one of my sisters leaves her boyfriend who I had gotten very close too and his 6 year old daughter Haven. I need help please. I've lost so much and want it back so bad.
