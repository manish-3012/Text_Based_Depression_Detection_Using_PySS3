Suicidal thoughts the only place I can find comfortIâ€™ve used throwaways here before but at this point I really donâ€™t care. I feel like Iâ€™m going to die at some point in the next week even if I donâ€™t kill myself. This has happened once before so Iâ€™m probably wrong, but I canâ€™t really deny the feeling. Iâ€™m horribly anti-social and the few social successes that I have had either A. Turn into worse failures because I allowed myself to hope, B. Just serve to remind me of what a piece of shit I am, or C. Both. I know whatâ€™s going to happen if Iâ€™m alive, but if I die, maybe Iâ€™ll wake up a year ago when things were ok. I really donâ€™t think I can do this for much longer.
