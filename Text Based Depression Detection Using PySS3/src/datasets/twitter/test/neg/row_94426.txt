My bfâ€™s mother attempted suicide yesterday and I want to help him the best I canSecond day of our sophomore year of college, my boyfriendâ€™s mom attempted suicide because of the family and marital issues/drama that started last year. Things were just starting to get better recently, so it seemed like she had been doing better, too. Itâ€™s extremely saddening that this happened at all when it was unexpected. The only thing that seemed odd to me was when she thanked me for being with her son two days before. That was on mind later on but I didnâ€™t bring it up to my bf because she was telling him how proud of him she was for going into our second year of college. It was in an appropriate setting to do so, but I didnâ€™t take it as a sign like I probably should have.

Iâ€™m sharing this because Iâ€™ve been suicidal myself in the past, and because of that, Iâ€™m not mad at her and sheâ€™s in a place now where she will get the help she needs. Iâ€™m more concerned for my boyfriend because weâ€™re both continuing college students and this situation added on to the pressure of school isnâ€™t any help. Would anyone be willing to suggest how he and I could make it through this year of school after having this happened? How would a girlfriend be able to help her boyfriend get through this event?

P.s. Iâ€™ve planned on seeking counseling anyway for myself but I donâ€™t know if my boyfriend would be able to do the same. And we both go to different schools.
