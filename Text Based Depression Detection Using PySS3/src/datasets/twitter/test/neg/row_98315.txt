Posted in /r/depression looking for comfort, instead got called a troll, loser, pathetic, ect ect. Not even the internet wants me. I think I'm gonna blow my brains out tonight.I have had no physical contact with another human being besides hugs. Ever. I have been slowly going crazy. All I wanted was someone to get physically intimate with, to make me feel better, to keep me going. I just want to know what it feels like to actually feel pleasure, and to make someone else feel good. Why is that so fucking wrong? 

I've gotten so low that even though I barely have enough money to go to school every day, I am willing to throw away what little cash I do have to get this. 

I posted in r4r hoping to catch someone's eye. I got threatened with a ban. I posted in depression looking for comfort, I got rejected and treated like shit. I wonder if SW is any different. 

Its obvious that if no one in the entire world is willing to touch me, not even for money, then I will NEVER feel happy, and this loneliness and emptiness will never go away. So please, tell me what I should do? Because right now all I've got for a plan is to go out, buy the first hooker I can find and blow my brains out afterwards.

EDIT: Banned from r4r. Also, I feel a bit better since the people here are genuinely nice. The /r/depression people were pricks and only made it worse, you guys are actually helpful.
