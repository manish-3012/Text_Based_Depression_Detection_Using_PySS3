I may or may not have almost attemptedI'm sorry if this is a little much lmao i'm gonna try to get help next morning idk what to do now. I'm also sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post on. I tried to take stuff to try to overdose but after i took a little bit i stopped for a sec bc my throat was hurting and i realised what i was doing. Ii don't know if i consumed enough to have symptoms but i felt neaseus (im sorry lol) immediatly (still do), my stomach feels weird, im feeling hot and my throat still has kind of a burned feeling. Idk if i need to call poison control immedialty or can wait for tomorrow when my family is awake and they can take me (it's currently 6 am in the morning). I know this behavior wasn't normal and i realised how much i didn't want to die. I got a lot of projects for school and also end of the year stuff so i don't want to annoy my parents by this interrupting me from that (sorry english isnt my first language). I'm also scared i'm going to be too scared to tell them tomorrow but i think i might have (stuff) poisoning. Idk if this counts as a suicide attempt, but i think i'm ready to get the help i probably need. So yay?
