I donâ€™t think I can do this anymoreThis is a throwaway account. I am a 19 year old female. I am struggling so much right now. I was diagnosed with depression 3 years ago now and have been doing okay but recently things have all gone to shit, I am so in love with someone who I can never be with for many reasons, I have lost all of my close friends due to me pushing them away thinking theyâ€™re better off without me. My family donâ€™t believe that depression is an illness and that it is just a state of mind. I have no one. I feel so lonely. I got drunk tonight and I just donâ€™t want to be here any more. Itâ€™s like a punch in the gut when these feelings hit again. I donâ€™t know what I plan on gaining out of this post, I just need to get my feelings out.
