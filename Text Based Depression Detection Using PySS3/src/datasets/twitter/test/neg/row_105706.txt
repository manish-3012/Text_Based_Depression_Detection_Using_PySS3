Opiate DependanceI've been doing opiates for about a year and a half on and off. Some times I do enough to keep me very high for days and days. Other times I do much much less. I've forced myself to go through withdrawals cold turkey all the way to the bitter end of them and have recently relapsed. Now I have told my family and will be getting professional help in the next couple weeks or so.

If you have any words of wisdom, encouragement or are currently going through the same thing then feel free to spit it out right now all over this damn board.

I want to know specifics about how you stopped yourself from going back to [insert your addiction here] after giving it up for good.

As always I love you all.
