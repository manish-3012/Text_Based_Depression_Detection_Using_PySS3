Suggestions on good hotlines?I have called many, and I get the same damn thing every time.

All they want to do is discern if you're in immediate danger or not. If you are, they shunt you of to the authorities. If not, they want you off the line as soon as possible.

Are there any lines where they actually TALK? Ya, know? Help you AVOID it getting that bad?
