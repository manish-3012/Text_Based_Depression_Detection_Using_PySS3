Doing some thinking...Idk where this post is going honestly. Iâ€™m just getting some thoughts out.

I wonder how people can be so cruel to others. Manipulative, controlling. Iâ€™ve left the situation but canâ€™t get things out of my head. I forgot a few things and Iâ€™m having to accept that these items that mean so much to me are gone forever. 
Itâ€™s cruel, truly. 

My mother is a nurse and has been exposed to covid-19. Iâ€™m losing sleep ever night worrying that sheâ€™s going to be sick. Iâ€™m struggling right now, as I have for a while, but I canâ€™t continue on without her. Sheâ€™s probably the only reason Iâ€™m able to be laying here writing this. 

I have a rather submissive personality, Iâ€™ve learned. So I end up being walked on quite a lot and Iâ€™ve more or less reached my limit. Iâ€™m not really sure what to do, Iâ€™m kind of numb at this point.  Iâ€™d like to just close my eyes and just never wake back up.
