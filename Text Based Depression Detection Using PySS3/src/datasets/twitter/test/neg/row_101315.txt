welcome back, dark thoughtsYou never stay away long.

I'm almost 40, its been going on my whole life and they never stay away long. The meds don't do shit. The decades of therapy haven't done shit. Weed don't do shit.  Getting hammered don't do shit. Getting drunk as fuck and smoking weed and hash and taking all these speed and benzos they give me together still isn't enough to drown out the hurtful thoughts.

The existential crisis never ends. All you can do is grasp st apathy, working to embrace nihilism into your personality as a desperate attempt at a coping mechanism. Because what else is there when you are but slab of meat taking up space and consuming resources.

I used to think that the meaning of life, my sole purpose, was to make rich men even richer.  Now I that worsening defects have rendered me unemployable the emphasis becomes more on making my parents feel better about them selves.

Because somehow having a son unable to achieve more than a joyless life of suffering is better than the disgrace of a son dead by his own hand.

As long as I stay silent, or force a happy face.

I just hope I'm not building a tolerance for the liquor and benzos.
