I fear for my futureI am 25 but I am afraid I won't make it to 40, I live with my mother and father, my sister moved out when she married.

I am sure I have Aspergers and I know I have depression and social anxiety. I have a very hard time holding down jobs, I don't really get on with my parents as they are very old fashioned Irish types who think you just need a job to sort out your depression, they love to slander me behind my back, my mothers favourite hobby is slandering people especially her siblings, I have bad genetics with alcoholics and depression in my close family background. I can't move out as I couldn't afford rent and even if I had a job I still couldn't move out as I wouldn't be able to fit in with housemates, I am essentially beat both ways and unfortunately I worry that I will be gone by aged 40, though I suppose that wouldn't be that bad since I would have lasted longer than many of my forefathers from 100 years back.
