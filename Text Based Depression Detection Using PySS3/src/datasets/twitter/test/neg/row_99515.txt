I don't see myself succeeding at anything. All the degrees I'm interested in are useless, I have a low chance of ever getting a job in the careers I want, thinking about my future just depresses me.Took a career test today and it just confirmed what I already knew. Every. Single. Career. I was interested in was "low employment chances", "poor career outlook", "high unemployment rate".

So I have to choose between a career I'll, at best, tolerate and, at worst, be miserable in, or get a PhD in whatever the fuck, end up unemployed and depressed. 

Fuck that shit. I don't want either. If I'm never gonna contribute anything and I'm never gonna find a job in something I'm passionate about where I can use my skills, my skills are useless and I'm useless because of it. What's the point then? Waste my parents money getting a degree just for them to find that I committed suicide at age thirty because I'm fucking useless? Why wait? What's the point? Why waste any more of their their time and hopes and money if I'm just gonna be an emotional and financial burden on them for the rest of their lives?

I don't want to commit suicide, but I'm running out of options.
