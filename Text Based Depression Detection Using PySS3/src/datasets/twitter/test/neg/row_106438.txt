just something, anything at all to live for.
I have a long list of things that are all in themselves good reason to just snuff it but I am not weak nor a child. The biggest problem I have atm besides being broke homeless and hungry, is that I have literally nothing to live for. What I mean by that more specifically is that nothing at all makes me happy. Nothing. I honestly can not remember when I laughed last, Or thought anything was interesting. I am not really sad but life is undoubtedly just shit and what gets me most, what I lie awake at nights thinking is "Is this LIFE? Is this really why I exist? To feel this miserable To never know love, To never feel safe, To just fail. *This *this is why I am here?"  I just need something anything to look forward to --but my life has been so difficult I just hate everyone and everything. My only comfort for almost 20 years now has been the fact that I can kill myself to get the fuck out whenever I want. So I keep searching but I am starting to feel tired. This tiredness isn't helped by sleep. It is as if tired and worn have become a part of my personality. I think my searching is over and like everything else in life I have failed. So please no cats, no god or prayers something real that actually can help. It is probably asking way to much for some random stranger to have a thought that would have any meaning to me. I Have no means at all but am willing to do just about anything at this point crash test dummy, drug mule any gd thing. So reddit plz send me a real happy thought or some kind of course of action.
