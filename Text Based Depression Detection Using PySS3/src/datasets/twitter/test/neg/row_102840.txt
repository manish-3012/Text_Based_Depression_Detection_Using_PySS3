Please convince me to not kill myselfI have been depressed for the past 4 almost 5 years with on and off suicidal thoughts but this year has made it even more worse and intense. I seriously feel like i cant take life anymore and im failing all my classes slowly, i just stopped caring about my grades, sports, health etc. Because Im convinced none of it will matter because i'll pluck up the courage and kill myself before i can even reach my full potential, go to uni, get married etc. I have a lovely boyfriend who supports me and loves me through all this but you cant love someone's mental illness away and it makes me so FUcking mad at myself because i feel like i've just failed him and i cant even motivate myself to try and get better for him because everything just hurts so much and my heart feels heavy all the time like a weight is dragging me down. I rarely get to sleep at night, i have the worst diet and amount of food intake in a day and its all just getting worse. I feel like i make myself feel worse because i want to be able to feel like my feelings are more valid the more depressed and suicidal i am because i always feel like im an ungrateful bastard since i have a house, 2 amazing parents, friends, a boyfriend, education and support which i am incredibly grateful for and never will take for granted but it just feels like no matter what and who i have in my life i'll always be like this suicidal headcase and it just makes me feel like an awful human being. 

IM convinced i want to kill myself tonight or this week. I dont want to go through with it but im in so much mental and physical fucking pain that i feel like i cant get through it, its been 4 years. I've been to the hospital over 4 times because of a suicide attempt and it makes me feel like shit knowing that i've failed. I dont know what else to do, ive been thinking way too much. help me
