VentingI want to sit around and read, play video games, stay on reddit for too long and explore New York City, but I can't without money. But I can't earn enough money without working hard for it. Work is boring and college is coming up and I'm just getting more lazy. 

I want to end things but then I can't be lazy and enjoy the things I want to do anymore, but if things continue as they are now I won't have time to enjoy these things either way. 

I'm at a loss and hate myself for being unable to stand in the pressure of the real world.
