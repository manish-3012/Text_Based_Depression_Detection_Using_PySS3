I really just want to fucking dieI'm horrible at everything. I just started my first year in college and I'm already fucking up. My life has always been garbage and I can't really talk to family about it just because they are almost like strangers to me. I don't really have any friends and have always been a social outcast. I fucked my own life up. I set myself up for failure. I literally can't do anything. I tried killing myself several times, all were duds. Right now I am in such a shit position, nothing specific but it's just been a bunch of bullshit happening back to back. I can't deal with this anymore. I really want to just kill myself. If I had a gun it would've been over already. Despite everything I just said, I'm not really suicidal. But the pain of living hurts more than any suicide attempt that I've ever done. I want to die but dying isn't an option. I'm really stuck.
