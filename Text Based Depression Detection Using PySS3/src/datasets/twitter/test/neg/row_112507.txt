I feel like thereâ€™s no point anymore.I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m needed.
I donâ€™t think anyone REALLY wants me around.
I donâ€™t believe I need to be around anymore because Iâ€™m just another girl.

There are plenty of girls like me.

Girls with frizzy brown hair and bad eyesight.
Girls that arenâ€™t exactly fit, but arenâ€™t â€œtightâ€ or hot either.
The girl that doesnâ€™t have any friends, but doesnâ€™t say anything either because sheâ€™ll be judged for it.

A mediocre cellist and composer.
A dreamer throwing her money away by following her diluted fantasy to be a musician.
A girl that fell in love with someone who she isnâ€™t even certain feels the same way.

I want to be needed.
I feel like Iâ€™ll never live up to everyoneâ€™s expectations for me.
I donâ€™t feel good enough to be alive and Iâ€™ve tried to fix it, but itâ€™s impossible.

*Sorry to post this during such dark times, but I have no one to talk to about this *
