i think this is gonna be it..Yeah so my wife is leaving me... I cant eat for 3 days, nonstop crying, cant sleep, had to call off work...My wife is the only thing I love in the world..I was so happy to see her everyday when she came home... I love spending time with her...I dont have friends or close family other than her...Ive already made up my mind about this... Just wanted to share I guess...
