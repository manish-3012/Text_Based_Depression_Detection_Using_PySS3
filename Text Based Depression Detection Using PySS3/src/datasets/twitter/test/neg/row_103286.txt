Wouldn't my suicide be seen as human evolution? Help?I mean, let's be honest, suicide is a weakness that nobody wants so if I ever commit suicide, it means that the bad genes which are negative and not needed go away from the gene pool thus making it one person lesser in the negative gene pool.

What do you all think? I really want to make a post about my story of suicide but I'm afraid it will go unnoticed just making me angry for typing all that.
