How do I express my concerns about a friend's dark/suicidal thoughts?I've posted about a friend of mine before, on a now-deleted post, but the issue has come up again.

TL;DR: a friend and I play Dungeons and Dragons together. He admitted to me that he's felt suicidal ever since he was a child, but feels he can't go through with it due to his religious beliefs. 

Recently, my friend started playing a new character in D&amp;D. The character was dark and suicidal, and, though it *felt* like he was playing the character to the point of absurdity (i.e., he was so dark that it looped around and became funny again), knowing his background, several of his comments had me worried. For example, the character begged the in-game God of Death for oblivion, he expressed in conversation that happiness was impossible (something the player himself has expressed), and his primary character motivation *seemed* to be to complete the quest so he could kill himself in peace.

Just to be 100% clear: he was roleplaying as a fictional character, but one that dealt with his own issues. Thus, I'm not 100% sure how much of his behavior was the player himself speaking, or the character drawing on the player's experiences (and not necessarily his actual in-the-moment feelings). However, I still found these comments rather spooky, especially things like the character's expressed desire for a guilt-free death followed by nothingness--which felt for me like a rather literal wish fulfillment, given what he's told me previously.


As his dungeon master, if this were any other character, I would spin this attitude into character development: "Hey, look, here's your long-lost girlfriend! She knows that you don't *really* feel that way, you're just broken-hearted and acting out! She's here to help you find meaning again!" Knowing what I do about his (the player's) background, though, I feel like this approach would, at best, come out as tone-deaf, and, at worst, be outright offensive.

[I will add--I managed to convince the character to stick around and serve in the Death God's church--though with the caveat that the character still gets a "get out of life free" card, if desired. Not ideal, but I tried to nudge him [the character] in the direction of admitting that life might be better if he finds some meaning in it, rather than just moping about the fact that he's still breathing so much.]

Do you have any ideas for how to talk to him about my concerns? I've never done this before, and I'm afraid that straight-up cornering him and saying "I'm scared, dude" might alienate him or make him think I've been judging him--especially if he protests that he was just playing along, and didn't really feel that way. Any particular ideas for what to say/what to offer him in terms of help?
