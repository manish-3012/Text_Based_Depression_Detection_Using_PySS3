GoodbyeIn two days the girl that I still love and once love me is going to homecoming with her new boyfriend while I'm going to hang myself. We broke up about 4 months ago 5 days before my birthday and when she left I truly realized how alone I am in this world. I have always been depressed but when we were together she was my only friend and the only person to truly care about me it was such an amazing confidence booster. But now all I feel is isolated and worthless. I have tried to be social and make new friends but when theirs less than 100 per grade everyone at school has their own cliques and I'm just the annoying one who tries to fit in. She broke up with me because she didn't believe I was religious enough but a month after we broke up she started dating a another guy that's 19 and she's barely 16 and have sex frequently when she wanted us to wait until marriage (which I fully understood). I miss you so much Andrea I miss your smile, that little sassy attitude you had, how we were each others best friends and the way you made me feel like I belonged in this world. I love you Andrea. I hope you the best of luck in this world.
