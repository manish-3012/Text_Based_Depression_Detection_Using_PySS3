It's my 18th birthdayAnd I'm thinking about suicide.  What a way to spend my 18th birthday, huh?  Birthdays and New Years are always bad for me.  What have I accomplished over the past year?   What have I accomplished over the past 18 years?  Nothing.   Today I'm not only 18.  But I'm an 18 year old kissless virgin.  (I should point out this isn't the only reason I have depression).  Most people getting their first kiss when they're 14, 15, 16 etc.  Me?  18 years and never even gotten close to a kiss.   Since it's been 18 years, it makes me think I'll never get it.  Neither sex.  Considering every girl I message, doesn't reply back and I'm too scared to go talk to girls in person because of social anxiety.   I honestly never see myself getting a girlfriend, a kiss, or getting laid.  I don't want to live another day being a kissless virgin.  I know I'm young.  I know I'm only 18.  But I see me in this same situation when I'm 19, 20, 21, and so on.  

I'm lonely because of depressed, and I'm depressed because I'm lonely.  All I want is someone to hug, kiss and cuddle.  Is that so hard to ask for?  Do you know how much better I'd feel?  I'm so fucking lonely I hug my pillow.  I'm sick of being alone and I'm considering suicide.  I need help.
