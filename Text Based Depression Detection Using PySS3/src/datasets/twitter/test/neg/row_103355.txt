Tried (and failed) over dosing a couple days agoI had a lot of emotions going on, my ex kicked me out, told me she loved someone else, and wanted no contact with me. I had nowhere to go,  and no clue what I shouldâ€™ve done. So I took what money I had and booked myself into a motel. I bought 12 boxes of sleeping aides. I figured if I took them all I would just sleep and not wake back up. All lot of it is a blur, but it didnâ€™t make me fall asleep, it was the complete opposite. It was like I couldnâ€™t tell what was really happening and what was fake. Iâ€™m still not positive what all happened. But at some point The manager at the motel got complaints of loud noises coming from my room, another one called saying I fell down some stairs tryin to get to my car. And here is where I only know what the paramedics and nurses told me, cause I donâ€™t remember anything. The manager called the police and they kicked in my door, i was conscious but barely there.  I was rushed to the hospital, where I would get my stomach pumped. They refused to release me, but I talked my mom into signing a form that would release me into her custody. Iâ€™m 21 now, and hadnâ€™t had any contact with her in a long time. Now Iâ€™m back to where I was before, sitting in the same motel. on one hand Iâ€™m grateful to be saved, but Iâ€™m not happy that I was. Iâ€™m not sure what to do.
