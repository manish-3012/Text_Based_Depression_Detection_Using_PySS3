Tonight is the night!I've been planning my death for a while now. I ordered an Urn, changed my bank accounts around, and gave away a lot of my stuff. 
I was just waiting for my husband to leave town for business and for my kids to stay the night with my in laws. 

I'll finally be out of this life in a few short hours. This makes me feel so happy. Haven't felt this much joy in quite a while.  
Good bye, world!
