I am seething with rage and I donâ€™t know where else to post this.Suicide is not at the top of my mind at the moment but I struggled with those thoughts in the past and this community has been very supportive. I feel extremely unstable, like the tiniest instance could change things. Iâ€™ve never felt this much emotion and this much fear of the future.

My girlfriend broke up with me last week. We live together, just signed a lease and took the master bedroom about 10 days ago. I canâ€™t afford it on my own, but fortunately one of the new roommates was kind enough to trade once the ex moves out. Unfortunately sheâ€™s broke, not moving out til next month. And even more unfortunately than that, itâ€™s not a clean break.

She was abusive, cruel, many other things I swept under the rug to keep my life stable. It was a mistake, the two dozen times she reached peak rage and cruelty mode I ended up begging for her forgiveness for things like rolling my eyes at a manipulative comment and not remembering an argument from months ago.

It was really bad, I am still processing now that itâ€™s â€œoverâ€. She ended it because I couldnâ€™t remember what I did with my friends when I got blackout drunk at a party, she accused of being a narcissist because thereâ€™s no way I wouldnâ€™t remember, it went back and forth for days with name-calling and ridiculing and escalating to the point where Iâ€™d walk in the room and sheâ€™d say â€œpiece of shit!â€ repeatedly until I left. Itâ€™s finally stopped because the new roommates moved in and she canâ€™t scream at me anymore. I got through it because I know Iâ€™ll be able to start healing once sheâ€™s gone.

But thatâ€™s the thing. What just threw a wrench in the whole thing is the other new roommate. Male, 8 years older than me and 10 years older than her. Heâ€™s fat, talks a lot, mega-hipster who values things like fine wine and whiskey and a nice cheese platter. Iâ€™m not exaggerating, heâ€™s caricature. 

This fucking bastard, knowing the situation, knowing sheâ€™s moving out and itâ€™ll be me and him living together gets friendly with her. And unfortunately for all of us, the walls are thin.

First couple days, I was like â€œwhatever, Iâ€™ll forget she ever existed after sheâ€™s gone and we can co-exist despite him clearly being smitten with my exâ€.

Fast forward 3 days of him hanging out in the living room with her for five hours at a time, talking endlessly, and finally the kicker when he word for word says â€œYouâ€™re welcome to use my room for *personal business*, I donâ€™t mindâ€.

Right after I typed that I went in and tried to talk to the ex about it. How Iâ€™m freaking out, I donâ€™t know if I can live with that guy, I lived here for 3 years alone before you showed up and now I feel like Iâ€™m being forced out by this shit, and overall just how I donâ€™t know what to do.

She scoffed, she told me to shut up while I was talking and at the end she said â€œha, you treat someone like shit and now youâ€™re approaching them as a friend. Get the fuck out of here!â€

Iâ€™m worried about my future. I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m going to go, I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll find a place I can afford with room for all my things and close enough to work, I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll get a handle on the rage I am feeling toward her and that fucking guy and this situation. How my home for 4 years fell apart because I allowed this woman to walk all over me too long. It wasnâ€™t enough to tear me down as a person. I know itâ€™s not her fault this guyâ€™s a fuckhead, but the situation is playing out because she lost control.

I feel so much, I donâ€™t have a safe space to get my thoughts together. She bursts in the room every hour to use the bathroom or try to start a fight. Itâ€™s so fucked, I donâ€™t know what to do.
