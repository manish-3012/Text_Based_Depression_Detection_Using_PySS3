Why can I just be a successful human being in life?The guilt of my failures haunt me everyday, and I have the urge to rid myself off this Earth before I become an even bigger failure. So many people are telling me to try other things so I could see myself having a use in life, but they really don't understand why I don't want to try new things. 

I just want to get out of here, I really was never useful the second I was born.
