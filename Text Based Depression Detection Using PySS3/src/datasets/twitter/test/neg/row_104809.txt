Mods of r/suicide watch, would it be possible to implement an automated comment reply to every post providing the telephone number to the suicide prevention hot line? I'm currently viewing this sub from my phone, but I'm assuming that support information is listed in the sidebar, which is something that I can't see from my phone. 

In browsing this sub, I can't help but notice how few upvotes/comments some of these posts receive, and I wasn't even looking at the "new" posts.  I'm just thinking that proactively offering that information to each post directly may help with prevention.  

Just trying to help.   If there's anything else I can do, please let me know.
