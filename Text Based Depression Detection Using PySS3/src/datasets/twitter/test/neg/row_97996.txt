FaÃ§adeIf you saw me and didnâ€™t know me youâ€™d probably think Iâ€™m a relatively happy person. Friends, family and co-workers think Iâ€™m doing well despite differing insights in my life. However, if you honestly knew me youâ€™d know that Iâ€™m feeling lost, hopeless, and overwhelmed with suicidal ideations. 

Why would I burden them with what Iâ€™m feeling day after day? I would taint their views of me. I canâ€™t get help. In this world, asking for help is damn near incentivized, yet itâ€™s frowned upon. If I make people aware of my suffering theyâ€™d be there to notice the change in surface temperature, but in the end I would be just as dead on the inside as I once was. Thatâ€™s the dilemma. I donâ€™t want help from others nor their concern, but Iâ€™m exhausted of living with the repercussions of my mistakes. 

My life is almost not worth complaining about if I take a step back. Sure, there are others that are better off, but Iâ€™m thankful for the people in my life and thatâ€™s what makes this so hard. I should have died on that night. I did die on that night, and now Iâ€™m just a zombie in this world. I keep telling myself just a few more months, but these last couple years have been showing me that my reassuring optimism is just a facade. 

Why does life make me want to kill myself and then the thought of dying makes me want to live? F*ck this feeling.
