I just want someone to tell me itâ€™s going to be okIâ€™m so alone.  I realized I was transgender a couple of years ago.  I kept it a secret from everyone but it blew my world apart.  I still havenâ€™t told anyone about it, but the dysphoria seems to be getting worse.

I also have Aspergers and have trouble making friends, though I do have a couple.  But one of the things that helped keep me going was my friendly co-workers in the supermarket I used to work in.  I got a new job in IT but the people arenâ€™t as warm and friendly and I donâ€™t feel like I fit in.

I discovered recently that my parents are likely narcissists, and my upbringing explains a lot about my low self-esteem and ability to deal with stress, etc.  They will probably disown me when they find out Iâ€™m trans, and it will probably kill me.  Even though Iâ€™m not physically dependent on them, I still am tied to them emotionally.

I just cant see any way out.  Either I keep going the way I am and continue to get worse and kill myself.  Or I attempt to transition and end up killing myself from the fall out of losing my family, abuse, etc.  Either way I lose.

I just need someone to talk to me, to tell me I can do this.  I donâ€™t know if it will help but Iâ€™m kind of having an emotional breakdown of sorts.
