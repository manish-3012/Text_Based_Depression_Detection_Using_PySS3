What option do i have now?I don't really know what's there to live for . I have nothing left. Everything's falling apart. All my life I've asked "why me?". Why did I have a dysfunctional family with issues, why couldn't I have had a pleasant family. Why did I have to be molested when I was a child. I have struggled with self esteem issues all my life. All my life I've faced bullying and I've been made fun of. I just hate myself now. idk why I am even alive. My friends have also gotten fed up by my constant whining.maybe they've stopped caring too. I couldn't even get into a fucking college. My entire life fell apart in 2019. I hate myself , u hate everything. I have started self harm, a new level of failure. No one wants to talk to me..I feel like I should just die ..but it won't make a difference..cause no one cares
