I desperately need help.I donâ€™t know what to do any more.

Iâ€™m in so much pain every day that I no longer know who I am.

I have no friends, no home, no family and no support.

Iâ€™ve tried medication but it has absolutely damaged my mental state even more. Iâ€™m terrified to try any medications now because of the hallucinations Venlafaxine has caused me.

Iâ€™m always alone with no way out. Trapped and hopeless.

Constant fear, anxiety, panic, loneliness, helplessness, nightmares and physical pain. Itâ€™s absolutely maddening.

When night comes things get so much worse. Itâ€™s like hell is closing in on me.

Iâ€™m terrified every night Iâ€™m going to succumb to the pain even tho I beg for death every day.

I just want to live and not be in this pain.

I donâ€™t know what to do. 

I just want to hug someone and cry my hardest.
Someone to tell me everything will be fine.
Someone to help me see past through this hell.

Itâ€™s pure agony.

Every breath is pain.
