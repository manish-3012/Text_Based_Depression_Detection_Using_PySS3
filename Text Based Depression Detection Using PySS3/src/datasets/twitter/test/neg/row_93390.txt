Fiery CrashProblem: weed, accutane, and minor traumatic brain injury.  1st is my fault, my parents gave me the second one, and the third was just bound to happen.  I enjoyed high school profusely until I "greened out" (panic attacks).  Accutane put constant thoughts of self-mutilation in my head and aided in my cycle of worrying.  The MTBI was the worst experience, imagine wearing two watches and not knowing which one displays the real time.  After MTBI, I possibly had a stroke on my dorm bed after watching a shower of lights, enjoying body euphoria, and extreme limb tingling.  Add school.  Add a fraternity pledgeship.  Things are hard all over.  I'm looking for an escape from this life.  I don't know what I'm looking for on this site.  ='(  ... I need you, humanity.
