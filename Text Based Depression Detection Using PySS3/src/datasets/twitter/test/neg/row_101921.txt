Math actually makes me want to die.Every time math is hard for me, which is always, I start to grind my teeth. I fall asleep, sometimes I cry, and I've contemplated suicide in certain cases. When I wake up for school I cry uncontrollably, and I've cut myself all over from that. My parents have found blood in my room and they seem really suspicious, they've confronted me a few times. I am planning suicide, but my family will be so sad I feel. I don't know what to do. Masturbating is a stress-reliever, but doesn't work for long. I have no friends to help me, except for my previous best friend who turned on me and now bullies me for god knows why. My parents will be extremely worried if I talk to them..

Help?
