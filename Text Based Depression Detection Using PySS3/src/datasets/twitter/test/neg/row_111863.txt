Why wonâ€™t the pain stopIt hurts all the time.
Sometimes I get distracted and feel a bit better, but a few moments later and Iâ€™m back to pain.
I wish I had the balls to off myself. 
Fuck.
I think about driving as fast as my shitty car can go into the divider on the freeway but I wouldnâ€™t be okay with putting innocent people in danger, but every time I drive I think about it.
Okay bye.
