I feel like I just snapped last nightI haven't had any suicidal thought in quite some times. Live was okay, bearable. But lately I think I just have been pretty overwhelmed, and depression came back. 

I've once told myself that art is the one thing that makes me worth something in life, and without it I meant nothing. I've been pushed to consider dropping it, and in addition I just felt like I've peaked and I won't be any better. So what else that would make my life worth living? 

Even if I did managed to move and settle down in Canada, have a better life, etc, I don't know if that life is worth living if I don't feel like I have any purpose. Maybe my problem is mild compared to others, I just forgot how horrible it is to be depressed and suicidal again.
