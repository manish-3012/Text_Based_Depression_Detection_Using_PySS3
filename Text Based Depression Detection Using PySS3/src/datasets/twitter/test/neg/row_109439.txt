Going to sleep, only to awake in hell.There's a lot of words here. Thank you in advance to whoever reads them all. For those of you who don't have the time or patience I understand, so I will just sum up this post in one word: Hopelessness. 

Every night, after the 4-6 hour long debate about whether or not to just fucking hang myself from a bridge, I think "I'm exhausted, this isn't helping. I'll sleep and feel better about things/life in the morning."

And I never do. You'd think that after months of feeling like this I'd know better and just do it. My first attempt was an OD and my roommate found me and got me to a hospital. My second was in a car in a garage and a friend talked me down. Both times ended in trips to the psych wards for as long as 72 hours. I hate that place. I never want to go back, and the possibility of failing in suicide again is really the only thing keeping me from trying again.

I don't even have enough fucking money to buy a gun. On my nightly runs I just fucking pray for a drunk driver to come along and mow me over. It would be a huge help to me.

Can't go on like this. Can't go on alone. I just fucking want her back and I want to be able to handle school or even a goddamn job without crushing under the pressure. She's a terrible person and not good for me but that doesn't stop me from desperately pining for her everyday.

Going to sleep now. It'd be really nice to just not wake up but I know I almost surely will. PM me or comment if you want to talk and I"ll respond in the morning.
