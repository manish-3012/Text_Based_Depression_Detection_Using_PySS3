Update to my last post..Hi this is an update to my last post. And what has happened since then.  A lot has happened since then

I feel a lot more shitty I'm miserable and I'm in so much pain (Liver still hurts like fuck)  and I've self harmed more and My father has heart-attack symptoms he went to a hospital and is now quarantined for 2 weeks and my life has turned even more shitty. I don't think I'll be alive in the next 3 years (when i turn 20 which will never happen because I'll be dead)

I just wish i fucking go to sleep and die that would be amazing just to die while I'm asleep 

Life is super shitty and there is no future ahead and never will be 

I turn 18 next fucking year and I'm going to be a homeless sack of shit no job no house no anything

because I'm a useless piece of shit and i should of never been born

I want to kill myself so bad but my family will fucking prevent me and they will scream at me

I just want to fucking die.

My liver will probably fail in the next few goddamn months anyway

Thanks for reading.
