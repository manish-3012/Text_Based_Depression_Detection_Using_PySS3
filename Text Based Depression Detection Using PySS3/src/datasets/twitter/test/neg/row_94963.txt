I deleted my poetic post about suicide by accident and now all I have is this one.Something about my tears burning my rosacea stained cheeks. 

And being alone. 
So alone. 
Thats what sucks about looking normal is everyone assumes youre fine so no one checks up on you or realizes how important or significant they are to you. 

I wish people could tell how much I needed them. I need all of them. All the people. 
I dont know why Im never good enough. 
To keep around.
