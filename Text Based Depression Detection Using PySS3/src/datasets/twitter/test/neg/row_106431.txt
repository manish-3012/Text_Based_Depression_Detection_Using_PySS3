Was shooting today, the temptation was unbearable.Storytime

It's hard to get hands on a gun where I live, but I went on a date (don't ask me what kind of people I spend my time with) and the guy took me to some sort of cottage in the woods. He legally owns a gun and he asked me if I wanted to try shoot at cans and stuff.. I agreed, he showed me how it worsk and everything. All I could think about at that point was how easily I could kill myself. I wanted to shoot myself so badly I had to put the damn thing down, I had legit panic attack over it. I just couldn't do it in front of someone who barely knows me. Can't stop thinking about it now. I was so close and just couldn't do it.
