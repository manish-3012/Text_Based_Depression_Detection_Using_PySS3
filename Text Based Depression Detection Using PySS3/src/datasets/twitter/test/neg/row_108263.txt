I'm contemplating suicide but I know I'm too much of a coward to actually do it.Every day, every hour, I somehow daydream and imagine committing suicide, the place, time, method, my note, and what I'm feeling, seeing, and thinking. But then once I stop daydreaming and come back to reality I feel fear, fear of the physical pain that will come from whatever method I choose to commit suicide with, whether it's a quick painless death, or long and excruciating one. And I'm most afraid of is if I fail. If I manage to survive, and whether I become crippled and/or retarded from the brain damage and I become more of a burden to others. My cowardice is what's keeping me alive.
