I might kill myself tomorrowI don't want to go too much into details but my childhood was fucked up and I don't really see any reason to prolong my life. I already have a plan. Past years I've managed to live because I didn't want to hurt my family but during the past weeks my family has actually hurt me really bad. I need a reason to live because I've lost them all.
