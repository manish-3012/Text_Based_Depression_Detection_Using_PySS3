It's so bad right nowI am in such a horrible horrible place right now.
I posted the embedded post (below) here on reddit two years ago. Today I can say that I am exactly in that same place, only the second person who has ever really loved me has now died, and I now am completely alone.
I've attempted suicide twice now in the past two weeks. One landed me in hospital.  I'm running out of options but I cannot take it anymore. I absolutely cannot take it anymore.
