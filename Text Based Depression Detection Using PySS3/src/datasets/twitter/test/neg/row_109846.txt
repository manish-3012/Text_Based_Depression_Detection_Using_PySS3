i know the where, why, and how. just the when. i wanted so much to be enough.please donâ€™t remember me

after im gone

after i go somewhere great far beyond

leave my memory behind

my apologies werenâ€™t just for the things i couldnâ€™t control

but for the person i couldnâ€™t be




i used to think i had a place to go

i used to think i was a person to be

but sometimes it all got too much

itâ€™s all getting too much

and the whole world i thought was filled with possibilities

has so little left for me

i feel like thereâ€™s so little left of me

but please donâ€™t think of who i couldâ€™ve been

because it never wouldâ€™ve been enough



i wanted so much to be enough

i wanted so much to be enough
