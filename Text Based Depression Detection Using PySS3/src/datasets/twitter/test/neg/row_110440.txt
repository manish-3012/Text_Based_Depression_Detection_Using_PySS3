The final strawhi whoever is reading. I'm 15 here and giving up, the sad thing is it's hard to explain. I think people think I'm crazy and a little "off" but I've been so disconnected and at this point I just need to free me from me, I can't even look people in the eyes and have so much anxiety in public no matter where I go I am going to feel like I'm being watched and it's an insane feeling, like I've just been exposed  kind of feeling. People think I'm weird and unusual but I don't want to be feared because I would never cause harm to anyone ever. I'm breaking down crying nearly everyday and don't feel comforted. 
Space. There is always going to be space between me and who I come in contact with because at the end of the day I'm eternally lonely and have realized that it's my responsibility to carry the weight of my conscious which is so heavy right now. I don't remember the last time I was hugged or talked to someone, I feel very weak and incompetent. I'm so lonely but scared to kill myself because I want it to be painless. Please get help if you feel this way, may you be freed from the entities taking over your soul, I don't know what this is, I am so
