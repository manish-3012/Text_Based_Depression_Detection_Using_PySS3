I have given upI'm a 20 year old trans guy, and I've been struggling with mental health stuff for a very long time. I started to feel anxious and depressed when I was around ten, and it just got worse from there. When puberty hit, I hated how I was starting to get curves and look womanly, so I ended up developing an eating disorder which I still have to this day. Abusive relationships and abusive parents have left me feeling like I will never be worthy or deserving of love. I also recently got diagnosed with BPD after years of my mental health issues not being taken seriously. I've destroyed my thighs and my arm with self harm that's been going on since I was 12. I've had so many suicide attempts that I've lost count. My dysphoria makes me feel like ripping off my skin and it makes me overly aware of everything I do, say and wear. I feel like I will never be happy, and I don't see the point in even trying anymore. I've spent half of my life barely functioning due to trauma and mental illness and gender dysphoria, and I can't see the situation improving. I've tried so hard to get better, I really have. But starting HRT is easily five years away due to long waiting lists, my BPD will always be fucking me up, and this fucking eating disorder will end up killing me if I don't kill myself first. I just really don't see the point in continuing living when I'm just gonna be miserable forever.
