Tomorrow I'm killing myself in a hotel room and leaving this on my laptopTo \[Mother\] and \[Father\],  


Thank you for giving me life, giving me opportunities, and supporting me to grow. Youâ€™re both friendly, creative people who always supported me whenever I needed it and I was lucky to call my parents.  


To \[Exchange Student Host Family\],  


Thank you for hosting me. While I wasnâ€™t ready to live overseas and I wound myself into trouble a lot, I treasure that experience fondly. Two years before, I was at a private Catholic boyâ€™s school where I was bullied and Iâ€™d rebel. You guys, \[Host School\], and \[Host town\] gave me to opportunity to play with ideas, learn about myself, and meet a lot of nice people. I was lucky you chose me.  


To \[Friends\],  


Thank you for supporting me throughout these tough periods of time. Youâ€™re a creative person with an endless capacity for kindness.  


To \[Another friend\],  


I believe in you, brother. Your optimism and positivity is admirable.  


To everyone Iâ€™ve hurt,  


I apologise. I continually relive the past, unable to move on, and with that comes a deep feeling of regret. I hurt many people as a teenager, and wish I hadnâ€™t.  


The reason I give up life:  


My brain continually analyses past people, places, situations, and never stops. Reliving past experiences nonstop has consistently distressed me for years - interfering with my ability to work at an acceptable level and causing me to drop out of university. One of the important parts of being human is the ability to move on (from both good and bad experiences) and live in the present. I donâ€™t believe a psychologist can stop this. I donâ€™t believe any mental health professional Iâ€™ve dealt with understands what is going on or how to change it. I believe Iâ€™m wired differently to everyone else.
