I think it's time.I didn't want to actually do it but I feel like I have to now. I ruined my life. I did something terrible and horrible all because I'm mentally fucked up. I have no sense of identity, I have issues with my gender, I probably have personality issues, I'm depressed, I'm always anxious, I'm always paranoid. And now it seems like everything I did is coming back to get me and I see no way out of it except to end it. Because if everyone finds out the truth then the idea that everyone thinks I'm crazy will finally come true. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I have no other choice. I wanted it to be okay. But I know it's not going to be. So I think it's about time now.
