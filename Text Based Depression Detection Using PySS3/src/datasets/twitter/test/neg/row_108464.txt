I've been feeling hopeless again...and those thoughts are coming backI'm feeling so bad again. I had to stop my meds, and I don't know if it's that, or the new place, or the slight drama that's going on. It's just so little like I would have expected it. 

I don't want to die but I don't see any way out. What if my job search is for not and moving was a dumb idea. What if I can't afford where I'm living because I can't get a job? It all just snowballs and I'm so afraid of it.

Death would just be a release and I don't want to think this way but I do. I tried to call a hotline but I just can't talk to people on the phone, I don't even know what to say.
