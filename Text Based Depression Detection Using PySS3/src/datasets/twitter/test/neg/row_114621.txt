I just want to go to sleep foreverWhen I talk about suicide, Iâ€™m not seeking attention or being overdramatic, so thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t like to talk to people about this, however I think about killing myself every day. I donâ€™t want to be the weird girl that always looks at the negative side of things or the selfish girl that had everything but was too blind to see it. I donâ€™t want to make people lives harder than itâ€™s, I donâ€™t want to make people more worried about life or me, I donâ€™t want to worry my mom, I donâ€™t want her to be worried about me when she canâ€™t do anything about it, she is in the other side of the globe, I donâ€™t worry my dad, I donâ€™t want him to spend the money that he earned with his hard work on me, I donâ€™t want to make my boyfriend live harder, by me overthinking every day, every minute and every second, I want to be gone. When I love I love a lot, with all my heart and all my energy and I feel that people donâ€™t understand that and call me â€œtoo muchâ€ I donâ€™t want to be too much, but unfortunately, I am, I donâ€™t like to talk and make plans with people other than my boyfriend (I guess you can call me unsocial), so when Iâ€™m not with him, I feel lonely and lost, and when he goes away from me because he had too much I feel that he doesnâ€™t need me, he wants me gone. Iâ€™m the cause of every single argument, Iâ€™m the cause of all the rough time that he goes through, Iâ€™m the cause of him not being as happy, when a met him almost two years ago, he was one of the happiest people that I knew, so kind, so soft, understandable and caring, now I look at him almost every day and I think â€œwhat did I do with the love of my lifeâ€ I donâ€™t deserve nothing good in life, if fucking ruined that life of someone that I love and care about, I should not be here. My mom is broken because of me, because she sold everything that she can to give me the opportunity to study in a different country, and here Iâ€™m just wasting my life without a purpose in life, no living just existing, and for my dad I feel bad for not being the perfect child, not being more like him, but instead being what he doesnâ€™t believe that is real. â€œLife will get betterâ€ NO! life was supposed to get better a long long ago, but it didnâ€™t. Maybe I appreciate my sleep as much as I do because itâ€™s the only time of the day that Iâ€™m peaceful with myself, no worries, no guilt, no overthinking, none of that, I just want to be gone, I just want to go to sleep forever. 

i hate everything about me, my looks, personality, my ways... Iâ€™m living with my boyfriendâ€™s family because Iâ€™m broke, I cant pay rent and they felt bad for me. im a joke.
