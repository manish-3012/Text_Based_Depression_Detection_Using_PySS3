That's it. I'm fucking done. I honestly can't anymore. You people have 24 hours to convince me not to kill myself.I can't anymore. I can't pretend I'm a good person; I can't pretend that I want to be here. I have a shit relationship with my parents, and it's only been worsened by my grades slipping. I feel as if all my friends see me as the sack of shit I am. I have an awful drinking problem. I'm 14. I don't know what I did to deserve this. Even when I'm having an amazing day, I still feel disgusting. I feel like a waste of resources. I've tried everything: getting a shrink(who I'm not allowed to see anymore bc my parents want to "talk more"), setting goals(tried to hang myself when I couldn't reach them), talking it out with friends(who distance themselves from me when they see the total shit case that I am) ET. CETERA. I really don't want to be here. Not to mention the awful anxiety that keeps me up at night (I haven't slept for more than 5 hours every day of the week in two years).
But what pushed me over the edge is that today I went into work with a stomach bug, wound up shitting for **45 MINUTES** and didn't clean the toilet well enough. Sure enough, my boss called me and told me. I'm so fucking embarrassed. I just want to leave this fucking planet...
