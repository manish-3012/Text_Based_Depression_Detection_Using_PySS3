I just cant anymoreI've always been depressed and dealt with it in any way i could. From  sleeping to playing starcraft to just drawing. Lately thoguh I've been loosing motivation to do anything, even this. I jsut dont want to exists. I'm young (sernoir in HS) and keep telling myself that it gets better or its just my teenage hormones making me feel this way but now i'm just done. I prob wont do myself in now or tomorrow but I know that's how i'll leave this world. Anyone got any advice/tips before its too late
