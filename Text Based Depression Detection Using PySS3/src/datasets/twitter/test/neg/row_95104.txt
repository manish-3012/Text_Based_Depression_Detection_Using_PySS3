Just gonna slash my wristsH,i Iâ€™m Matt, Iâ€™m 16, and this is the story of how my life went to shit in a nutshell, why Iâ€™m gonna die, and why I probably sound like the most upbeat suicidal person youâ€™ve ever met

So, a lil about me. Iâ€™m 16 and Iâ€™m already depressed and anxious, no diagnosis though. I am also a pathological liar probably, I really struggle a lot with not lying to anyone about anything. Thereâ€™s literally not one person in my life who knows everything about me, until now I guess 

So I got depressed over a girl I could never have because I had no social life. Then I got depressed and got pretty damn close to killing my self a lot of times. I was depressed up until April when I met online the girl of my life. We started dating and she made me very happy, we even met up for real in August. The only problem is, she hates me being depressed and says she canâ€™t cope with it, so this whole time Iâ€™ve gotten very good at hiding depression.

So in my current situation sheâ€™s there ignoring me whenever I get sad and then saying I need to not talk to her when I am, because Iâ€™ve been getting worse at hiding how depressed I am, maybe my depression is even showing in this post, probably not. I have no one to talk to, no friends. I just need a really good friend, I dont care who I just need someone please. Really if life continues like this Iâ€™ll be dead in a few days, maybe even tomorrow
