Fuck.Ok, im fucking fed up with my life, let me start by saying that im not going to off myself but this vent may prevent me going in a rage and hurting ppl that care about me and i just feel like i need to vent some stuff that i've had on my chest for a long time, even if its only on the net it might help.

Few years ago i was a happy, naive 22 year old nerd who played games and went to college, occasionally had a drink at the weekend but i'd never had a girlfriend and got the most enjoyment from playing games.

Then i went to uni and my life got fucked upside down. I drank every day, went crazy, did drugs, flunked my course and generally fucked up my life. 

During this time i met a girl who i fell in love with, almost obsessivly in love with, she lived 800km away and long story short she asked me to move in with her, so i left my family and friends and moved in, only to find out after 3 months she was cheating on me with another guy. 

After leaving her i bounced around a couple of dead end jobs, contact centres, cafe's, bars etc. Was never able to hold down a job for more than 3 months because i have a problem with respecting authority, and i generally detest working menial jobs.

Fast forward 3 years, i've been unemployed and on state subsidies for 2. I live with my new girlfriend who adores me, and i can honestly say she is the only good thing in my life. Only problem is i dont feel anywhere near as much for her as my first love, and i hate myself for that.

I dont see why i should get a job, as the only thing i enjoy and am good at in life is gaming, and that is easily paid for by my state benifits. If i had my way i'd sit on my ass 24/7 playing games and never have to work in a stupid job again.

I've also become very bitter, and quite a nasty person. 10 years ago i was the nicest guy you could have met, would have trusted anyone etc... now the slightest thing will piss me off, im not a violent person but sometimes things set me off and im scared i'll end up doing something stupid.

tl;dr: I hate everything i've become.
