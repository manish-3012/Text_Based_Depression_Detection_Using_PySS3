Confused...Ive been dealing with fluctuating moods for the past month, I get really depressed and then straight after, im really happy out of nowhere, but then feeling down comes back straight after. I dont have a reason to be depressed , I have an amazing family, supportive boyfriend, great friends, and Im really confused about thats happening in my mind... I dont understand.. the worst part is that for the past week, I had moments when I felt suicidal, I just wanted to end it all, im scared that eventually, I'll get to the stage where it wont be scary anymore, and that I'll do something that will hurt everyone around me. I dont know what im looking for by writting this, maybe someone else who had similar experiences could tell me how to cope with it...
