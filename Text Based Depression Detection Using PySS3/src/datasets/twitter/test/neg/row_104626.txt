Caregiving - Polyamory - Self harmMy wife (32F) and I (34F) have been together 11 years, married 5. My wife has had breast cancer the last 4 years, itâ€™s been metastatic/terminal/stage 4 for a year. The caretaker dynamic has dramatically changed the chemistry of our relationship. We are more like best friends/family these days. There is a lot of love between us. I could tell that she had chemistry with her best friend though. So back in March I suggested that we shift our relationship toward non-monogamy over the summer so she can experience new love again. They are girlfriends now. 

Itâ€™s been a huge undertaking as my wife has had 2 new tumors, a brain surgery and has lost a lot of mobility on one side of her body since we made the shift. In that time her needs have greatly increased.  I provide most of our financial security and I know she appreciates/needs that. I am now also doing all of the cooking, housework, and taking her to her appointments. Thatâ€™s the role I have committed myself to. This year has made her prognosis pretty clear and we are all kind of preparing ourselves for what is coming.

Last week we found out that my wife will have to undergo a 3rd brain surgery as soon as Wednesday. Since we found out she has only wanted to be with her girlfriend. I get it. They have less grief between them. But I feel lost. Lately I feel so overwhelmed by caretaking alone, I am not sure how I thought I could take on opening our relationship during all of this. I didnâ€™t expect my wifeâ€™s health to decline so rapidly when we first talked about opening up. I project my fear of losing my wife on their relationship every time emotions are heightened. I found myself spiraling this week and when my wife asked me how I was I came down on their relationship instead of expressing what I am really feeling. Afraid, angry and sad that this keeps happening to my wife. I feel so selfish making it about anything else. It feels like coming down on her about their relationship has pushed her even further away from me. My heart is broken.

My panic attacks have taken a self destructive turn in the last month or so. Impulsive thoughts of killing myself, literally slapping the hell out of myself, tracing my veins with my pocket knife.. I want to be strong for my wife, but lately it feels more like I want to die. I feel so deeply overwhelmed.
