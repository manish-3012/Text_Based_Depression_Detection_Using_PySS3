I think Iâ€™m going to kill myselfI think Iâ€™m going to kill myself even though Iâ€™ve been trying so hard not to. I only have a few more days until I move into supported living, I thought I could keep my shit together until Iâ€™m around people who can actually help but Iâ€™m really struggling. Iâ€™m doing everything to try and not do it but Iâ€™m in so much pain. I can feel myself falling deeper and deeper into the abyss that is my depression, I canâ€™t seem to find any other way out.
I tried telling my CPN but she just dropped the subject after I said I hadnâ€™t hurt myself. I tried to tell her how bad it is but itâ€™s like she couldnâ€™t hear me. I also tried to tell my Psychiatrist but she also ignored me after I said Iâ€™d only hurt myself a wee bit, I only did it to try and stay in control. I feel like nobody can hear me anymore. It used to be that people forgot about me all the time and now itâ€™s as if I literally have no voice. I feel like Iâ€™m turning into a ghost. I wish I was a ghost. I wish and half expect people to walk right through me. Itâ€™s like I hardly exist anymore. Iâ€™ve tried reaching out for help for years and people have always been completely unable to help or theyâ€™ve just ignored me. Iâ€™m trying not to kill myself and I think I need help. I feel like if I had a physical illness, I would be in the ICU close to passing right now. I donâ€™t know where to turn. If I go to the hospital, theyâ€™ll just treat me like Iâ€™m a stupid little kid. Theyâ€™ve always been so patronising when Iâ€™ve been in the past, saying things like: â€œYour so young, youâ€™ve got your whole life ahead of youâ€, â€œDonâ€™t you know/care about what this would do to your family? 
I canâ€™t turn to my family because they think Iâ€™m pathetic, that I need to get my shit together. Every time Iâ€™ve had a breakdown in the past theyâ€™ve always said: â€œWhy would you do this to us?, â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with you?, â€œWhy are you so selfish?
I canâ€™t turn to my friends because I donâ€™t want to burden them with my shit. They shouldnâ€™t have to deal with me.
Iâ€™m alone.
