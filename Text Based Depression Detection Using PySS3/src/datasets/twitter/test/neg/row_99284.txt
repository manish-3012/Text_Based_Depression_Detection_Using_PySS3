Voices are driving me crazyOkay I could go a day or two without hearing voices. But when I get depressed  anxiety and paranoid I start hearing voices
Getting tired of this. Just want to end my life. At times I feel like driving off a bridge 
Or just  hanging myself in the garage. 
I don't think my doctors care .all I get is medication that at times don't  seem to help. Scared of my thoughts.and no one understand.  Every time I go out .i get paranoid thinking that there is someone following me. I get to the point that I just want to confront these people and hurt them. I get scared. And my wife is scared too. Sometimes I think is better for me just to give up. It's been to long dealing with this shit. I am getting tired. Of it.
