I finally did itI have crossed the point of no return.

I have come to a point in life where no matter what happens next I will never be happy anyways. You could tell me tomorrow that I won the lottery and it wouldn't make a difference, I would be just as suicidal.

I did it. I have become unsaveable, unfixable, doomed.
