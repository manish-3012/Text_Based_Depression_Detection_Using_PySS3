Idk... maybe I'll do it tonightI can't do anything right, I'm so fucking stupid and poor and forgetful. I'm so hungry because I don't get shit done and I don't get shit done because I'm hungry. I'm terrible at my job but it's the best I'll ever get. I'm so hungry. I'm behind on bills cause I don't ever do enough. I wanna just die and leave it behind me. I don't even feel much joy so what's the point of working through it afterwards. My art is suffering from it and has been worse. I don't have fun doing my hobbies I just do them to avoid shit. And now look where I am. I don't give a damn anymore. End me
