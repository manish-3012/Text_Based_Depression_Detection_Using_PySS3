Iâ€™m disfigured and I canâ€™t live with it anymoreIâ€™ve posted my story on reddit before, how I was left on a medication for rosacea that slowly caused my symptoms to worsen, flushing and swelling over a six month period. 

I continued to go to the dermatologist with pictures of what was happening and they misdiagnosed me with â€˜severe rosaceaâ€™ then when the swelling got worse they misdiagnosed me with autoimmune disease. It was the antibiotics all along 

Long story short, six months of severe flushing and swelling left me permanently discolored and swollen 

Itâ€™s been two years. I loved life so much, but I canâ€™t live like this anymore 

I feel responsible for not stopping the medication sooner. 

Multiple dermatologist continued to advise me to stay on them

I should have never listened. It ruined my face, my life.
