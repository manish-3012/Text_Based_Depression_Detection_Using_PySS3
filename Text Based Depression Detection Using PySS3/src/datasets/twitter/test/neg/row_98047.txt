How to get self committed involuntarily with least self-harmWhen I was 17 I was voluntarily committed at a hospital psych ward for 5 days due to suicidal behavior. I'm 20 now and still living at home.

The problem is my parents would never commit me unless I actually did something drastic, enough to get their attention. I really don't think I want to die, I just want all this *shit* to go away, the pain, blah blah whatever it doesn't matter. The point is I want---*need* to get committed so I can have some time at a place where I ***actually feel safe***.

What is the best way to go about this? If I somehow manage to voluntarily get committed then I won't have expressed all this self-rage and I might try something while there, and they kick you out for "funny business" like that (they told me that last time I was there).

Advice?

***edit:*** to be clear, I seriously contemplate suicide on a daily basis and have for several months now. I don't think I made that clear.
