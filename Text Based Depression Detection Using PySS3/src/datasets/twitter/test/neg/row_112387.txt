Thinking about ending it allIâ€™ve been married for 12 years and itâ€™s a very hard marriage unfortunately. My daughter is 11.  My job requires long hours, my wife is bi-polar and doesnâ€™t get along with my side of the family among other things and our sex life isnâ€™t that great. Having said that we took a little time off to be separated. We are still married though. During that time for some reason I e-mailed an ex of mine just to say hi or see what was up or whatever. Anyway, she responded quickly and she told me that she has news I may or may not want to hear. I asked what is it, and she said that she had a daughter and she wasnâ€™t sure but it may have been mine.  The dates lined up. She sent me a picture and honestly I didnâ€™t see a resemblance to me. I only say this bc my daughter is damn near a spitting image of me.  I asked her what she wanted from me and she said nothing. She said she herself didnâ€™t know for sure who the father was. The child is now 17. I basically freaked out. On top of all of that this  e-mail conversation all happened on Christmas Eve.  I had 0% knowledge of any of this before that day. This was a few years ago and Iâ€™ve never followed up on this bc of the hurt I feel and the mental well being of my house. My wife use to cut herself and while Iâ€™ll never do it but I do think about suicide quite a bit now. My soul feels awful and sometimes I can barely get out of bed. I just want it all to end.
