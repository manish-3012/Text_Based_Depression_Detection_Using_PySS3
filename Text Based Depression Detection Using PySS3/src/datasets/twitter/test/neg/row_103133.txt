I have no oneAnd I'm not exaggerating. Not a single soul cares about me or would notice if I perished. Loneliness is devouring me whole. I've been alone for 5 years now. I did lots of gaming and listening to music to cope (sitting in my room all day), but it's getting unbearable as of late.

I don't know how it came to be this way. Perhaps being homeschooled was a factor.

I'm seriously thinking about ending it 'cause this feeling is worse than death. 
I'm in a constant state of mental agony. 18 btw

I've run out of tears to shed or hope to hang on to. 

The only thing left to do is cease to exist.
