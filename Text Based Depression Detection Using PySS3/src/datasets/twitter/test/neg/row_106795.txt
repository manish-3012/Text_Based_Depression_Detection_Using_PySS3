I'm not gonna do it. But i want to.I would rather live than die but trustme, I get that aching feeling that I am a regret, a mistake, a tumor on the world. That I have a past that I cannot fix and that I will always be chased by it. That my life is nothing but a mirage of what I could have been  cause of who I am. I am nothing. And Trust me, I get that feeling of just leaving forever. I won't though. I won't.
