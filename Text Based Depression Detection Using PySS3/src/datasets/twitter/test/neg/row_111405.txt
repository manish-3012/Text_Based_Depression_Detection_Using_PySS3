It happens again and again.I'll have a good stretch of pure happiness and then some string of events will bring me back down. I'm tired of toughing it out, i just keep fucking up. I have no mental illnesses and no chemical imbalances. I've been tested. My life and most of the people in it are shit. I've never really worked up all the courage to kill myself, i usually just shut my door and cry on my bed like a bitch. I know i'm a good kid and i've done good things but right now the bad out weigh the good. I just need someone to talk to. Other people i've talked to have teached me so much, but alas, here we are again. You people are saints. Thank you.
