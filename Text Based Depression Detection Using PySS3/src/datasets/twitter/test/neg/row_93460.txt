I'm obsessed with wanting to die.I've got a note written out already and I've read through a ton of other people's last words and suicide notes. I wish I could fake-die just to see what people do and say after I'm gone.

I know I can get better. I know all of this stress and exhaustion will pass and I'll get to a better point in life. But I know depression is a cycle, and no matter how long I live or how many stupid positive affirmations I tape to my bathroom mirror, I will want to die again.

I'm just too morbidly curious.
