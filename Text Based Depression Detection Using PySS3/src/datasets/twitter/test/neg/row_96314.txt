Why bother.I have hit rock bottom. Have you ever noticed that when that happens, when you truly fall apart, the people who you thought would be there for you just scatter? I have told 3 people of my intention to die, 2 of them health professionals. I have begged to be put into a mental health facility. Not one person has taken me seriously. I have lost the love of my life. Left me 2 months ago after 17 years. I find joy in nothing. Nothing. My mum doesnt want me to go into hospital because it means I will miss work. Who gives a fuck about work? Do you want me to live or not? 
My ex won't give a shit if I am dead. He has cut me off completely. I wake up every day and think "will today be any better?" It never is. Never. I just had a chat with Lifeline. Not even strangers give a shit. All scripted crap. 
In the end, we are well and truly Alone. I could die tonight and no one will even notice.
