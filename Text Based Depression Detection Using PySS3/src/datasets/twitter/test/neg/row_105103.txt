Why am I guilted over suicideI don't understand the usual phrases said when suicide is brought up and I don't think I need to mention them since everyone must've heard them at least once.

Why should I feel bad about it, why should I worry about others when no one worried about me and my mental state when I talked about it?
Why is only death taken seriously and not what lead to it?

Why do people think of themselves up until the person is gone which is a paradox since they won't be able to care about someone who's now dead... I don't understand how people can so easily tell to just "get help" and be in the hands of total strangers that aren't even guaranteed to help...

I just want to be forgotten and be able to go without having to worry about others all the time it's tiring and making me want to do it even more even if I hate everyone for it.
