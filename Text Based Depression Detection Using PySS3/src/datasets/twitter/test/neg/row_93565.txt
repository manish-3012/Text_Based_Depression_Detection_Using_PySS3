Given up on this world need to escape to a fantasy to be happyRemember when life was simple when we had no idea about horrors like politics, school shootings, the possibility of a world war 3 or any issues like that when we could just be happy and pretend we were in another world? Yeah me too I the only thing thing that keeps me going is make jokes about the things I've listed above but these PC faggots are make me feel horrible for what I do even though it's my only way to escape it. I don't want to live in this world anymore I just want to go to a fantasy world of Love, Romance and Fun a world where I can be a kid again without being told to "grow up" and I swear if any of you guys tell me to "grow up" I will kill myself right now. I just wish I could build a portal to a fantasy world or at the very least travel back in time to erase my mistakes I know some people are idiots and don't believe that's possible so I'm not ask for advice from you all I'm asking for is if you know a group of people on the internet that have the same interests as me so hopefully I can find happiness in being with my own kind at least. Instead of having to kill myself to escape the pain. 

Thank you 

Lots of love
