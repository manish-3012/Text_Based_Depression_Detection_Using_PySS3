help?I'm 19 and i just want to kill myself. I got barely into university in a course i have no interest in learning. The only reason i am in there is because my mom really wanted me to go. I don't have any friends to spend my free time with. So all i do is go to class and stay in my room all day. I don't have any hobbies. All i want is to be with someone to have someone to spend my time with, maybe even someone to love. But i don't even know if it will make me feel better because i'v been alone for so long. If it all stays the same i don't see myself finishing university. I just can't get myself to do anything. I'm just so tired of being lonely.
