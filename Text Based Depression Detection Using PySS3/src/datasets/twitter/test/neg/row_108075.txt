Failed attemptWell, got caught with drugs in the club and banned for life, got very depressed and took a mix of about 70 prescription pills, woke up in the hospital, could barely talk let alone walk and my coordination was totally gone. Spent the first day and half hallucinating, like proper seeing people in the flesh who werenâ€™t really there. Got discharged a couple days ago cause I managed to convince them I donâ€™t want to kill myself anymore, which is a lie.
The reasons I want to commit still stand, I want it all to end, unfortunately I have nothing in my possession that I can use to make sure Iâ€™m well and truly gone, and not just end up back in hospital or in a psych ward or some shit, cause thatâ€™s not a life worth living. Thatâ€™s all folks, sorry for the long and boring post
