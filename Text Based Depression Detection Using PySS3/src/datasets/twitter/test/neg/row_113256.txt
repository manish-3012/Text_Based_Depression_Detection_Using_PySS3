I donâ€™t think I can ever get over my wifeâ€™s emotional affair. All I think about is about ending itMy wife had an emotional affair about half a year ago. We did counseling and it didnâ€™t help me at all. All I think about is just wishing I could disappear, but then I think about my 2 year old daughter and get so emotionally torn.
