TonightPeople always told me things would get better. They told me suicide was a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Well, if only they knew depression isn't temporary, it's not going anywhere. So tonight, I'm going to do what I should have done a long time ago and kill myself. I hope everyone reading this has wonderful life, if not I hope they find peace. If my dad is reading this, he can go to hell. If you grieve my death, I'll give you the same advice you gave me in regards to my depression: get over it. Anyways, I guess this is goodbye. Peace.
