I have struggled with PTSD, depression, physical pain, hate, fear, ect ect ect... Since I left the military right after my deployment in 07'-08'. I have been to a few mental hospitals and have a rating from the VA for these issues.

There is not a day that goes by in my life that I don't think about suicide and just stooping how much I hurt. I can keep the feeling at bay most of the time but today is not this day and I am afraid~ish.

I do not feel confident that I will try and attempt on my life tonight but I am not 100% sure on this and my mood is only getting worse as every minute passes.

I am trying to figure out if I should call for help but I have other things to consider if I do this. The last time I made a call for help I was in the mental ward in Topeka, KS for many months, muuuuch longer than your average stay and I do not want to go through this again, for many reasons. There is one that I want to bring up b/c it's a nasty catch 22...

As I understand it if you spend more days of a month IN the ward than OUT of it, you loose your disability for that month. If I do this I will be homeless (again) and this is not an option.  I swore to myself the last time, no matter what, not even for a day will I ever be homeless again, I do not deserve this. So, with that said, I am very reluctant to ask for help b/c I feel I am almost signing my life away. I make so little money from the VA as it is that anything that would fall under a "Financial Hiccup" would crush my life.

I do not know what to do. I just want to stop this pain, I want my old life back. I miss me.
