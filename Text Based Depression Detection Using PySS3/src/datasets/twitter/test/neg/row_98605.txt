I really want to dieHe said he loved me.

He said i could be "the one".

But then i found out on his reddit how he regretted losing a girl that he was with years ago, that he thought that girl could be the one.



I confronted him and he made it like its not a big deal. He also said its normal to miss something that you dont want. Wtf? He was missing his past relationship and his ex. How the fuck was it normal. 


I can only conclude that he lied to me when he said he loved me.
