Got a bottle of pills in one hand and a bottle of gin in the otherI'm close to downing both, I don't know what to do anymore. I know that I'll hurt everyone close to me, but I can't keep going on. I have everything I could ask for but and my friends and family all tell me they love me. There are only two other people in this world that know I've been thinking about suicide, and right now I'm scared as hell. I just don't know what's wrong. How can I have so many people who care about me and still feel this way?
