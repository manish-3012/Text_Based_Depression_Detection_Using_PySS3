Help! My friend is going to kill himself. What do I do?One of my Australian friends sent me a message telling me that he's going to kill himself. I was very sad and shocked. I have tried to talk him out of it, but I haven't been successful. The thing is that I live on the other side of the world from him, and I can't go see him. This is making me feel sick everyday and I know that he's going to do in in a few days. What can I do other than being there for him? Can I call someone? I don't know what number to call, since I don't live in Australia.
