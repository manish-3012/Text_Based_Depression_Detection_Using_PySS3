After which you crawl back into bed in the early morning blue lit room you feel disconnected to.  
A razor in your hand, one you bought to score scores of loaves because baking is calming.   
Waking up is awful.   
Even if you were having a nightmare, the jolt from fantasy to suicidal is never easy.   
Early mornings remind you of the emptiness on the shelf of your accomplishments.   
Waking up early reminds you that you are alone. Alone and barely getting by.    
I will not let my cat starve should the razor be enough for me to leave.  
Depression is putting more cat kibble in the bowl than she needs because you wonder how long sheâ€™ll be alone.
