Im tired.Im tired of living.

Im tired of.. everything.. i dont know anymore

There will be some days that i will think that the world is good and my life is going to great!

But i remember, day after day. Everytime. Life is just a loop of suffering

I dont know anymore what to do...

I want to do suicide but im islamic so killing yourself would guarantee get you to hell.

I want a quick,fast,quiet death but a way to say goodbye.

I already have a plan to do it

1. Enjoy 10 days of my life

2.At last day, write a goodbye note/book

3.Calls

4.Freedom (suicide)

Welp thats enough of my plan

Also im actually 11 but i wanted to commit suicide when i was like 8-10
