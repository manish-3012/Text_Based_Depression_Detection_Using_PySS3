Feeling like I'm arguing with myself.So I've been diagnosed with depression and have been attempting to treat it for the past couple months. Lately, and it happened today, I've been having sporadic changes in my though process. One hour I'll plan my suicide in my head, and one hour I'll think how crazy I was being for thinking like that. It constantly changes. I don't know if it's based on what I'm doing or if it's some underlying issue, but how can I prevent the bad thought from taking hold over the good thought?
