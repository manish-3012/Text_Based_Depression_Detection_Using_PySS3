I just want some peace and quietBetween constant worry, the never ending struggle of grades and trying to succeed, chronic pain, anxieties about my shitty decisions, and nothing to look forward to, wouldnâ€™t death be at least a little effective? Everything is just a constant negative swirling abyss of shittiness, month after month. Iâ€™m going to graduate and leave this fucking pit just to end up in another one, just as unhappy with my life. Killing myself just sounds like a big relief. Thereâ€™s no reason to keep going on with this life, and if I just die then at least I get to be done with all of it. The thought of sleeping forever sounds amazing. Iâ€™m so tired, Iâ€™m so unready and unwilling to face the rest of this life, I just want to end it here. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m fully useless per say, but Iâ€™m not important. Call it cowardly, but I think it would just be so much easier.
