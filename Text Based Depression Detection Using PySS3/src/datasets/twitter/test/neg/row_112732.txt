Im 99% sure I want to die but am afraid of the unknown. If things were just a bit different or I hadnâ€™t of made a rash decision, things would be different. Iâ€™m scared, Iâ€™m alone and I donâ€™t know what to do. Nothing lasts foreverI think I want to die. My mental illnesses havenâ€™t responded to treatment and I feel really really bad all day. Honestly my quality of life is extremely poor. 
But Iâ€™ve brought some of it upon myself which makes it worse 

.Iâ€™ve isolated myself the last few months and made a decision a few months ago that has caused me more pain and lowered my self esteem. I basically took a risk and it backfired but I donâ€™t wanna go into detail. If things were a bit different and I hadnâ€™t of made that choice, Iâ€™d probably wanna live a bit longer and give things a go. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d live long term, however. 

I feel fucking terrible that Iâ€™m conflicted and itâ€™s purely because of my friends and family. I donâ€™t care about myself. Fuck this life and these sorts of decisions. I feel like I may have an ounce of regret once I make the decision to end my life. But I am also contained to a life of extremely low self esteem, depression that doesnâ€™t respond to treatment and generally high anxiety. I do want it to end but the world makes it so difficult and unaccepting.
