What's the point of it all (Princess Bride)I really think it's like Wesley said in PB "Life is pain."

&amp;#x200B;

Life sucks. It hurts just to live. It doesn't get better. 

Any joy is temporary. 

I think other people have happy successful fulfilled lives but that's not in the cards for me.

I wish I was dead. Every day over and over and over and over I just keep on wishing I was dead. I go to bed not wanting to wake up. I think about various ways to commit suicide so that it looks like an accident. I've settled on single vehicle car accident into bridge or brick wall or telephone pole. If there is no note then they can't say it's suicde. Or an "accident" hiking up a mountain - where I live there is a lot of mountains and hiking and places to "accidently" fall off of. I already like to hike b/c that wouldn't be suspicious.

It has to look like an accident for insurance reasons and for my kids. I don't want them thinking this is okay.

I hate myself so passionately and I want to die.
