Uh, weirdo here, just, help, pleaseI don't actually feel so suicidal, as many people I see on this subreddit, but, I still feel quite a lot like it. Like, sure, I'm smarter than average, yet I always get into trouble with other people or with myself, mostly the last one, tbh. Like, should I be dead? I suffer from anxiety, depression and hiperactivity, and no matter what I do, it always feel like it's wrong, or not even worth it. Only things that matter to me at this point, part of my (social) anxiety, I think, are the effect my suicide would cause to people who surround me, my parents, my little sister, and my girlfriend, for the biggest part. I feel like everything would be better with me dead, but even me causing my own death would cause trouble for people, something I can't bear to think... I know there's something in me worth for living, but everything else makes it useless
