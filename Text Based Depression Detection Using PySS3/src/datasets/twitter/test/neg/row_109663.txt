I posted in here a few days ago, it helped, but things have gotten worse.I can't do this anymore. I just need help and it sucks that I am reaching out so much but no one, besides the amazing people who message me after my last post, will help me.I quit my job, dropped out of school, and am now homeless. Everything I have worked so hard for is now nothing and I made the decision to do it. I am completely numb right now but am so incredibly scared for what will happen when I start to realize what's going on. I just needed someone to read this and pretty much evade myself from posting it on Facebook or something. I have had suicidal thoughts for years so my concerns for how I may act are not invalid. I know that I really don't want to die, I just want to have an option or just be someone else.
