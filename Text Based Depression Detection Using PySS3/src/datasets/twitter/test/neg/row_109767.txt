I just wanna end it all but something is always holding me back.I mean i have real friends, a family that loves me and a good job, but im still sick and tired of all this. I tried to end myself several times by hanging beeing the recent method or trying to jump in front of a train, even oxygen deprivation with helium. It either didnt worked with the oxygen deprivation i only was unconscious or didnt had the balls to do it like jumping in front of a train. By the last week i tried several days to end it by hanging and everytime i feel a little bit numb i always pull myself up cause i have two branches under my feet where i could just do a short jump and that would it make harder for me to save myself from it. I just lean forward because i dont have the courage to just letting myself end it. I just dont wanna live i have no motivation to keep all of this going. Neither do i wanna seek help i just want to end it since February this year.
