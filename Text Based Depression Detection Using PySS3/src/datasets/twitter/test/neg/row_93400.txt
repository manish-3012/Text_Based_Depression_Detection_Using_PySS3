I honestly don't know anymore...I can't deal with my depression any more, I can't even find anything to hold me back anymore... I just want that knife more and more, even though people tell me no it makes it worse, I'm sorry to those who will hurt after reading this.

The final straw in my book:

Guy, telling me I like 10 year old girls (Accusing me of pedo) And saying that my Autism and what I just said, I should go kill myself over...



Also, many people have said it gets better... Honestly? It doesn't... It mostly gets worse... and worse... and even worse...
