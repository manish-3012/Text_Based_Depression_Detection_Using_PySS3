I wish I was brave enough to do somethingI want noting more than to die. Every time I go to try something, I chicken out. I would give anything to not be here anymore. Why should innocent people die when I could. I donâ€™t know how to function anymore. It seems so easy to pull off. Except for the part where I have to actually take that step. I think Iâ€™m worried about what will happen after I die. Not for me but everyone else. Like I believe that when you die, you die. Thatâ€™s it. Nothing else. But Iâ€™m scarred for everyone and everything else that Iâ€™m leaving behind
