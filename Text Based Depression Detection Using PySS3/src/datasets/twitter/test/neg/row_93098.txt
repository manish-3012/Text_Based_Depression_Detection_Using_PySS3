Is it normal to feel suicidal after a few weeks of unemploymentHello, everyone.

First of all, this is my first ever Reddit post \(I just created an account\), so please forgive me for any formatting/posting mistakes I may make with this.  Now that that's out of they way, as the title implies, I have been unemployed now for about six weeks, and I've been having trouble staying motivated to even live since it's been difficult for me to find more work.  For a little extra background, I am a 24\-year\-old\-male, recently out of college, and still living with my parents for the time being as I seek new work.  I was laid off from my previous job with a non\-profit organization, as there was a bill that we were trying to get passed in the state legislature, but never even came up for a vote.  It didn't really help matters that I never felt fully comfortable with this position either, as it required a decent amount of travel and speaking with others, and I am not a people person.

In any case, I have been having much more difficulty finding new work than I expected, and this has absolutely crushed my morale and general outlook on life.  I have started seeing a therapist, and I have strong religious faith \(Catholic\) that keeps me going somewhat, but things have been so frustrating with the job search that I have gone so far as to actually think about planning out a suicide \(choosing a date and location, method used, etc\).  If it weren't for my faith and the fear of my friends and family going through unnecessary pain, I just may have already gone through with it by this point.  It is also worth noting that I am a gun owner, which makes me uneasy.  I've considered giving it away for a while to someone I may trust, but I don't want anyone to worry about me.  With that being said, though, I just don't know how much more unemployment and general lack of direction in my life I can take.

Can anyone else relate to this?  How did you cope, and did it ever get better?
