I just need to rant about thisMy uses me as his caregiver, and has been using me in this way since I was a little kid. He also has used physical abuse as a parenting style. My mom was my world, and was my escape and the one I could tell anything to. But sheâ€™s gone. I no longer have my rock. Iâ€™m horrible with handling anger, and my dad makes me the angriest out of everything, and he makes me massage him, using my elbows, fists, heels, whatever, and he calls me into his room up to 10 or so times a day, and I usually have to put him to sleep at least once. But Iâ€™m responsible if he wakes up. So this is where the anger comes in. I have so much pent up anger that Iâ€™ll show it, maybe Iâ€™ll yell at him, or hit him too hard, but then Iâ€™m in trouble, so instead, Iâ€™ve taken to clawing at my skin, (usually my inner arm, hitting myself (I almost broke my own arm once) and hell, even biting my knuckles and arms. With the clawing, I really donâ€™t do much damage because I clip my nails almost religiously. Sorry for rambling on. Sometimes I think dying is the only way out of the place Iâ€™m in, I hate it. I hate that Iâ€™m not even allowed to go on a walk or go to my friendâ€™s house and my phone (my only communication to the outside world) is taken away for little to no reason. My dad will compare me unfavorably to my mother, and put me down all the time. I just feel like suicide is the only answer
