I'm doing itI am exactly as my username reads: a worthless cunt.  I have no friends and barely any family, and the family I do have are either insane or backstabbers.  Or both.

I had a bright future ahead of me when the person I loved more than anything in the world decided to spread lies about me to my employer.  They believed him over me even though they don't know him.  Now I can't even get a job working in a fucking grocery store.

My childhood was filled with beatings and molestation.  But I'm a liar.  I'm a liar, I'm a liar, I'm a liar.

I can't make money to support my elderly mother.  I've failed her.

I'm a worthless piece of shit, a waste of space.  I've been waiting since I was 12 for it to get better.  I am 25.  It's not getting better.

I look forward to dying, because either I'll wind up someplace different than this, or I'll stop existing altogether.

I can't wait.
