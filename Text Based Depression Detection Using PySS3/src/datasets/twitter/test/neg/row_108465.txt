I fucking hate those "call this hotline it's ok" postSpecifically those that give the same fucking examples of things i don't have, making mild generalizations like that's going to do shit.

"Call this hotline so we could involuntarily hospitalize you regardless if you've gotten this treatment numerous times and still nothing has changed." 

 what is with stuff like this always making such mild assumptions. I don't have family or friends who give the slightest shit about me. Internet strangers don't love me because love roots from personal affection, not pity or being able to relate. It's always the same damn example, "people still love you." How? My mother is dead and everyone else cut me off, therapy does jack shit, meds aren't helping, self help books state the obvious but in smarter terms. 

Any fucking post about suicide prevention gives me more reason to just fucking off myself and it pisses me off how often i see it. If it helps someone then fine, godspeed, but t's so fucking ironic how counterintuitive it is for me
