Getting readyI'm cleaning my entire house, trying to sell all my stuff, wrote notes, and am just waiting a few days to get stuff cleared out so my family wont have to deal with getting rid of stuff after. I wrote out who will get my beautiful dog. For the longest time I thought he would be crushed if I left. I know he loves me but I have crippling anxiety and hes so anxious and I think it's my fault. I've never been so ready before.
