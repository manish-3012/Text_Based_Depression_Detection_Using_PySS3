just want to dieEdit: Im sorry i know this is probably a mess to read and has no purpose but i just have to say something somewhere i know people will see it, thankyou if you bother taking the time to decipher this shit. 

Im 18 just got out of a relationship with my gf, i dont even know if its over lol we've broken up like 20 times  i just give up when we argue and fall out now and live to regret it after. im so emotionally drained with everything i know my relationship was toxic and probably not the best but i gave everything i had to this person and i still fucked it up. Ive felt somewhat depressed and had suicidal thoughts since i was like 12, my life isnt even that bad so idk whats wrong with me im just fucked up. Ive fucked everything up my whole life and its like this person was the last chance at happiness i had and i managed to fuck this up. They were way too good for me but they caught interest in me and they reached out to me where i could not. ive felt my happiest and saddest with this person and i hurt them so much i made her relapse after being 1 day away from a year without self harming. Im just fucking worthless all ive bought to this earth is shit ive been a shit person my whole life its just who i am even if i try to do good i just fuck up somehow and hurt people like i did her, shes been through so much shit in her life more than i could ever imagine and i just wanted to be good for her and make her happy. I have nothing left in my life i look and think about maybe trying to have a future and live but its just not worth it to me. I grew apart from the few friends i had when i got with this person, its hard to explain but they kinda didnt like eachother without even knowing eachother and they kinda pushed me away as i got to know this person and now i realize i was just there to them they really dont give a fuck and are happy going on with their own lives. I told my sister i self harmed when i was having a breakdown  and needed her to fetch me bandages and she basically didnt even care apart from the occasional "you ok" text. idk icant blame anyone im just not wanted here ive fucked up many good chances i had and now theres nothing left for me. Even if shit could change in the future i dont want it to. I dont deserve to be happy and i dont want to be here without her. My entire family just thinks im useless, which i am but i cant help it my brains just a constant emptiness ive got to the point where im so drained i dont feel anything anymore. I just want to sleep forever. i spent years of my life being scared about death with anxiety about health issues that i had, i didnt expect to be alive today. I wish something just took me. If i had one wish it wouldnt even to be to have another chance with this girl it would just be to sleep tonight and not wake up because if i had another chance i know i would just fuck it up again. I think im comfortable with it so i dont know why im delaying it sat here drinking alone typing this shit to people who ill never know and who will never really care. I just had to say something somewhere im sorry. Im thinking about getting some pills off the internet and oding but i dont know. I dont even have the energy to cut myself anymore
