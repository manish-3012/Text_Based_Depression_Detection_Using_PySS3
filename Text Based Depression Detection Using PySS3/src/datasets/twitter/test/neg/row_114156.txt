Day 4 of Losing HerIt's day 4 and I'm finally starting to feel something other than the sadness and grief, pain. Pain not in an emotional state, pain as my body hurts. I am developing a migraine, I feel lightheaded when I stand up or move too fast, my legs feel like jelly under me, my vision is blurring when I'm not seated. I'm realizing my body is going to go into survival mode if I don't eat soon. I haven't lost anymore weight but I expected as much, I'm pretty much starving myself and soon enough, I'm going to be in bad shape unless I eat. As much as my body wants it, my emotional state is fighting against it. I know what the right thing to do is but I can't find the inner strength to do it. She took every part of me when she left, I don't feel like life is even worth living without her.
