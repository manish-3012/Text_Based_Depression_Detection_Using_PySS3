Got a B in another class, crushing my dreams basically.I know in the context of the other stories mine is so small and stupid. Whatever. Iâ€™m still gonna kill myself over it.


I wanted to go do a MD/PhD program but my GPA was slightly below average, but nothing a semester of a couple As couldnâ€™t fix. Then boom, got a B. GPA is now significantly below average for admissions. My boss is gonna be upset with me, Iâ€™m upset with me.


I canâ€™t go on any longer.
