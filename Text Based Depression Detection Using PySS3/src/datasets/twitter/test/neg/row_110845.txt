can't take it anymorei'm so bad at everything i try to get into, people always yell at me for doing horrible but i swear im trying my best. i have a nearly endless list of mental disorders ranging from  extreme paranoia to bipolar disorder. im fucking done with being the retarded friend that everyone laughs at. i'm done being a fat fuck who sits in a chair all day doing nothing. im tired of disappointing my parents im just done. i wish i could j ust be smart, i just want to be "normal" god dammit. i pretty much lost my sanity about a year ago, when my only true friend passed away from cancer, ive been a fucking mental wreck ever since. i beg for death every day and god dammit if i have to do it myself i will. but i will more than likely wuss out like i always do. if anyone can help ill be up probably all night [EDIT] screw it im tired pce. sorry for this poor writing i probably should have put more thought into this post
