I think Iâ€™m going to do it tonightI can not stop the constant churning thoughts of where I could be, where I should be. 

I am WAY smarter than the life I have now. I just made bad choices that has gotten me into a pile of shit, but Iâ€™ve always been smart.

I couldâ€™ve easily gone to school for social work straight out of high school &amp; I know that wouldâ€™ve been a GREAT job for me especially someone who was adopted. That was my DESTINY. 

Iâ€™m 25 right now. Im supposed to have my degrees. Im supposed maybe be married with kids or even have a boyfriend, but I donâ€™t. My life is a pathetic MESS. It will take a lot to get out of this. 

Letâ€™s say I do go to school &amp; get out at 30. Okay great so now Iâ€™m a social worker, but now I have to live with the fact that I wasted a whole DECADE doing nothing just wasting away. 

I just donâ€™t have it in me to go on .. lol but my funeral would be such a joke! I barely know anyone! I canâ€™t hang out with friends right now because Iâ€™m so miserable. 

Itâ€™s 3pm. I havenâ€™t had anything to eat all day. My head hurts like usual &amp; this is regular for my body. I donâ€™t even need food anymore. Iâ€™m just this body that has been withering away &amp; Iâ€™m telling you, itâ€™s very very sad because I was a beautiful girl &amp; I couldâ€™ve really been a light in peopleâ€™s life. I had a story that set me apart. I was the adopted girl who grew up in a fucked up family. I wanted to be an â€œentrepreneurâ€ so I went for fashion &amp; it makes me just squirm inside thinking about that. I mean in the end I wanted to help youth &amp; foster children, but I couldâ€™ve just cut to the chase so now when I DO enter college, Iâ€™ll be way older than anyone. Iâ€™ll probably be single forever. Your EARLY 20â€™s are your crucial years to get it together to make something of yourself for the rest of your life &amp; here I am. A FLUNK. 

Anyway, today Iâ€™ve decided to really go through with it. If I go to hell, I go to hell idc at this point.
