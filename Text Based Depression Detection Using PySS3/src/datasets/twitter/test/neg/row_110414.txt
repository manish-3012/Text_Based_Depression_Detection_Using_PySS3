I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m meant to be here.I know it sounds insane, but I think my purpose in life actually might be just to end it. I think that explains why nothing has gotten better. 

I heavily contemplated giving into tonight but I always carry so much guilt when I think about leaving my family behind. Maybe theyâ€™re supposed to be put through that type of grief, I just donâ€™t wanna be the one to make them deal with it. 

maybe Iâ€™m speaking from a place of pain and distress but I really am tired. I donâ€™t hold any resentment anymore, Iâ€™m just ready to let go. Iâ€™m tired.
