I posted on here a couple of years ago at one of the lowest points in my lifeAll I have to say is that Iâ€™m glad I didnâ€™t go through with it. Iâ€™m glad I went to therapy to resolve the issues that stemmed from trauma I was dealing with. For those of you who are in a dark place, there is hope. Hang on, stay strong ðŸ’ªâ¤ï¸
