I want to die on good days tooI had a good day today. I went kayaking for a couple hours this morning and genuinely thought about today was gonna be a good day and it has been. I played some hollow knight and beat a boss I struggled with. Had some leftovers and laughed at a joke with my sister, had some genuine connection.

I still want to die. I'm still bone weary and completely unable to enjoy anything for more than half a second or do anything of meaning. I just wish I was dead. I really do.
