Since the only thing that matters in the world anymore is coronavirus, why don't I just kill myself?Think about it. Not being infected with coronavirus and not spreading it to other people is the single most important thing in life apparently and nothing else matters as much as that.

So why don't I just blow my brains out then?  Because masks or distancing arent 100% effective, but killing yourself is.  Once I kill myself I can't spread the coronavirus or give it to anyone else. Selfless.  Committing suicide is just the most logical extension of "public health restrictions." IMO, they're basically just telling you to end your life.
