I'm a disgusting worthless personI insult other people because it makes me feel better about myself. I'm a horrible person and I lose all of my friends and all of my family has distanced themselves from me. I'm not able to get close to anyone: it gets lonely, and the more lonely and rejected I feel the more insulting and hurtful I am. It's a miserable cycle. 

I just want to die. I'm a complete joke of a human.
