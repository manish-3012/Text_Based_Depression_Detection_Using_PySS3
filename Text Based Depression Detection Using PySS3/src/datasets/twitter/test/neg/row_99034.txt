What......does it mean, to live this life? To exist in this time regimented conundrum comprised of lowest common denominators?


The only antidote, the only shield against the utter shitshow of madness and cruelty we are born into unwillingly, is to have hope in a singular vision. A grand purpose, focused by unwavering tunnel vision.Â A prize, to live for.


And, if one is so lucky and blessed to have this while buoyed by the mass delusion of Love, a madness in its own right, all the better.


Without these buffers, these girders on our metaphysical foundation, every day alive becomes a bleeding wound. An inexonerable, painful death by a thousand cuts, administered by the slow knife of time.Â 


There are rules to this "game", in which we are participants, unwilling and not. The penalty for refusing to abide by their random, ridiculous ministrations is severe in the extreme.


I know this all too well. I took the path Ill traveled, and it's thorns have rent my flesh asunder. My spirit is nothing but a sack of bleeding bones, crushed by broken self-promises and vicious punishments meted out by my own,Â  guilt wracked hands.Â 


I failed at this "life." I never got it, never understood what it wanted from me.  One screwup after another. This existence in a madhouse of scrapped dreams and ugly memories is all I deserve.


I will, most likely, end this suffering very soon. One cannot continue living such a cruel charade, after it's purposes and designs have become horrifyingly clear.Â 


Any chance at a good life has long been wasted. I hold on for nothing. I have no one. I lie to myself constantly, to ease the pain of this reality, yet that has now ceased to dull the bruising blows every failed day administers.Â 


There is no opiate to soothe my broken soul. It screams only for release now, and soon it shall have it.
