I want my family to hate me so I can kill myself.I stole my aunt's credit card. I stole my mom and dad's credit card. I used it to buy things on Amazon on my boyfriend's account. They disputed the charges and now my boyfriend is mad that he can't use his account. 
I have no money. Can't keep a job. Don't want to live. I have wanted to kill myself for years now but I can't bring myself to hurt my family sometimes. My boyfriend is the only person I have irl that isn't family. My friends are all online. I want to kill myself. I want to kill myself. Why won't they hate me. I want them to hate me so I can kill myself and they won't care. This is so stupid. Even if they did hate me they would still acknowledge I was in their life once. Why can't I be rational. I want to kill myself. The guilt is eating me alive. I don't want to be like this. But I want to die so bad and I can't. I'm so hungry. I want to kill myself. I want to kill myself. I want to kill myself. I don't want this anymore. I'm tired. I'm tired.
