Maladjusted for this worldI recently realized that all this time I've worked for 3 years, the skills I obtained were never useful to any company, and now I'm getting rejection after rejection. So basically, I'm useless now. Despite me being 25, I always thought I never matured enough, or at least on par with my peers.

Whenever I get to an interview, after introductions, I really notice the change in their voice whenever I honestly answer their questions. Was it of disappointment? I don't know, but I certainly feel it, and I always end up being disappointed with myself.

Today I've started to make little efforts to desensitize my survival instincts, so when the time comes, it wouldn't kick in as much. I've been establishing a plan. I plan to withdraw all my life savings and put them where my parents could see it, record some farewell videos for my close friends and my girlfriend, and end it.

For the longest time, I've been looking at my peers and wonder why I can't achieve what they have or why can't I be as strong and intelligent as them, and now I can understand. Maybe I'm really not meant for this world.
