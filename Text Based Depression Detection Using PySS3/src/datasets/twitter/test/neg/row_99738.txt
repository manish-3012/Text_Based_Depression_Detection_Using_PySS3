Feeling of jumping of building

Is it pain when you jump off from 4th floor?
I've seen people saying that they lose conscious after they jump and regain consciousness seeing themself in the ambulance or hospital. Do anyone else actually tried before jumping and still have consciousness when you already reached the ground? Do you feel pain?
