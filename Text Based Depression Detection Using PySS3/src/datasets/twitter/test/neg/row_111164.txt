All I want is to just snap out of itIâ€™ve donâ€™t the therapist thing, Iâ€™ve done the medication thing, Iâ€™ve done the change your lifestyle thing. 

I feel like I am the glue thatâ€™s holding so many people together too. Which I donâ€™t understand how. 

I just wrote my note. My â€˜I want to kill myselfâ€™ note. 

Itâ€™s just as rambling as this post.
