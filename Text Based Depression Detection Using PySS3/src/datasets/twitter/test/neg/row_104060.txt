Spiraling further, I just need a friendly voice.Hey guys,

I'm a long time redditor, and as such I've always been aware of sw and the wonderful things you do, but until today have never been compelled to anonymize and solicit your help.

I'm in my late 20's.  I'm a white male in the US.  

I was born into relative privilege, never truly wanting for much.  Ever since puberty, however, I have always had social challenges that started out with simple teasing and bullying, but soon blossomed into full-fledged social anxiety and panic disorder, diagnosed as a Junior in high school.  I had a high ranking college education fully paid for and I stepped into adulthood debt free and set up.  I was placed in a sales position with the very multi-generational family business that had afforded me such an advantageous upbringing.  Soon I was saving up loads (to me) of money.  I didn't want to do this forever, but it seemed like a good stepping-stone.

I even decided to buy a small house, no small achievement for someone of my age.  And I did so.  3 months before the housing collapse and the onset of the recession.

I had roommates originally, but they left.  Our small business has been slowly collapsing, and my income has dried up.  Thankfully it still supplies a meager cash flow but all of my other attempts to find a job have been for naught.  

As it stands now, I feel like I am in a coma.  I've got credit card debt and am late on my bills.  I haven't been able to focus at work for months now, and my bosses are growing impatient with my performance.  I have been abusing alcohol and marijuana to numb myself when I'm not trying to work, and when I am, my teeth are clenched from the adderall I have been prescribed for ADD.  It used to work beautifully, but now it fails to keep me on task and just makes me skip meals, smoke too many cigarettes, and drink too much caffeine.   I have trouble getting to sleep at night and have trouble getting out of bed in the morning.

I'm becoming a social hermit and have been seeking out the company of others less and less.  The mere sound of my phone ringing makes me panic.  My parents are becoming concerned that I never answer.

I'm drowning under a mortgage, I've become socially detached, and could even get fired by my relatives for being so damned depressed I just sit in my chair and stare all day.  I used to go out, have fun, go to the gym, catch up with friends...  Now I just feel such despair that I can't even feel that engine inside me anymore - the one that says "get up, go... do this..."  I just feel empty...

I don't think I would ever take sudden action against myself...  but I feel like gradually I'm doing it anyway.

If there is a voice of support out there, I would love to hear from you.
