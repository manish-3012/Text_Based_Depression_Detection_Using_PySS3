I really want to kill myself.Im 16 and hit the lowest point ever. Having asian parents means they want good grades and nothing else. I have no motivation to study as well and those two things dont mesh together. Im also introverted and socially awkward and cant talk to people normally and my parents give me flak for that. They have absolutely no regard for my mental state and its deterioration. Im just feeling so tired of everything and wish there was some way to go out peacefully.
