Running away or suicide?I'm seriously considering running away again. I've already tried it before, long story short ended up in a psychiatric ward for the night. I thought the only way to change my situation (which really isn't that bad) would be to kill myself, but I didn't. Everything is still the same, nothing has changed. The only thing that has changed was teacher's attitudes towards me, because my grades are in a sharp decline. I planned out how I was going to kill myself so I neglected to do any of the work that week, stupid I know. When the fated day came I executed it terribly and didn't have the heart to drown. I have a few people who care about me, mainly my family but we get into so many pointless arguments about stupid shit that I don't really care anymore. I am going to therapy for this, and there is a social worker in my school I'm supposed to talk to, but wow. I hate my situation a lot more now. It seems to me that everyone knows about it, fuck. noone expects me to show up to school so I'm constantly thinking about just skipping school and figuring out a way to peacefully end myself without distressing my family or friends.
