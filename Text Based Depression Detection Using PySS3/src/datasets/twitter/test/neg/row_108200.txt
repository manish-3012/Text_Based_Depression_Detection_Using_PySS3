I have a plan and I think I'm going to do it.I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm a wreck. Fuck. I've always had the thought to do it - I've attempted twice before already - and I've dismissed it for the past, I don't know, several years because I don't have a car or my own place and I don't want to die in someone else's house. I thought I'd just have to wait until I have my own place, which would take about a year probably to get to from this point. But I haven't made any progress whatsoever in the past few years. Debt has built up. Vision problems have kept me from driving. Something snapped recently and it just kind of hit me that I don't have to wait. I can just leave now. Use cash. Use public transportation. Go far away and find a motel.

*I just want to.* That's what scares me the most. I don't really have any external reason to push me towards it, I guess. I have bipolar disorder. It started out as generic passive thoughts every now and then and then has rapidly gotten worse and worse. I'm so numb. I only feel anger. I only feel anything else when I drink. It's like some kind of craving to self destruct. I feel like crawling out of my skin. Everything seems wrong and I don't even feel real.

I can't do it immediately. I have things to take care of first - like paying off my debts, training people at work. God, today  I was finally offered the promotion I've been trying to get for at least a year now. It's not a certain thing; the position is still occupied for the moment. They want me to lead the team, said I'm their best asset. I said yes, I would apply for the position if it's opened, and then I went home and started drinking at 2:00 in the afternoon. I've barely eaten since Thursday; I've eaten a single stalk of celery,  a few small bites of watermelon, a microwavable breakfast biscuit,  and a burger I didn't want that I could barely stomach. That's all I've eaten between Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. 

I've wondered a lot why I'm incapable of keeping friends and making new ones now; I took a look through my old social media and former friends' old blogs, several which they never knew I knew about. It's obvious to me now. I'm awful. I counted, what, at least seven different people saying I was mad at them or stopped talking to them and they didn't understand and missed me. I haven't grown. There were so many people who really liked me and admired me and I just trashed it all. I don't understand why any of them liked me. I don't understand why anyone likes me now. 

I'm sick. I'm looking up bus tickets. I want to just stand up on a table and yell, "HEY, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH ME. I'M SICK. PLEASE SEE ME," but at the same time that never helped because people tried to help me and I ignored them. I want to go away and let them all forget about me. I don't know what I'm doing, I'm so torn up right now.
