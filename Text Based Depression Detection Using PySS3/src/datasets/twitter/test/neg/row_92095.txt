No hope..Iâ€™m to depressed to explain why it affects me so much, &amp; I realize it sounds like Iâ€™m just being dramatic..But if Trump wins presidency my life is going to take a turn for the worse. I will have nothing left to hope of look forward for. I will end my life if he wins. My life wonâ€™t be worth living at that point.
