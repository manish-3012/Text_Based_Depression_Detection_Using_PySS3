no drive to livei really donâ€™t know why iâ€™m writing this. living normal life with no struggles at all except one my head. everything is so obvious to me. people. so easy to read. nothing feels challenging mentally. learning. just after semi mastering it in short time i donâ€™t want to do it anymore. i donâ€™t know what to feel. i have no drive for sex or any passion for love. only thing i care about is my little brother. 
i indirectly try to kill my self every night. when i go to sleep i place my pillow on my head and my hands on pillow. hoping i would suffocate but letting it for god to choose+ its the pose i find most comfortable. all my dreams are so alive, like i am awake. feels intense so much that i get woken up like its a nightmare, but its worse then that. i dream so fucked up shit i canâ€™t go to sleep and i sleep around 3 h a day.  like there is second me in my head who knows dreams for me are like real life and fucks with my mind destroying me mentally. i donâ€™t think that is connected to me being suicidal but it isnâ€™t helping either. 

sorry for my bad english. donâ€™t really know what iâ€™m hoping for here but yea.
