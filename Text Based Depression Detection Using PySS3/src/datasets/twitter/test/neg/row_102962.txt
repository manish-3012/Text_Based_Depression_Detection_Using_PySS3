Everyone is dying and I am left behind and left outMy friends ex gf and also my friend killed herself this past weekend. A friend at school killed himself last night. Im overwhelmed. I hate myself that my first emotion is jealousy and then sadness. How fucked up am I, right? Everyone at school today was crying because they miss him and I am crying because I wish it was me. I wish it was me. I wish it was me. I dont want to hurt anyone. I wish I could die and have nobody care.
