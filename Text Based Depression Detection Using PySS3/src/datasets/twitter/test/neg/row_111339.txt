Need help with a friend far away.Just to start this off - I do not need help myself.  
About three and a half years ago, I met a girl online and we became friends rather quickly. We are currently both 16 years old. I live in Europe, she is in America.  
About one and a half years ago, she told me about several things - self-harming, not liking herself, not trusting people. She often tells me that she is always there for other people, but those people are never there for her. (I cannot really talk to her whenever she wants at this time  due to six hours of time difference and me having to go to sleep somewhat early because of school).  
To add to this, her parents are extremely strict (I know almost nothing about them) and she is not allowed to go out often, which then leads to her mostly using her phone to talk to people. The reason 'people are not there for her' is because they often do not respond to her or take a really long time, according to her.  
I do not know if she is still harming herself, but she has not told me about it for almost six months.  
I try to talk to her and skype with her as often as possible (Though it is not possible as often this week as I'm on a school trip to Ireland).  I try cheering her up, but I don't think I'm talking to her correctly about this. She appears to be in a worse situation since recently because she often responds using very few words (Mostly single words) and talks in a more aggressive manner.  
How can I help her?
