What is the point?So maybe I'm just lying to myself, but I don't want to die because I'm sad or my life sucks. I mean I am sad and my life does suck and the moment but i know if i hold out it will get better so like I said maybe I am lying to myself and it is because i'm sad, either way what is the reason for living? because I'm honestly over trying. I feel like I've experienced everything I want to and now I'm ready to find out whats next... I'm bored with life and I don't care to see anymore of it and before you say friends and family are the reason I gotta say the "friends and family" I have in my life aren't worth living for and no I don't want to go find new friends I JUST WANT TO SEE WHATS NEXT regardless of what it is it will be somewhere new...
