I felt so empty today...I don't know what happened today. I went to see my daughter and my mom for Mother's Day, which was fun, and I got an email from my favourite Streamer I watch (Vinny from Vinesauce) that he received all the art I sent him, and the letter. I was so happy, but...I laid down in bed, rolled over, and just stared at the wall. 
It was a terrible moment, because while I was laying there, I felt a terrible numbness. Like I couldn't feel anything. It became so overwhelming, I just cried. 
I don't have anyone to talk about this to. My husband just tells me I'm okay, and to cut it out...
I just want someone to talk to...
