Can you be depressed but not suicidal?I have been struggling with depression and anxiety most of my life. On days I feel really down I get mad at myself for not being willing to kill myself. Just thinking about death terrifies me because new things scare me especially when I have to do them by myself. I feel like because I am not willing to die, my depression doesn't matter. As long as I am still alive, and plan to stay that way, I shouldn't bother people with my mental health issues. It's this messed up thought that my brain sticks to, even on my good days. Has anyone else felt this way?
