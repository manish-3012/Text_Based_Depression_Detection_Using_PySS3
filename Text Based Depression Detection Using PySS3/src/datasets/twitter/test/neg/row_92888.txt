no reason to be upsetI have no reason to be as depressed as I am.

White male privileged. In school. Attractive physically with a girlfriend of 4 years. Never had any problems with family that messed me up mentally. Yet all I do is lay in bed at 23 years old when I'm not going to school and want to die. I'm not brave enough to commit suicide yet, but I think i've gotten less scared as I've aged and it is simply a time bomb. 

I don't believe in an afterlife, so the whole "you'll hurt those you love" does not trouble me. I will be dead and I will have no conscience, and it will be as it was before I was born. 

I dont want anybody to talk to about this. I just want to know about my selfishness and see those who share it with me. I'm not saying you have to have been physically abused or had some sort of mental trauma to be depressed, I just know that I'm selfish. I'm an asshole for no reason. I believe I just rolled unlucky. 

Guess I just want to see how many other people here are upset and also dont see a reason to be.
