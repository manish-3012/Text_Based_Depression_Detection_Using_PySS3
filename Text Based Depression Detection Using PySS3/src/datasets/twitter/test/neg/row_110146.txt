Too much wrong; no plan, moreso just needing to talk and have a shoulder. It's starting to snowball though!So, I'm a bit strange, unfortunately. Basically, I'm 22, female, college graduate with a few majors, bilingual in French, but still live at home, always cooped up in the house (don't drive due to back pain). I run a successful webpage large relative to its interest base, and have filmed for a feature documentary I'm strongly featured in. Oh, and I have a transsexual medical condition; surgery planned for May, though I cannot stand so much of this-infertility, hating that tumor on my body, and missing out on the correct childhood. There's no way to fix any of the above, so that's just great, isn't it? And that's where matters get complicated.

I started hormones at age 20, which a lot of people say is young. Not me! I've always known since I was two, and was denied hormones by rather uninformed doctors and therapist four years, most of my teen years, so I am still very bitter about never getting to experience high school as my true self. However, this was no fault of my family; they are extremely supportive of my transition and so forth, very much so, but I'm told that I look in-between by some of them, after like 2.5 years on hormones, which hurts a bit, though perhaps understandable due to cognitive biases. My hair doesn't grow out either, though it has been a touch recently. Pretty much all people over five see me as female, but I think they're just being nice, but it's hard to tell at times. That, and four year old kids don't think I'm a girl, they think I'm just playing tricks on them, which is crushing. Probably this voice, though they also say I don't look like one, which is the last thing I need. Horrific, really...I've been told my voice sounds like Jessica Rabbit, but I'm not dumb enough to believe such nonsense. 

I also worry about my ability to get employed; I look at the fact that I applied for a few fast food places in the area, and they still wouldn't hire me, after an interview in which I discussed the entire company history, plus their menu, as to be best educated about the practices of the applicable corporation. If I can't get hired for this, no reason to think I can succeed in my desired major, finance, either. After all, my grades sunk the past three semesters after my father died completely unexpectedly, who I was really close with

And thus, I live at home, with no friends in this state I can talk to. I'm told I'm a mooch, a leech, and that I need to get a life. This doesn't help things at all, and not really sure what I can do there. I want to be able to repay my family for all they've done for me, and then some. So, the way I figured I would do that is get on Wheel of Fortune, since they were in my area, and it's my webpage's focus. Disclosure: I love my game shows, pathetic a hobby as it is. A lot. I do really well at them, so it seems like it would be beneficial to get on. 

So, it's January 2014, and I'm at the audition for Wheel, where it's 60 people; of those probably 6-8 will make the cut for the show. The number of people in the room is trimmed down to 21, and I am one. I never make a mistake, play really well, I get excited, heck, I am moreso for the other players, genuinely, than they were for themselves.

Many of my friends have been on like five game shows, and hey, I could help my own page on these matters, plus my family, right? So, we wait two weeks for a mailed letter (if it shows, you're in the pool)-mine doesn't come. Of course, lots of my friends have made it on, so I feel inadequate AGAIN in my life, including a chorus director our family is pretty close with. Was I happy for him? Of course! I can always support other people when they get something good in their life; it's about all I've got going for any kind of positive emotional state these days. My mental instabilities have always rooted from internal processing.

Mother claims it's because, "They can tell you were trans. That's 100 percent it." Didn't help they asked for my name as it exactly appeared on Social Security. I was screwed, since documentation wasn't officially changed until March of that year, but my appearance and common name were changed for about seven months at that point. Then, she told me not to try out again because of what it did to me the first time. Thanks for the words of encouragement! Not like this is a life dream or anything, silly as it sounds.

So, I let everyone down, from family, to my page, etc. They say otherwise, but thinking about what it could have done for all parties, I absolutely did. Don't tell me I didn't. I could have given my site more information. I could have gotten to move the heck out of here. I could have paid some of my surgical expenses. Told myself if I was just given one chance at this show, I'd make it. Let's face it, it's less about the show, as it is financial independence. I'm told all the time about how much happier I'll be when I get a job/am out of the house, but not sure how much that's true, or even likely to happen.

A rather peculiar ending disclosure here: I'm usually on the other end of things; I typically try to help save people's lives, which is in part why I'm working with the documentary's media. I like to help people become themselves, even if it's just with me, or how to do this on a larger scale. Heck, I presented with my friend Jazz Jennings last year in front of hundreds to help encourage a similar message.

I'm just a loser who surely is going to blow her potential, and be worth nothing, like so many others. Sigh. Thanks for reading all this, if you got this far, and sorry you wasted your time dealing with such an inane diatribe. Just wish there were solutions out there for so many of these problems, but it doesn't seem possible. Just dead ends.
