going to buy a shotgun and end it this weeki quit my job today and pushed away my best friends. my life is falling to pieces and thereâ€™s nothing i can do to stop it. i am a piece of shit, iâ€™m consciously self-destructive and i hurt everyone around me. everyone will be sad for a while but will be relieved in time. i am going to try to get a shotgun even though they made me sign a contract in the hospital that says i canâ€™t buy a gun until iâ€™m 23. probably wonâ€™t be able to get one but itâ€™s definitely worth a shot. i would not use any other method, they are all too unreliable and painful.
