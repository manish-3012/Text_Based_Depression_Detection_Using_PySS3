I'm too scared to kill myself, but i want to go into a comaI've been up all night reading which over the counter medications I can overdose on to enter a coma. I'm too scared to take the gun I have and shoot myself, I have a fear of death and what's after death. I tried overdosing in March which only caused a lot of puking and a trip to the ER. Please don't give me "you have so much to live for" I really appreciate it and id do the same but I really can not keep up like this. I need this next week to pass without me being awake for it. It's better than killing myself and I want to see if my life will be okay after it because the worst has passed. Please any medical advice? Thanks.
