I accepted death an an inevitability when I was 8.  Could that be why I'm like this?I had a friend die.  He wasn't too close to me but I knew him enough for it to really bother me.  Eventually I realized that we're all gonna die so why worry about it? I was religious back then so I believed that I would get to see him again when I died, so eventually I started looking forward to it.

I'm not religious any more but my attitude about death hasn't changed.  If we're all gonna die any way, and I'm not enjoying living, then why keep going? Why is it such a big deal? Why can't I just say "Hey, glad you guys are having fun with this game.  I hope you keep enjoying it.  I don't like it.  I'm out." I would actually feel GOOD about that.  Why does that make me a bad person? People are asking me to stay in this fucking terrible situation when I could solve it easily just so that THEY don't have to deal with pain that they will eventually get past because they are mentally healthy people.  And if they won't get past it, then why can't they just do what I did?

What's so important that we're doing here? It's just a game.  If you like it, then fine, but why should I have to play if it just sucks all the time and my being around is causing this attitude to rub off on others?
