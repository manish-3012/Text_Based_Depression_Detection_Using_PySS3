Iâ€™m at a Cross Roads, and I donâ€™t know what to do with my life anymoreI miss the old me, but sheâ€™ll never be back. Sheâ€™s been dead for years, and Iâ€™ll never get to see her again. Now itâ€™s up to me to reconsider my life choices, and I donâ€™t think that I can actually confront them without breaking down. Thereâ€™s a side to me that wants to fight, but thereâ€™s another side of me that knows that it would be a waste of time. My entire existence has shifted between being used and abused. Iâ€™ve just become so tired because no one wants to see things from my point of view and at least see that there is something wrong because theyâ€™ve never had to deal with the problems that I struggle with. No one listens or takes me too seriously because the things that I worry about arenâ€™t worth their time. 

It kills me how much Iâ€™ve fallen into this pit of despair and how I canâ€™t get out of it anymore. I keep telling myself that Iâ€™ll find my way, but thereâ€™s something that always happens that tears me down; wether that be a social/romantic issue or something I canâ€™t stop thinking about. I just want to be happy and live my life, but itâ€™s like no one wants me here. If that is the case then whatâ€™s the point of trying anymore. Iâ€™ll only cause myself more heartache being here. I donâ€™t want to live the way my parents or the rest of my family live. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve invested so much time/money in college and ROTC. I know that I would develop into the person that I want to be if I take this route, and Iâ€™ll finally see some change in myself. 

Life has hit pretty hard now and I canâ€™t even think of one thing thatâ€™s positive about me because others are able to do the same things that I think Iâ€™m good at if not better than what I am able to do. Itâ€™s just hard to feel like myself when my wings have been clipped and doors have been shut in my face. No matter how much I apply, how hard I try, or how bad I want something itâ€™s never going to happen, not for me.

I want to be here, but itâ€™s getting pretty hard to find a reason why or the right help to get it.
