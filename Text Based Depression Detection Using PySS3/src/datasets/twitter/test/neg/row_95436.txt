I donâ€™t live for meHonestly at this point Iâ€™m only living life and going through the motions for my parents. I donâ€™t want all their years of suffering and hardship because of me to be for waste. Going to school, working, living every day is just exhausting. But I do what I do because I know if anything ever happened to me that my parents would be heartbroken and I canâ€™t do that to them... They deserve better.
