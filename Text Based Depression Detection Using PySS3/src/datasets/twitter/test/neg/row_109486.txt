Everyday waiting for my life to endHi all,

I just feel like I need to get this all off my chest, otherwise my heart will explode.
Ever since I remember all I wanted in life was to  find someone who would love me. Iâ€™m 24 and Iâ€™ve never ever been loved. By anyone. I was in love, but the feeling was never reciprocated. I thought that this would come with time, but it never happened. It makes me so depressed I canâ€™t breath. Literally, I force myself to get up everyday and to go through another day. Somewhere in the back of my head I hoped that the miracle would happen and i would find someone. But I canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™ve lost so much time, thereâ€™s so many things Iâ€™ve never done and will never do because itâ€™s too late. I feel like even if I meet someone, they would leave me ASAP because I was alone so long that it just fucked me up. 
I started cutting, I am ashamed of it. I promised myself I would only cut one of my thighs so nobody would ever know. Every time I look at the bruises it reminds my of how fucked up my life is. But is not enough. It doesnâ€™t help me anymore. I just want to die, everyday I hope that it all will be over. Death would be a salvation but I feel like I donâ€™t even deserve it and Iâ€™m just punished for being who I am. 
I wish I could just kill myself. But I canâ€™t even do that properly.
