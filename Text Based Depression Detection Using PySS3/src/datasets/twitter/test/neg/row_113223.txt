god i feel like shitSomeone who told me i could trust them and that theyâ€™d be there for be at my lowest moments literally doesnâ€™t care anymore. last night i was feeling like complete shit and i was drinking and smoking, and decided that i was going to end it, seriously end it all. i texted her and told i her that i give up and that iâ€™m done, then said bye. when i got up to get a knife, i passed out and woke up the next morning lmao second chance i guess, but when i chechen my phone i saw the only response was her saying â€œnoâ€ five times, no other check ins, no calls, nothing, i was legit going to kill myself and she didnâ€™t care, sorry for sloppy grammar
