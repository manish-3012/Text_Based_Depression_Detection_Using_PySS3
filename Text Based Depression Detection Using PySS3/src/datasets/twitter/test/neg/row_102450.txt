Not sure how close or likely I am to do it, but one thing for sure is that I eventually willIt's \*mostly\* loneliness that has fuelled my suicidal ideation, and realistically speaking I simply am a physically unattractive dude who, I feel, is destined never to find a partner and die alone, however it is I die.

I'm at the stage at the moment where I truly find my life valueless and hold it in no regard, and in some ways this is actually quite "freeing", I guess, because I'm basically just doing whatever I want no matter how dangerous or unhealthy it is now. Alcohol, junk food, late nights, thrill-seeking and such.

That said, while I wouldn't at all care if I lost my life right now, I've kind of set myself a goal of sorts, to see if my life improves and I find a partner by my late 20s, and if not I'll off myself soon after my 25th birthday at the very latest. Because, at that point, I would not only be too old for potential partners to be interested, I'd also have missed out on too much of young life that could have been spent with someone, and I can't see any purpose on living on after that anyway.
