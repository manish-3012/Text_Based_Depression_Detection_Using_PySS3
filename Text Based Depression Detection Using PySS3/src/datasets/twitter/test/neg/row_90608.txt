Not good enough to dieIt's selfish of me to post this, I'm taking attention away from people who really need it, people who are in crisis and need help. I'm sorry. That's just the kind of attention seeking asshole I am.

I'm not going to die yet. I don't deserve it. I need to become a better person before I can die. I want my death to mean something. I want to be somebody that someone could've loved.

I'm sorry for being so worthless. I'll try to be better.

Wow. I have no reason to post this. Why the fuck would I post this? I'm just being an attention seeking whore. You really should ignore me, but I'm desperately hoping that some random person out there thinks that this is.. interesting or dramatic enough or something to care.

I don't deserve your attention. You shouldn't care. But I really want you to. I'm a fucking pig like that.

EDIT: I'll be ok. Jesus, Reddit is an amazing place. Turns out there's more than just cat pictures here. I just needed someone to care, and you did. I need to live now. It's going to be painful and messy, but I can't do much unless I'm alive. Thank you for caring.
