Pissssed off and suicidalIm pretty depressed cuz I have no friends and am a senior in highschool. No girlfriend (in fact I havent been with one ever) and really nothing to do with myself other than lift weights and do my work or play a video game. I've had this strong sort of hate towards the mainstream and hate all the trends that have circled around, I'm sure you know what I'm on about. I'm talking about the shit heads that smoke Juuls and listen to trap music or anything that's bound to get old quick(Drake). I'm a metal head, and I grew up in a town with no one else who shares that. I love Pantera, or some Slayer and not the bullshit people listen to now. 

ANNNYYYWAY The reason why I'm depressed is because I've never found that group that I fit in with. All of my previous friends left me because they wanted to smoke and drink and use people for their money. Fucked, am I right? I feel like shit for not going to parties or being with a girl at least once. Shit pisses me off that I live in this place, especially when I'm in a town where every one is preppy. So I'm not going to give you ALL the details but I'm sure you know what's good so what are your thoughts of this and what the fuck should I do to improve on myself because I'm tired of being alone and I can't do much about it since I hate a lot of people in my town. I just don't know where I belong.

Thank you
