Why I will probably end up dead.I have been getting help and have taken medication but it's not getting better at all. I would like to just give a over view of my life to let some of you understand why I have given up. When I was School people hated me idk to the point of almost being killed by being tossed over the edge of staircase and having my hair set on fire. I was raped at the age of 12 by my doctor. People often just don't even talk to me at allz and just walk by. That's if I even go in stores because I get anxiety about people behind me just all around me in general. I just find I can't live life like this anymore.
