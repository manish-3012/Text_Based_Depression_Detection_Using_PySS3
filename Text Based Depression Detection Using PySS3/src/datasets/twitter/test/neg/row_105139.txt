The fuck do you do when your self destructing and it feels like your dragging everyone around you down too by being a goddamn waste of space? Because hot damn, I have done NOTHING except waste everyone around me's time, space, and resources.   
I would like to fucking commit die now. Fuck this world. Fuck this life.   
Failing my 3rd attempt at secondary and tertiary schooling again, YAY. And fuck everyone that says "oh you have it so good" and "you have so much to live for" "just try harder" yadda yadda, fuck that shit. You think I don't know that? THAT'S WHY I HAVE DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY YOU MASSIVE BITCH. Ugh. 

Idk man, tried to choke myself out, been thinking about the roof way more, and god knows I have enough resources to try something. ugh, I just want to die sometimes. Fuck this year, the lovely voice in my head that tells me to end it all and that I ain't worth shit just won't shut up sometimes. 

I've got this pit of anger in my chest and I just want to burn it all down out of spite, but fuck man, the only thing keeping me going sometimes is the goddamn spite. It's like, idk I'd like to fucking die, but some shitty part can't quite get the memo, so I just get stuck halfway between wanting to jump off a roof or something and making half-assed attempts to get better, wasting time and resources while I'm at it. I'm just... tired, and angry, and so so done.   
And don't even try to fucking tell me it'll get better, trust me, it's been over 12 years of this shit man, only getting worse in the last 3-4 years. If your here for that fake sympathy bullshit you can fuck right the hell off.

I just. I don't know what to do anymore, and god knows my support system sure as hell ain't helping shit. Sure they try but fuck all if they actually know what the hell they're doing. And before any of y'all fucks tell me to see a therapist or something, I'm already doing that, and am on drugs which still ain't helping much with the shit so yeah. whatever. Thanks for listening I guess. Sorry bout the... *\*waves hand at entire post\** that shit and all, hope it didn't fuck someone else up.
