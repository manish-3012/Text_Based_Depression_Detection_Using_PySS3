I'm in a black hole I can't stopI have my fair share of problems, including a developmental disorder and mental health issues. I didn't prepare adequately and I lost a job six months ago. I tried to solve my own problems like an adult. My family is very judgemental and domineering, so I didn't share my problems. But my family is furious now that they found out. My financial situation keeps getting worse, I'm severely depressed, and I don't know how to get out of it. I feel lost and suicidal. Anyone else feel the same?
