Why do I feel this way?I don't see the point in continuing my life. I just don't. And I feel so entitled and stupid and selfish for it because so many people suffer and have worse lives then I do, yet I can't seem to find a reason.

I have supportive friends and family, I have a job that I'm content with, and I'm doing good in Uni. I should be so happy and living life but I don't understand why I'm like this. The funny thing is, I know how stupid and spoiled I sound, but I can't help it. Hell, I don't even know why I'm posting this here, maybe to see if anyone understands?

But what is the point in continuing my life? To see my friends and family die off? To be successful and achieve superficial happiness based on materialistic purchases? I don't see the point in studying to get a degree so I can get a job that is more comfortable and better paying, then work till I'm 65 and die. Why not just end it here? Why prolong suffering that is life to have moments of happiness? The environment that I'm in is so good but yet so unstable, it can all crumble and fall as it did before. I don't want to experience that again.

I think the only thing stopping me is the possibility of a god existing. I don't want to suffer forever if there is a god, but if there isn't, I genuinely don't see why we live life. We live our lives just to continue life itself, is that really all there is to it? How is everyone okay with this? The more I think about it, the more absurd it seems.

Am I just an entitled brat? If I am, please tell me so I can at least try to convince myself that I should be happy and that I have it good. Please, I want to be happy.
