I'm brokenIm 19, have a pretty rough background. My mom isn't in my life anymore and I live at college. My dad and I can talk about sports or things in gerenal but I feel like he doesn't really want a relationship. I tend to be the one to invite myself over. My stepmom is nice, but it seems like shes done after five minutes of talking to me and after my freshman year she never called or had much interest in me. My grandparents were never really in my life and are now dead. With my friends I am the butt of every single fucking joke. My girlfriend has way worse problems than me so I tend to try to be there for her and hide my depression/anxiety.

My friends constantly say how im not a good person. And the problem is I try so hard to be good. I try so hard to help people and do the right thing. With college I study so much and get Cs. I am constantly stressed due to having no money. I had a surgery last may and for some reason it has never healed right which combined with not having anytime outside of school I can't work. And I honestly don't have time for extra curriculars (I am double majoring) 

I guess after trying so hard to move on from the abuse I used to suffer and try to be a good person but fail. There's something wrong with me, I don't really have any place I belong. There is so much wrong with me. Im ugly, im not smart, im not a good person, I have no worth to me. I'm short, im attracted to other guys (i have a girlfriend so im not bi, just have the ability to be attracted to guys) which if my dad knew it would kill him, my girlfriend would dump me, and my friends would laugh at me and never be able to see me as anything else. I have depression, I have anxiety, I have nothing going for me and im worthless and broken and I just don't want to fucking be me anymore. No one is on my side, and I have learned when so many things correlate there is usually a reason. I'm broken, useless and a piece of shit.
