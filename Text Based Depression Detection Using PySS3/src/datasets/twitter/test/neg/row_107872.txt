I Think I Got My GF PregnantEver since I discovered what sex was, i made a promise to myself I would always wear a condom. I've broke that promise twice. The first time, the condom broke and I didn't realize it, but I suspected so I pulled out just in case. That happened maybe 2 and a half weeks ago? I like to consider that I have good self-discipline since I can pull out without ease or trouble. But today she told me her discharge was brown before her period. I've been really really worried since then. She's going to get a pregnancy test and find out for sure. 

Ever since she told me like an hour ago, i can't get my mind off it, and off of suicide. If she's pregnant, I can't deal with that thought. It's making me sick just typing this. If she is in fact pregnant. I think i WILL off myself, because I can't do it. I can't deal with the consequences, I just turned 18 yesterday, i'm not ready to grow up and live. I don't have a car or my license, I live with my parents. I've been sheltered my whole life, I think it would be better if I just was gone, because i don't think I could deal with anything. Because I wasn't raised in a way to know how to do anything in the world. 

I'd hate to leave my family and girlfriend behind, and my child. But I can't do it. I'm not ready for this world...
