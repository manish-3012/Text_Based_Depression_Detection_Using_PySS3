I am alone.What is the point of continuing my life if I know it is only going to get worse?
I have a family history of schizophrenia and I know that I have it too. No one will understand. 
My family has completely stopped contact with my grandmother because of it. They donâ€™t understand. I will be next. 
Therapy doesnâ€™t help. Meditation doesnâ€™t help. Time doesnâ€™t help. Medication doesnâ€™t help. 
What is the purpose in continuing to live like this? 
I have been suicidal for almost 10 years now, and I am ready to be finished. 
I am done. 
Donâ€™t I at least deserve the right to end this the way I want?
