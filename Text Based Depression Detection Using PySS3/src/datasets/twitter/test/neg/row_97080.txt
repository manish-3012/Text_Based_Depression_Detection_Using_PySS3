TitleI'm too lethargic to change, and too crazy to accept anything other than that. I think I'll try and pay off my loans if I can make it that far, but what a terrible survival game which life is.

This post is fucking pointless and attentive. I don't think I'd argue about the self serving nature of help in this sub. Bring on the cliches.
