I still feel like a loserBack in November I made a post here. My debts are getting paid, although those are in small payments. I'm learning to drive, studying. I have a plan by the end of the year to move, but the reason I'm posting is because I'm self-conscious. All those things don't matter if I can't find a good job where I can settle down. I at least want an office job and the only thing I have is a degree from a community college. Anybody can graduate from community colleges. I can't afford to go to a university and the five minutes I went to the cheapest one I hyperventilated because everyone there was better than me. The worst part is that I only went there to be back where I came from. I've regretted it ever since. I feel like I've missed out on something everybody should go through. I'm turning 25 in two months. I feel like I'm wasting my time and everybody elses'. There's only a certain point you age before you realize how much of a waste you are.

If I seem like I'm being a bitch, then piss off, I need help. It's in my goddamn name.
