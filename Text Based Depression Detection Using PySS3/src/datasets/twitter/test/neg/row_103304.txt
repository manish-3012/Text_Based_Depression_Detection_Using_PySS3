please someone help me. mother/daughter relationshipiâ€™m going to be cross posting this a lot because iâ€™m just so desperate at this point. i cant do this anymore and i really need some advice. basically, the issue is my mum. Sheâ€™s loving, supportive, caring and just everything a good mum should be. but i canâ€™t look at her and i canâ€™t bring myself to like her. i feel disgusting when she touches me, i want to scream and cry when we are alone together. and itâ€™s ripping me to shreds, i try to hide my emotion but can see how itâ€™s affecting her. please someone help me. yes, thereâ€™s more to this story and iâ€™ll send it to help give more information in a pm but i just need any help i can get right now. if you can, please help me. thanks.
