What keeps you going in life? Whats your reason to live?Its that time of the year where we all feel miserable if you're spending the holidays alone like me. I struggle with the very thought of suicide every day and in my case, playing video games and watching movies, TV shows and most recently, anime keeps me going in life. Its basically my reason to keep on living. I know I sound like a loser and what not, but I would like to know what keeps you going in life? What keeps you from killing yourself? Whats your reason to live?
