School has just started, and its making my depression and suicidal thoughts worseI'm a freshman, i just finished middle school and it was hell, but i was glad it was over, but then i realized i still have 4 years left, and while i wanted to enjoy summer as much as possible, it was already being ruined the first week, my stepmom, who i'd been an asshole to because she was trying to be a good parent shot herself while under the influence, and now people are thinking my dad killed her because of his checkered past. I was devestated, but i never cried about it until a month later.

But after that night, i was doing ok. And then my baby brother started being a pain in the ass. Honestly, the only things i want to do during the summer is relax and play some Bedwars and Mirror's Edge. But its constantly being interuppted by a screaming crying toddler, and ive blown up on him so many times, i've said "fuck you" him a few times because i can't handle small kids. in my house there are 4 children, Me, the oldest, my brother, the obnoxious younger one, my younger sister, the one who cant be bothered to use the restroom and constantly pisses herself, and then the toddler, basically the embodiment of a demon. and thats what ive dealt with all summer.

So at that point summer was fucked, the worst summer i've ever had. And on top of that it was starting to end soon anyway, so there was no point in trying to fix it. I did get a desk in my room, which meant i could relax in there the entire day, but then School started, yipee! Another year of mostly useless information that i probably wont need in my life later down the line. And i started late, due to me moving school districts, and cities for that matter. (since my step mom died, i've stayed with my mom) and virtual school is such an exhausting and unmotivating environment. There's so many websites you need to go to. I've met my teachers, and they're all nice, but it's just not an environment i enjoy. Especially since classes are shorter now, and i have 7, and like, i can deal with 6 but thats basically my limit, anymore and i won't be able to handle it. And I dont know if my teachers will be understanding of the fact that this is kind of a new thing for us. And i've been off track mostly, becauses im trying to make sure to be at meetings on time, and it's gotten better, but i missed almost a week worth of work because im still trying to make myself comfortable, but i just can't. Everything is going by too fast, and i can't handle it. The toddler is making me suicidal, school is making me suicidal, and if my grades deteriorate to a point where i get everything taken away from me, i won't have any friends to talk to, which will just make things worse, and my mom is an understanding, person, but im afraid she will just think its because im distracted, and i am, i'm distracted because i want to be able to do the things i want to do but they've been shoved away by too much school work in the first week.

I've tried the suicide hotline, and they helped me, but i ended up missing the 2 other calls the person gave me after the first one, and that made me feel bad again. But now i'm almost about to go through with dying. I can't deal with little children and school. But my mom would be devastated, and that's why I can't decide whether or not to just die.

I need help, desperately. i dont want to die, but it might be the only thing i can do to escape this godforsaken world.
