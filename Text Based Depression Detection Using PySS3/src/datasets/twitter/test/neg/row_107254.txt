I have spent the last 24 hours fucking everything up.I have fucked up my life, i have fucked up the life of the person who i love the most in the world, i have started cutting nyself again, i an seriously thinking of dying i dont know what to do anymore because i have fucked every single thing that matters to me in the world up.

Ending it right now... never being heard from again... that seems so much better than staying here.
