id rather dienursing homes have been on my mind lately. they are seriously the dumbest fucking thing ever. hopefully im dead way before i get nursing home age but id rather be taken out into a field and be shot in the face rather than live with a bunch of strangers and caregivers when im old as fuck and cant do a thing for myself. just another reason why i hate life so much.
