In a bad moodHooked up with my ex-girlfriend recently and felt like we reconnected. Later found out from my friend that she's not really looking for anything serious, and she likes me as a friend and had a good time, but isn't looking to pursue more.

Unfortunately, these events got me thinking about her a lot, and I've been kind of hung up on her.

Hung out with her tonight in a social setting. Tried to be cool about it, but everything made me think about how much I liked her. She ended up going off to get a drink with this 50 year old scumbag dude (she's 25).

Been doing really badly. Uh, I don't know what else to put here.
