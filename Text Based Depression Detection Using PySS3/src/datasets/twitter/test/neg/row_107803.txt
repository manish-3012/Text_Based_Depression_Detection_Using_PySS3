When you know that the only ones who will be sad over your death is your online friends.My family literally hates me. I mean we are talking about emotional and physical abuse. Rl friends? Bullies. I am no more than your nerd in the class and mostly a straight A student so everyone would emotionally attack me in school. The only ones I have told about suicide are my online friends and you, the sub. I doubt that anyone would care about it, I am worthless anyway. So suicide is the only escape for me.
