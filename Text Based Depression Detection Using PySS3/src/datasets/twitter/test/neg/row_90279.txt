I sat with a gun to my head today.I just need to let this out. I sat with my fathers gun to my head today. Theres a list of reasons why a mile long, just like everyone else's, and I know intellectually that just because other have it just as bad or worse than me doesn't make my situation any less viable. I do, however, feel that way. 

I know there are people I'd hurt. I know there are people who care, but I'm beyond caring about them. I'm beyond loving. I'll miss my sons birthday this year. And I don't know if I'll be alive for any of the others. I've had a note written for three weeks, and today wasn't the first day with the gun. 

I feel like it's inevitable. I feel like I've only dodged the bullet and there are more coming. An endless stream. It doesn't scare me anymore. I've all but accepted I'm to weak to handle this. I've all but accepted I won't amount to any more than I am. I've all but accepted this is a fight I don't want to win.
