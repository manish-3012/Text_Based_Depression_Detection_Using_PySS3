HelloI'm pretty sure I'm going through with it this time. Original goal was to wait until the abuser was convicted but he only got 6 months the first time and society is on his side so I'm to the part where I'm thinking of painless ways to do it. Also therapy sucks and I don't want to go into details. Everyone has an adverse reaction when I bring it up so its like I can't talk about it and I don't think its worth trying to "be strong" because I'm not and at this point I feel as though everybody else is selfish for not letting me kill myself. Time doesn't heal all wounds, it just haunts you. I don't want to be convinced otherwise at this point I just want a swift and discrete (no guns) way to do it.
