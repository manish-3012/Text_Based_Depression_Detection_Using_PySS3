I'm not sure of what to do anymore.this is my first time posting here, but i don't know where else to really turn to...

as of lately things have been turning for the absolute worst. i have friends moving away, and it feels like no one really wants to talk to me in the theatre space that im in. im a trans guy, and i have a fucked up cocktail of mental disorders due to severe emotional and mental abuse from multiple family members. [ to note, it's ptsd and borderline personality disorder that really contribute to my feelings of hopelessness, along with depression. ] and as the years go by, things get worse and worse and i dont know who to go to anymore.

lately i havent gone a day without crying for hours or thinking of ending it all. someone i was close to keeps getting more and more distant, and i fear of telling them my problems because i fear that they'll turn it on me, as they have done in the past. i care so much for them, but they told me it seems like i / dont / care about them and it's really fucked me up.

like... and with school, im not doing bad at all. i just feel not good enough. good, but never good enough. there, but not quite. im in the fine arts, but that feels so bland as i keep getting that damned silver medal in competitions, there but not quite.

and the thing is, the people who can get me help keep holding off on getting me that help. my mom isnt the best person, but ive been asking for therapy for at least over 2 years now, and she kept making excuses for not finding anyone. she still hasnt found anyone.

and to add onto THAT, i have to hide my problems from her, because shes not really the type of person who listens. she always tells me that because she went through these things, that i'll get through it, and that doesn't help especially when im in such a low that i dont see a way of escape.

for weeks ive been trying to debate with myself on when to get rid of myself. its been causing a lot of stress. 

im just hoping i can find better advice here.
