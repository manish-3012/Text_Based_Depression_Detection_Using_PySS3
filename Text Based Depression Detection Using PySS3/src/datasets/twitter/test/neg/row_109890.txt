I've dropped everythingI don't care about my goals anymore.
I don't want anything, I have nothing I want to achieve.
I'm hungry, and I don't even care to get up to eat.
I just quit my job.
There is nothing more powerful to me now than my disdain for existence.

I'm going to hang myself with a belt in less than an hour.
