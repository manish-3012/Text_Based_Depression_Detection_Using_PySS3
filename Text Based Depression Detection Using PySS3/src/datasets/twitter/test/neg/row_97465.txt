I'm worried about my brother but he is halfway around the world in the military and is exhibiting strange vocalizationsHe's in the US military and is back from his second deployment. Ever since he's returned he's been having serious issues with depression and alcohol abuse. He will call me, usually drunk, and tell me that he wants to kill himself and thinks about it constantly. He claims he won't follow through on it due to the pain it would cause the family and I mostly believe him, but some of his speech patterns make me doubt he's being completely honest with me. 

He will generally continue to talk about his situation until he is crying in a public pace, which isn't too extreme. What does worry me is that he screams out involuntarily in the middle of sentences in the public place he's calling from. I'm afraid it might indicate an issue deeper than depression that may enable him to act irrationally. 

I've had issues with depression myself and I understand what he's going through to an extent. He tells me he thinks of suicide every day, and I do too, but that he'll never follow through on it. He tells me that when he was deployed he'd try to get himself killed (since it wouldn't appear to be suicide to the family) by acting like a lemming on PCP but he managed to get through his deployment unscathed.

After much effort I've managed to convince him to see a military psychologist, but I'm afraid he'll be less than completely honest since he's worried about losing his clearance. He's relatively isolated on a military base six time zones away, leaving me unable to help him. Is there anything I can do?
