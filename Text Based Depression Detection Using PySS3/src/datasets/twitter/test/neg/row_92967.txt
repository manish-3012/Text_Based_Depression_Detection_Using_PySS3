i donâ€™t want to be here.i donâ€™t have a super long post like everyone else but iâ€™ve dealt with depression since i was around 5. my dad died and my grandfather commits suicide 6 months after. dog and rabbit died recently. iâ€™m not pretty. i hate myself. no matter how much i vent to people it never helps and i never get better. i want to kill myself in order to get rid of this fucking pain. i want to be with my dad. and all my pets. i just want a bus to hit me. something. anything. i want to feel pain. iâ€™m going back to cutting. i hope that holds it off for a little while.
