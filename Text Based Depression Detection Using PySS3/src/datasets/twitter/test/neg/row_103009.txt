[19f - uk] Going to GP tomorrow, will I go to hospital if I tell them I have suicide plane?Cross posted!

Title says it all really, will I be sent to hospital? I donâ€™t really feel safe anymore as the temptation of suicide is unreal at home.


Iâ€™ve only had experience of being sent to hospital though A&amp;E.


Will my GP send me to A&amp;E and/or how does it work and is it worth me packing a small bag of clothes just incase I go into hospital? I also have anorexia also and chances are they will refer me to another hospital as Iâ€™m losing weight very quickly
