If I can't move by the end of year I want to do it.I grew up in a really bigoted place that taught me to hate myself. Ever since failing out of college due to the depression I've been stuck here at home and it's agony. I want to move to a place like Chicago or California, but I have no money to leave. My parents won't help and I have no reason to fight or work or try anymore. If I can't be gone by the end of the year I think I'm going to do it. I can't take this any longer. Life isn't worth this suffering.
