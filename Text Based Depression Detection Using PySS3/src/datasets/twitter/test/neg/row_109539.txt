Can I ask for a od?Hey,

Long story short, i've been dealing with some mental problems for over 2 years, everything is going alright for now. but i don't really have a plan for the future. I don't see the point of investing my time in anything.

I wanted to ask if i am able to ask for a od to my therapist? i mean, it's my own choice so are they allowed to accept my request?

I appreciate it if anyone could answer
