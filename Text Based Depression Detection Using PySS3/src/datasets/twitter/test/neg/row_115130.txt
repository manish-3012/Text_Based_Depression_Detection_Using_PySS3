hallucinations/visual disturbancesdoes anyone with anxiety/depression see things? sometimes i see things out of the corner of my eye/can feel the presence of a man in the room. heâ€™s not someone I know but he represents a very real fear of men that i have (iâ€™m a sexual assault victim as well). things can get particularly worse when iâ€™m having a panic attack. it began only happening the day after doing drugs (save the lecture iâ€™m in the process of getting help &amp; stopping) but now itâ€™s regular

edit - i donâ€™t know if these are considered strong enough to be hallucinations? or if theyâ€™re more visual disturbances ?
