Just need to let some things out. Maybe it'll help.The "I want to cease existing" moments are happening closer and closer together and it's getting harder to find things that will make me happy enough to get over them. Puppies and kittens and kisses don't work.

I thought that once I had someone I could love for the first time in my life it would be better and hey I actually managed to find someone. The only thing that happens is that you feel like a burden. He's the only one I feel I can actually say anything to because his words are the only ones that have any sort of emotional impact on me. I have other friends and they have taken the time to talk with me and I appreciate it but I'm too scared to share much with them.

I hate crying all the time. I hate feeling like the world would be better off without me and that I'm using resources that would better go to someone who deserves it. I hate having the desire to actually accomplish something but being too stupid and tired and out of my mind to do anything about it. I want to stop fucking crying right now. 

I want to stop thinking about advil overdosing, scapels, highways and freezing to death. 

I want to stop thinking about myself all the time and enjoy the world around me. 



But it's never going to happen. 

EDIT: I think it helped a little. I can at least breath now.

Edit2: Nope. I still want to die. Curling up in a shell now.
