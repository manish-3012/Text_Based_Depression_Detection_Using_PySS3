Can't even go buy a rope to hang myself with due to everywhere being closedThanks to COVID-19 I can't even go to a hardware or outdoor store to buy a climbing rope so I can hang myself. Every store around is closed. What a fucking cruel joke.

Nobody gives a shit about me, I have no friends or SO, and people that I thought cared about me completely ignore me. I'm also poor with almost no money, and due to my mental health I will probably lose my job. I have no future or career path. I struggle with depression, anxiety, and probably borderline personality disorder as well.

It would be a perfect day to end my miserable fucking life. I'm a pathetic failure in life and a piece of shit.
