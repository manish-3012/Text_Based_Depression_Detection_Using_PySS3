NYC hospital? (xposted to nyc and depression)Hopefully this is information that will be utterly useless to me, but I'm kind of sliding downward on a depressive streak and am concerned that I'm approaching a harming-myself level. Obviously if I feel that way, I'll take myself to a hospital, but I wanted to know if anyone has had any good or bad experiences in the NYC psych wards. I know sometimes they can do more harm than good. Any suggestions?

Edit: If no one can answer this, can you recommend a good place for me to find this sort of information?
