I'm done with lifeMy life has been truly horrific. After a lifetime of abuse (33 years) and dealing with chronic homelessness, I finally have safe, permanent housing but am so isolated. I can't take being home alone all day every day. I can't drive and was hit by a car so can't handle taking the bus. Lyft/Uber are too expensive and limited availability with covid. Everyone in my life betrayed my a few years ago and I have only made a few friends since who lead busy lives and I don't see much at all.  I had been applying for part-time jobs (on disability), but the isolation is causing so many issues that I have had to cancel  interviews because I can't handle it. No suitable volunteer positions available either and even if I am able to go to the park or something, everyone avoiding me because of social distancing makes me feel horrible. I have contacted churches and other organizations about getting some social support/interaction and they are just ignoring me (I've contacted them before and they've replied so they are deliberately ignoring my emails as I sent a second just in case). Virtual communities make me feel more alone and there are no solutions left for my situation. I can't handle so much time alone, especially after everything I've been through. I've spent my whole just trying to survive and I am physically and mentally exhausted. I'm tired of fighting just to suffer more. Asking for help has made my life and the mental health system is a joke and caused me harm so done with it. I hate society and will end my life soon.
