I want to express MY will.I hate how I've lived subordinate to other people's will. For the longest time I have went out of my way to not be selfish, and to try to coexist with everyone else's will. Well fuck that. It bit me in the ass. 

*I* want to express MY fucking will for once. When is anyone going to listen to me? When is MY input going to matter? When am I going to make my own fucking decisions?

I feel like my will has been thwarted by everyone else and any time I try to express my discontent with the situation I get back lash and now  *I'm* the selfish prick who exerts his will over others. Ugh.

I think this is a big reason why suicide is appealing to me. It's a very powerful expression and kinda says "I'm aware that everyone disapproves of this, but fuck it, it's what *I* want for once." It's not as romantic as that but I think that is in the mix of why I consider suicide.

Basically I feel like I have no control over anything, except my own will. But even my will seems to be at the whims of other people, whether it be employers or just people I know. Tired of all this. Just want to sleep forever.
