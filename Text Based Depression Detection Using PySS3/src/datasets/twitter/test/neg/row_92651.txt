Don't want to deal with it anymoreI dropped out high school and quit my job so I wouldn't have as much stress but I don't think it was worth it. Now im just a burden to my family. I've been looking for another job but can't get any call backs. The weight of the world is just crushing down on me right now. I don't know what Im going to do about my education, I can't find a job, my boyfriend is moving away from me for college, and my family is moving houses. Im going to this program that is supposed to help me, I've been going for a few weeks now but I don't notice much of a difference. I just don't want to deal with it anymore.
