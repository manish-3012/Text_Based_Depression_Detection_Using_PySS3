Please help meIâ€™m guessing I will get a lot of comments saying an answer that I did not want to hear, but oh well. Here I am. So, my questions are...

1) If youâ€™re a teen, does swallowing 1 tide pod kill you?
2) If the answer to number 1 is no, then how many?
3) How long will it take for the tide pod to kill you?
4) What chance is there that it will kill you?
