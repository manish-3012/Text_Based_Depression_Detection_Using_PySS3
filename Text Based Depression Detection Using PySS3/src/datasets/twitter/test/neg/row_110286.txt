been thinking about this for a whileI want to kill myself. It's the first time I have said it outside of my own head. I have been trying to bury these thoughts by binge drinking, having sex, not sleeping, and staying out all night. This is the first night in a week that I have been alone with myself and my thoughts. I have felt this way on and off for most of my life, but the past few months have been especially difficult for me. I don't have any friends right now. I'm not anyone's priority. People only care about me when it's convenient for them. 

I really just want to end it all,  but I don't have any type of belief regarding what happens after death. This fear is the only thing stopping me. As someone with a psychology degree, I know that we are supposed to consider this to be a good thing, because after all I am still alive. But for me, it feels like torture. I can't live anymore and I also can't escape it. 

I'm not sure why I am posting this here, I guess I just need someone to talk to. This seems like one of the rare places on the internet where decent, caring people tend to gather.
