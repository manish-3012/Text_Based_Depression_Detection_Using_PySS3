NadirHi guys. I'm kind of at the end of my rope. This has been going on, seems like years now. Don't really know when it started. I think I might go through with it this time. Not really sure why I'm posting other than a cry for help. My life is fine, filled with all kinds of "hope" and "potential" and good things. There are paths I could take, plenty of opportunities, but I just don't care. I'm 30 years old and have nothing to show for it. I look out towards the future and see nothing but barren wasteland. 

I'm living for a short time in my ex GF's house with her and her brother. I am unwanted here. I'm looking at finding another job somewhere in the country. I don't want to go but I can't stay here. I am now certainly an alcoholic. These thoughts of death and dropping off the map plague me and scare me because it could so easily happen. I'm raging drunk every night and have guns a'plenty. It would be so easy to do, and it's so inviting. Every passing minute grates on my consciousness. 

They say suicide is selfish. I don't care. The pain of being here any longer is too much for me to bear.
