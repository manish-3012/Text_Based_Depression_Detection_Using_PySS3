I want to kill myself, because I'm bored.I wouldn't necessarily say kill myself. Just do something fucking stupid enough to get myself killed. Or at least get me out of my boredom. 

This isn't just a one time boredom kind of thing. I live with old (65+) people and am still a minor so I'm not allowed to do anything without their permission and supervision. But they're old so at the same time when they do supervise me, they only watch never participate (can't blame them though). Only child and because of their fear of me getting kidnapped or killed when adults aren't around, can't hang out with friends either. Fuck, I can't even walk around the neighbourhood on my own.

I'm fucking sick and tired of this bullshit. I know they're old and I can't blame them, but it's really starting to take a toll on me not being able to do ANYTHING aside from being in the house all day. I've just about up and had enough of this. The more I think about doing something stupid and/or getting myself killed the better of an idea it sounds.
