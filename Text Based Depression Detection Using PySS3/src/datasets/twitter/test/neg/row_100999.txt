Can't come to terms with being gayI'm not sober while writing this so I'm sorry if I'm incoherent. I'm a 20-year-old woman, I've been denying my sexuality for years. I was treated horribly when I was young for being gay. When I was a little older, I was played with by straight women as a joke. I wanted to kill myself for being so stupid. I feel like a joke. I was sexually abused by a woman for years when I was really, really young, and it makes it all more pathetic and awful.

I feel ashamed and disgusted with myself for being a lesbian. I constantly worry that I'm gross and bad, and that this is just a culmination of abuse, and that I'm broken. I'll never know what it's like to be healthy like other lesbians.

I have no friends. I lost them all when they found out what I was. I live in a moderately homophobic section of my state. I don't know how to "grow up" and get better. I drink and smoke myself to sleep. I've been trying to get myself to go to therapy for a little while but I haven't worked up the courage yet. I'm too afraid of what I'll hear and what'll come up. I'm too afraid to be vulnerable around anyone else. It's easier to say nothing. I feel ugly.

I know I won't do it but I've been drinking, and thinking about taking my sleep meds. I know it's a bad choice, and I'll probably fall asleep soon anyway. I needed to get this off my chest. Probably going to go downstairs and cuddle with my dog and repeat this the next day
