Suicidal after fiancÃ© leftMe and my fiancÃ© were together for over a year . He was my best friend in the whole world !!!! Everything about him was so beautiful . His eyes, the way he laughed, his humor, even the way he danced silly at clubs. He treated me like a queen at the beginning of our relationship and praised the ground I walked on . Our sex was AMAZING and to this day I have never found someone that knew my body as well as he did. We had the perfect relationship, and our friends envied us because we were so god damn happy . But Overtime, we started to grow apart. We argued like cats and dogs, and he often ignored me toward the end of our relationship. We split about two months ago, and I have been feeling suicidal ever since . I am 25 years old . My entire life I have never met anyone so perfectly compatible for me and I don't think I ever will . My heart feels like it went through a meat grinder, and it's hard to get up in the morning, go to work, get dressed or even breathe . What's worse is that he is happily living his life, not giving two shi*s about me ... so what's the point of living life if you have to live it alone ??.I just want this pain to end . People say I will get through it, but I really just cannot bare this pain I'm feeling . Death would be so great right about now :)
