The opposite of what youâ€™d expect.Iâ€™m 26, still young but feel like Iâ€™ve lived enough. My soul is tired, my life is collapsing piece by piece. I havenâ€™t had a hearty genuine smile in over 2 years. But this shouldnâ€™t be me....I grew up with everything a kid would ever need, I have two supportive parents who want nothing but the best for me, siblings and friends whoâ€™d shoot through a whole town for me. A job which many would die to have.

But I feel no love, I feel nothing, in my mind, I havenâ€™t done enough, I havenâ€™t learned enough, I havenâ€™t worked hard enough, Iâ€™m not good enough for they love they give me. In part my social awkwardness plays a part. But thatâ€™s on me and another reason why Iâ€™m not good enough for this life. 

I donâ€™t know where Iâ€™m going, I have a mental breakdown everyday, constant anxiety which has led to me developing a heart problem because Iâ€™m always on edge. To be honest Iâ€™ve been waiting for this to kill me. At least I would die knowing my family know I didnâ€™t take my own life. My grandmother died a year  ago and that alone shattered my family. 

Iâ€™m currently sitting in my car on the side of a bridge, Iâ€™m sorry if this is the wrong place but the river below looks inviting, thereâ€™s a factory thatâ€™s on and the light look so beautiful and it hit me....this is where I can go
