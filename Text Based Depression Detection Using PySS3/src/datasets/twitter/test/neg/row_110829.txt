Been contemplating suicide for a while now.All my life I loved gaming it started with my Atari and has grown from there, at a very young age I decided I wanted to play professionally, however my parents wouldn't have it.  When my father found out he smashed my game systems, I was distraught but I lived my life anyways.

Several years later I was a manager at papa johns, had my own apartment and fiancee, but I hated working at papa johns.  I would come home and watch pro gamers streams and get incredibly depressed. Eventually I said "FUCK THIS I'm GOING TO LIVE LIFE MY WAY OR NOT AT ALL."  The next day I quit papa johns and started towards a career in gaming, not even pro gaming, just anything at all. 

Well my fiancee wasn't happy but she dealt with it for a while, about the time I joined reddit she left me because she thought I wasn't going anywhere.  I didn't know what to do anymore so I ended up moving back in with my parents.

I was sad for a long time but eventually that fueled me "I'm going to become successful and leave all them behind they'll see" I kept telling myself that over and over and over to no avail.

Today I sit in my bedroom at my parents house a complete and utter failure.  I don't really blame anyone other than my own ambitions.  But I can't see myself moving forward from here, I have the vacuum cord tied around the support beam in my closet and I want to end it so bad, I want to try harder but I know I'll just fail like all the other times.
