.Welp my pistols got taken. Itâ€™s a shame, that etching was looking real pretty. My dad saw the initial but brushed it off. Iâ€™m just gonna have to buy a gun now. Not gonna lie, a .38mm  or a 9mm would have been better than a shotgun shell, but I have to save up cause Iâ€™m broke as an addict. Oh wait! I am an addict thatâ€™s why.
