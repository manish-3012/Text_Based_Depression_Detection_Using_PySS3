38 days left.Honestly I feel little more at peace. I quit my shitty job and I'm getting around to saying my goodbyes to my few friends and family. You can check my other posts but to sum it up I'm not in school and have been working shitty jobs ever since high school. In a little more than a month I'm gonna blow my brains out with my step dad's pistol. Finally I'll be done with this worthless life.
