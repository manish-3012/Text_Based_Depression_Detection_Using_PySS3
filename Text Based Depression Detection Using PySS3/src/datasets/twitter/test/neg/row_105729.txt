I'm tired of waking up. I've missed 2 days of work in the past 11 years. Today I asked for a week off and they told me if I take a week off I'll get fired. I've been unsuccessful in finding a job that will pay enough so I can afford rent. I'm physically tired. I need a little bit of time to just catch my breath. I'm kind of tired of life in general. I'm sick of getting up at 4:30am in the morning everyday. I'm tired of being yelled at all the time. Never does anyone notice when I do something right, but god forbid I forget something or overlook something simple. I'm tired of all the negative people and I very sick of going to work when it's dark and coming home when it's dark. I don't have any family left alive and at the end of the month I don't have any extra money to go do anything with. Even if I did I wouldn't have the time. I can't go anywhere because I don't have a way to get there other than walking and my physical health is so bad now I wouldn't make it if I walked. 

I'm done with life. It will make no difference to anyone if I'm here or not. I've contributed very little to this world and due to my physical problems I won't be able to contribute anymore to this world. I really don't care if anyone wants me here or not. It's none of their business. 

I'm going to leave this up on the work computer and go kill myself in the break room. 

The people I work will did this to me. I just want them to live with that.
