I dont know if this is the place, but here goesIll keep this short...Once upon a time i had everything figured out, but things went way outside of my control.  Without giving too many details away, i had a good life, but everything has gone sour, and has been that way for a few years.  It just seems like every time i try and make a move forward, life shoves me back a few paces.  I am 28 years old and working as a waiter because that is all i can do, i know im much smarter than that, but any effort to get into school just gets tossed out.  my love life is a joke.  i got told tonight i wasnt worth a damn by a girl i thought was going to be the one...again.   i know this all sounds first world problems, but i put on such a happy face all day every day, and tonight i just kinda snapped.  i cant keep pretending that i love what i do, i cant keep pretending that i even like my situation.  i definitely cant keep pretending that my shitty apt means anything to me.  and more than anything im just tired, this stupid mask of a face i keep on makes me sick, but i keep it on to get fucking tips so i can pay my bills.  i just need a little reassurance that putting down the pills is the right move.  the fact that ive considered that multiple times means i should probalby get thearpy, but in all honestsy, i just wish i could talk about this to anyone IRL.  Writing this out is helping, but i really just hate being a fucking bitch, and i know i am right now.

sorry its a throwaway, i hope you understand.
