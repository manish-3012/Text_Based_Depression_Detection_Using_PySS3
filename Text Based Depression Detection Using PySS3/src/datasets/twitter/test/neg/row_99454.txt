Life is too Much to HandleIn the summer my friend tried to kill himself twice, each time I was the one who found him,the first time I was the one who called the ambulance, sped so fast I got to his house in 8minutes when he lives 15 away, I ran into his house, he was lying on the kitchen floor unconscious. We went to the hospital and I didn't leave his side until he was "safe" at home again. Two nights later he tried again. I did everything over again but when I got to his house he wasn't in his room he was somewhere in the forest. It was 1am and I was told to go out into the forest and find him. I was crying out his name hoping he would answer but he didn't. When I found him he was up in a tree and when the police arrived they got him down. Again we went to the hospital and I stayed with him as long as I could. I guess I don't need to fill you in on everything that happened but after he got out of the hospital he got upset with me and stopped talking to me. In August he texted me and wanted advice but I didn't say what he wanted to hear and he got mad at me. I couldn't take what he said so I decided to OD, only, the next day I woke up. I've never hated myself more. I wanted everything to go away and I failed. How do you fail at something like this? The next week I was accepted to college across the country so I packed and left. In October another friend killed himself and left me feeling so helpless. Now I'm sitting in front of my laptop and I have no clue what to do. Everything is just really stressful and I am trying to be positive but I was just diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and everything is piling up. I feel like I'm drowning. I sorry I just need to rant. Sorry. There's more I want to say I just can't do it.
