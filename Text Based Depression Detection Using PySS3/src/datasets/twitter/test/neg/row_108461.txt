im doneim sorry for the people that will have to deal with my body but im done with everything

i have no future im a disappointment im a failure im useless im just a waste and a burden

ill never have a decent life and i dont want to keep pretending that some day itll get better cuz that isnt gonna happen

it hurts like hell being so fucking alone all the time but thats how im gonna go
