27M. Social anxiety has ruined my life and I can't get past the feeling of my 20s being a failure. Ending it is for the best.Honestly, I just feel like ending it. Social anxiety has completely fucked me. I am the worst loser on Earth. I'm 27 and I've spent the entire decade making absolutely no new friends. During my entire 20s, any social connections I made at all were influenced by alcohol.

You know what my Thai girlfriend said to me tonight in broken English? "Why you not have many friend? I think you have many friend when you young" See, that's how desperate I am. Such poor social skills that I had to find a girlfriend from Thailand who can't even fucking speak English remotely fluently. But a girl who still knows how socially inept I am.

She's a great girl and everything but she speaks rudimentary English so our communication is always rather superficial. Beyond cooking, travelling, and watching films together, we don't share any interests. Most people like me who read books and pursue other intellectual interests tend to find partners of an equal intellect. I found a poor farmer girl from Thailand. 

That's not even the worst of it though. The worst if it is how my 20s have been spent in a state of mostly pure isolation. I have two acquaintances, but they're not friends; all I do with either of them is drink. I could call on neither guy to help me during a crisis, such as now.  

In college, I studied for four years and I can count the number of times I went out clubbing on two hands. I've fucked two girls in my entire pathetic life. 

You know the things most people do during their 20s, like making tons of friends, going out clubbing all the time, etc? I've done barely any of that. Yes, there were times when I was sociable, but most of my 20s have been spent alone due to my anxiety around people.

I worked in an office for a year in 2014: had to quit because of anxiety. In college, I scored low on some modules because they had a presentation element, which I invariably skipped. Went to Australia on a working holiday visa to change things; ended up returning home after 3 months because I was an utter outcast in the sociable backpacker environment. 

The last three years, I've lived in Thailand 50 percent of the time with my girlfriend, who I met while on a solo southeast Asia trip in 2013. During all that traveling? I've made a sum total of zero new friends. Drank with randomers in bars sometimes, but mostly, that's near 18 months spent living in a foreign country making no friends at all. 

You know how everyone who travels solo meets lots of people? I spend my time exploring cities alone, and cowering away from others in my hostel bed, afraid to interact. 

I'd try change things but I've already fucked up too bad. It is too late for me. If any of you learn anything from this, it's that social anxiety can lead to death. Also, please learn that travelling around the world, even solo, means nothing if you are an introverted recluse who is shy as fuck and spend your time abroad too afraid to really meet new people.

Any of you who got this far, thank you very much for reading. I don't even know what feedback I'm looking for but thanks for your patience in reading this wall of drivel.
