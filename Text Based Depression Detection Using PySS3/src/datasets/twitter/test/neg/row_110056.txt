Not worth the timePost history is something funny here in reddit, ive commented many times on random subjects and some rando stranger just by chance checks my post history and get san idea of what im going through... but its not worth it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

why do people care... or pretend to care anyways. idk.

&amp;#x200B;

well im here to notify another failure... (yay)

this was a weird weekend, friday night i got high, drunk and shitfaced in every way i can imagine right now, and well as i expected, at some point in the night my mind cleared for a while... in between all the weed, alcohol and well bad desitions my brain cleared and i saw my own death.

well at least i think i did.

and well just like evey other post ive fucking made i tried to jump off a building, the same building... that building.

i couldnt, a stranger grabbed my arm and took me for a ride, to this moment i still dont know his name, but i do know that he told me something that has stuck to my head.

"you arent more worth it just because you can end your life, you are tho if you regret it after youve tried to"

&amp;#x200B;

now i dont remember much after that point, its all a blur but i can tell you this. Im not ending my own life, or at least im not making one last goodbye if i do.

&amp;#x200B;

in the last month my near death experiences have been numerous, i got run over by a car (havent mentioned it previously to this post), i got into a fight and then noticed one of the guys who beat the living shit out of me had a knife, and i even was missed by a lost bullet. and every single time my only thought is "why wasnt i killed, why does god hate me enough to make me think ill die and then dont let me".

&amp;#x200B;

and well, i dont regret any of it, i do want to die but i dont have the gut to do it, im not brave enough, i dont deserve to die because i deserve the pain ive been living with.

&amp;#x200B;

ive accepted that, and now ig im just living untill im worth dying. Im done now, im really done with trying, life, im done with living for others, for myself, even though i love somebody i cant keep living. but i will.

its not right. why me. why do i get to live and others die.

&amp;#x200B;

i dont have hope, worth, im empty and im fucking done.

&amp;#x200B;

this is not a goodbye, if i die it will mena it was my time to die and ill finally be happy, fullfilled. but untill then im stuck here.

&amp;#x200B;

dont waste your time regretting, dont waste your time on me.

&amp;#x200B;

just remember that being a kind stranger is something that is hard and you should be proud of... im not one anyways.
