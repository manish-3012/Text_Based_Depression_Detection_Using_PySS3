It's time to goI've been wanting to end my life for two years. I thought talking to people would help. I thought thingd would get better. They don't. Because nobody cares.   
People have had it worst so I have no right to complain. Apparently if I go see a therapist it can destroy my family somehow. Maybe I'm just a selfish asshole after all. My life isn't that important so it doesn't matter if it is shit or if I can have a decent life.  


People told me they care. They care so much that they don't do anything to help me. They care so much that they ignore me when I need them the most. Maybe I'm just expecting to much. Maybe there is a reason if they lied to me. I still don't understand why would they do that.   


I should have ended it when I had the courage to. I didn't do it because of them. Now it's worst and I don't even have the courage to do this because I'm a coward. I wish I had the strength to do it.   
I just need to get over the fact that I will be alone forever and that it's how it was meant to be. I just realized it after 16 years of existence. Maybe if I knew it before I could have done something.
