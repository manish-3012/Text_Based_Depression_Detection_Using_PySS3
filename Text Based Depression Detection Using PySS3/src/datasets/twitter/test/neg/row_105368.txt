Just lost my benefit (Uk), was already far physically and mentally unwell to carry on. I think I'm going to dieFor three years, while living in a homeless shelter which was a container project, I suffered with flu nearly every day, unbearable anxiety and depression along with a ready made ghetto full of rape, crack and suicide.

It would be impossible to describe the physical and mental suffering endured during this time. I saw dozens of doctors and clinics, nobody can figure out what is wrong. I suffer from severe fevere like symptoms daily and live in almost permanent hell. I have to physically purge my system of cortisol and adrenaline multiple times in the day. My dissociative symptoms are so extreme sometimes I have no idea what is going and suffer amnesia like symptoms. I have profound insomnia that I am due to see a sleep clinic for, a neurologist for my fevers and will be starting a third lit of CBT this year.

Today I received a letter from the DWP in the UK stating that my money will be reduced to Â£60 a week down from Â£125 for some reason I have been placed in the work related group instead of the support group.

I had an assessment 4 months ago and provided evidence of my inability to work and how I have been MUCH more ill that the last two years of where I was receiving the normal rate. The appeal process takes weeks and I won't be getting any money in that time.

The only thing stopping me killing myself this very minute is the though of hurting my grandmother, who is 96 and I live with all the heart I have and my mother who has had an awful life as well. 

The only reason I was alive was because I could buy the food and warmth I needed. I can't even buy my family presents for Christmas now.

I want to die so badly and I'm scared that that feeling might overtake the love of my family and I might kill myself. I hate living so much, everyday is just pain and suffering. I pray to God nearly every night that I don't wake up.
