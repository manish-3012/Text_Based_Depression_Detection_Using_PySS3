Application failed for the school that I needed to go. Now I must kill myself.I live in South Korea.

There is a high school that I needed to go in order to go abroad.

My application got denied.

I don't know why.

I made sure I was qualified for the school that I applied in, and I took every steps carefully.

Now I have no way to go abroad for studying. I have to stay in South Korea. 

I wanted to go abroad to get a better education and a better job.

My life became shit now.

I don't know if I could suceed. I keep failing.
