School makes me want to end it allps: sorry for any spelling mistakes, english isn't my first language.

So, I just finished a school semester and i'm so tired of living. I got straight A's in almost all my classes and I still feel so empty inside. I pretty just spent the last 4 months of my life only doing school work and nothing else. 

The issue is that i'm an average student. I'm not really bright or anything, unlike the rest of my family. My two brothers are in med school. My parents want me to become a doctor. I have no interest in becoming a doctor, but I don't want to be the "failure" of the family. I'm not even in university yet, and I can't handle the pressure anymore. Anyway, after i'm done with med school, i'll be stuck being a doctor, and that job doesn't interest me at all. So i'm wondering if its just better for me to end it all now. My future is so depressing. I'm someone who's super creative, "intellectual" jobs makes me want to die. I spoke about it to my mom, and she was so mad and hurt. My parents know i'm unhappy, but my dad told me that: "you have to make sacrifices in life in order to be successful".

I'm so depressed, I can't handle it anymore. I haven't left my house in two weeks. I isolated myself from all of my friends. I have a pretty large group of "friends". I'm always the "funny" one in the group and I don't want to see my friends because I don't want to put up the act of "being fine" and still be "funny".  I've been thinking of suicide everyday for the last month, I even have a plan and everything. My soul is tired. Everyday I wake up sad. I'm mentally and physically exhausted. It's not that I want to die, it's just the only way i see of escaping the future I didn't chose.

My parents are quite religious, so for them committing suicide is a "sin". So I can't just go and tell them: Hey, I want to kill myself! They are going to tell me to go read the Bible and that kind of stuff. They think suicide is the "meanest thing someone can do to their family". Suicide is indeed selfish, but " can suicide really be a choice if its the only choice?".  I highly doubt the Bible can heal my depression and anxiety. I don't have enough money for therapy, and once again If I ask my parents help for that, they just are going to tell me to go and read the Bible and pray until I get better.

I don't have a friend or someone close that I really trust. I talked about it to my school psychologist and she said that I probably have a really severe depression and severe anxiety.

I just needed to vent somewhere. I wonder if theres anyone out there who was in the same situation as me and they were able to still have the future they wanted, if so how?

I want to die, help me.
