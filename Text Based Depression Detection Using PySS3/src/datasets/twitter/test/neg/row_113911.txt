AfraidI'm going to hand myself today. Hoped I could get the whole weekend and do it on sunday but shits hitting the fan tomorrow so it has to be today. Scared as shit. Had a few trial runs, just to feel what it's like hanging, didn't seem too bad. Got loads of research about the method. Got a haircut yesterday. Not leaving a letter. Nobody suspects it. Yet I have this fukin feeling that I am going to fail. Obviously I'm afraid of what goes on after death, but this failure thing scares me even more.  If i fail I'll just add another fukin point to my already epic list of shit. Don't even know why I'm writing here honestly. Guess 4 years of boiling in this shit and never talked about it with anyone. Thought this day would be so much different.
