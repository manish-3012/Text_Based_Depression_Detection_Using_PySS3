No medications seem to stop my bipolar disorder from wrecking my lifeMy life could have been so much more. I'm so stuck in my head about how my life could have turned out. I couldn't commit to school because of constant depressive downs and manic ups. I dropped out at 21 before they had a chance to fail me out. I ruined the one shot I had at going to school. Currently I'm working full time and going to school part time but I can't deal with it. My depression gives me no passions to pursue because I can't picture a future for myself. My current job is so dead end it isn't funny, and my work is using my depression/FMLA usage as an excuse to not give me a raise or promotion. I feel like I'll never get a decent job because I'll never be able to get a college education. Every time I start to excel at school, I have a massive breakdown that prevents me from getting good grades.
I've ruined every relationship I've ever had, romantic and friendship. I'm a self sabotager. I don't think things through. I don't think before I talk. I let my spur of the moment bipolar episodes control my narrative and explode on the people I care about. I let my anxiety run my life which constantly makes me say and do horrible things. My husband's friends won't talk to him anymore because they always stressed me out, so I'd always melt down in front of them and say things I regretted. They think I'm abusive and toxic and can't be around me, meaning they can't be around him. Maybe they're right. Maybe I am a piece of trash. The abused always become abusers, right?
I wonder if I made the right choice getting married. Ever since his friends accused me of being abusive and called me a horrible person, he cut them out of his life to defend my honor. He's been so depressed ever since. He says it was worth it because he loves me but I really wonder if it was worth it. I could sense they didn't like me from the start and I could sense I wasn't the best for him but I let myself think love conquers all. But ever since they accused me of abusing him, I even wonder if I'm capable of love. I don't think I love him anymore. And if I do, my love is severely misguided. He could have done so much better but I pressured him into getting married quickly because I felt he would find someone better and leave me. No one has ever treated me this amazingly in my life and I just take him for granted. I should let him go but then I'll have nowhere to go except back home with my abusive mother, and I would literally rather die. So I'm taking him for granted and using him again so I have a place to live because I can't stand the thought of being alone. I know I can't be alone. My suicidal thoughts increase when he leaves because I always think "now's my chance." I feel he'd be better off a widower than a divorcee. One of his friends said one way I'm abusive is because I threaten suicide when he leaves. She got it all wrong. I've never outright told him about my suicidal tendencies. I came to her once during his bachelor party because the depression got so bad and she interpreted what I was saying as "if he goes, I'll do it." Abuse is telling your partner you'll kill yourself if they leave, but I didn't do that. I wanted him to enjoy his bachelor party, so I reached out to her instead. She didn't get it and now it makes me abusive in the eyes of all of his friends. I trusted her with those thoughts and she used them against me to kick us out of her friend circle. But my husband has no idea how badly I'm struggling and I'll never tell him. But I fear he may never know until it's too late. The main reason I haven't done it yet is because I don't want him to be the one to find my body. I can't do that to him. He deserves better. I'm not in the planning stage, but the idea of driving off to the mountains and disappearing forever has crossed my mind. That way some stranger can find my body. They don't deserve that either, but better someone else than my husband.
I've considered institutionalizing myself but I don't want the stigmatized label of crazy. I would lose my shitty job because they would hire someone else in my place. If they did reserve it for me, everyone would tiptoe around me and treat me like I'm broken. They already do. My abusive mother uses my bipolar disorder against me already when I try standing up for myself against her. She writes all my feelings off as a tantrum due to mental illness. If I got institutionalized, she would have more of an excuse to gaslight me. People already take her side because she's a manipulative narcissist, so I don't want to know what it would be like if I went to an institution. I can't voice any opinions without people looking at me as the sad bipolar woman whose life is falling apart. So I keep up appearances and pretend my life is great so no one treats me differently. I just got married in February and a house in June, I should be happy, right? But I fear myself. Especially when no one is around.
I wish medications worked for me. They all have horrible side effects or straight up don't work. Lithium worked but it tried to shut down my kidneys. I'm on Lamictal and it was working but this is my second major depressive episode in two weeks with suicidal intent, which I haven't felt since I started the med a few months ago. It was working and it just gave up. And I don't want to up my dosage because last time I did that, I had a Steven Johnson's disease scare and couldn't be on that high of a dose. Not to mention my doctor currently thinks my liver is on the verge of giving out which could be due to the medication. I'm at a loss. Nothing works for me. I'm in therapy. I take meds. I confide in people. Nothing seems to work for me anymore. I don't see a point in going on if the rest of my life is going to be this miserable.

Tl:dr I want to quit school but doing so will make me feel like a failure, I feel like a failure of a wife, and I feel I can't be institutionalized or my life will unwind. Medication isn't working anymore. I'm at the end of my rope, no pun intended.
