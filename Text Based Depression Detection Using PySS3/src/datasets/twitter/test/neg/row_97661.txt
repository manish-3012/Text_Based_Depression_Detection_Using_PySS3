FailingI'm so tired of living a life where it seems like I can't do anything right. I'm on my second marriage, and she's constantly depressed with massive anxiety. I work hard, we don't have a lot, but there's a roof over our heads and my two beautiful children are happy, healthy, and fed. But I can't shake this feeling that I'm failing them every day. I try everything in my power to make everyone's lives easier but every day when I come home there's some reminder of my failings as a man. One of my best friends hung himself in February, and if I didn't believe suicide was a sin, I'd probably follow in his footsteps. I've wasted so much potential and I just wish I wasn't the piece of shit I've become.
