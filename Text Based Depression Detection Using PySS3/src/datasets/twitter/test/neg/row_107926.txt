LIFE AFTER MY SUICIDE ATTEMPTBACKGROUND/BEFORE: It was just last year, I took 90ish pills after rumors spread around school that I was being raped, that everything about my background was a lie, and that I was being abused by some guy rather than somebody at home. My father was always physical eventually he kicked me out. Bouncing from house to house of close friends, I had to rely on others after the school found out I was sleeping at Xsport in the beginning. Not that I didnâ€™t have the highest level of gratitude for all of their care and support, the reliance and asking to eat food and eventually running out of money (because I was only 15) couldnâ€™t keep up with me needing and wanting rather being a service to others. One of my ex-best friends' birthday was coming up and nobody prepared anything special bc there was a focus on me and it wasnâ€™t a priority possibly in their minds. So I spent all of my money remaining on food at the grocery store to have a feast and a night of festivities at somebodyâ€™s house and it turned into a line of questioning of where I got the money and how was this possible. Eventually, they believed I was selling drugs to do it bc I was associated with somebody that did. I Never Did. Girl, I donâ€™t even Juul. How would I sell anything else? Soon after everything came into question. I was forced to go home with my friends not being comfortable with my presence in their home. Reasonable. But my father kept pushing it so I took his pills and my mothers gulped it down and went to sleep. I slept for hours on the day and couldnâ€™t walk due to the dramatic ingestion. I wrote 22 letters to apologize to everyone. Somebody found out. I was hospitalized with a breathing tube, getting pneumonia after. My friends told the whole school I was in the loony bin while at the same time they visited on my 16th birthday. I just didn't know it at the time. The psych ward taught me gratitude for air and the outside world but it also taught me the system of the quickest way of functionality in society is through prescription, which for me doesn't sound appealing but does of course work for some. I refused and so I stayed longer my body language was taken to account when I was just cold but they interpreted as hiding something with my arms crossed. I met people and will always remember them. 

AFTER: I got a job and met amazing people, felt it was right to do something. In the beginning, I stayed inside didn't wanna go out. I cried my self to sleep, worked everyday half the time till 1 am @16. It was good at the beginning to sign up for things to keep busy. But that was my mistake I shouldn't have kept busy and forget. I met new people but the things are I leave before they can, it scares me. I'm still pretty lonely just do the motions of life without any passion or purpose. I have episodes of panics and crying and wanting to end it all but the biggest thing is we do have somebody. You always do even if it's religiously related somebody is listening. It's important to talk and have discussions. Don't cave inside to your world talk about it, really truly helps, I can promise that. I hope my story helps especially with the quarantine. Life can get better itâ€™s up to you.
