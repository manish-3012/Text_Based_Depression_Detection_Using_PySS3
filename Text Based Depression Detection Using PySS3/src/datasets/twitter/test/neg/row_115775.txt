Need someone to talk to... Not sure I want to continueI'm not sure I want to go on with my life.  I'm extremely self-conscious and have no self esteem or confidence to speak of.  I've only been in one relationship ( which I now know she only entered to take advantage of me, and I didn't see it until the damage was done ).  I have absolutely terrible luck with finding someone to love, and I fear I never will.  Other than the bad relationship I was in, I've never even had a woman look at me that didn't want me for some other reason ( cheating off of my homework, need me to buy something, etc).  Just about every girl I talk to has no real interest in me, and it hurts.  Rejection hurts.  I've been rejected so much I stopped counting.  I'm not good looking, but I like to think I'm decently intelligent.  I've got lots of friends, who think I'm lots of fun, and my co-workers think I'm pretty cool, but when I talk to girls I have an interest in I lock down and inevitably fumble and ruin it.  My social anxiety is crippling, and I don't know what to do.  I've all but decided that if I'm still single by the time I hit 30, I'm going to end it.  Or at least try.  I've been low enough to try before, but the universe thought I didn't suffer enough, and the primer in the bullet was a dud.  Lucky me -_- please talk to me, help me.  I have all the love in the world to give, but I can't even give it away.
