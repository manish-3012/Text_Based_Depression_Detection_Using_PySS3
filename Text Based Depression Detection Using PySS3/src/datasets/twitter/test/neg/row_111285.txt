Will swallow my pills later. Can't stand it anymore. 22FI am literally unlovable. I havent anobody irl and if I die nobody cares. The people who are kind to me do that only to cheer my depressed ass up. I am ugly, fat, and have the body of a 70yo woman. Basically I am doomed to be lonely. Who could ever really live such and ugly piece of trash? I don't consider myself a woman. Women are pretty and have value. I dont. Literally. I am tired to hear "you are worthy, you aren't alone" because it isn't true. My life sucks. My past is made of constant bullying and marginalization, my present is empty, is made of depression, anxiety, bulimia nervosa, self hate, suicidal thoughts and loneliness. I have literally no reason to keep going on. Goodbye
