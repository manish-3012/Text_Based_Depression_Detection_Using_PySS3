At What Point Should You Seek Professional Help And To What Degrees?Basically I'm just hitting a low point in my life where a lot of small hostility just breaks me down too much to the point of crying, cutting, and suicidal thoughts. This is probably the second time this month I've had a similar breakdown, there was one more but I didn't cut so I won't count it. I want to know when I really should seek out help from a professional, or what I should expect when I do to certain sources, so I've never called suicide hotline because I know I would be akward on the phone
