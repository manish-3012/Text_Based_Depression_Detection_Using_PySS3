The only reason I'm still alive...(Contain slurs)

Basically I've been a good student until the 7th grade, after that it's been a downhill, I realized what I want to do with my life; adventure and actually f###ing live, instead of waking up at 6am, go to school at 7, get back at 3pm, study until 5pm, cry in my bed with the excuse that I'm napping, "waking up" at 6pm, eat for the first time in the day, watch TV sit on my butt and then repeat, I'm in 10th grade, I wake up EVERYDAY in the morning and the first thing I think about is "I want to suicide today", while I'm preparing myself for school I plan out how I'm gnna jump on the road infront of a truck because it's the easiest way to go out, seems painless, but then realize I want to do shit in my life, and not be a f###ing whining little bitch, the only thing that's been keeping me alive, is faith, faith in myself and in my future, faith in my personallity, not faith in any god, the only reason I'm not dead is because I want to live out my dreams, yet they seem so far away, we are sold the idea that school gives us jobs, yet... the way I see my future doesn't include academics in it, but no, I'm just a dumb whining kid that's dreaming, I think to myself.

I tried to talk to the school counselor, but she thinks that it's because my father left me and it will pass, even though that's not the reason, I don't give a single shit about my father, never even truly talked to him, used to see him for an hour a day, which was spent smoking.

Honestly, I'm scared for my life, only thing keeping me alive.. as I said, is faith in my future, I'm scared that one day I'll lose all the faith, and I would have nothing left to live for, I want to finish this, but I also want to live as myself.
