Need to just forget itIM tired of feeling like shit even single day ........  I just want a daddy  being abdl has been a curse even since i found it i Just want someone to love someone to finally be at my side .... to help me with theses damn demons I donâ€™t want to fall to them but with an abusive home locked down like a prisoner and losing  battle ... ... I just donâ€™t know if I can continue man ... Idk ... I gotta for my autistic brother but thatâ€™s all that makes me get up ... itâ€™s why I donâ€™t jump ... even though taking care of em pushes me to the edge  I keep in fighting  and with drunken fighting absuive language to me and family and just pain everyday from a so called family that cares .... it becomes to much ... I live in a broken home basically the US Government.....a world where itâ€™s shit but I canâ€™t do much about it cause the majority doesnâ€™t see problems.....I just canâ€™t ... everything doesnâ€™t want me to win ... but I still get up .. so why havenâ€™t I seen progress in my life ... I thought after 13 years of abuse and drugs I would finally get my happy ending.

I forget tho again Iâ€™m not important people are dying and people  need help... I need to just understand that I have to shut up and clock out
