I can't stop thinking of ending it all...Through my life I've had issues with anxiety and depression do to my up bringing. I'm  now 30 years old, turning 31 on Feb. I dropped out of community college and moved to NY when I was 25 working as a concierge. I was hoping by the time I got to 30, I would have some sort of idea of what I want to do with my life, and that I would change enough to get my ass up and make something out of myself. Now, do to the Pandemic, I lost my job, and I had to move back into my parents place.  I've been living there since the pandemic had started. 

 As I stayed there my mental heath worsened. I don't believe that I am meant for this world, everyone around, including my siblings, are still able to work and make a living. My younger sister is currently making moves to close on a new house, My older brother is an attorney and helping his wife get her baking business off the ground. My older sister is not doing as well as them, but she still manages to find work and is living with her boyfriend. I feel like I am a tremendous burden on my family and friends.  They all still show love and support, except my father. My father as always been an angry man and his disappointment in me only grows, and I sense my brother is getting tired of me as well. 

My best friend had a pretty good paying job but he also lost it do to the Pandemic. With the money he saved up, he decided to travel west to find him self. He knew what staying at my parents house was doing to my mental state and convinced me to fly out and join him mid November. He thinks it would help me break out of this mental state and perhaps find myself. I'm here now trying to create a routine that will change my state of mind. We meditate, make goals to reach, exercise, and take breaks by camping out in nature. Some days I feel okay, but every morning is the same. I wake up immediately filled with anxiety and depression. I meditate to try and see that these are just negative thoughts and they don't make who I am. It's very very difficult. I can also see that my friend is getting tired of my behavior.

  I'm left with the feeling that I am not like everyone around me. I wouldn't be able to survive on my own. Every job I got was from help of my parents, and I was fired from most of them. The only reason I end up traveling is due to my best friend convincing me to go and he would cover most expenses. I always need saving, I always need someone to do something for me. I never know what is the right thing to do. I enjoy art (story boarding/ character design) and comedy, two professions that require a lot of effort and time and I'm already 31, I feel hopeless to achieve such goals.  I am the dead beat brother in every tv show or movie. I am PATHETIC!!!  

Everyday I have thoughts to end it all. I spend hours thinking on how I would do it, what's the most painless way to go. The only thing that's honestly keeping me from doing it is that it would literally destroy my family. I've started writing notes, but I know nothing I can say would help my family if I'm gone. I almost wish I had shitty family so this would be easier but I know to have such a support system is a blessing and I remined myself that I am lucky to have them. I feel stuck in misery. I realize that they're people out there that are much worse off, but that doesn't make me feel any better. Almost every experience I have, I feel numb and my best friend sometimes is surprised that I have no reaction to some of the things we see and I agree with him. I should have more appreciation for life, but I just don't.
