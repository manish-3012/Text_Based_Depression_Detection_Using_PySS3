Been on my mind for too long, I donâ€™t know where to turn. Dealing with my mom has taking too much of a toll on me. (16)The last few days have had me on edge more than I have been for a few months. Reason being is that Iâ€™m currently going through withdrawals. I can admit that I have a psychological addiction to weed. I started smoking about two years ago, when I was 14 (16 now), because my momâ€™s boyfriend at the time had it all over our house. Both of them simply encouraged me to be into the whole â€œstoner cultureâ€ I guess and so was allowed to smoke. Being that I felt like it helped with anxiety, my mom would constantly buy it for me up until the last few days, where she had told me she was going to buy it, but then our money â€œdisappearedâ€, again, like Iâ€™ve been told more times then I can count within the past few months.
Living with her and her new boyfriend hasnâ€™t been too good. Everytime she gets a new boyfriend, she ignores me quite often, ignores her share of responsibilities around the house. I want to be honest in saying that I feel I have the most clean room in the house, which by my standards, I still feel is gross, but nonetheless her spaces are extremely messy, unorganized, and disgusting. I donâ€™t feel as if Iâ€™m asking too much by not wanting food left out and sitting overnight.
Itâ€™s extremely hard to talk to her, and our bond seems like it fades away all the time. I canâ€™t stand her at this point. Iâ€™ve dealt with too much shit from things that she has put us through. Dating drug addicts and letting them steal her wages, my child support money from my father, selling our stuff to support them. Iâ€™ve saved her ex boyfriend from an fentanyl overdose once when I was younger. Her ex before her current boyfriend overdosed too while in $1000+ debt to us which would have paid our rent, but we had to skip so of course we had our shitty slumlord corp. try to shove eviction notices down our throat until she almost declared bankruptcy. Weâ€™re by no means rich, but weâ€™re also by no means â€œpoorâ€. Or at least, poor enough where clothes and food shouldnâ€™t be skipped. Except for, the latter of the two all the time. It gets down to -15C currently, and as the weeks go on, that temperature can drop to -30C at times. Still no winter boots though, no winter jacket. Just my spring jacket. But when I ask for what Iâ€™d consider essentials, she gets mad, yells, tells me Iâ€™m asking for too much and that I need to have patience. Conservatively Iâ€™d say she breaks her word about 60% of the time with me. I canâ€™t trust her, and especially with our financial issues caused by her exes (which I now feel is just an excuse), I lack trust in her.
Dealing with her as much as I have to makes me completely angry. But Iâ€™m stuck. I already have problems controlling my emotions and anger, and have since I was a kid, but this amplifies it to a whole new level. The only validation I get from her is about my grades, because straight 90%s or whatever. Doesnâ€™t mean shit to me anymore considering if I was so â€œsmartâ€ like she wants to tell me, then maybe Iâ€™d be listened to for once.
I keep having violent thoughts and outbursts that I mainly keep to myself. I own a 22 rifle, I have hollow point rounds that I store. Iâ€™d give a rough estimate as to around 20 separate occasions within the past 30 days in which I have thought of killing myself. Not all with my gun, but about half. Some are more violent when  my mood dictates (drinking chemicals, lighting myself on fire, etc). With how things have been recently, the idea becomes way more appealing. I only have a few good things to live for. My girlfriend, my best friends, and my dad and his family which I only see 3&lt; times a year due to 400km+ distance. I want to stick around for them, but I donâ€™t know what to do. I have the option to live with my father, and I know he has a lot of issues too, but being around him actually gives me the sense that Iâ€™m cared for. Thing is, I donâ€™t want to leave behind my friends and girlfriend here, and where I live currently offers a good university in which I plan to go to, but Iâ€™d be stuck living here for 5 years or so. I really feel as if one of these days when dark thoughts come, Iâ€™m going to muster up the courage and off myself. I donâ€™t want to in a normal state of mind, but given impulsiveness, who knows. I want to seek therapy but when I ask itâ€™s chalked up to â€œuse the kids help line or online etc...â€. I canâ€™t talk to a screen for support. I need face to face. I want a proper therapist or counselling, but my mom says itâ€™s too expensive, even though I believe itâ€™s covered by govt. health insurance.
I canâ€™t say Iâ€™m completely innocent, but fuck, I just need something to do, anything to make this time a lot easier.
