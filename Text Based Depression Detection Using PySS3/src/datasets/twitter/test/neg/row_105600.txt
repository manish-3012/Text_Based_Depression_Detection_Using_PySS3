My friend wants to kill a police officer and get shotMy friend is an alcoholic and stopped drinking for two years because he ended up having a fatty liver. Since then life has been a struggle for him and he can't find happiness in anything.

He was arrested last night and put in detox. He says he wasn't drunk at the time and insists on it, but said he got drunk after because he was so mad.

He feels like he was wronged (he says he told the cop he didn't need to show ID and that he was arrested for that) and now wants to kill the police officer and himself because it was at his neices recital and he was wronged and embarrassed.

I asked for him to go to inpatient therapy. But he refuses. What are my options. He seems manic and when he starts drinking gets crazy. He's been my best friend forever but I have no idea how to help as I am four hours away. I don't know what to do.
