I'm not wellI'm not well is my cry for help. The last time I used it I had been curled up on the floor crying in front of my chemicals. Mix them and i could final be free.

The last time I used it, I had been crying on the couch for a week straight. I hadn't eaten anything and was waiting on me chemicals to arrive by mail. They had accidentally messed up my order and it wasn't initially processed so I had to fix that shipping issue and it was on the way again. I fully intended to mix them the day it came in. Instead my best friend got through to me the day before it arrived. I cried on her so hard. She stayed at my home to receive it the next day and along with the ones i already had, dispose of them... I've since reordered both and have had them since my birthday last year.

The last time I used it, I was supposed to go with my best friend to play boardgames at a monthly gathering. I was hurting bad and choose to isolate and self harm instead so i flaked on our plans. I started drinking heavily. I wanted to feel something different than the pain I was dealing with. I threw myself into gaming and kept going back for more shots of rumpleminze and whiskey. I wanted to hurt myself but wanted also trying to distract myself from thoughts feelings and even the inclination is self harm. well I quickly became way to drunk to play the game any longer. So i turned on Netflix and started stress cleaning my home. The show ozarks was playing. I started taking swigs of the bottle ever time i passed the fridge. Sitting on the couch, I started becoming overly dizzy and woozy. That's when I texted my friends that i wasn't well. I say and cried with no reply for awhile after all they were busy. I cried so much and decided that I was done. I finished the bottle of what was left of the rumple minz. I blacked out. I briefly woke up, i was laying in my shed on the floor. I couldn't move. I accepted the peacefulness of the moment and the silence in the shed. I still couldn't move no matter how hard i tried to concentrate. I accepted that this was a good death, a peaceful one. So I closed my eyes and let go of everything. The next thing i know my friend is holding me crying and i start vomiting. I started crying "why"over and over again. They got the neighbor to help carry me to their car. They were talking me to the hospital. I begged and convinced them not to. They didn't know it was an attempt. When they arrived, they found my indoor cat outside freaking out. There was glass broken in the kitchen and the back door was wide open. They searched for me through the house before checking the shed. They nursed me back on tons of water eventually progressing to so many rally fries and sweet tea. The next day I'm at work as if nothing happened, They cried in the yard staring at the shed.

This time... I'm struggling. I want to sink, I want to drown in my sorrow and pain. I don't want to struggle as I go down and instead I want to find my peace that was taken from me in the shed. I've been chasing after that sense of calm acceptance ever since. I'm calm now. I'm laying on my couch, tears drying on my cheeks as my cat lays in my lap and music playing on my Google home. I want to leave and I deserve rest from the horrors in my life don't I? I just wish to be understood. To leave some sort of words behind so that someone out there could sympathize with how hard I've tried. How many times I've cried out for help that I'm not doing well. How much I hurt and how tired I am... Fresh tears again... I'm tired of writing and my mind is back to my chemicals in my closet. I'm tired, I'm ready for peace.
