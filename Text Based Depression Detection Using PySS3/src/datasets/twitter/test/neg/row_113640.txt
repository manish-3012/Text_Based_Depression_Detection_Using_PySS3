F**k schoolAll I care about is the money, I dont give a crap about grades, if it can't land me good money whats the point? I seriously don't understand life. 

6hours of BS and screw asian parents. No wonder people want to die, push your kids hard thinking your a future source of income? I don't mind paying for your coffin, but anything else f**k no. 

realistically im going to drop all my other classes and just meet grad requirements. Then try a trade school.
