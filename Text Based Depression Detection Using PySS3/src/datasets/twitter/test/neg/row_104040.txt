Im doneIm just here to see if anybody would still care about me. It's not that i have no friends its just because i dont have anyone pour all my emotional shit out. Not even my mom. So last year (i'll be frank) my mom found out that i have taken weed in form of a brownie from one of my classmates I only did it out of curiosity. She says that she was dissapointed and who wouldnt be. The teachers dont know. This year im almost graduating highschool and i ended up being classmates with the guy who gave me the shit. I didnt even tell my mom the truth about how it happened. I told her that i spat it out in the bathroom. So this year i end up being classmates with him again and my mom wants to change my class section but doing so would inform the faculty about drugs in our batch and sure enough my name would turn up and be kicked out. I know it's my fault and right now i'd rather die than face this problem. Every night i wish that i would just go away already. So far my younger brother has been my mom's favorite and i've been the disgrace to the whole family. I have no where to go.
