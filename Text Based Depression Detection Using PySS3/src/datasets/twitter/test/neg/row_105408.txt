No clue what I'm doing anymoreI don't know what life is supposed to be. It looks like a mess from where I'm standing. I can't see where others get the joy and the drive from. It looks broken to me, and I know I too am broken.

The past few weeks I've just been wasting time, watching movies I've had on my list for forever, finishing a book. I'm not going to university or have a job, I can sit on my ass and die eventually if I like, I get money for being broken anyways. I don't take joy in that. Nor in anything.

I thought I wasn't depressed anymore. I'm nearing mid 20's, somehow. Now I'm not upset at how old I've become so quick, but rather how the world becomes less recognisable every year and I still feel like I'm 14 years old inside and just as confused despite all I've learned.

The whole world makes me sad and how is that supposed to be fixed? I don't want friends, I don't want nice things to help fix me, I need to be alone. But if I'm alone and nothing happens to me, how am I ever supposed to change?

How does an idealist deal with such a huge disappointment? It's not like I can mend the way life works. I can't lift it up and make it all better. I can't fix myself. I don't know what this existence is supposed to be but it just makes me hurt whenever I'm not numb.
