I don't know where to go or what to do.Man. So I moved into this place about a month ago and things were fine. I am not a super social person but I am pushing myself so I don't come off as rude. I have an elderly animal who is having some troubles adjusting to the new environment so they need some help. I am trying my hardest to make sure I am meeting my roommate demands and my animals but for some reason it has just gone off the rails. This weekend I was gone from home and received an angry text Friday. Apparently my animal smelled terrible and needed to be taken care of (keep in mind she stays in my room and does not walk around the house. Meanwhile my roommate has a dog that shits and pees everywhere, you can't even walk in the back yard and the living room carpet has smelled like pet urine far before I got here.). But no big deal. I will come home and fix it. So I did, and left again. I understand people who are not used to particular animals being frustrated about what goes along with them, and I don't expect anyone to understand everything. So fast-forward to this morning. I walk into my room and it is torn to hell. Apparently my roommates said the animal had clearly urinated and threw-up on everything in my room and it was a problem (they decided to shut the door so my animal must have been in here unable to access the bathroom and must have been scared). They clean the room and then today are now talking to me about moving out. It feels very sudden and I am SURE I seem like a total asshole but I am not too sure what to do. I'm just anxious and I feel bad because I don't want to come off as an asshole but I also am frustrated because no one seemed to tell me it was a problem until it was too late. And this is happening on top of tons of other things in my life that are just making everything else go down hill. I don't have the money or the credit to do anything and I just feel incredibly trapped and sad. More hopeless than I ever have. So here we are. Fuck me I guess.
