Difficulty starting a new yearObjectively 2018 was a really great year for me in terms of my uni studies, finding part-time work that was relevant to my degree, getting a raise at my first workplace and starting a relationship with a really wonderful guy. I've always been quite close with my family and have loving, supportive friends. There are a reasonable amount of people I care about and I know care for me too.

I know that I am living a life others may never get to experience and I am truly thankful for everything that's happened in 2018, and proud of myself for getting through all the challenges when I thought I couldn't. 

But I simply can't see myself starting a new year and having to go through everything again. I just can't. I can't formulate any clear goals to work towards for this year. I can't feel any drive or motivation. I can't see a future when I used to be able to, and every year feels more difficult to get through than the last, even though, objectively, I always seem to be moving onwards and upwards. I'll break my family and loved ones' hearts if I let them know about how I feel right now. 

How much easier would it be to leave all this behind if I weren't so attached to these people in my life? I feel trapped and just want to leave everything so I can be this little soul that flits about into everywhere and nowhere; that feels nothing and only observes what happens in this world.
