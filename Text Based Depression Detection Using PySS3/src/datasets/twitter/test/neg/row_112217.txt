I feel lostI'm so lost. Stuck. Anxious. I can't move on from anything. I lost a friend because I fucked it up...I'm barely talking to other friends. That was almost a year ago and I still cry about it. My motivation is in the negatives. I need to pick a major for college, but have no clue where to start. I have no interests or abilities to show for because social anxiety fucking sucks. I worry too much. I worry about becoming an adult...how many things I have to keep track of, how to keep a job, how to manage money, how to raise kids right. The only reason I'm here right now is because my dog is completely attached to me and I can't leave her. She means too much to me. I'm scared for the future. I have no idea what I'm going to do. I don't want to be in this world, just barely scraping through life...just waiting for the next paycheck. I wish I could stop time and just sit and think and figure out everything. 

I apologize for how messy this is, it's just my monologue that's been the source of all my anxiety. It's all that I think about now; what has been keeping me up at night,  Sometimes I think the quiet would be nice...just real peaceful and nothing to worry about.
