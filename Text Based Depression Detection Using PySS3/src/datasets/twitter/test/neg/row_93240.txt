Trauma memes are the only thing keeping me going.Shout out to r/CPTSDmemes for the laughs. Man, I dunno. Life is so hard, I feel in over my head living it. I've been in therapy for so long, I've tried so much to be better. I've opened up to people, something I never thought I'd do. But I'm still just sad and empty most of the time. If it weren't for the memes, I wouldn't have known anyone else is struggling like meâ€”to be around, to be okay.
