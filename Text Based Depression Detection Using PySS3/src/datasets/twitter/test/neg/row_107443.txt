Committing Suicide at 17. This is it. I just wish I could have seen this coming sooner.

I just created this account and post just in case my parents will want to further investigate my death. Mom and dad...... I'm sorry. Even though I don't really like you two, I can't imagine how painful this is going to be for you. But, I don't live for others' satisfaction. I despise this world and my life, even myself. It's finally over. 

Goodbye.
