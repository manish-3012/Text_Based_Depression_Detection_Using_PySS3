Never posted before but I need to say this allI'm 18, I've struggled with my mental health sincei was 8, my dad was an alcoholic (he's 4 years dry now), and it fucked me up real bad.
He's also schizophrenic and I may be too
Today, in about 6 hours, I have a psychiatrists appointment because I have been suicidal for 3 weeks and am very close to acting on those Feelings. Im feeing OK at the moment, and have insight into my situation, but I can feel that slipping, I know my behaviour has been erratic and irrational, I know I'm probably delusional and paranoid but I also know that I am definitely being stalked. I'm so scared for my own safety and so desperate for help.
I've been hospitalised once for a suicide attempt, I was 13 and I spent 6 weeks on a psych ward, it wasn't too bad, but I know adult services are worse. I'm scared that my psych will take one look at me and my situation and admit me before I can attempt anything, I feel the need to try and end my life now, but I don't want my mom to find me, I have a 5 year old sister who wouldn't understand, my partner would be broken, and my dad may start drinking again. I'm so scared of that, but I'm also scared of hospital
I guess I really needed to get this out of my system, I can't vent to anyone else cus I don't wanna worry them, I probably won't attempt, so there's that I guess.
