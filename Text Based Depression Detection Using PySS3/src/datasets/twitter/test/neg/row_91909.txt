I've wanted to die from impulse since I was little.I'm 27 and have had suicidal thoughts and impulses for about 18 or 17 years. I have these sudden bursts of overwhelming desire to die at the spur of the moment that are overwhelming at times like,

I'll be sitting in the passenger seat of a car and have to stop myself from opening the door and jumping out on the highway.

Jumping into a wild animal exhibit at the zoo.
Plunging a knife into my chest that I'm holding in my hand

And I try to put myself into situations where I can die without it being technical suicide I think.

An example i have is about 2 years ago when I was walking home from work late at night I saw this guy who was breaking into a van, I yelled at him and he pulled out a gun and instead of me running away I just sprinted towards him swearing and telling him if you shoot you better not miss and than he just started running. I caught up to him and slamed his head into the asphalt and called the police

Too this day I keep thinking about that night and I wish he just pulled the trigger I don't even care that I caught the guy to be honest I just wanted him to end it.
I find myself looking for moments like that again but I'm just never around during the crime and I live in a pretty low crime area town.

My question is do i have some kind of mental illness? Idk if there are even meds or therapy that is designed to help with these thoughts or action?
Do you know anything about these tendencies any input would be appreciated.
