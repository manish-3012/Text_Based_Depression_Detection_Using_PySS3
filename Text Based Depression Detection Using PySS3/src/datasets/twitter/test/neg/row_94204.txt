It's only 30$ to Uber to the Golden gate bridgeI could even spring for Uber comfort or Uber black. Not like my bank account will matter after this. Fatality rate is pretty high going off the bridge, very low chance I'll live too. It's as simple as stepping out of the car and stepping off the bridge, and I'll even know the time I will arrive. I've been staring at my phone screen and thinking "I could die in like half an hour, neat."

I really curse myself for going out with my current girlfriend. Just so you know, I'm an emotional black hole from having suffered so much, and so I latch onto nice vulnerable girls like my girlfriend and make them feel bad for me and close to me and then I leave them. Now I'm doing that but killing myself too. 

Oh, she'll be devastated if I kill myself. I lied enough to her so she likes me quite a lot. Thinking of how sad she'll be is really what's even kept me around. I remember when I was having a big suicidal stint last year, my suicidal brain hated her because her kindness and how bad she'd feel was the only thing stopping me. Anyway, no way she could deal with it, and I'm sure the university will destroy her since it's awful and loves stepping on people who are down on their luck. I could wait until her graduation but that's kinda far.

I want to do it so bad. I hate how I chose her, I was lonely and she was cute. We ended up having a great relationship, but it can't be great consistently because of who I am, and I can't change it no matter how hard I try. The longer I'm with her, the more I set her up for failure and waste more of her time. 

Recently I got really high and thought about a girl from work I could never have. I feel shame and hatred of myself really deep in me for doing that. If you knew my girlfriend you'd hate me too, because she's a saint. I can't tell if it's my suicidal brain trying to get me to break up with her so I can cut off all loose ends when I die, or if I actually want to break up with her. The suicidal brain makes me so certain right now that it's just because I want the relationship to be over, but I know even months ago I didn't believe that. Who knows. 

My head's so fucked. So fucked right nowm I'm so scared and I'm so fucking alone. I seriously want to know what the point of living is because I've only noticed it's a when lot of pain and suffering on my end. Oh boy have I wanted to kill myself recently. It's all I can think about. 

I don't really want to work until I die. Maybe I could just quit today, break up with her in the morning. Kinda just waste away in my room for a couple months using my savings, send her whatever money I can and make sure she's OK. Then, after finals, peace out. I guess I could do that. 

The nice thing is I see it happening. I can't force myself to Uber to the bridge now, but its easy to just quit my job, (slightly) easier to just break up with my gf with some excuse that will make her hate me. That's what I did with my ex, might as well repeat the cycle. I absolutely should die. 

God why did you put me on this planet? Why did you make me so alone? Why did you make me so guilty, why did you make me so fucked up. What's the point of making me sentient just so I can suffer?? It's not fucking fair I should be able to choose if I want to die. I should be able to choose. The only thing I should be concerned about when wanting to die is how I feel about it I'm so sick of people saying they'll be sad if I do it. I know it's my fucking fault you like me and I'm sorry I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry baby I can't do it. Something about my life was wrong from the start, could've been watching my dad die, being who I am which got me bullied, my mom not caring about me not having a real family its been fucked from day 1 and who cares if I've been privileged economically. I've bought most of the things I want and guess what I want to die. And it makes me feel even guiltier knowing my economic privilege. What is the point of me suffering and trying man.
