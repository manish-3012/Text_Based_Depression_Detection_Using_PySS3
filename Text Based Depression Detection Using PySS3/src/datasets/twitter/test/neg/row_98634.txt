i feel like i am on a conveyor belt running away from inevitable deathi feel like we are on conveyor belts going through time leading us to the end but my conveyor belt is going so much faster and ive already reached the end now im just running backwards against time. and it would be so much easier to just let go and die.

 it feels like everything was supposed to end at some point in the past and im not supposed to be here anymore and im just clinging onto to life but my story is supposed to be over. i cant see a future and i dont really want one. its more exhausting to stay alive.

sorry.
