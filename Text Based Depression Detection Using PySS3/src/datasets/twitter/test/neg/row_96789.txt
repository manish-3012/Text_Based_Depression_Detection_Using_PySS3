I want to die alreadyI'm such worthless trash. Both of my jobs have threatened to fire me recently (had to take time off for mental health reasons) and I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone (I know my parents would tell me I'm worthless and pathetic). I keep trying to kill myself but keep failing.  Sucks to fail at both living and dying.
