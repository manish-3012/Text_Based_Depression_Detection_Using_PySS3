What Should I Donate my Money to Before I Kill Myself?I haven't decided when or if I'll go through with it. But I'd like to make a Will here soon that says my money will go towards X charity when I die.

I'd like something mental health related. Maybe even just something targeting the stigma around mental health. I've met one person in my entire life that I felt I could talk to about wanting to kill myself. I know I was lucky to even have her because a lot of people don't meet anyone they feel they can open up to.

Anyone else in my life I could talk to it would either fuck up my life by having me committed, or forever changing their opinion of me. And it makes it impossible to make my death look like an accident, so it would fuck up whoever I told if I went through with it too.

I know good treatments aren't readily available, but I don't think I have enough saved to really make a difference in that way. 

Ideas are welcome, I'm open to anything at this point.
