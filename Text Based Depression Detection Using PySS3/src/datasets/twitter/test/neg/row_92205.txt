Man..I just blocked everyone. Now I have no one. I just donâ€™t see the point of talking to people if Iâ€™m just going to lose them. They donâ€™t respond. Then when I get mad they act like itâ€™s not a big deal even though it is. They knew how I felt about that, I told them that. But nope. It still happens. I just donâ€™t know what to feel anymore. I donâ€™t even know what to say anymore. Iâ€™ve let out so much anger and frustration Iâ€™m just speechless now. Despite me making this long post, but I digress. Fuck everyone. Fuck everyone who thinks their different, yada yada yada. You know the rest. Iâ€™m killing myself goodbye
