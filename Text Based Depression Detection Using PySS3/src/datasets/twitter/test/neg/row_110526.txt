What's the point?What's the point to live when I make people sad or mad at me? When it's always my fault? When I always mess things up?

  
I always tell myself I have to suck it up, it's my fault, I am wrong, I have to change. 

I just think everyone who knows me will be better off without me and I will be forgotten easily.   
So what's the point of even living when thinking constantly of suicide?
