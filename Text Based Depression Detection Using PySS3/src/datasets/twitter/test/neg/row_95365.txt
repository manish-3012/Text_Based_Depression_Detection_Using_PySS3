weird coincidencewhat an odd coincidence.  Have been planning on ending things depending on how my legal issues pans out and tonight my dad gave me a book to read about a woman who attempts suicide. no one knows about my legal problem or suicide plans so thought that was odd. we hardly ever have traded books to read.  I'll read it as it looks decent. guess I'll have to add the to the note if I go that route so he doesn't think he was the catalyzer for my end.
