I'm running away (maybe I'll die too???)I'm 22 years old and I'm running away! I guess I'm not committing suicide, but If I die in a foreign city, I guess I'm fine with that?

I'm almost finished with my Bachelors, and I fucking hate every second of it. Sure I like the field, I guess??? But I'm just so burnt out. Maybe I'll finish it :O it's all online. Hopefully with a change of scene (preferably an ocean view) I'll be more motivated?

I just have to get away from it all. My family nagged to quit my side hustle or they'd take my car away. So there I was, jobless for a few months eating into my savings, only to land on a job where even though the high rates are higher, it pales in comparison to what I used to make. in fact now my parents are saying "well just go back to your side hustle"

I have a so called girlfriend, but she barely wants to hang out, leaving me all alone to just fester by myself with my thoughts. She's the cutest thing in the world, and I love her to death, but shes the only person I have, and the only one to give me a second glance. It hurts when she ignores me. 

My ex-best friend ended up to be a fake soulless scumbag, and really he deserves no more than this sentence dedicated to how cruel he is.

I hate living here, there's no jobs, no one appreciates me, and I'm just tiered of being used. I'm tired of just sitting here festering, tiered of being sad, and not good enough. I'm leaving.
