Stimulus check to fund my deathThe recent economic relief stimulus check has given me enough money to kill myself peacefully and painlessly. Iâ€™m not going to list what method or what items I could buy, for fear of someone using my plan on themselves when they havenâ€™t thought it through as much as I have. Iâ€™ve been severely depressed and suicidal for 6 years, and suffer from generalized anxiety, social anxiety, and severe social awkwardness and fear of intimacy. Why shouldnâ€™t I end it all with the stimulus money?
