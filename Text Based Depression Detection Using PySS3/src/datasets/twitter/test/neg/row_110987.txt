Distraught on whether to kill myself or notI'm gonna preface this by saying that I don't want people commenting just to say "you have so much to live for" bc I've heard it enough and I'm not here to have my opinion/idea swayed.

Ok so I've been contemplating suicide for a while now. I'm not gonna go into details as to why but I'd like readers to know that I'm a teenager and I live with my family, so yes my suicide would have an immediate effect on people.

I don't truly know if I want to do it, but I've started thinking about it so much that I feel I have only two options; go through with it when my closest friends are in California w/o me, or see someone so I can get hospitalized. I haven't self-harmed in a while, but I don't want to start again soon because I know that I'll feel like my decision will have been made the second I cut.
