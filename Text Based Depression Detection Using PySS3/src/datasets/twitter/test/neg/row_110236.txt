I wish my loved ones could understand that death is not always bad...I canâ€™t commit suicide, despite that would make things easier.

Iâ€™m a failure. My death would be the best thing I could do for my family, except... guilt.

My wife would feel guilty, because she couldnâ€™t save me, or think that sheâ€™s the cause. My children could think itâ€™s their fault. I worry that it could hurt them immeasurably, because of guilt. Theyâ€™re the reason Iâ€™m still here, they could never be the cause. I just want the pain to stop. I just want to stop hurting and causing difficulties for the ones I love. I force my family from being able to live a normal life with normal social circles, because Iâ€™m so damaged, I have difficulty connecting with other due to severe anxiety. I hate myself, because Iâ€™m so uncomfortable at any school events that I canâ€™t enjoy my daughtersâ€™ successes and spend the time tucked away in a corner just waiting to leave. My family sacrifices so much, because of me. Iâ€™ve been unable to hold steady work over the last few years, because of hospitalizations and anxiety that we are barely able to make ends meet. With all of that, they still love me. 

If they could understand, but until I find a way... Iâ€™m stuck being an anchor holding back the ones I love.
