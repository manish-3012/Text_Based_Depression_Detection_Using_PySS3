Years of suicidal thoughts becoming exponentially more frequent and tempting.. want help, don't know what to do?I've fantasized about suicide for years. I've always been one of those "if you aren't beautiful and perfect you're worthless" types. I struggled with an eating disorder and an amphetamine addiction in high school and after my weight and general mood have been a non stop rollercoaster. I tried killing myself a year ago and failed, which was crushing to say the least. On top of an embarrassment, it was silly and if anything made me feel worse. 

I've always stuffed these feelings away because I'm terrified of being labeled an "attention seeker." I dyed my hair in high school in a similar way a classmate did and was ultimately the copy cat attention whore, etc. I was never able to let it go. So I don't tell people how I feel. Not family, not friends, only the boyfriend because he never seems to take it that seriously, which I like. It makes me feel like I am being a dramatizer and that I'm not really suicidal. 

But lately I just can't do it. I began working inthe MR/DD field and am now surrounded by young women with behaviors who are constantly emotionally beating me down. They take a lot of medications and I've considered taking a lot to overdose during night shifts. I don't know. I'm working a night shift now with a new girl who ignores my every advance to engage in friendly conversation.. I'm texting all this because it hurts swallowing the impending bawww. 

To get to the point. I have health insurance and want to see a doctor or something, but my whole life doctors have treated me like I'm a hypochondriac(Sp) or something. I don't know what to say. I hate feeling stupid, and that's how I feel talking about this stuff. Stupid. Pathetic. Attention seeking. Dramatic. I feel like I make everyone's eyes roll. I wish I wasn't so afraid of the big sleep. I would just get it over with.. but sometimes when I drink I'm less afraid of all of that. And honestly, I want to be happy and live. I just don't know where to start.

Tl;DR: I'm suicidal, want to get help, too ashamed to get help, don't know where to start.
