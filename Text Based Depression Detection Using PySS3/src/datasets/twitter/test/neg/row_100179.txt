I hate myself and want to dieI've had inherited depression for my whole life but only recently have I really felt suicidal and I feel like I'm going to do it before Christmas.

I've fucked up my life so bad it would just be easier to kill myself than just wallow in this misery. I'm a relapsed heroin addict that lives with his parents, whom I've also stolen thousands from. Paying them back is the only reason I want to live but I am in so much pain and so ashamed I don't even want to be seen. I also have thousands in debt on 3 credit cards.

My girlfriend that I relapsed with was someone very special to me, I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with her but she dumped me a week ago because she decided she wants to be single. I told her since we're both trying to quit heroin we could help each other but she wants no part of me. She was the only person I had to talk to, I have no friends besides her anymore.

It seems so like such a better option to grab the rifle from upstairs, drive into the woods, and shoot myself than wallow through the pile of shit that is my life.
