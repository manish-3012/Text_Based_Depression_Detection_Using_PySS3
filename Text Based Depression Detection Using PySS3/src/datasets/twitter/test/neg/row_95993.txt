This may be my suicide letter.A couple of days ago I got a girlfriend, before I even told her yes, I knew there was a possibility that she was just using me to hurt a friend of mine. But, like the idiot I am I said yes, today she confirmed my suspicions and told me she never liked me and called me a fag. I've thought about killing myself for a while now, even though the circumstances are different this is the second time this has happened. Tonight I might kill myself 80% chance if you read this thank you, and if I'm not here tomorrow, goodbye.
