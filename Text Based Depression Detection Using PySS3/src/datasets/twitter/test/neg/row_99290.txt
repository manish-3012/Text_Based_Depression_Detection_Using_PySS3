I either want it to be over with, or I want things to go right for me for onceQuit job tail end of march to go to school. Live off savings, sell things to lengthen ability to live without income. Do poorly in school for no other reason than being a stupid bitch. 4 more classes. Bike is the only way to get to school, because it starts earlier than the buses run. Of course. 

1 bike has 2 flats in 2 days. 2nd day (yesterday) flat wound up bubbling through the sidewall so the whole tire is fucked. Miss class. Missing class hours means I won't get special cert. Will still get basic cert. Trying to get bike 2 ready to go. Had been poaching parts off bike 2 to keep bike 1 going. Been all morning. 4 hours. Been trying to get the rack off bike 1 on to bike 2. Certain work arounds because bike 2 is very old. 

Who is so stupid that they can't install a bike rack. No one else in the world is this stupid. At what point does an animal become so stupid that they can't manage breathing? And how close am I to that point? 

So angry and frustrated, resorted to self harm again. first time in years, yay! Did with wrench because that's what I had in hand. Now have stupid fucking bruises on legs. Lump on scalp. Said how fucking stupid I am, what a worthless fucking bitch!! What a waste of resources!!! Food I eat, water I drink. Could go to someone who's not such a dumb ass. And I know my neighbor heard because I can hear him sneeze sometimes. Maybe I'll get a wellness checkup lmao.

Everything piles up! It's just more and more and more! I can't catch a fucking break! I just want something to fucking work out for me for ONCE IN MY FUCKING LIFE I JUST WANT SOMETHIN TO  FUCKING WORK!!!!!!! THAT'S IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have an appointment with my psych in 30 minutes and I have no way to get there. Funny thing is, I was supposed to talk about healthier coping methods. LOL. 

Don't have a plan. Attempted before, and obviously failed at that, like I have failed at everything else in life. Too stupid for a successful suicide!
