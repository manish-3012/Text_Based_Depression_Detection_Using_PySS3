Impulsive suicideI had a horrible night, was driving home and sobbing the whole time. So many thoughts were racing through my mind. It would have been so easy to just drive into a brick wall, I considered it every time I passed one. 

But I was scared of surviving. Probably of the pain as well. I used to consider car accident as one of my top ways to go but Iâ€™m so vain, I want to look pretty when Iâ€™m found. I knew someone who died in a car accident and the sight of their body haunted their parents. My looks are the one strength I have. 

I have such an uncontrollable temper with myself that Iâ€™m scared one day I really will just impulsively do it and be gone forever. I have to hurt myself somehow to get the rage to leave my system. I feel like Iâ€™ll never end up doing it for real.
