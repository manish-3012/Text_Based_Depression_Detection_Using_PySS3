Why am I even here? People donâ€™t even respond.I know Iâ€™ve helped people and made them happy but I just donâ€™t feel it anymore. I have nothing. Iâ€™ve lost everything except my cat. My friends suck and donâ€™t answer their phones hardly. Iâ€™m alone almost all the time even when I reach out to family they blow me off or donâ€™t answer. Iâ€™m not kidding I asked 5 different people to do something and they either declined or didnâ€™t respond. No one makes plans with me and this is the hardest year of my fucking life because my bf committed suicide last year and I have to pass all these dates without him and thereâ€™s no one there for me. Iâ€™m hanging by a strand. I feel bad for feeling this way because this was how he felt as well but I donâ€™t care thatâ€™s why I fell for him, he just got me... and now itâ€™s just me.
