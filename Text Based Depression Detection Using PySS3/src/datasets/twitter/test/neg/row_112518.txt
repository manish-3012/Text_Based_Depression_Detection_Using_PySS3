I want to die even when i feel okay. I just want to end.I've got every opportunity to live, and I don't want it. Even when i feel okay, I still think "I want to die now."

I give up. I don't want this opportunity to live. I want to not exist.

And I feel nothing but stupidity, shame, and guilt for it. 

i feel so stupid. i just want it to go away. i'm tired of fighting.
