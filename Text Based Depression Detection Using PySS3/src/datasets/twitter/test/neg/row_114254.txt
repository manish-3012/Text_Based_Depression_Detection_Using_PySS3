I know I wonâ€™t but I canâ€™t help but imagineme and my ex dated for 3 years, we broke up a little over a month ago. I thought I was doing okay getting over the breakup, trying to occupy myself with different thoughts. last night he came by to drop off something and ended up locking his car keys in his car. he asks to spend the night and ends up in my bed. morning after and we cuddle and talk all morning and then he has to leave. I feel useless, like my progress is in the trash, heâ€™s doing better by himself and Iâ€™ve been in a depression for over a month. he gets to continue his life happily satisfied while Iâ€™m laying here crying, wishing I could get a few more minutes of affection. I havenâ€™t self harmed in three years and now suddenly Iâ€™m having shitty thoughts imagining I just stopped existing
