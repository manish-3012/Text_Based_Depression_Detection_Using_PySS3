Canâ€™t sleep.Every night for hours the same thoughts fly through my head, quick, methods of dying. Gunshot to the head, neck breaking, my throat being slit deep. 

It wasnâ€™t long ago that I realised that thinking about death this much just isnâ€™t normal. These thoughts will never leave my head and I just want to be normal. 

I donâ€™t see a future for myself but donâ€™t have the strength to end it.
