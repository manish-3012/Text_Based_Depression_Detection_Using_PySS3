Cross Country Suicide TripHey everyone I'm a 25 year old female and you don't need to know my name.

I'm tired of living and would like to die, but first I'll be going on a road trip. Come along with me and I'll tell you some things about me and my life. 

I'll be leaving tonight as soon as I get back home but for now I'm stuck wandering my home city in my trusty truck. I can't go home right now because my dad isn't home and when he isn't home I'm not allowed to be home. He thinks I'll try to hack his computer or steal from him when he's not around. He does this because my older brother hacked his computer and stole from him. I've never stolen from my dad and I don't know how to hack but that doesn't matter. My brother's sins are my sins.

I'm currently in mid-Texas, I'll be going north. I can't stand the fucking heat anymore.
