Maybe It would be better If I kill myself now?I'm 22 year old male and I feel like nobody loves me anymore. I have been bullied for 10 years now. I also been cyberbullied a lot too. I feel like I'm been ignored by everyone. I have lost all hope. Maybe I should end this nightmare. Maybe people would be better off without me. All I can do is cry, Be depressed, Sad, scared and lonely. This SubReddit have recommended me to seek Help. But, I don't know who I talk to.
