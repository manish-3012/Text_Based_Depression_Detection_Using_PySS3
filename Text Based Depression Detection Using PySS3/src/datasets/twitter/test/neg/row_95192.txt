*Advil update* Thank-you everyone who's worried about me and messaged me, You have NO IDEA how much you have helped me this week.I'm okay. I really am, Everything is good physically now. I still feel a little sick, but not too bad. My organs are fine. Doc gave me a stern talk about how suicide is stupid. lol Doesn't change my mind about wanting to end my pain though. 

I still wish it worked. Nothing has changed, and it's not going to. Not for a long time. at least it feels that way. 

Thank-you everyone for your care and concern, it makes me feel connected in a big way. I'm sorry if i've missed anyone's comments or messages. I'm back to trying my best in everything I do. I will just try, and keep moving forward, one day, one hour, one moment at a time.
