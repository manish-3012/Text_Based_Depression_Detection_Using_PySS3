If I knew it would work, I would do itExactly what the title says... I donâ€™t really have anyone or anything else right now otherwise I wouldnâ€™t be posting this.. but Iâ€™m exhausted, completely and utterly exhausted. I have zero motivation and even when I am on zoom I just sob. I just wished that if I knew taking the bottle of clonidine would work.. that there wouldnâ€™t be any consequences.. I would do it. My life.. isnâ€™t that hard compared to other peopleâ€™s.. but it just feels like Iâ€™m fucked.. no matter what I do, no matter how well I was doing before.. I still always end up here. Itâ€™s a vicious endless cycle that I just desperately wish could be over. I shouldnâ€™t have to wish for a car accident because Iâ€™m too much of a coward to do it myself.. Iâ€™m just done.. thereâ€™s no other way to describe it than just... done
