Ran out of hopeBeen fighting to get my daughters free of my abusive ex-husband...I got one ruling of sexual abuse against him by CPS, but he bought an expensive attorney and sued them for over a year until they reversed it. Now I can't get them to investigate any abuse claims against him...my daughter had a broken foot that they ignored for 3 days...the other one came home with a bruise the length of her forearm....I can't get them to investigate, I can't afford to sue them...

My friends...when I started going down this road last night, the fear and the hopelessness and the misery....they all just ignored it. Ignored my emails, ignored my calls...I've always been there for them. I thought, I truly did, that I had relationships with these people. Apparently they never cared about me at all...I was a resource for them to use. 

I can't keep watching my children get hurt and being unable to help them. It's so horrible and cruel and miserable. I don't know why my friends don't love me...I don't understand anything and I'm lost. I'm lost.
