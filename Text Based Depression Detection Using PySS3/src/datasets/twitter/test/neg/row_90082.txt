I'm failing at life and I feel life nothing gets better from where i'm at.My best friend is an elitist asshole who gets everything he wants in life with ease and i'm sure i'm only his friend because he wants someone to show off the stuff he doesn't have to pay for. I'm working part time college student (failing as of now) and part time grocery bagger to pay off a car my parents dumped on me that i have to help pay for. My degree i'm in isn't as interesting as I thought and I was supposed to get off without debt and now it's starting to stack up since i'm failing and none of my life up until this point seems like it matters anymore. I'm still really young and i'm not sure what to do.
