People hate me because i am a loser.People look down on me because im "poor". They see me as lazy loser. They believe everyone can be middle class. But im tired of treated like a Piece of crap. Why do People treat my like shit because i am lower class? Am i really worthless because i have no Money? Because i have live off welfare and sometimes get bad Jobs but These are unskilled positions so they don't last Long. Should i feel ashamed to be poor? I jsut don't want to live anymore because most people just hate me and constant bully me. Should i kill myself?
