I'm here about to cry and I can't even tell my mom how bad I am anymore. Am 19FFirst of all, I am not open to talking over PM. Makes me fucking anxious idk why.

I have a bunch of mental bullshit and had to drop out of regular highschool and graduate using independent study. I failed out of community college.

Now, I know my dad is disappointed in me and doesn't like me. I don't like me either. I've been sleeping a lot lately and having a very hard time getting up, I just pass out again. I woke up to yelling. My dad was yelling to my mom how I'm so stupid for failing out of school, blaming me for all kinds of stuff. They don't know I heard. "She's trying!" My mom said, "WELL THATS NOT ENOUGH", my dad yelled. It's ok dad, I don't like me either. I know I'm not enough. 

My mom has mental bullshit too and me coming to her breaking down just makes her worse and my dad bitched at me for it and was on her side, so this is why I'm up in the dark refusing to let my worthless ass cry. 

Cutting doesn't help anymore. The next step is death, and I can feel myself getting close to it. I've tried and I can't even please my own dad, and I can't get my shit together. I'm surprised he hasn't kicked me out to the streets, but he has threatened. I won't be able to hold down a job and I don't want to be a waste of welfare or disability money.

I wish my mom had the baby she miscarried before me, instead of me. 

EDIT: comments are welcome, I may have caused a misunderstanding.
