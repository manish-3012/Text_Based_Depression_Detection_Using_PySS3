I'm too miserable to try to fix this again.Hi there, I've been lurking around for a long time, but I've never posted anything to Reddit, please excuse the formatting if I get it wrong.

This is the fourth time I'm going through anxiety and depression, and I'm 27. I don't want to do this again. I don't want to do the medication and therapy, and experience the shame and judging again. It started this time because of a co-worker bullying me, in a really back-handed sneaky way that no one has witnessed. I eventually told my other co-worker and team leader, both of whom think I'm going crazy, because the bully is pulling an "I don't know what she's talking about" act. I had an appointment with a psychologist last week, she was lovely and I have another appointment on Thursday, but she can't exactly hold my hand 24/7.

The easiest solution that I have to all this is to just end it. My work situation is only set to get worse now, and I can't see a point to continuing my life if every time I get better, some asshole sends me right back to this state again.
