I just tried hanging myself and failed. I donâ€™t know why.To start off with, Iâ€™m an empty shell of a person. Iâ€™m a teenager who went to a homophobic, right wing school where I never fit in. Now, Iâ€™m at community college where my only friends are people who I talk to through a screen. Iâ€™m a writer, but not a notable one. Iâ€™m an activist, but because of my parentâ€™s views I canâ€™t advocate for anything I believe in. I ended up on a major news channel for a protest I snuck to earlier this year and if my parents ever found out they would be furious. My mom doesnâ€™t let me dress how I like despite my 18th birthday being in less than five months. I spend my own money on clothes, and my mom throws every single outfit away until Iâ€™m stuck with raggedy tshirts and super gross leggings to wear everyday. 

So, anyways, today something just snapped in me. Iâ€™ve had depression on and off since I was 13. I thought it was better, but today I suddenly snapped and tried hanging myself in my closet. I was up for about 3 seconds, nearly blacking out, before my feet  grabbed onto a nearby shelf and I went down. My neck is still sore. 

I donâ€™t know what happened that led to this, but I think it was a conglomeration of things. My mom has always been emotionally abusive since she was raised by narcissists and took some of their parenting traits. A lot of things Iâ€™m unconscious about, like my skin picking and short height and gap teeth, my mom has always said weâ€™re the reason for HER stress and made her upset as if Iâ€™m supposed to be responsible for her health. During quarantine, this got to a breaking point. She would always try to shove her own political and social views on me, too. Sheâ€™s said extraordinarily racist, transphobic, homophobic, and mysoginitic shit in the past, including about people who I consider my friends. I guess this was exacerbated by being around her all the time, but it just got too much.

Also, if itâ€™s not clear Iâ€™ve been alone for a long time. My last girlfriend broke up with me in May and since then I havenâ€™t dated anyone. I mean Iâ€™m assuming most people havenâ€™t begun new relationships over quarantine, but Iâ€™m kinda used to being in one and the loneliness makes me feel empty.

Over quarantine, Iâ€™ve been mindlessly binge eating with little to no exercise. I donâ€™t know what happened, I used to be a xc runner. Today, I noticed stretch marks on my stomach from rapidly gaining weight. Fun.

I donâ€™t want to tell my parents what happened. I want to continue community college so nobody gets mad at me, stay silent, and not be a bother. but I also clearly need psychological help because there is no way for me to keep living like this.
