Emotionally drowningI don't think I can keep going.

I have multiple chronic physical illnesses that have left me on a Disability Support Pension (DSP). Throw in multiple mental health issues for more than half my life, and a history of chronic trauma.

I just... I don't know how to keep going. My GP and psychiatrist try to be helpful, but it doesn't seem like they understand at all.

I'm worn out. I don't want to keep living... it's just that, as yet, I haven't been brave enough to kill myself. I have a plan, a means, no specific time frame.

I feel like I'm emotionally drowning.

My physical health is not going to improve. I can't study, can only work 3-4 hours per week. I'm socially isolated because I'm generally too unwell to leave the house after pushing myself to work and see my psychiatrist.

This wasn't the life I wanted. I don't see it changing. There is no treatment for my illness. It isn't progressive, but there's no cure. 

I'm tired of living and I don't know what to do.
