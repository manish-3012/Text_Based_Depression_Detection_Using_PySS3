Not this againMy life feels like it's falling apart again. My friends moving, or judt not seeming to care. my family kept (by choice) at a far arms reach. I don't trust anyone who I have left and I feel like I have nowhere to turn. I don't know what to do anymore. I've been suicidal before and I think I'm headed that way again.
