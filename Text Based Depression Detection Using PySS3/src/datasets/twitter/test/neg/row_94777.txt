20 My parents are going out of townMy parents are going out of town until Tuesday and I think I might be finally ready to try and dispatch myself since Iâ€™ll have a couple days to get it right if the first time doesnâ€™t work out. I feel like this has always been inevitable. Other people I feel like can look into their futures and see something almost to the point where itâ€™s tangible for them. When I try to think about my future itâ€™s like a foggy white mist like thereâ€™s nothing there. I of course have things I want for my future, I have entire dreams and aspirations and things but I just donâ€™t think Im meant to get there. Hence the reason for the fog. Iâ€™ve always had the feeling that Iâ€™d die young and this past like 9 months have especially been hell and Iâ€™m losing my grip on the only good things left. My favorite artist put out a couple of singles this past week that put my state of mind deeper into this sad state. My hearts skips a beat when I think about doing it just out of excitement and eager anticipation. Iâ€™m ready to be free. Out of the black, into the blue, so to speak.
