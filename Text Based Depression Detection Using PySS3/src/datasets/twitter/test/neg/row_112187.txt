Don't know what to do anymoreI don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to put that strain on my girlfriend and family. Only reason I haven't. 

I don't have any friends best and only friend in my childhood moved after 6+ years our first year of middle school, his replacement left the following year. Isolated myself for the next 5 years until my junior year of high school. Meet who I thought would be my two best friends for the rest of my life. We had so much fun, did so much together. We were the three musketeers. Then they meet a new friend named Mary Jane, and let's just say I no longer speak to them.

I'm now a freshman in college(sorta) and have no one besides my girlfriend. She's great, don't get me wrong.  

I have no one, nobody cares about me, I'm the kid who's good with technology. I was known as the programming god in high school. It's the only thing I'm good at. I don't have friends, I have people who need things from me. I'm there for them, but they are no where to be found when the situation switches. Nobody talks to me, nobody texts me, nobody asks me how I'm doing, nobody wants to hang out with me. I'm so lonely and my life is so boring. I sit at home all do doing nothing. I don't even have the desire to game or program. The only two things my life consisted of up until now. I don't even get out of bed anymore. I've cried more now then I have my entire life. 

Now the big problem is college. I fucking hate it, I hate school in general. I never wanted to go in the first place, only did because "it's what you have to do".  The problem is I haven't gone in about 4 weeks. Failing all of my classes, probably beyond repair. I don't know what to do anymore. My family still thinks I'm going, I'm tired of lying. I feel so guilty. I've talked to them about wanting to drop out, they all told me I need to go and get so upset with me. I don't have the heart to tell them I'm basically dropped out. And if I do drop out then what?  My major is computer science(surprise) and you sorta need a degree for that. 

I don't know what to do anymore, I don't know where my life is going, I'm not looking forward to the future.  My life is over... There does seem to be one solution though, but I could never do that to my family.
