Emotions are a horrible thing that ruined everything I could have had.Emotions aren't a good thing. My emotions are the reason my relationship with him is so rocky and the reason I'm going to lose my job, worsening my relationship even more. Emotions have kept me from doing things I need to do, like reporting things to the police or signing up for therapy. Why would I ever be grateful for such a malformed brain, with all of these defects? I wish I could have been born pure. Sociopathic and aromantic/asexual. I might get laundry done if that was the case. I feel too much. And I can't regulate them as easily. I wish I didn't have to feel at all. It would make my life much easier.

Emotions haven't motivated or inspired me, they've paralyzed me. Emotions have made me a bitter, anxious person that's insufferable to be around if I'm not in a (very short lived) moment of distracted happiness.
