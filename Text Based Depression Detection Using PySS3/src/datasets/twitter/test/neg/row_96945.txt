I verbalized it and I couldn't stop cryingI've had these thoughts for quite a while and how it'd be easy just to do it and that there's nothing left. And the only reason I've been putting it off is because of my brother's wedding and how if I did it before no one would enjoy it.

But today I looked myself in the mirror and said "I'm going to kill myself after my brother's wedding". And I just broke down. Not to sure what that means, deep down do I not want to do it?
