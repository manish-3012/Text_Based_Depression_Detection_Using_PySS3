Does everyone think of killing themselves?Does everyone think of killing themselves?
They must right....?
Everyone has thought about it at least once right?
At some point everyone gets to a point where they hate themselves so much that they think it would be easier to just end it all 
That the people in my life will eventually get over it and move on
That I can finally be at peace somewhere in the black abyss 
You cant tell anyone...because they'll only get mad at you, or tell you how it would hurt THEM...
But they are tired of addressing what hurts YOU. 
So you walk around all day with a fake smile to make everyone else feel more comfortable about the self destruct button on your forehead.
When you find yourself always a part of the problem
Everything in your life plagued by your toxicity
Wouldn't it be better to make the world a slightly less toxic place by not existing at all?

Tell me everyone has these thoughts...
At least once....

So at least I know there are at least some days
I am not alone...
