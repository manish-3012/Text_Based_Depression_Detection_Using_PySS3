I'm so exhausted and damaged.If you can see my post history, my recent post is one of the reasons I'm contemplating to kill myself.

Also is the fact that I will never be accepted for who I am.

The fact that I cannot be the person I want to be.

The fact that I am not continuously happy despite of my achievements in life.

The fact that I have a dietary disorder and mental issues. I've tried therapy but it hasn't worked so well.

I love those who care for me. But I'm just so done. Please let me go.

I know I am not capable enough to kill myself (still afraid) but don't let me go to that point where I'm not afraid anymore.

I'm so sad and miserable
