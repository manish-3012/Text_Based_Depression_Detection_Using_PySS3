SoMy ex has been posting about me on various social media, theyâ€™ve made posts specifically on their page and in groups. Theyâ€™ve  told many random people to block me. 
All the times weâ€™ve talked beforehand theyâ€™ve never said anything like they do when theyâ€™re alone. All they do is talk about me, and how depressed and suicidal I am. 
I really donâ€™t know what to do, knowing that so many random people have talked about me and made fun of me, even made memes about me being suicidal, it hurts me more than I thought it would
