Why should I not kill myself?I see no reason not to.

I have no skills, no health insurance, no money, can't find a job to support myself, can't get into college, was rejected by the military and I have no way of making myself happy.

I've tried so fucking hard to make things change but every I always get told no.

I'm done, I now have a way to finally kill myself quickly. I figured out the combination to my family's gun safe. I plan on using their shotgun.

And if any of you say "think about who will miss you" I don't care. 

If someone is suffering with no chance of getting better let them die.

Notice how I say chance of getting better. Who in their right mind wants to leave everything up to chance? People just tell themselves that despite knowing it won't get better.
