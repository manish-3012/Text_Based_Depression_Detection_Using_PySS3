The "Why did I do that" -&gt; "What the fuck is wrong with me" -&gt; "I should kill myself" cycle of social anxietyI understand feeling this way as an awkward teenager, but I'm in my thirties. I should've grown out of this a long time ago.

Anytime I do it, my go-to is distance. I cut off that person for a little while until I feel better. It's ruined relationships, friendships, jobs, you name it.

Anyone have any advice for handling this other than therapy or "just think about something else"? Neither of those have helped. Neither has actually talking about it with the people in question. That usually makes it worse.
