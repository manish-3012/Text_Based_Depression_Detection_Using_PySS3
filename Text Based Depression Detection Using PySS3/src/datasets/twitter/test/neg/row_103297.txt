I am about to lose my job. I want to die.I fell into this job out of college through a temp agency. They were desperate for anyone, and even wanted me to start that day. A kniving executive who worked there recommended me for a position, I got hired despite almost blowing the interview, and as he was considering promoting me to his team, he was fired because the company couldn't deal with him being a real fucking lowlife. 

Fast forward and I'm two years without a promotion, and it's gotten to the point where I'm a joke in the office. I have no clue how to communicate with these corporate types, despite coming from an English background, yet my position requires me to transition into a biz dev role - which no one thinks will happen for me. 

About two weeks ago a rare, potentially lucrative opportunity finally opened up from a segment within the company. And I literally just squandered it by copying someone from a competing firm with similar name to my coworker on an email to my boss with a survey we had been working on (highly secretive info). 

I tried recalling the email but it failed. Just waiting to get chewed out and fired in the morning. My current manager will likely fire me as well because I have been focusing on work for this new guy at a crutial time. I have no job prospects, and I am surrounded by a successful family who is so competitive they would rather smirk at my failing than help mE find solutions. 

I have a couple more xanax and I have a bottle of Jack. I can't face tomorrow. Everything good in my life, I have squandered. I have a penchant for self sabatoge. I just want to fix myself but I've tried for years and I'm right back to the 10 year old kid I was, thinking of ending it all. 

Please just say something.
