i just swallowed my anti-depressantsthis is my first time posting but

i canâ€™t take the pain anymore, i just swallow all my anti-depressants, probably around 2000-2500mgs and well, yeah. 

iâ€™m thinking to myself now, iâ€™m not going to see my sister grow up, iâ€™m not going to see the ending to some shows i watch, iâ€™m never going to laugh with my friends again. iâ€™m going to miss a lot, but iâ€™m selfish, and i want the pain to stop. 

i feel like what iâ€™m doing is wrong, and it is, but i donâ€™t care anymore.
