I don't plan on living my life longerI'm 18 M, currently in 12th grade, and a few months from now I'm expected to be in college. I dread every month the upcoming college years and my transition to early adult life. I relatively get good or above average grades throughout Highschool, but my parents still see me as their 'smart' child. what they don't know is that I'm just barely keeping myself together at school. They expect so much from me like they want me to become this or that, when I don't even know what I want to be, I can't even picture my future without being dead that's why I have no goals in life. I'm only limited to high earning careers so I have no choice of becoming 'something' else. I feel like I'm becoming stuck to a course or career that I don't want and I want nothing more than just to get out from it. Lately I've becoming more worn and tired from everything, I can't get some school requirements done on time, I can't focus on my studies without being distracted and addicted to whatever videogame i'm playing. I had let my group mates down on our research paper by without making any progress so far. I have failed as a student, as a group leader, as a son. I just want to die now, immediately. I almost have these passive suicide thoughts everyday that is becoming more active by actively planning my eventual suicide. I don't want to face living my life in the future, knowing I'll just fail harder and spiral downwards in this shit hole.
