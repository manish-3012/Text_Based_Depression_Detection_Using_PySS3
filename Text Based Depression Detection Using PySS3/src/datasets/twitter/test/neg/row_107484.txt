I ruined my life for being a total idiot and suicide is a growing option for meI started college this year (out of state college) with the major Iâ€™ve wanted to do all throughout high school and at the beginning of the year I was so eager to start and excited to see where my career would take me in the future. After the first couple days I grew VERY depressed due to certain conditions at school. This led me to stop caring and made me start hating my life more and more each day I was there. It got so bad that I stopped going to class all together. Now that the semester is over I got placed on academic probation and got told I wasnâ€™t allowed to stay on campus. I planned on telling my family but when I talked to them I panicked and made up an excuse why I could come home. I come from a poor family because my mom is terminally ill and only my dad works. Because of our low income and losing my financial aid due to academic probation my family will never be able to afford to pay for even a community college by ourselves. Iâ€™m out of options and feel like I have nothing to live for anymore.
