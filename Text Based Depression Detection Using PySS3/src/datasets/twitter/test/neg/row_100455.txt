I'm just gonna start writing and update this every day, let's see how many days i have in meSo to start with I'll give some backstory, not too much because I'll probably do that another day, I'm in high school and I have 0 friends. Litteraly 0, I get to school and speak to no one. There was a period of about a week where I hadn't spoken to a single person, no not even my parents as they work at night so I stay home alone some days. I used to be one of those cringey people that thought "I'm an introvert but I'm smart" or something, now I notice I'm just really fucking stupid and no one actually cares about me. I did have friends before, they did come to this school, but we don't share classes and they have their own groups, I'm nothing like I was last year, I used to be funny energetic, things like that. I just don't have it in me anymore, I'm not failing any classes but the only reason for that is because I cheat in all my classes. I'm writing this at lunch, sitting alone, ready to cry but there's people near me. I can't sleep anymore and make it up during my electives, I used to go to sleep with asmr but that doesn't do anything for me now, when I lay in bed my legs and hands twitch because I know I won't sleep. Trying to sleep is the worst feeling of all, looking up and just seeing pitch black having to think of the day or life you have. I did have one friend earlier in the year but it seems that the election made her insane, asked me who I supported and then went on for 30 minutes texting me that if I don't support her candidate than the world will end or something, really I don't support anyone, I don't actually care about who's my president, not like itll change my sadness. I don't know what else to write here but I'll probably remember overnight, tommorow at approximately the same time I'll update this or make a new post or something of the sort
