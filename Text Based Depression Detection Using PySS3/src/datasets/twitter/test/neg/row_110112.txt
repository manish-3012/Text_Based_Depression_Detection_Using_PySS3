Fuck dudeFuck. I canâ€™t cry. This is just the worst pain Iâ€™ve ever felt. Itâ€™s so weird. Right after I thought it was gone something shittt happens and I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know how to not feel this way. Over some stupid fucking thing. It just happened again. I feel like Iâ€™m freaking out. What themfuck do I do. I canâ€™t stop this. I think death might be the only answer because I legitimately cannot stop feeling this way. This is just pain but itâ€™s mental. Fuck
