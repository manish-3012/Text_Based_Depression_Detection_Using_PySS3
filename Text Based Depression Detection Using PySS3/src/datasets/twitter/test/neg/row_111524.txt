My Dad is going to commit suicideI've tried everything to convince him to not do it.  He has had depression for the majority of his life.  He has been to therapy. He has taken meds for the past 15+ years to no avail.
He's about to retire in less than a year, and even this is not reason enough for him to stay alive.  He is in so much pain every day.  Convincing him to live makes me feel horrible, as I feel like I'm pleading with a terminally ill person in severe pain to stay alive.  He has been waiting to do this for my sake, as he wanted to make sure I would be ok.
I'm to the point where I have accepted he is going to do this.  I want to know what I should be doing with my Dad in these last moments.  
Part of me wants someone to respond with some brilliant method that helps me pull my Dad out of this depression, but again, I believe I have made it to the acceptance stage of this situation.  So although appreciated, please do not bother posting hotlines and such. 

Thank you all for your support.
