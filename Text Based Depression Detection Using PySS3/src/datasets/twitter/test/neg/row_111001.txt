[update] good things on this subreditt recently. i didn't cut myself. thank you.So i just wanna say massive thank you to this guys who text with me here: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7oeg3w/is_cutting_helps/

in night when i want to do this i was too much fucked up and just get asleep about 10PM. When i woke up i decided that tonight i stay sober and have to do this. But then i check out my reddit and those comments change my mind. i got so fucking scared about this shame, ever ending cycle... i didn't cut myself, but anyway i'm scared of my head. for the first time i want to to do this, in first day already held a razor blade... fuck me, maybe i should try to write long essey about my problems here if you, lovely guys helps so much. once more - thank you. 

btw. it's third good update from last two days. im freshmen. does these things happen all the time here?
