My suicide noteIâ€™m sorry. 

Iâ€™m sorry I left you, both of you. 

Iâ€™m sorry I donâ€™t love myself enough to make an effective change to keep me around. 

Iâ€™m sorry I didnâ€™t try anything because I knew Iâ€™d fail at anything I did so there was no point. 

Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m a failure. 

Youâ€™re going to say that Iâ€™m none of those things, but thatâ€™s just a normal reaction. I am a failure, I am selfish, I am ugly, I am fat, I am useless. 

I had a fucked up childhood and the way I was raised conditioned me to know I will never be good at anything. I always know deep down that there is a little demon in control that I constantly let win. The dark voices always cover the light. And Iâ€™m filled with darkness at this point. You can always darken a painting but itâ€™s so much harder to lighten it, and I just donâ€™t have it in me to try to make my painting lighter anymore. 

Please tell our son I love him. He is the only good thing to ever come from me. He In no way is responsible for this. Donâ€™t you dare ever blame him because of postpartum depression, because this is all me. If anything, Iâ€™ve hung around longer than I wanted to because of him. He brings me a joy that is indescribable. You tell him that he was thing that mommy loved most. You tell him that I am poison and no mom is so SO much better than me as a mother. When I killed myself, I saved him from a life of watching me and him learning my behaviors and mimicking them. I will never let my darkness effect his light. When he is old enough please let him read the note I attached. 

Now as for you, thank you for supporting me. Thank you for trying. Donâ€™t think it wasnâ€™t enough, there was nothing you couldâ€™ve done. I shouldâ€™ve never married you. I married you because I thought I could change you and that was so wrong of me. You are a very apathetic person and that was not good for me. Anytime I was happy or excited about anything, you showed no emotion. You were never once happy for me back, or excited that I was in so much joy. That slowly ate me away. I lost my joy. I forgot how to be happy. I think thatâ€™s why I love our kid so much because he would laugh with me. He would smile at me, our fucking 2 year old would just hug me randomly and say he loved me. 4 years of marriage and youâ€™ve never done that. 

This isnâ€™t me blaming you. Yeah, being with you didnâ€™t help, but as youâ€™ve said â€œyou knew I was this way when you married meâ€ and yeah I did know you were that way, I just thought you loved me so much that youâ€™d change. That was my mistake. I knew it when we were engaged l, but I feared disappointing people so much I shut the voice telling me to break up with you down and went in with it. 

The worst part is, you are my best friend. I fucking love you as a friend. You are such a fun fucking friend, but not spouse. You only give me friendship. It sucks and I shouldnâ€™t have married you. But then we wouldnâ€™t have miles and heâ€™s amazing. I would do it all again to have our boy. Please show him the love that you know I needed. Show him love the way you see me loving him. 

Iâ€™m sorry I have nothing left to give. 

Iâ€™m just so tired of faking every action I make. Iâ€™m so tired of pretending. Even when Iâ€™m visibly sad, thatâ€™s still a mask for how sad I really am. I canâ€™t pretend anymore, itâ€™s taken everything out of me. 


Note to my son:

Miles, my sweet, amazing kid. 

Everything good I had went into you. Everything I am proud of, everything I love is in you. Iâ€™m not around anymore, and for that, Iâ€™m sorry. Trust me when I say that you are so much better without me. Unfortunately, I was a toxic person and I didnâ€™t want you to learn my negative behaviors. I want you to be so much better than I am, and the only way to do that is not not be around anymore. 

Please understand that me being gone has nothing to do with you. If anything, I only stuck around as long as I did because I wanted to be with you all the time. You are all the joy in the universe sucked into a tiny little package of love and happiness. You are so smart and so funny. You always tried to make me laugh, you were always successful at it too. 

Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s been hard and Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ve always questioned why I did what what I did, so I want to make sure you have an answer. 

Mommy was sick. I had voices in my head constantly telling me that I was not good enough. That I was trash, I was ugly and fat and stupid and good for nothing. These voices only got worse and one day, I just didnâ€™t have the strength in me to keep fighting them. I gave in because I was so tired of trying to prove them wrong, but always failing. I saw myself as a useless failure. I was a waste of space in the world. I didnâ€™t want the voices to win, but I knew everything they said was right. I didnâ€™t want you to grow up watching your mom hate herself be I didnâ€™t want you to learn how to hate yourself. I was taught to hate myself by growing up around the people I did and their words to me became permanent voices in my head that I could t escape. Without me, youâ€™ll only have love. Your dadâ€™s family is love. They are incredible people that you will grow up around. You will be surrounded by so much positivity and love and thatâ€™s what I want for you. My mom will only every love you as well and all of my uncles, I really hope you still have relationships with them because you came into our lifeâ€™s during a dark time and brought them all joy that was so needed. 

You are light. You are a bright shining light. And itâ€™s okay to not always feel that way, itâ€™s human. With all sadness comes good, and you can know how amazing that goodness is by knowing how painful sadness can be. Remember to hold onto the good parts. 

Miles, that love I have for you is indescribable. The most joy I have ever felt in life has been with you. You are the reason I was able to experience a happiness I never thought was possible. Even though Iâ€™m not with you, never forget that you are so so great. I didnâ€™t do this because  your love wasnâ€™t enough, it was more than enough. I did this because my pain was so overwhelming, that I could not breathe. My decision to end my life was terrible and selfish, and you can absolutely hate me for doing it, hate me all you need to, just never ever hate yourself. There is nothing in you worth hating. 

You are a wonderful human, and making you was the best thing I ever did for the world. 

I love you. I will always love you.
