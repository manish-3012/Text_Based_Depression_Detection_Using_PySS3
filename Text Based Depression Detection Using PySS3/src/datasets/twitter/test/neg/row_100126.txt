Yeah I'm on the verge of a total fucking breakdown if I don't get help right the fuck now.I don't know why I'm surprised this time. I can't believe I allowed myself to believe that my dad loved me this time. I can't take his verbal and emotional abuse anymore and I have nowhere to go and no one to support me. I need to kill myself in a way that destroys him for destroying me and then deceiving me that he loved me. I'm sorry his parents scarred him but that is no goddamned excuse to ruin me. If he's going to anyway then I will end his livelihood. He has a couple of firearms so I have to make sure I kill myself before he can react to what I've done and kill me himself. I can still die on my terms. I won't let him take that from me, too. Recommend me some people to call. Otherwise I'm going to try to make an exit bad or blow my brains out. I'm not sure if I want to leave him with the trauma of seeing the physical imagery of his actions.
