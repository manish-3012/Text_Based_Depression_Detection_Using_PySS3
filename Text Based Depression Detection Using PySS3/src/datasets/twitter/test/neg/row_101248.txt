How to stay out of my own head?I know everything around me is probably fine.
But my brain is trying to convince me that this is some plot for all my friends to abandon and ghost me without having to feel guilty. Like everyone's constantly lying to me. At this point idk if i really have anyone to talk to. Ffs i think my mothers against me and i KNOW just as well for my friends that that's bullshit. I already plan on getting a therapist but i'm having trouble holding out till one can see me. I saw a future for myself past 30 and now that future has been curbed. Now I'm back to "give it till 30" shit. I'll probably  be fine, i probably just need time and i'll almost definitely delete this later. But ranting into this void is how i cope for now. If y'all have any suggestions for keeping out the deep end that'd be dope. Till then i'm hanging in there.
