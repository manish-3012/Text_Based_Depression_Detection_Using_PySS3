a coward and a liarI have been depressed since I was 12 years old. (20 now.) I've always felt like shit with very few weeks/months of happiness in my young adult life. And I've fucked up a lot the last few years.

I dropped out of a lovely four-year college because I couldn't find it in myself to care. Can you believe that? I could have been happy there. Instead I fucking dropped out and move back home and now have a minimum wage job and debt collectors calling me to pay for the education I rejected. My boyfriend supported me for a year of panic attacks, nightmares and freakouts. Now I am employed and he recently lost his job so I am supporting both of us, and a cat. (I know....but food adds up, for all of us.) Money is fucking tight and that's with living with 3 other people.

My boyfriend. Yeah. I cheated on him. With my ex. I love my ex. I love my boyfriend. I don't know what the fuck to do because neither of them is interested in sharing and it's just generally fucked. My boyfriend knows nothing - he is a fucking saint, he's done everything for me and I love him to death. I don't feel bad about the cheating, just the lie. Something is wrong with my morality.

This week I tried to catch a puppy that was loose on the street. It danced out of my hands and into traffic and I watched it die.

Then my ex blackmailed me. I verbally attacked him because I'm an asshole, no real reason, and he said he would reveal everything. I broke down. I thought I was a proud person, you know? A person with morals. With the serenity of a priest my adulterer broke me down into little bits, showing me who I really am. I'm a dreadful liar and an abuser. I am a fucking coward. I don't have the balls to go back to school, I don't have the fucking guts to change my life, I don't have the strength to confess to my boyfriend and put us on even footing. I disrespect and dishonor him. My ex peeled me down to my core and what I saw was ugly and selfish. I am hideous and hypocritical and disgusting. I don't know what I want so I abuse those around me. I'm a pathetic, delusional spec of human shit.

I just want to be happy. Now no matter what I do - if I confess, or if I leave, if I go with my ex or beg my boyfriend for forgiveness - no one wants me. No one loves me. It's sad. I hate myself. My boyfriend would never forgive me. Now, my ex says he is too stressed for a relationship. I can't afford to live by myself here, it's too expensive. I would be alone. I am alone, really. I'm always alone.

I am so afraid. I am afraid of my own friends. I am afraid of the people I love, because I fear they will stop loving me. (I lost a lot of friends when my ex and I broke up. Well...all my friends. I have friends now but I now know how easy it is to lose them.) I am so fucking scared and I dont know what to do anymore. I wish I could just start over and do shit differently this time. But I can't. I can't do anything. I'm afraid of dying alone. I'm afraid of dying, because this is it, after this there is nothing. Everything I thought good about myself was a fucking delusion so I could justify playing two people and not picking one, so now neither one will want me unless I lie to them, which is even more pathetic. I'm trapped here, depressed, half-crazy and a douchebag of the highest caliber. Where did I go wrong?

TL;DR I'm a cheating asshole abuser and don't know what to do with my life, so I might as well get rid of it.
