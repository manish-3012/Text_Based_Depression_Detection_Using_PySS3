Emotionally retardedI'll begin by saying that I think I'm a rationally intelligent person. I'm gifted in that way as all things logic-related have always come very naturally to me.

But emotionally, I'm completely retarded, probably on a level of a 6-year-old child. I don't understand my emotions at all, and much less have the ability to deal with them or change them. I feel like a ship on water - completely at mercy of the weather and tides of my emotions.

I can't trust my emotions.  
I often feel extreme desire to do X and make all the plans - and when the time comes and I have to do X, I hate myself for ever bringing myself in that situation. Also, once someone shows any kind of hostility, I can never trust them again, and it makes dealing with my family hard, as they are short-tempered people who can argue to death and then talk happily the next day as if nothing happened - and over the years, I've only grown to resent and hate them more and more.  
So to deal with those kind of problems, I've learned not to listen to my emotions. Well, at least positive ones. The negative ones are harder to ignore.

That's kind of a short analysis of why I feel the way I feel.

I feel like I'll never be fixed. It's been so many years and I'm still the same annoying dysfunctional crybaby who can't even deal with everyday problems. I'm not well-calibrated to this world. My existence will only lead to more pain and suffering for me. And I'm not entitled to other's empathy since I'm not even a good person from most of the people's ethical viewpoints. I'm just an outcast, and I probably did this to myself, and now I'm suffering the consequences.

And honestly, I can't identify what made me write this post. I don't even like Reddit nor its inhabitants, and I probably won't care for any stranger's "kind words" that you might write in the comments. It's easy to be "kind" from the comfort of your own room, a computer and an internet connection.
