My friends called the police on meMy "friends" called the police on me after telling that if I ever need someone to talk to they were there. They lost me my job, my 2nd amendment,and put me in debt. Now they won't oven dignify me with a response when I try to talk to them. They left me in a worse position than when I asked for help. Im lost at what to do at this point.
