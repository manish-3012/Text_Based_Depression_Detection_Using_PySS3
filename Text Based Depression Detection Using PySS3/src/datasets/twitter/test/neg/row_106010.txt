I'm scared I'm going to lose control and hurt myself when I'm upsetI'm not a confrontational person. I'm very sensitive and worried about doing things wrong, because when I do, even if its something simple, I get filled with so much guilt and usually, get incessantly yelled at. This time round, the yelling didn't stop for a while, and it continued to where I was crying on the floor begging for them to stop yelling at me and just let me have some silence.

I felt a massive urge inside myself to take literally anything sharp and stab myself with it, and whilst I've had these feelings before they've never been this strong. I don't really WANT to do it and now that I've calmed down, I can't believe I was thinking about it, but when I get worked up to that point of shaking and crying, it's one of the only thing's I can think about, and I'm scared that I might actually do it next time.

I have no clue how to get help with this or who to talk to, as I feel like I've filled up my quota of asking for help from my friends and talking to therapists have never seemed to really help me, as I really either need complete trust or complete anonymity.

I just want to move on with my life, but I feel handicapped by my sensitivity and concern for my own personal safety.
