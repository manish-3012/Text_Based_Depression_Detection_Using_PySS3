My progress is a miracle!!It has been just 16 hours since i started venting in Reddit and i already are desensitized to a lot of things. I can bear pain, now i even crave it, but every passing minute i am becoming more and more ready to die!

I am so pathetic that i don't even have money for a gun (the best option out there)
I want something effective and cutting is not lmao. It is like trying to stop breathing, you wont simply do it and even there is the risk i do it wrong.

I dont have pills nor drugs nor money.

Hanging takes too much time and maybe is not effective.

That lets me with tadaratardtarardttataaaa!!!

Maybe jumping from a very high building which is pretty easy, or jumping under a bus or a heavy car, although i am leaning more towards jumping.

Lets see how this develops ðŸ˜
