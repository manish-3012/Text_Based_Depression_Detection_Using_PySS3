My angel doesn't existSince I was ten years old, the only thing I've ever really been concerned with was finding my soulmate. My only friend always jokes that I wasn't hugged enough as a child.. that's probably true. Love has given so much meaning to my life in the past. It's the one that makes me happy 100% of the time. Giving myself completely to another, who does the same for me, purely out of love, wanting to see the other happy.. I'm incomplete without it. 

And that's the problem.. I'm a complete wreck without it. I've got no direction in my life. I don't care to live. I don't care about money, I don't care about my hobbies, I love my family and animals but they can't take the constant pain away. Without anything to really call my passion, all I am as a person is a desperate, bleeding heart that wants to make somebody the happiest person on planet earth. That's not what people want.. That's what most people call crazy. 

I've had people tell me the whole stretch of truth on the matter. Nobody will be able to carry me in life, nobody will want to. I need to love myself first. I have to focus on finding happiness without others. And then there's the really harsh realities some people drop on me.. Love is a sham. Monogamy is bullshit. Everybody will hurt you. Go out and fuck as many people as you can because you're wasting your time chasing love. Haha..

So the past month I swore off looking for love. I stopped altogether. I got my first job at 21 years old at a fast food restaurant. I got on a routine. I thought I was getting better. Turns out I fucking hate my life more than ever before. I'm going fucking nowhere and nobody will ever want me. I've already quit my job and I'm ready to check out.

I've tried therapy. It's too damn expensive, my family is unsupportive and I don't get anywhere with it. Medication hasn't worked. I've been in a mental facility before. I've done the whole "please get help". I tried. I tried helping them help myself. It hasn't worked.

Everyone is right. There isn't an angel of a woman out there who's gonna save me from my bullshit life. And if there is, she certainly isn't taking my sorry fucking ass.. Not when there's so many better people out there. I'm waiting on a lie.. On a fucking fairytale. I can't change. I want to remove myself from this world.
