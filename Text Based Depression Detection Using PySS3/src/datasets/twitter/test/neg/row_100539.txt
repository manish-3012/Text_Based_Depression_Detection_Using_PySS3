listening to "look on down from the bridge" while thinking about what to put on my suicide noteit's gonna be a happy death for me i swear. i'm tired of my mother blaming everything on me. i can't do anything right. we will never have anything and its my fault. so, maybe once i die people will be happy. so, very, happy.
