Feeling 100% hopelessDear Reddit,

I'm posting here because, although I know the internet will judge, at least I don't have to look you in the face as you're doing so. 

I am in financial ruin. My student loans are in default. I work two jobs, but didn't make enough money last month to pay my rent. My phone is about to be turned off (again). Every time I start to get my head above water, I get pulled down again.

I have very little support system left. My family has no idea what to do with me. My friends have been alienated from me since my bf and I broke up in July (a lot of them were mutual friends, and rather than pick a side, they chose neither).

Every day, on my way to work, I pass over this bridge. And every day, I think about how easy it would be to just jump over the railing. 

I have no idea what to do or how to get myself out of this hole.
