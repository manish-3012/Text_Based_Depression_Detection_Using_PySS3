My husband hates me as much as I hate myselfI'm the scum of the fucking earth and I don't deserve to be here anymore. My husband can't even be in the same room as me. I stupidly pulled the gun out while he was awake and he took it away from me. I'm planning on slitting my wrists outside in the snow as soon as he falls asleep.
