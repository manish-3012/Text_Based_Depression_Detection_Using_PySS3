Im losing my grip.I was sexually molested when i was a boy as well as emotionally and physically abused by both of my parents. I was abandoned by my father and my mother tried to kill me by running me over with her car. Ive been suicidal since I was 8 and have tried at.least.7.different times. This year though has taken the cake for me. The.love of my.life left me for a man she was cheating on me.with. i was arrested and evicted from my home. I became a felon. I was diagnosed with terminal lukemiea. I lost my business, lost my wife, lost my health. I feel so hopeless, isolated and alone. I work at a minimum wage job that doesn't pay the bills but pays me enough that I've lost my health insurance. I live in a small one bedroom house and now my daughters are supposed to come live with me.....how am I supposed to rebuild and start over when I'm literally dying? How can I watch my daughters when they just.remind me.of there mother. How can I go on???? Im on wellbutrin 300mg and it helps me hang on but it doesn't get rid of my suicidal thoughts. I live next to the ocean and imagine just going for a swim and never coming back. Or attaching a hose to my broken cars exhaust pipe and taking a bunch of sleeping pills. Or drinking 3 handles of vodka in an hour. Im trying to hold on but I'm losing my grip. My wife is coming over tomorrow to take the girls till Sunday and i just want to tell them all goodbye and then die. I literally wake up and go.to.sleep.crying. I cry at.work, I just cry cry cry. The pain is overwhelming. I don't know if ill make it to the new year. I love my daughters I want to be there for them. But it's becoming so hard to hold on. I just want the pain to stop. I want to feel loved. Thanks for reading the rambling of a broken man. Im trying to hold on I really am but it's so very very hard.
