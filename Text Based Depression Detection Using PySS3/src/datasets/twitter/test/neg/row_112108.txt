I want an accident to happenIâ€™ve nearly killed myself almost every day for the last 3 months and I just canâ€™t do it anymore. But I have family who would be devastated. I just canâ€™t deal with this longing sadness and torturing pain anymore. So I want to get murdered, or get in a car accident, or get an illness thatâ€™ll kill me fairly fast. I donâ€™t want to hurt the people in my life by ending my life, but if an accident doesnâ€™t happen by New Years maybe Iâ€™ll just end it myself.
