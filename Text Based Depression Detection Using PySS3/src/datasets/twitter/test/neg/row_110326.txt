I Thought I Could Make ItI thought I could make it.  I really did.  I got fired, but I found another job--contract, but still.  Money.  Self-worth.  Something to DO all day.

Then my girlfriend threw me out after I broke my leg.  That sucked, especially since I couldn't work while my leg healed, but I had savings and stayed with my mom and recovered from that.  And when I could walk, I moved to another city to start over.

For a few months, I stayed with two of my best friends in their guest room.  It took me a while, but I found work again--still only contract, but it's a shitty economy.  I even was learning to cook.  And last night I signed a lease to an apartment.  I was going to move in this weekend.  

All I had to do was cook dinner tonight and I'd be one step closer to getting back on my feet.

But I fucked it up.  I set off the smoke alarm twice.  I lost my shit.  I got myself in front of my friends and bashed my head against their wall and left a fucking hole.  I'm packing up my shit to move to my furniture-less apartment, I cut them a check to cover the damages, but I can't make it.

I'm going to kill myself tonight.  They took me I and I destroyed their house.  They were my friend and **this** is how I repay them?

Fuck me.  I'm gonna die tonight.  I'm an asshole.
