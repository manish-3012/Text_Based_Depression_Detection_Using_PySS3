I don't want to do it.I don't want to kill myself. Sometimes I just wish that I'd go to sleep and never wake up or get hit by a car. Just something so I don't have to do it myself.  

I don't know what to do. I'm getting tired of living. I feel like I can't go on anymore, I have no hope left. I'm starting to feel like I have no choice but to do it myself. Nothing is going to get better, no matter how many times I tell myself that. It's not going to happen. I will never be better.
