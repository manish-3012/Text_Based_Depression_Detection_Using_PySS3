This is so dumbI post in here and in CPTSD for emotional support because - well fuck I kinda have too. 

And for some reason it always happens that before anyone comes by to help me someone down votes the post... 

And Iâ€™m genuinely like have panic attacks reaching out for help and for seemingly no fucking reason people down vote it in subs where your supposed to be reaching out... 

I have such a hard time speaking, ever... at all... and I know itâ€™s stupid but those down votes always confirm that part of my head that goes â€œsee- no one cares if you live or die. No one cares if you need help. You gunna suffer alone or your gunna have to off yourself.â€ 

I just- why? What did I do... why do people do that Iâ€™m subs that are so sensitive in nature. 

I know itâ€™s dumb. 

I know itâ€™s my fault. 

But I need help and I have no where else to go... I just donâ€™t... i donâ€™t understand why some of the time people seem to think I just donâ€™t deserve that help... 

Maybe I donâ€™t... 
maybe I should just die and leave everyone alone...
