Some help?When I was diagnosed with depression it felt like I had to deal with a burden of shit, for the past 5 years. From holding my fatherly figure in my arms on his death bed, to loosing out of my education just because I felt I was misunderstood.

For a while now I've just started to believe everything is my fault. It was my fault my girlfriend of four years just up and left, even though she knew my condition and everything I went through. Also I felt like I never got to say goodbye to my grandmother, again it was my fault as I never saw her before she died.

I'm sorry this post is in a jumbled order but I'm just picking certain things in my life to share, and believe me there's a hell of a lot more.

I've tried to end this pain twice, I have the scars everyday to remind me, I hate them, I hate this life. Every breathing minute feels like an hour, and if I'm honest, I'm sick of dealing with this now. 

I'm even anxious about posting this.
