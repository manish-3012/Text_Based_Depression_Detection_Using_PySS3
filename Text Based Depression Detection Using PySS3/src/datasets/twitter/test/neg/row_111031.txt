Either I get cosmetic surgery soon, or I die.I hate my face. I hate my body. The body thing is easy though, because I don't have to eat. My face on the other hand, I can't control. People say I'm gorgeous but reactions from other people tell me otherwise. If I do get surgery I will make my mouth less ape-like and my eyes big. If I can't be drop dead gorgeous, I don't want to live, let alone ugly. The main issue though is that I'm under 18. I live with my mom and she would never let me do that, plus I don't have the money. So, is there any quick way to earn the money? I could threaten suicide but I would end up in a hospital. Besides, I don't want my mom to have to spend that money on me. Also, if I get the money, how do I actually get the surgeries? I don't think there's a logical way to accomplish that so I'll probably end up dead.
