Iâ€™ve been hoping to die naturally for years nowItâ€™s just small things like not wearing my seat belt or behaving really recklessly. I canâ€™t bring myself to actually do it, Iâ€™m too scared of surviving and living with the consequences. Iâ€™m too young and poor to afford an assisted suicide in a country that allows it. My SO gets nervous when we go to places with steep edges and what not because I will be reckless in vain attempts to slip and fall. People around me demonize suicide so much, so I donâ€™t want anyone to know I did it. I just want to die naturally. I hope for a fatal car wreck when Iâ€™m driving alone or maybe one of these days alcohol poisoning will do the job for me. I want to try starving myself so people will think I have anorexia but Iâ€™m a male and where I live/my family would just call me a fag. I hope I die soon
