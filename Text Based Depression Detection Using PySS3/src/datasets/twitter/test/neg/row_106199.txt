If you read this, don't worry, it won't take longI don't need to vent, I don't need your pity, I don't need support. 
All I want is to feel like I said goodbye, but there's no one to write to. 
This is my note and if you found it under the thousand identical ones, if you are reading it, it's yours too. 
Knowing it exists will comfort me when I fall asleep tonight for the last time. 
Thank you for your kindness, your boredom, or whatever casualty convinced you to read it. Thank you for being someone to write to.
