Do you guys have the same feeling?Do you ever just lay in bed,stay in the shower,or just sit in a corner and think and complain about how horrible life is and just wish you could end it all but don't have the guts to do it? It will happen to me if I'm just alone by my self or I'm feeling really down. I really try not to let it happen to me but it just happens to me. I always like to go for long walks on the dark night,really late at night and just walk in the middle of the street. Just waiting for a car to come and hit me
