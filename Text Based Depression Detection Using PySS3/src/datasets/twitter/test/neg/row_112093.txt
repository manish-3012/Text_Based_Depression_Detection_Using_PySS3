If I wasn't so afraid of death, I would kill myself.I just got down from the tenth floor ledge of one of my university buildings. Thought about jumping, but I'm too afraid to die. The theoretical options for the afterlife are going to hell for committing suicide, or my consciousness not existing any more. Or the worst one, reincarnation. I don't like the life I'm living but the after life scares me too much. If I had a vision that all human souls are guaranteed a peaceful afterlife, I would certainly kill myself.
