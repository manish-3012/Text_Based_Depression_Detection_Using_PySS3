I failed todayI sat on the kitchen floor with a handful of pills and a glass of water. I sobbed. I put one in my mouth. But ultimately I failed. Again. I'm such a fuck up that I can't even kill myself without screwing it up. I'm alone, and worst of all I don't trust anyone enough to let anyone in ever again. My life is over and I bitched out of the only thing that will ever make this pain stop.
