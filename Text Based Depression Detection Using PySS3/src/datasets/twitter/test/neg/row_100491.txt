nothing to live forlike the title says i have literally nothing i have no dreams or aspirations i don't have any idea what to do after high school i'm 99% sure all of my friends actually hate me i'm a constant disappointment to my parents and other family i'm failing school and 100% will fail this year and i can't do anything about it. it would be so easy to just kill myself and be done. ppl say it'll sort itself out and that i just need to hold on but that's bs it's been over a year and i feel nothing even close to improvement i just keep feeling worse and worse plus on top of that i'm trans so even if i don't kill myself i'll still half to deal with coming out to my extended family most of whom are very conservative and my friends who are also in high school so you can guess how that'll go. also i know that your supposed to focus on your mental health before school or work but that doesn't help bc when i do that i just stress about how much i'll be falling behind in school but if i focus on school i get super stressed and overwhelmed and there's no way to balance it. i'm trying really hard but it's not working i just want to be like normal people but it doesn't work
