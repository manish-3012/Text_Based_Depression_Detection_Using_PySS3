Sad soldierSo I joined about a year ago and made it through BCT rather easily and most of AIT but I was injured and now I'm being kicked out. Every day in here is hard. I don't want to get up and go to formations. I don't want to take transition classes. I don't want to talk to my peers. I don't even want to be awake. I've fairly new to reddit and just discovered this thread. 

I've been considering some non-messy ways to off myself quietly in my room. It's been hard. I don't know if I want to go home or fight to stay in. I wish I could just stop breathing. 

I hate knowing I can't even serve my country. I feel really useless.
