Everyone comes to me to vent and ask me for help but they never ask about meI basically became the guy you text when you re sad  i have a really good friend  she comes to me with her suicidal thaughts and i always manage to talk her off a cliff but at the end no one cares to ask me how am i doing and i dont know how long i can keep going like this
