Death seems so nice and I can't stop think about suicideThe mystery what happens after death makes me wanna die! I can't wait 50 years to die! I want NOW! I have no goals in life, so it's good. I've already liked a branch and bought a rope. I'm an average person financially but not because of me but because of my family. I have no abilities to be rich and successful and I actually don't have the will to be. Only thing I wanna do is to die. Can't wait to see what's after that. Even if it's nothing it will be OK.
