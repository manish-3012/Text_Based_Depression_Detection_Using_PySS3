I've recovered from my long-going suicidal tendencies a year ago but it has suddenly come back, I want to give up.I feel like I've wasted so much time and efforts just to feel good. I was stronger, confident, popular again. I passed successfully my exams, avoid sickness and everything. But yesterday I realized want I am and what I truly wanted in life and now I'm here, because I know that apart from a miracle, I'll never be happy. I've played a role for more than ten years now, and I forgot who I really was. I don't know what I like anymore. But one thing I know for sure, I hate my body. I hate it so bad. I wish I was in a body where I can truly said "That's me" with a smile.

I'm not afraid of death anyway. Leaving this sick world won't make me sad.
