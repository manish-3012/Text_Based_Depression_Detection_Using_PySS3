How do you finally build up courage to do it ?I donâ€™t want to make compelling post outlining large amounts of grief, I see that a lot of people on here have their own problems. I just want advice on finally getting the courage to go through with it. Lately Iâ€™ve been thinking about waiting until my uncle goes to work going in his room and finding where he keeps his gun. Maybe then driving off someone where maybe enjoy some last moments then off myself .

 At the moment that would be the only thing that would make me happy or put me at rest . Iâ€™ve just been so down. I remember this last Christmas instead of going over to my aunts house where all my family was, I stayed at home tying a belt around my neck trying to hang myself for the first time. Suicide has been on my mind the last 4 years (Iâ€™m 25 now) . I think Iâ€™m ready to do it. Please help with words or rituals I could use to finally work myself up to ending it all . Thanks in advance.
