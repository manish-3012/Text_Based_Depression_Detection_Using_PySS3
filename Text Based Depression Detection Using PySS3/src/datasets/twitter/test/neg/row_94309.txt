I want to stop existing and I feel so guilty about itI've been suicidal since I was 13. I have a truly loving family, but I was bullied a lot since I was a little kid. That caused me to have some mental issues I'll admit, and I cut myself, starved, puked, buried my nails on my skin.. I have gone through a lot.
But the desire of just.. Just stop existing once and for all is always there no matter what I do. 

I go to therapy, I have friends now, I'm doing what I want in life, soon I'll travel to Japan which is one of my dreams. But still I want to die. I feel so empty. I don't feel anything at all anymore.

A year ago I survived a suicide attempt. My mother fell ill because of the shock, and is constantly watching me, doesn't leave me home alone and doesn't even let me close the door to my room.
I really love her, but this is so frustrating. 
I can't sleep, and if I don't sleep she doesn't sleep either, because she suffers for me. I don't wanna hurt anyone, so I have to pretend I am okay at almost all times so she is well. That is until I explode and enter a crisis, then everything goes wild again. 
And over and over again.

I don't want to hurt anyone, but I wanna die and I fantasize about it constantly. I know this would deeply sadden the people around me, and I feel so guilty and dirty, but.. I want to cease existing.
