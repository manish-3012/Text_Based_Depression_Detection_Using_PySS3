32 year old manletWhere to even begin... 32 years old.  Male.  I'm basically a midget at 5'1" tall.  Penis size is proportional to my height, so yeah, not likely to ever please a woman with a grain of rice.  Virgin of course.  Face covered in pimples.  Strange odors emanate from my wretched gasbag of a body.  I brush what teeth I have left about once a week.  About half of them have rotten out already.  I live on a steady diet of junk food and whatever slop my mom cooks when she's in the mood to cook.

Oh yeah, and of course I live with my mom.  At 32 years of age.  I am the archetypal basement-dwelling absolute failure of a "man".  I dropped out of college and have just bounced from one shitty, minimum wage, dead-end job to another ever since, with long stretches of unemployment in between.  I can't hold a job for longer than around 6 months before I'm either fired for being late or missing too many days, or I just quit.  I told my last boss to go fuck himself.  He was 19 years old.  I was a 32 year old loser midget being bossed around by a 19 year old.

I can't go on like this.  My life is a complete joke.
