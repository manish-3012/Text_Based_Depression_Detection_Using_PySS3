I cant stop thinking about itI've been thinking about taking my life for 7 years now. I think it's time. I have done everything I could and it seems like I can't fix any of my problems in my dysfunctional life or change my mood. None of the antidepressants worked. therapy didn't work(was just patronizing tbh). I am stuck between contemplating suicide, looking for a way to end my life and getting discouraged by thinking about what happens to my family. I am completely sure that I can't go on for another day, sitting in my room and just think about ending all my problems. Like, the thought of another day is waaay too bear. I guess I am writing this cuz I absolutely have no idea wtf to do next. The only thing that comes to mind is taking rice pesticide pills.
