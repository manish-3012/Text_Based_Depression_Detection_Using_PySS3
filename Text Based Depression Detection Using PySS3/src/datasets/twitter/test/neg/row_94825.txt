God, please give me the strength to not do anything in schools because I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m at my whits end. Iâ€™m here in the bathroom and my high school, Iâ€™m just about to hyperventilate to make myself faint if not otherwise I take the pills inside my my book bag because Iâ€™ve had it up to here. The pain of being alone in school and the fear of talking with peers because of my past antisocial behavior, the stress from the insane amount of homework that I didnâ€™t finish and that will cost me my grade which pretty much controls what will happen in my life for the outcomes, the years that never seem to stop because of trying to calm down so I can barely see what Iâ€™m reading , Iâ€™m fucking done.

Therapy is hard to go though, every single class I have with the exception of 2 of them are killing me, none of my close friends know my struggles, and I just need a way to escape the pain

Iâ€™m still iffy on trying to pop the pills now so maybe fainting will work so that I donâ€™t have to think about the physical aches of class first. All in all, I just want it to be over...
