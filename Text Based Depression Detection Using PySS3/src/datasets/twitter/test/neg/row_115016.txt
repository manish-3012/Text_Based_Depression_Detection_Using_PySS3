I want to ended all.I've been dealing with chronicle depression for the last 2 years and anxiety in the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

My ex-girlfriend started seeing someone and since she tell me that, i've attempting to kill myself once, ended up at the hospital. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I just thing about killing myself all the time. I've got no motivation left and I just thing that death will be a better place with peace and no more sadness.

I don't know what to do.
