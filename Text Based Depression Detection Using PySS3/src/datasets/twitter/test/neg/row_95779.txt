Not wanting to give someone the time of day because the "might do something silly" is stupidI live in a house with no choice to my situation, 3 other kids and 2 "trained" staff I finally admitted that for a month I've been looking up how to kill myself, and the fastest technique to do the job today I finally done it I tried to all I eember is tying the noise and doing it a dumb way it didn't hurt it just felt like lots of pressure went to my head I could still sorta breathe but my chest wasn't going in or out then it started going grey and then I woke up half an hour later lying on my floor in a pool of saliva, I asked the staff of I could talk to them in the car (so the others couldn't hear) and they said "no way, you might do something silly" if you think I'm gonna do something silly the silliest thing to do is pretend I don't exist, when you realise I don't respond anymore open my door and see me dead that's your fault bitch.
