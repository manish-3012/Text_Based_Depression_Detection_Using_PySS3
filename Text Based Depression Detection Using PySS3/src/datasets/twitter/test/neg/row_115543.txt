I dreamed that I loved somebody.I had a dream where I truly loved and trusted a person. I was absolutely sure, without a single doubt, that they felt the same about me. That's the only time I've ever loved or trusted anyone. It felt so good. But that'll never happen. I wish I didn't experience it, because it was fake. It was a fucking dream and now I know what I'm missing, it hurts even more. 

Do people actually love and trust others? I never knew how it felt until I dreamed it. Doesn't matter. I don't care if I'm alone or not, I just want the suffering to stop.

I've been in constant pain since the dream - it's nearly a month now - because somehow, I feel literal physical pain in my heart. Like I'm nearly choking, but just barely able to breathe. I've lost my appetite. I haven't eaten normally since the dream. I'm so tired.

For as long as I can remember, any kind of happiness has just been making everything hurt more. Happiness lasts no longer than a few hours, and it always results in feeling depressed for way longer afterwards. I smile and I laugh and I forget things, but it's not real. I don't think I've ever been truly happy at any point in my life. I've never come close to feeling how I did in the dream. I remember the feeling so clearly.

I wish I never had that dream. I wish I never realized how it's supposed to be. But at the same time, I'm glad I know how hopeless my life actually is.

It will never be real. What's the point? I have no future. I'm not actually living. I'm so sick of this bullshit. Just kill me already.
