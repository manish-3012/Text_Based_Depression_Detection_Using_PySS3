NosediveBackground: Two years ago I was an up and coming new head of department, weightloss on track, and life finally going in the right direction. 

I was offered a job. A high paying job, and was bullied out if it not 6 months later. 

I started another job, on a severely reduced salary, practically the bitch that does everything. I tried to provide solutions, alternatives but they fell on deaf ears, as they do in most of these cases. 

Covid happened, and I worked through it. All the hours god sent, while everyone else was on Furlough. 

I was made redundant. 

Applied to literally thousands of jobs, everything, anything. I got one offer, and accepted. Now I'm miserable - I don't have a right to be. But the job makes me uncomfortably sick. but it's money, and any money when you have none is a blessing. 

I hope it turns around, I hope the plane that is my life picks up altitude and stops it's 600 Mike per hour nose dive. 

I don't know how much longer it will be until I hit the ground.
