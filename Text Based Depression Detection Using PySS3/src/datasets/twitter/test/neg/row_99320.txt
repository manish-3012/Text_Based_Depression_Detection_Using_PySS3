About to get evicted, no hope leftThere's nothing else left for me. Family can't help, I've been denied assistance from the city even after appealing, ran completely through my savings, the coronavirus is about to get the everything shut down and I haven't been able to find work for like a year now. I don't have anything to really sell and I don't have any friends I can turn to to ask for a place to stay. It's not even worth trying to fight it at this point, I'm gonna be homeless with nothing to look forward to. The 23rd is my last day in this place, and probably my last day on earth at all. I've been depressed since I was 8 or so, but I'm accepting my fate and just letting it happen. Don't know what else to do.
