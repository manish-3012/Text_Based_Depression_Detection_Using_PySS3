OverwhelmedI'm sitting here, contemplating what the easiest and most painless way to go is. I've been trying to keep myself occupied and limit the time that I spend by myself, because I only end up drowning in my own thoughts, but it's inevitable. I'm on my own in a city far away from friends and family, and every day I have to come home to an empty apartment.
