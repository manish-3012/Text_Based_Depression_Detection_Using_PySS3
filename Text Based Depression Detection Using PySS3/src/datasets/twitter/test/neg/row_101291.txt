i want to die, but i dont want to kill myselfive been struggling with thoughts of self harm and depression for years. nobody can help me and ive been ostracized and made fun of by others even though i know they go through similar things. i dont want to die but i dont want to live. im so angry and alone and sad that everyone has forgotten about me. everything good i had going for me is gone. i dont know what to do anymore. i have no one else to talk to, and no one else would care until its too late
