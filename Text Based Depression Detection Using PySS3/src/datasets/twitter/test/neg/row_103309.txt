I didnâ€™t mean to live this longIâ€™m 19, I planned to kill myself before I hit 16. then 17. then before i graduated. Now iâ€™m an adult with no plans or future and Iâ€™m thinking about suicide more than ever lately. I tried to kill myself several times throughout middle and high school, but either chickened out or failed one way or another. 

I wanted to go to college for a while but I donâ€™t think I can. I didnt do anything special at all in high school, no classes above academic, no extracurriculars. I have no future it feels like. 

Iâ€™m trapped in my home with two shitty parents of which I donâ€™t know where to begin on how badly theyâ€™ve helped fuck my life and self esteem up from the start. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever become my own person apart from them. 

I know Iâ€™m worthless, I have no impact on anyoneâ€™s lives. I have no friends, it feels like my biggest impact if I were gone would be on my workplace simply because itâ€™d be an inconvenience to find someone to replace me on my shifts.

I feel hopeless and I just wanna die again. I thought I was finally doing better until the end of last summer, and itâ€™s been downhill for the past half a year. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can put up with another day of this. Iâ€™m unsure if Iâ€™ll really try to kill myself soon, but every day it feels like a better option than this. Just needed to put this out somewhere.
