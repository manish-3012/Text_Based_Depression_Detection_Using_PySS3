It hurts being uglyI was a wee bit ugly throughout my life and the experiences I had hurt me so much. I tried suicide later on and now I am even more ugly in every single way. Nobody loves me or notices me. I'm less than invisible now. Nothing helps. It's impossible to be accepted to even half the extent I had before. I want to die again but I don't want to go to hell. I want to die so bad
