My father told me I didnâ€™t have the balls to kill myself.Last year I was diagnosed with bipolar and got committed to mental institutions various times for suicidal ideation and 1 attempt. Then in October I flew to Tijuana and bought phenobarbital. I then flew to Mexico City. Itâ€™s always been one of my favorite cities and I wanted to see it one last time before I died. It was very miserable. It was raining and I just didnâ€™t get the spark I first had when I visited.

I finally wrote up a letter to my aunt and father and turned off my phone. I was scared of drinking the phenobarbital. I put it aside and went to sleep. I was woken up by Mexican police around 6am. Iâ€™m not quite sure how they found me. I know my dad called the police in San Francisco. Maybe they coordinated with the embassy and Airbnb. I donâ€™t really know.

They had my family buy me a ticket out and escorted me all the way onto the plane. I was able to go on other meds and have been doing good since. Yesterday my dad confronted me about $3,000 of his that has gone missing (he hides money all over the place, so I think he just forgot). Things get pretty heated up and then he tells me that I didnâ€™t even have the balls to kill myself... that one hurt.

This time Iâ€™ll prove him wrong.
