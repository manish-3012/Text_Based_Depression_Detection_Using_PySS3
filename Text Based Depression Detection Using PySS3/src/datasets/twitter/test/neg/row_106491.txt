What am I doingSo Iâ€™m completely lost... I tried to talk to people who say they are there for me and it only makes me feel the same or worse, when I stay alone itâ€™s not any better. One moment Iâ€™m okay or happy next minute all I can think about is killing myself. Tbh I donâ€™t even know if I should post this here? But just needed to vent again.
