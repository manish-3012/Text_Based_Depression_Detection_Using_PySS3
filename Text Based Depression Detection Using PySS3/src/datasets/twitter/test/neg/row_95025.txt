Donâ€™t know what to doSometimes when i feel myself having bad thoughts i start writing a list of the things in life i am looking forward to and excited about

Last year it used to have easily over 50

Last night i had 12
Tonight i have 2 


Iâ€™m scared of when it will become 0. Sometimes in my moments of clarity i realise how much i want to live and all the things in life waiting for me but Iâ€™m scared that one day i wonâ€™t be strong enough to fight it


I have been going to therapy and on medication since 2016. I dont want to live the rest of my life doped up talking to a woman who wants her pay check it hurts to think about the future
