The second day of trying#2Beautiful things that happened: 
I practiced exercise(I did not complete the 10 minutes but to do this and start this achievement for me) .
I drew (it was a strange drawing, but I wanted to try the drawing) .
I made someone smile (I think) 
Bad things: 
1 I am very afraid 
2 I am worried to give up 
3 Imagine strange things (talks in my imagination)

Little information about me (I love Number 8)^^
