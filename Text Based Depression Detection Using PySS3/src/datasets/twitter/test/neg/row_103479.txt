Merry Christmas. â¤ï¸Just remember people care for you and love you. It may not seem like it now and the current situation may be dire, whatever that is for all of you who may be reading this, but I promise, it gets better. We can all hopefully get through this. Hopefully. Hopes all we really got.

Feeling like shit on a day thatâ€™s supposed to be cheerful isnâ€™t any of your faults. â¤ï¸
So I wish you a Merry Christmas. Stay safe loves. We can overcome this together. &lt;3
