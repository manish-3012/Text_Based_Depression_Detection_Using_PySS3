I just cant. Anymore.In feeling so down right now and depressed. I can't even put it into words. There's just so much. I wish I would just die. I wish I would just get murdered and not even know until a second before it happens. 

That's my only wish. That's my wish. 

Life is cruel. I wish I was never born. This life isn't for me. It really isn't. 

It's just pain. 

I don't want to live anymore.
