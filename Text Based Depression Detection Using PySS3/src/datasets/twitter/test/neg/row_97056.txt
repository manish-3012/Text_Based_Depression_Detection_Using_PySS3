a goodbye and a thank youNothing can sway my decision anymore. Iâ€™m going to die soon. Nothing will change my mind. Iâ€™ve waited too long already. I just have to get some things in order and then Iâ€™ll be gone.

I had no friends, no real passions or hobbies worth speaking about, never really traveled much outside my hometown, never graduated high school or went to college, never had the money or means to pursue anything. Iâ€™ve been completely isolated, dealing with abuse, addiction, severe mental illness, and poverty for nearly my whole life. 

Iâ€˜m not good looking or funny. Iâ€™m not an intellectual or a creative or a deep thinker. Iâ€™m not particularly kind or interesting. But I tried so hard to be all those things and more.

No matter how much I gave, nothing was ever returned to me. I feel so lost and empty. After all Iâ€™ve been through and learned, Iâ€™m always trapped somehow.

Please donâ€™t tell me I can change. Donâ€™t tell me to grow from all of this. Iâ€™ve tried more than anybody I know. Thereâ€™s nothing to be done. Iâ€™ve been through hell and back more times than I can count and Iâ€™m just a shell of the fiery, smart little girl I used to be. Sheâ€™s just a ghost who shares my name and she died a very tragic and violent death a very long time ago.

I appreciate all of the kind people here and everywhere. Iâ€™m so glad to know that people arenâ€™t all bad, even if sometimes itâ€™s hard to believe. I loved reading stories about peoplesâ€™ lives and looking at photos of your outfits and vacations and families. Some toys lost in someoneâ€™s attic for decades, found again. Your beloved pets. A poem.

Everyone is so intricate. Most people are so beautiful to me. I canâ€™t carry hatred for this world when I see all of the good things that came out of it.
My life has been endlessly difficult but I donâ€™t have to like my life to recognize how thankful I am that I got to be alive.

If I get reincarnated, I hope I can come back as a human again because in some other life, Iâ€™d love to be loved as I am, both by others and myself. Iâ€™d love to do all the things that I couldnâ€™t do this time around. Thereâ€™s something so very special about being human that I canâ€™t explain. I wish I could recognize myself as one of you.

I try so hard to take the depth and beauty I find in others and see myself reflected in it, but I canâ€™t. I try so hard to understand what makes me so different. What could I do to make someone love me, respect me, befriend me, admire me? I think maybe I just wasnâ€™t meant to experience these things.

I donâ€™t know. Thereâ€™s just something intrinsically wrong with me and no therapy or medicine or self-reflection can change that. 

Iâ€™m just exhausted. I want to rest.

Iâ€™ll miss a lot of things and people, even though they wonâ€™t miss me. I love this earth even though it was cruel to me.

I hope that I get to come back here sometime and try again as someone new. I hope I get to see summer sunrises and smell the salt of an ocean and feel soft grass under my feet again. I hope I can be born into a healthy mind and body, a healthy family. I donâ€™t want perfection, I just want a real chance at happiness. 

Please, be good to yourselves and to each other.
