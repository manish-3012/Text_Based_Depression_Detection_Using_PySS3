No way outIt's been *only* two days that we haven't spoken; actually less given the time difference. It was her Sunday night my Mon morning. I'm horrible to her but I need her. She does this she'll go up to a week not talking to me and ignoring my messages. I love her she loves me at least that's what she said. I'm a narcissist according to her (has had direct relationship with one and attributes my behaviour to what she's previously experience). I'm scared she won't come back this time. She's offered to get me 'help' but when I need her the most she ignores me. When she has needed help I've been there for her each and every time she calls, when she sobs in her car as she hastily leaves and I hear the verbal abuse in the background. She had planned to come and visit me in some months from now, now she only will if I pay for her flight. She's said why if I don't want to be friends do I want her here..she says to kill her. Actual message was "No I don't. You're the one wasting my time. Tell me why you want someone you feel contempt for there? To kill me?" I called her insane to think that. I can't even kill myself properly so why would I kill someone else less her. I would give everything I owed and more to make her happy but is making her happy just leaving her alone? Oh Reddit how I wonder.






If I were to kill myself she'd never know that's the frightening part leaving knowing she hated me. She's not coming back. I'll give her some more days. I asked her to call me tomorrow (it's the 4th today she's undoubtedly busy) because I want to resign from work. If I resign I plan to give everything up and just leave the country. Since she knows my situation I want her opinion first just like she has called me (even when she's done this silent treatment occasionally she's called because she simply wanted me to proof read an email for example) my message lays undelivered and unread. Her last one to me was "I'm going to bed. Goodnight LemonLimonLime" so I'm hopeful because she hasn't blocked me but it's a fairly removed response. 

If she doesn't make contact in a few days I don't know what I'll do. She's very important to me.

It's not just losing her that doesn't make life worth living she's been a rock to me this past year. My rent is behind because they cut my hours at work, my father may as well be a sperm donor. I'm going on vacation in a few weeks but but it's the wrong time. I'm young enough to just leave and people will forgive me. I haven't impacted anybody's life enough.
