Iâ€™m tired.oIâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m 18 and have had thoughts of suicide since I was 13. I hate fucking hate college and I hate my home life. My dad is a meth addict and although I know my parents care about me they were never fit to be parents. I was the weird kid growing up because of it and my grades were terrible because I had no motivation. I wish I wouldâ€™ve tried harder because I loathe community college. I have no ambition. I barely have any friends left and my social skills are terrible and I have an extremely hard time letting people in because of it. The only thing I have going for me right now is my job and being able to save up. I want to get out of here one day but itâ€™s hard when I can barely even think clearly most of the time. I fucking hate myself and the way I look on top of it, so I have absolutely no confidence. It just hurts even though I know things could be worse. I think about ending my shit every day even but Iâ€™m scared because I know it will hurt some of the people in my life and if I fail I donâ€™t want to end up disabled for the rest of my life. People told me if gets better after high school but I feel just as alone and miserable as I did back in those days. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve been starving myself on and off since middle school, and Iâ€™ve been doing it again just because I donâ€™t give a fuck what happens. Iâ€™ve stopped self harming because Iâ€™m embarrassed of my old scars now but I still get the urge to do it constantly. I donâ€™t hate life itself but I hate the miserable isolated somewhat hopeless life Iâ€™ve been living. I apologize if I sound over dramatic but I just thought Iâ€™d try using this as an outlet because I donâ€™t know where else to go with these thoughts.
