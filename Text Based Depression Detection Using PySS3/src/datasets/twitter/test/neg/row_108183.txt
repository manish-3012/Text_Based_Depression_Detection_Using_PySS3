I am a problem no one can solve. My parents are afraid of me because they don't know what to do with me, and they laugh at me to hide their fear.This didn't really become clear to me until about a few months ago. When it did, it kind of made sense how my parents have been talking to me for the last two years. Every time I've to tell them what I really think, they've just either laughed or told me that that's not how I really feel and it'll soon pass. Well guess what? It still fucking hasn't! It's gotten to the point where I'm not really sure if it's worth staying alive, since I have almost no one I can talk to, even on this shitty website. I can't talk to most of my friends, since they're not equipped to actually process most of what I say that's related to my emotional problems. Even when I try to open up to people on this website, they usually just assuming I'm making things up - never mind that I have Asperger's and tend to exaggerate my emotions because it's hard for me to put things in perspective when I get upset. I'm 21, living with my parents, and don't have any source of income as I can't do the dead-end job at my uni library. I'm still in online classes, but I hate them and think that most of them are a pointless waste of time to be honest. All I want to do is play vidya, but I can't even do that because of all these stupid final papers I have to write! And don't give me that "oH yEaH wElL tHeN wHaT aRe YoU dOiNg On ReDdIt?" crap. I'm posting this because it's my last resort.
