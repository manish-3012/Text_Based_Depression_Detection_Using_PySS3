addicted to self harmI'm not depressed anymore,I'm actually happy with my life.But sometimes on some evenings I feel empty,I feel like I want to just be done with everything,and on those evenings I scratch myself with whatever I can find or even lightly burn myself.I don't know what to do,I'm on medication and it is working most of the time but I feel like this addiction to self harm will be with me for the rest of my life. I'm not in despair or anything,it's just kind of annoying to have to deal with this.
