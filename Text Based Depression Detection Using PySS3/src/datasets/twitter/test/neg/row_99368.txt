What the fuck did I do? What the fuck can I do?I paid a super sexy tweaker girl for a skype show last night. Turns out she's high risk. I triggered her inadvertently by referencing the borderline personality disorder she mentioned. After a few hours of several confusing, alarming message exchanges, she claimed to have attempted suicide and stopped responding.

Now she claims (general post on her tumblr, not to me) to have failed in her attempt. I messaged her the number for her local mental health crisis services, no response.

I'm worried sick for this person I barely know who I may have pushed over an edge I couldn't recognize. How do those of you committed to preventing suicide deal with this blind brinksmanship, this constant eggshell walk?
