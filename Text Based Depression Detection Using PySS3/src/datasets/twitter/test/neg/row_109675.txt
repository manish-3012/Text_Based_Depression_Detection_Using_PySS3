I sit here and pretend to be normalWhat you donâ€™t know is I am planning on suiciding myself very soon! I have a job interview tomorrow and if it goes well I may not bother...I was really hoping I could do it tonight or tomorrow night but I have children to look after so that kinda messes up my plans. I feel guilty sat across from my best friend whilst I type this, she is going to be really upset if I do it... she will never forgive me!! I am hurting beyond what I can cope with!
