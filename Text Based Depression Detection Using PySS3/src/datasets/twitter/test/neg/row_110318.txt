I am just a burdenI really wish my family would just forget about me, i wish i could erase my existence from their minds. Then i could kill myself. The thought of my mom and my brothers crying for me. Is the only thing keeping me alive. I have no friends, no lover, no one beside family who would care if i died. I know i am a burden, so wouldn't it be better if i wasn't here? I'm not the center of the universe. Life would go on without me. Maybe i'm not as important to them as i think. They would cry a little, it would be difficult at first, but they would forget and heal eventually. That's what i think. I have no purpose, no ambition, no set goals or motivation in my life. So what's the point in dragging this out?
