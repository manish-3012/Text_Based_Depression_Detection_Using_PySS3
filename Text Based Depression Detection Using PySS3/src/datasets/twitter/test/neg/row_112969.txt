Alright Iâ€™m at the scary point where realizing even full recovery would still leave me in a pathetic life of misery. I donâ€™t think who I actually am is someone who is capable of surviving in this world.I finally have no one and itâ€™s all my fault. I am 10x worse off than I was the last time I tried to kill myself.

my girlfriend, who was the very last person making up my support system still willing to deal with me in all my vicious untreated glory, finally had enough and had to let go, and now that the relationship is over I can see that despite thinking I really truly loved her, it was an insanely unhealthy attachment from the very beginning. I donâ€™t know how she held on for as long as she did but I am so fucking scared to be completely alone now that she is gone.

At this point, I am a closeted transgender communist with PTSD debilitating enough to prevent me from taking care of myself. I have not been able to work enough to come close to paying rent anywhere in almost a year now. I live in a house where photos of my rapist hang through the halls and everyone I live with considers it unreasonable for me to ask them to cut him out of their lives just because he spent my childhood raping me. People like me donâ€™t really survive, do we? Iâ€™m having a really hard time understanding how Iâ€™m supposed to go forward from here knowing how dissatisfying a life awaits me even if I commit entirely to recovery. During our last conversation, my girlfriend told me she could tell we were just at different places in life (her nearly finished with her art studies degree, in the active process of being publicly out as a trans woman, creative endeavors being propelled in ever corner of our city and beginning to go beyond that too, working full time, sustaining friendships and family relationships. Me continuing to get sicker and sicker, unable to hold down a full time job. In no uncertain terms: she was growing, I am rotting. I cannot blame her for wanting to avoid the fallout of what will inevitably be a violent end for me, I think she could tell itâ€™s coming soon too)

It really feels like I am just waiting to afford myself the kindness of admitting that itâ€™s not worth it for me to try to get better. Even at my best I will be too pathetic a person to dignify helping, and I will not be capable of contributing anything to my community. I need to just stop letting things get worse and at least take this last responsibility for myself.
