i sexually assaulted someone when i was 15 and don't deserve to livei was 15 and a childhood friend (16f) was back in town for the summer. we had been hanging out a whole lot that summer and we were flirting pretty much the whole time this was going on.  we even held hands at one point and were getting very close with one another. she had recently broken up with her boyfriend and had emphasized to me that she wasn't interested in a summer fling. but we kept flirting and hanging out but just keeping things as friends. 

one day she came over to my house and no one else was home and we were watching tv together sitting very close on the couch. i actually think that i was sitting on the middle cushion and she was laying down with her legs over me. my memory is very bad so im not sure if that's how it was. 

anyway as an immature 15 year old i was like flirting with her and tickling her side. she was laughing and trying to get me back and we both ended up falling onto the couch and i managed to get on top of her. i tried to kiss her multiple times while she was moving her head back and forth to avoid my advances. i held down her arms while i was doing this.  i don't know if my memory is correct but i think her shirt got pulled up somehow as well. 

after a few seconds she told me to stop and if i remember right i did stop right after she said it. she ran into another room and i ran after her thinking that we were still just having fun. we went back to watching tv and everything kind of went back to normal after that. 

we continued to hang out for the rest of the summer until she left and it wasn't until a year ago that i remembered this event and realized what i had done. i feel so terrible because i know that i assaulted her and i know that i may have impacted her for the rest of her life. 

i would never ever do anything like this again but the fact that i did eats away at me every day. this all happened before i made many of my good friends and now they all tell me how good of a person i am but they don't know that this happened. 

i am terrified that i fucked up her life and seeing that she's a childhood friend i am terrified that she will have to see me again someday and be reminded of what happened. 

when i realized what i had done i reached out to her and tried to apologise explaining how bad i felt and how much i regretted pursuing her even after she had explained that she didn't want anything. she said thank you and then blocked me. i don't know what to do. 

every day i wake up and go to bed thinking about how much i would give to go back in time and erase what happened. no one but me knows about this and i have thought about opening up to some of my close friends about it but i know that they would never see me in the same way and they would probably hate me just as much as i hate myself. 

i don't know how i am ever going to be able to forgive myself and every day i fall deeper into the pit of realizing that i can't be the good person i thought i was and try to be when ive done something this horrible.
