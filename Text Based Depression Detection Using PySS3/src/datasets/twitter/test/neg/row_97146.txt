Why is it some days are great and then some days I want to kill myself?I've attempted suicide once... I took 11 roxycodone pills, 2 xanax, 2 klonopin, and then drank half a bottle of Nyquil, and half a bottle of Dayquil. I don't know why I'm explaining how but... yeah. And now, sometimes in the same day, like, the morning/afternoon will be great. Then at night I get depressed and want to kill myself. Or one day I'll be happy. And the next I'll want to kill myself. Why does this happen? Why can't I just be happy? Am I always gonna have this nagging thought of why did I fuck up, why didn't I just do it right and kill myself the first time?
