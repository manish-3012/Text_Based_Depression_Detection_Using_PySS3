TalkI can't find a good way to start this, I've just been looking at this text box for a hour so i'll just type what comes to my mind.

I don't know if I have depression, I've researched it before, seems like what I have but I feel that I am just using it as an excuse to myself. I know in my head that I am better off than most people in life, I'm sure a starving African doesn't complain about depression but people insist its a real thing so I want to find comfort in logic and analyze my life.

Its really hard to find a starting point to this, most of my life I have been trying to fullfill expectations of my family, goals. I am 19 years old and I've recently finished a course in college, every day I was in college I found as a struggle to socialise with people, I found isolation very conforting since I was 13 as you cant disappoint someone when you are alone or in someways vice-versa. 
I think when people say when your depressed everything is grey they don't mean you suddenly colourblind and all you see is grey but when you wake up first thing in the morning and you say to yourself what you want to achieve, most of the time if not, in my case all of the time, you will draw a blank and throughout the weeks you find little to no joy in anything you do, it becomes tiring to be around "friends" because the smiling mask you put on becomes heavy. I found that over the years I've been increasingly empathetic to others, I found that I see patterns in behaviors that make me psychoanalyze peoples problems and I have no problem helping them, and I'd say I have helped everyone for the better except for myself which is ironic.

A few months ago during my time at college one of my colleges from college said that I should get checked for depression, I declined and said that I wasn't depressed, but I took the hint and decided to go change my GP so my family wouldn't know, since then I haven't bothered going, its literally about a 10 min walk away and I haven't gone to go get checked, I still think I don't have it, my brain is telling me that its just a slump, I am almost a adult in socities eyes, I should beable to deal with my fucking problems, why don't I just get a grip and stop typing on a board which is filled with people who I am pretty sure, have it worse than me. 

Does depression make you not want help or something? I feel that I can deal with it, I've been saying that to myself for years now. 

Going into uni in the end of September, should be a experience, I hope the work I do can distract me from this and I wont have time to feel like this, usually education normally has a aspiring feeling to it, makes you feel like you can have a life goals and be happy. 

Recently about a week ago I decided to take some MDMA with one or two really close friends of mine, who I always mask myself from, it was the first time in years, that I was truely happy, I was high as fuck and was in the most happiest place of my life, now forward to now. I am back where I started, I have UNI that I need to go to to make my family happy, I have two close friends in my life who I can never express emotionally too and this is as close as I have ever been to talking to someone about it too which I find is irrationally pathetic.
