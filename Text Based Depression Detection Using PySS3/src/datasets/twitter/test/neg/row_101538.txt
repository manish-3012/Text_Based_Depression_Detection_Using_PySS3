I want to die right nowRecently I have had suicidal thoughts and have been so close to suicide more than once this month. I have been wondering if I was even born into the right body but thats a different subject. My parents are still trying to control what I wear and who I am which has caused me to not stay at home anymore. I quit college because it was all too much for me to handle and I would have bursts of either anger or crying if it got too much. After that, I realized how useless I am. I can't do anything right. I even started cosplaying this year but I end up feeling like I'm not good even though I love doing it. I just want a way to give up completely, and suicide feels like it's my only option.
