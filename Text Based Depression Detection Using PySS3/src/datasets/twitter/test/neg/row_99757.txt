Worst place I have ever been.I am a miserable person right now. Just miserable.

I recently made the biggest douchebag stunt ever to an employer in a supermarket I worked in. Said yes to help with a weekend shift, made a no-show and send her a lousy e-mail. Like I always do. Didn't even had a decent reason. Like I never have. It's just an intuition. 
I have just seen her respond and and I honestly have trouble in forgiving myself for this one. It was so uncool to do.
What she didn't know is that after my last shift I took 50 painkillers to end it all. Like I always do when I lose something I really care about. Like I want something to take me somewhere else.

Like I did with the breakups of my only two girlfriends, I really loved both so much. 
Or the cute girl I met at a music festival years ago. I couldn't show her my compassion for her and backed out. She could have been the one. Instead I took a crazy amount of pills and ended up hospitalized. I just wanted to get somewhere else. 

But I couldn't explain anyone about my pain. They just saw a suicide attempt. But the pain was that I could not give that girl all of that love and compassion she deserved.

Or the solo backpacker I met in Berlin. Would have loved to spend the days in her company. Just being able to hang out and explore Berlin with person from the states. Telling her stories about living in Europe while eating dÃ¶ner and drinking weird German drinks.

But I can't connect.

It is like living life in a paralyzed body. Something inside of me has always been off. Since I was a baby. Just watching things, but not able to reach out for love.

I do things I can not comprehend. I walk away from the good things. Damaged from all of the failures and pain, I only expect life to handle me pain.
Really can't see a way out. I've lost the meaning of life early on. The pain feels too much. Like something has been turned off. And I can't find the switch on. 

That is why I don't want to live. I know life is the completely opposite. It shouldn't be like this. But I can't reach to it. I can't live without being able to see and explore other souls and hearts and connect with them. 

Wonder if I could have grown an unknown brain tumor or something. I actually wish that God would give me something to reconnect with life. An unexpected baby or something. Or the one person who could get me back on track. A new start.
