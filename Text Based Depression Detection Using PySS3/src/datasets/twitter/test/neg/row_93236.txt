19m - No reason to keep existingThis is my current situation

â€¢ I went to college last fall and dropped out in March. I struggled with math and even more so with insecurity and the belief that I didn't belong there. I was a good student in high school and graduated in like the top 10% so it was a big hit to my self esteem that this was my college experience. I went for computer science.

â€¢ I recently broke up with my girlfriend of two years. We started off as a great couple and were really sentimental. Eventually we got into more in more arguments, and as things going on in each of our personal lives brought the relationship down, it got to a point were there was no more love and we had to call it off. Spending time with her made up a good portion of my free time, which we didn't really have a problem with. But now since I don't have that there's a but of space that needs to be filled.

â€¢ I've been obsessing over health and fitness, watching a lot of informational YouTube videos and reading tons of articles, but never took action to any of it. I'm 5'11 at 240lbs and I've been struggling with food addiction for the past year, even though I've always been reliant on food for comfort. I like to binge on fast food usually. I don't do it so much recently, but I don't have any motivation to get in shape or be healthier.

â€¢ I don't have many hobbies, but I've played guitar since I was 12. Lately i've lost total interest in it, so now I don't do much but browse reddit and watch netflix while I'm trying to pick up a job. I've grown bored with video games.

â€¢ I'm not in touch that well with my old friends, and I recently moved away to a town where not much goes on, so I don't have much available to meet new people.

Nowadays I go to sleep early and wake up late. After I eat I just wait until it's a good time to go to sleep again. I don't feel much of a reason anymore to try and make my situation better, because all I feel like I need anymore is something to eat and a place to sleep, and I have that.
