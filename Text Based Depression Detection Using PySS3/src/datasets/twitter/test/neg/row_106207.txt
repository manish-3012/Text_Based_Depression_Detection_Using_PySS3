I wish I were dead, but Iâ€™m not an acute suicide riskThere, I put it out into the void. I wish I were dead. 

More accurately, I want to be dead. And itâ€™s interfering with my ability to progress in my therapy because when I have a fleeting suicidal thought, Iâ€™m supposed to feel fear/revulsion, and eventually learn to let it go without having to engage it at all.

However, what actually happens is a fleeting suicidal thought comes in and I feel hope. Sometimes I even feel a rush of relief if itâ€™s a particularly strong impulse. Like, â€œmaybe this time thereâ€™s a chance lol nope.â€ So I have a bunch of secondary thoughts and have fully engaged with it before Iâ€™m even fully aware of it.

But Iâ€™m not going to kill myself. That ship was already sailing before Coronavirus, and lockdown has guaranteed it. Iâ€™ll say it again in hopes that maybe my damn brain will get it: Iâ€™m not going to kill myself.

All Iâ€™ve been able to do at this point to â€œdisengageâ€ is tell myself that itâ€™s not happening during lockdown, and to come back at me when I can travel freely again and have a way to kill myself away from my spouse. Iâ€™m lying to myself - I wonâ€™t be killing myself just because lockdown ends, but at least the lie lets me disengage.

But I still canâ€™t move forward with my life either because Iâ€™m clinging to a hope of dying. I wish I werenâ€™t.

Maybe by getting one repetition of this stupid cycle out of my head and into the void I can help myself to break the cycle.

I suppose Iâ€™m free all week to work on it until my next appointment.
