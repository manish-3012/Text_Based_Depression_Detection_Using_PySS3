I wish someone cared.It's like, everyone always tells you you're never alone and they're always there, but when you reach out to someone, it's like they just don't care. And then when life is good again, they reappear. 

Why am I even still alive? 
Everyone's here for the light, but no one ever stays for the darkness. 

I'm tired of feeling like all I'm surrounded by are fair-weather friends. 

I wish I had the courage to just let myself die.
