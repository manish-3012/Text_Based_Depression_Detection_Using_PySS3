Today is the last day of my vacation, but I don't know if I'll make it to work againI've never had a higher volume of suicidal thoughts than I have these past few months, ESPECIALLY these past few days. It's no longer about, "Jesus, I can't take this anymore." It's to the point of being, "well, I wouldn't want anyone to have to clean up that mess, what if I..."

I don't know what else to say, I just need to get out. I can't find one reason (that I actually care about) to stay.
