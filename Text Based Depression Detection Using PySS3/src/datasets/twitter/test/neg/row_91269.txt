I wish someone would have told me it was okayI live everyday of my life empty I have no more hope I have little Joy I'm in school it's going fine I'm working at $8.25 bare minimum wage i hate my job I hate school I'm slowly starting to hate life I workout I look good but I'm just so empty inside I no longer even want friends I don't have any friends and the girls I f*** with just 
want my money and my family give me some love and support but I'm still empty they barely understand me want me to find God all of every day of my life is getting f***** up or bored out of my mind
