I am tired of living my lifeNobody understands me. Nobody bothers to care what I'm going through. I asked my boyfriend to help me out of this situation but he's too busy with his friends. I don't feel good. I'm sleeping for hours day and night.i don't want to wake up anymore. Is there any way to die excluding hanging from the ceiling or having pills or jumping off the rooftop.
