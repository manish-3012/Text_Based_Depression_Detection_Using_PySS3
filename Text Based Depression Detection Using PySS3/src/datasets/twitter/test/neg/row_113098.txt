I am brokenI don't know if there is any way to fix this. I feel dead inside. There's nothing going on in there. I am almost positive that I'm suffering from c-ptsd, but I can't talk about the situation with anyone because no one believes me and I don't blame them. I'm an honest person, not prone to fights of fancy or psychotic episodes but what happened is just too unbelievable for anyone to even consider. Please, I don't know what to do. I guess what I'm saying is. If someone experienced something unbelievable, something in which they felt trapped for months, put under a microscope, had their thoughts and feelings invalidated to the point of losing themselves, and they were unable to talk about or work through these problems with anyone, would they have any chance at recovery?

Don't ask what happened, it's a long story and I probably won't tell you
