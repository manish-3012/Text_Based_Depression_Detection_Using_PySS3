Worried about a friend of mine. Help?
I'm going to tell a condensed story.

So my friend (not the one i am worried about) (we'll call her Sarah.) Get's into a relationship with a fellow (we'll call him James, he is who I am worried about.). Sarah is in the U.S. and James is in the U.K. Everything is fine for about a month, until Sarah gets a job with this Carnival. Long story short, Sarah cheats on James and James is considering suicide. I don't know James very well, but I am still worried.

He says he tried killing himself two nights ago, and that he called a hotline earlier that stopped him from jumping in a river
