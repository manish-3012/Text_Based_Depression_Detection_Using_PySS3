Ruined a lovely family dayWas supposed to go to watch Christmas carols today with my parents, grandmother, aunt, and boyfriend, but completely lost my shit, the trigger being not knowing what shoes to wear. My emotions get more and more out of control the older I get and Iâ€™m having tantrums like a two-year-old now that Iâ€™m nearly a legal adult. Crying, screaming, freezing up and not being able to move. My loved ones just want to help, but I snap and yell at their every move. I see a psychologist but canâ€™t get in until January. We ended up not being able to go to the carols because I was so hysterical and nothing calmed me down - not of the tactics Iâ€™ve learned at various psychologists, nothing. I always do this. I always ruin family events and other peopleâ€™s days because I get overwhelmed and lose it. Iâ€™m toxic to everyone around me and even after years of therapy, Iâ€™m getting worse, not better. I donâ€™t bring joy or happiness to anyone in my life, which is why everyone, if they have the opportunity, leaves me. My family have to stay because Iâ€™m incapable of taking care of myself, and my boyfriend only stays because he feels bad for me. Every time I think Iâ€™m getting better, one little thing sets me off, and then Iâ€™m worse than before. I canâ€™t keep living like this. Iâ€™m a human leech on everyone I encounter. I contribute nothing to the world. All I do is take, take, take. Everyone would be better off without me, if I only had the fucking guts to do it.
