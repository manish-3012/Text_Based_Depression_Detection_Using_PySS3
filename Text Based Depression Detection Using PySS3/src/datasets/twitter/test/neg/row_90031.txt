Coming off antidepressants, not as easy as it sounds.I have been on antidepressants the last 4 years, but I have been using Venlafaxine (Effexor) 150mg for the past year. I'm not sure why I decided to tell my doctor to taper me off. Since then I have deleted all social media, increased my life insurance for my son and mother and try to communicate with others on reddit because honestly. Family, friends and acquaintances will always be there.. you know this, but you still feel alone.. but as soon as you open up. You've already been judged and labeled as 'crazy' or better yet, when you piss them off get called a 'nut job.' I'm in my 20s now but spent my teen years online, playing World of Warcraft and Counter-Strike. People online are more family to me than my own flesh and blood.

Last thing I want is to be back in a psych ward. I am fully conscious and aware of how I feel. The suicidal thoughts have been with me for as long as I could remember. It started out as thoughts and I blew it off, but the older I got the more I realized. This is just who I am. I made the mistake of opening up to someone who couldn't relate.. 10 minutes later, the cops are at my door. I never really understood, if someone is distraught or angry. Locking them up in a hospital will just piss me the fuck off even more.

I didn't know if I slit my wrist it would take 15-20 minutes to bleed out.. but since coming off Venlafaxine it honestly doesn't sound so bad. A 9-mm hollow tip at point blank range doesn't either. I'm typing this honestly fighting to live another day. I want to be able to be there for my son but my way of thinking is so dark that I feel like he doesn't deserve me.
