Everything is pointlessI'm bombing the absolute christ out of university after somehow doing amazingly well in high school.

I just *can't* do it right, I don't know why. I have ADHD, and none of the medications will fucking stick. 

I'm living with my parents because I don't know how the fuck to function in a normal environment (barring the fact that I'm 18). They said they understood if I failed classes, and it was okay, because what else could I do? I can't really function in a job setting.

Of course, now, they're going back on their word. I don't know how to tell them that I bombed 2/3 classes last semester, and am doing basically the same this. I think I'm starting to get the silent treatment, it's fantastic.

I'm probably going to have to wait weeks if not months to see another therapist, because my health care is a goddamn joke even in Canada.

I'm so tired of it. Crippling anxiety, depression, ADHD, some ambiguous misophonia/autism thing, *and* OCD. I'm really nearing the worst you can get of the genetic lottery. I thought I had *dealt* with this, I was okay for a while, and now it's just the same shit all over again. I was trying to get diagnosed to see if it could help with uni, but my psychiatrist basically was a jerkoff, and so the cycle renews itself. Too late for school.

I can't even try switching meds again because being off of them renders me absolutely non-functional. I have finals soon. I can't even do my fucking essays. Even if I try it makes absolutely no difference, sometimes I genuinely fear I'm just not meant to thrive in a life like this. I don't know.

I'm wrestling with a lot of confusion about whether I'm asexual and aromantic. In which case, I'm probably going to die alone anyways; everybody else has a special someone but I guess that's just not a thing either. Cool.

To top it off, both my sister and I are being plagued by chronic strange health issues that just nobody can figure out. 

I'm so tired of living. It's the same shit over and over again, on repeat, broken up by periods of waiting and deceiving almost-happiness just to be fucking beat back down again. The only thing is, unlike the last few times I suffered from absolutely debilitating depression, I really thought there *was* a future I could be happy. 

If I had access to a gun it would've been solved already. I'm too scared of the pain and feeling if I hang myself. Christ. I was the 'good one' in the family once, too, now I've never been more of a disappointment. 

I want to check myself into a hospital or something but I feel like the possibility of my parents downplaying it is all too real. I don't know how to do this living bullshit anymore.
