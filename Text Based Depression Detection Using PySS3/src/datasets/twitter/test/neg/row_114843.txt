today I attempted suicidetoday i attempted suicde

I jumped off a bridge. The current was very strong. I could barely keep my head above the water. I thought I just wanted to let go but I couldnt. I held on to my life. I found that I dont want my life to end, I only want the pain to stop.
I got to shore my body was bleeding everywhere. The river is very dirty so maybe the aftermath will give me the rest. The pain is stronger now than ever. Not from the outside but from the inside. My heart is getting crushed.
