Thinking about living for 5, 10, 30, 50 more years is unbearable.I wish it were still the good old days of humans only living until their 30s and 40s.

Unfortunately, here I am, in my 20s in 2017, with probably at least 50 more years left. Maybe a bit less because chronic stress and loneliness has been shown to shorten oneâ€™s life. But still too long. Even one more year sounds terrible.

Itâ€™s probably much easier for people who have something, anything that makes them happy. I donâ€™t. I struggle along, fantasizing about all the ways to kill myself and hoping I get cancer so my family wonâ€™t be hurt by my suicide.

Yes, I have a family, and I know logically that they care about me, but I donâ€™t feel any love or care from them very often. Iâ€™ve got a couple of friends that I know would get by just fine without me around. I feel the same about my family too...I know it would hurt them if I wasnâ€™t there, but I also donâ€™t get included in most family things anyway, so how much would they really miss me.

I just want to be done with this. Itâ€™s so exhausting living this way. Iâ€™m on medication, Iâ€™m in therapy, Iâ€™ve tried countless different meds and types of therapies and doctors and counselors and Iâ€™m not much better off than I was the first time I tried to kill myself a decade ago. Nothing makes me happy, or even just slightly content. Itâ€™s all a miserable wasteland filled with bullshit and I want no parts of it. Iâ€™m so tired, I just want it to be over.
