I just want it to stop.Some of this I'm sharing for the first time. Some of it I've recited to so many health care professionals that I couldn't forget these things if I tried. 
I've never had any sense of a "good life". I was the middle child of 3 boys and too young to remember my parents splitting up. Neither one of my parents wanted us, and when custody came up they just decided it was 'fair' for us to move to Ohio for 1 year to live with our father, then to Virginia for a year to live with our mother. This continued for about 5 years before my dad never showed up to get us one year, and my mom acted as if he didnt exist. 5 years in which I never made a single friend. Never had time to adjust to rules before there were new ones. New rules, new faces, new schools... every year. My mother's boyfriends beat us. My mom beat us. My dad beat us when we were there. I can remember a night where my dad, drunk on scotch, threw my younger brother across the dining room table(6yrs old) and kicked me and my older brother across the kitchen floor(7 and 9 yrs old). I could never remember why. My brothers never spoke up about how things were, and because I was the only one who would make myself heard my mother institutionalized me at 9 years old. Heavily medicated, I celebrated my 10th birthday in a padded cell. At that point my father appeared out of the blue and came and took me, and me alone, back to Ohio with him.

8 years of being beaten, attacked, terrorized.. Nothing I could do was right. My achievements could have been better. Everything was an excuse to hit me or scream at me. I was sent to our local detention center for juveniles at 17 for striking a police officer who arrived at the house after the neighbors called the police and made a noise complaint because my father had tried to throw an ashtray at me but it broke a window behind me instead. The assault was an accident. I was sentenced to 1-4 years pending good behavior in Ohio's lovely juvenile prison system. I left after 2 years of hell with a lot more scars than i came in with. I finished High school in prison.

I was never prepared for life. My mom more or less ignored us, and my dad only taught me the value of properly fearing him and listening to HIS directions. I THOUGHT I was an adult. I'm currently 26 and Im still feeling completely lost. I started college a year out of jail and I did really well while I was there. 4.0 GPA. Presidents list. I scored a perfect 36 on my ACTs, and I joined American MENSA in 2011 with an estimated IQ of 158. 
I've never been called a smart person. I barely scraped by in High school. I just read in the back of class and kept to myself. No point in making friends if you were afraid to have them come over and see you humiliated. I had 2 or 3 actual friends, but I never widened my circle. 

I was always made to feel like I couldn't do anything right. While I know in the back of my head it cant be true, it's hard to argue with everyone you've ever met. My upbringing left me angry, insecure, petty, and with no self esteem to speak of. My whole life it seems has been a spiral. I can't think of any time I thought that I was glad I was alive.

I met my first real girlfriend in college. She was sweet. Passionate about learning and art. Very intelligent, and very gentle. Fast forward 4 years and she's cheated on me 3 times, and the last time was with my "best friend". I never trusted people to begin with. People latch on to you as 'friends' or otherwise because you have something they want, or you compliment their ego. But after that it was as if, if I had any left... as if I had lost my innocence. I felt more unworthy and unloved than I ever had in my life. I never even REMOTELY thought she would do that to me. But she did, and was able to laugh about it afterward. I spiraled. Hard. I lost my apartment, my job, and any sense of clear thought. I didnt feel like I could ever be loved. My parents didnt love me. She didnt love me. No friends. No other family. ALL I WANTED WAS SOMEONE TO HUG GOD DAMN IT. THATS ALL I WANTED. IT'S ALL IVE EVER WANTED. TO MEAN SOMETHING TO ANYONE.

I started drinking heavily. Started smoking weed too, and honest to god the weed is probably the only reason I'm still here to type. Probably the only decent decision Ive made in the last 10 years. 6 months go by and I'm still in my spiral. I meet the girl I would end up marrying. Another mistake. She wasnt a bad person, and probably the ONLY person who had ever treated me with any kind of decency. The only person who thought I was special in any way. Had I had more support, or something to lean on other than my own negative thoughts I might have been able to make it work. but our entire marriage (4 years) was spent looking for lies. I wanted to believe that she loved me. But if anything even remotely hinted that she was lieing to me or being unfaithful my entire life would flood my mind. How im not good enough for anyone, and of course she was cheating on me. Everyone does. It's easy to pick these things out as irrational after the fact, but in the moment it's nothing but crushing dread and anguish. It's occurred to me before that I cant think of a single time in my life where I didnt feel like I was drowning. 

We had a child together, the most beautiful baby boy in the whole world. He was my whole world from the moment he was born. In time though I began to grow increasingly anxious around him. I didnt want my little boy to grow up to be me. The first time that thought ran through my head I probably didnt stop crying for 5 hours. I was garbage. Worse than garbage. What kind of a monster do you have to be to hope that your child is nothing like you? To begin to believe that they had a better shot at life if you werent there to influence them. What do you do when you think the best thing you could do for your child is leave before they start to pick up your mannerisms? Never trust anyone. Rage over constant nonsense because your anger is overflowing with no real target. Never feel comfortable in public to the point where you think everyone you come into eye contact with is preparing to assault you. To be a complete emotional wreck. Well, she took care of that for me a week ago and left with my son.  

I'm now jobless. Soon to be homeless. My car broke down and doesnt move so when the time comes Ill have to scrap it and trash the belongings I cant carry. I cant handle this anymore. It's so hard. No one wants me. No one cares about me. Who can blame them at this point? I was raised to be a piece of shit. My son is too young for him to even remember me, my wife doesnt care, and anyone impacted by my passing would get over it, as is the way of the world. Even they will die eventually, so ending my life would leave no permanent damage to anyone, because everyone and everything eventually ends. When I was younger there would be small things that would alleviate my anxiety. Books, hiding in my closet when dad was drunk... the only true relief Ive felt in YEARS, YEARS AND YEARS, was when I fully decided to end my life instead of just considering the act. I can see an end point. The feeling was intense warmth like I had never felt. I actually felt happy because I felt like I was on the final sprint of a race that refused to end. There is no sadness when I contemplate my death. Just acceptance. The hollow words I've left here dont begin to compare to what Ive had to live through, but it gives a remote idea. 
I've lived just over a quarter of a century and can count on one hand how many times Ive felt real happiness. I both treasure and detest those memories. I treasure them because of the brief reprieve from the shitstorm that is and has been my life. I detest them because I feel like I might have been better off if I had never known happiness at all. To never know that there was something else in life. What was the point of having the experience if it barely lasted long enough to remember? I'm a 26 year old male who is supposed to be in the prime of his life. Shaping his future. Instead I still feel like I'm a scared 10 yr old little boy who has no idea why everyone is screaming and I just want someone to fucking hold me and tell em that everything will be ok, even if I dont believe it. I just want the PAIN to stop. I NEED it to stop. All of the voices screaming at me that I'm not good enough, that I'm worthless. I can't function anymore. This feeling is crippling. I JUST WANT IT TO STOP.
