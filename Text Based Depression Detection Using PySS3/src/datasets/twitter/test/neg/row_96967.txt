Everything I encounter today makes me want to kill myself.Itâ€™s as if everything is bad news, even if itâ€™s not. Iâ€™m sick of everything. I just donâ€™t fucking want to BE anymore. I donâ€™t want to exist. But I wonâ€™t go as far as to ideation this time. I havenâ€™t been in that place in a long time, and I donâ€™t want to go back.
