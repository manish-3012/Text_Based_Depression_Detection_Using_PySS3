Twin sister and I are both suicidal, feeling awful right nowIâ€™ve been depressed since I was 12. I am now 17. Before anyone says â€œget help,â€ please know that I canâ€™t, and it is just too much to explain. My mom knows, but when she found out I was feeling this way, she ignored it.  

I want to kill myself. But I feel that if I do, my sister will. And that will destroy our family. My sister is also suicidal, which I only found out a week or so ago. I honestly donâ€™t get it because as far as I know, my family does not have a history of depression. It makes me question if this is genetic, and if it is, then am I never going to get better unless I take meds?? I donâ€™t want to take meds and my mom doesnâ€™t believe in meds for depression... she thinks they turn you into a â€œzombieâ€. 

I just feel like I just canâ€™t go on anymore- I havenâ€™t felt happy for an entire day for years. I donâ€™t know how to feel happy. Doing small things donâ€™t even make me happy. I fear the future and I feel that I am going to be extremely unsuccessful and poor. I hide behind a smile every single day and itâ€™s getting really tiring, especially when Iâ€™m nice to everyone because I never want anyone to feel the way I do. Everyone just sees me as the nice, cute girl who is kind to everyone. 

I wish there was a way to just press a button and disappear. I canâ€™t take this anymore.
