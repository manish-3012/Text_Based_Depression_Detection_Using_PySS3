What if they find out I'm faking it?I'm terrified of how I'm feeling.

A bit of a background:  I had gotten to a pretty dark place almost a year ago.  My wife (I'm in my early 40s) pleaded to me to get help, and I did. I went on meds which, at first, intensified my suicidal thoughts but the dosage was upped and I felt I was getting better. I also started with a therapist --I've been doing cognitive behavioral therapy with her and that seems to have helped.  In fact, you could say that I was on a total upswing...

... until now. I feel like I'm spiraling out of control with my feelings. Work was tolerable before but now it's not. (My manager got laid off a month ago and I don't get along with my replacement supervisor or team.) I feel like there's no future for me where I work, and I'm frightened of going back out into the rest of the world to get a new job to only suffer more rejection. Work wasn't the best, but at least it was safe. Now -- not so much anymore.

And I feel the days getting shorter. Daylight Saving Time ends this Sunday and the clocks fall back - meaning it gets darker an hour earlier.  And it causes anxiety when I look at my day and see how little I've accomplished before the sun sets.  I don't know how I'll cope.

The worst thing? I volunteer with a youth group. Have been for a while. The kids are great and they've looked up to me.  I've been an adult they can talk to who isn't a parent and who won't be judgmental. Some of them have gone through some tough times and have confided in me because I've been a constant who can help them.

And I feel so fake because I try to help them see the big picture -- that everything will be okay. That there is hope. That they have their lives ahead of them to make good choices and thrive.  And they believe me. Yet I'm feeling no hope and no future for me.

What if they find out that I'm faking it?

I don't know if there's any answer to this. I just needed to let this out I guess. Thanks for reading...
