Everyday is a struggle.Sitting here at 3am and just like almost every other night sleep evades me. I feel like captain Ahab looking for moby dick, but my white whale is sleep and it beyond my reach. Being on such a fucked up sleep schedule only compounds my depression and every day I wonder what I'm doing here. Oh yeah and since all the people I know are on normal schedules I usually dont reply to texts (because its 1pm and I'm probably asleep) or honestly I dont care. Caring is also something that's hard to come by these days for me. The moments I seemingly do are fleeting and never last long enough to make serious plans with anyone. So, I've lost friends and I cant blame them. Who wants to be around someone clearly faking being happy and with nothing positive to say? I don't. Everyday is a struggle and everyday I have to find something worth living for. I know it can get better with time, but time is something I just feel like I dont have a lot of.
