Thereâ€™s nothing more I want from lifeEverything I do for â€œfunâ€ no longer makes me feel happy instead it makes me feel sad. Itâ€™s like the part of my brain responsible for pleasure has stopped working. Iâ€™m tired of having to work for this so called â€œhappinessâ€ in life. I hate seeing the bitches in my school and church get everything handed to them on a silver platter while they abuse the living shit out of others for their own â€œhappinessâ€. Thereâ€™s no material item that I want in this world and I no longer feel mental satisfaction from studying or trying on new clothes after dieting or learning something new. Iâ€™m just slowly rotting to death every single day.
