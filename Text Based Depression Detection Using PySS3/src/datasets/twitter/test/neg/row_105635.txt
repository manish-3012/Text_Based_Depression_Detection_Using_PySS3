CrisisI want to kill myself. I don't have anyone I can talk to. None of my friends like me or care to respond to my texts or ask me to hang out. I don't know what I do that is so unlikeable but no one likes me. I'm ugly too. Also I'm crazy. I keep having these moments of crisis like I'm in right now where every negative thought I have comes to a head and the reality of my situation( that no one likes me, I have no one) becomes to much to bare and I want to kill myself. I called my ex boyfriend 20+ times in the last hour because I am suicidal and don't know what else to do. I called and texted my dad and he didn't answer. I texted friends but they don't respond To my normal texts anyways. I'm an ugly 27 year old crazy female with no career, living in a basement, no friends and no direction. Like there is no reason for me to not kill myself.
