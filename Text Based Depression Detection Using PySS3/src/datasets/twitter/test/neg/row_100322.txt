The only person who has ever cared about me just died...I grew up in an abusive home with my four siblings. My father was an alcoholic and a drug addict, and was very physically abusive, and because of this I wasn't able to make any friends. Three of my siblings became very cold and hated each other, and me. My older brother however became my best, and only friend, he helped me get away from my father as much as he could, and he did his best to take care of me when I was injured or distressed, without ever asking for anything in return. No one else has ever cared about me, the few other people who I thought I had become friends with, were only using me, or taking advantage of me.

My brother recently died in a car accident. I was the only member of my family who came to the funeral. I have never been more sad and alone, and I haven't gone a day without sobbing over his grave. I am highly considering suicide right now, I feel like it's the only way I will ever be able to end my sadness, and hopefully see him again. I just want to end it.
