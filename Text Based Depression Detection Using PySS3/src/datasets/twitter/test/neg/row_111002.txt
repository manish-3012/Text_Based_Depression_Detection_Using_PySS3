I sound stupid and whiny I just had to say it all.I'm 15 my grandmother is dying I've already tried to hang myself and I failed it seams like nobody cares and my mom is to consumed with work to notice I cry myself to sleep about every night my dad died when I was 9 and I feel like I failed him like he'd be disappointed in me and shun me from the family cause I'm not some athletic sports steroid pumping superstar with a trophy case my grandfather barely remembers who I am the only reason he does is because of a hat I wear. My girlfriend is cheating on me with 3 other people and whenever I try to talk to someone about it they shake their head at me and just don't notice and will change the subject instantaneously everything seams like its getting worse and worse and like its just gonna all collapse in front of me and I can't do anything about it.
