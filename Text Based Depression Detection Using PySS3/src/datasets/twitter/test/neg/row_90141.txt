I think I'm doneI don't even know why I'm typing this. I guess to get it off my chest. I've been thinking about suicide for a while now. My life isn't really that bad. It's just that I always feel bad about things that I do. 

Backstory: I've always had my way. Even when my sister came around (she's now 7, turning 8 in a few days, and I'm 15). I'm always mean to her. And I always feel bad after. The worst thing is, she isn't even related. It hurts. I always wonder how she feels with her big brother always hurting her.

And I've always hurt my friends. Sometimes emotionally, like with my old best friend who finally had enough and moved on. I guess she got tired of me. And the ones who are still around I stopped talking to. I just can't anymore. I've even hit some of them. And I feel bad after, but can never apologise.

And I live in a bad part of town. I go to a nice school on the nice end of town, nice students, uniforms, the whole thing. And I'm going back next year. I always feel out of place, since I'm the only one from my end of town, and how I talk, walk, act, and the music I listen to is way different then all of them. I'm always the odd one out, since I'm always on edge.

So, given it all, I'm thinking of ending it. And why not? I could take all my parents pills, and be dead in an hour. And nothing is stopping me. 

If I have to give a time when I'll be dead, I'll either not go through with it (unlikely) or be dead within 48 hours. 

So this might be goodbye, everyone.
