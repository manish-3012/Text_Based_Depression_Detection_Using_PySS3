Having a flashback. Need support.I need support. Iâ€™m spiraling. Iâ€™m having a flashback.

I was with a man for five years who turned out to be very abusive but in a completely underhanded way. He had me convinced that everything was all in my head. I was completely isolated for years and his abuse broke the ptsd wide open. I guess Iâ€™ve had symptoms since I was a kid (bad childhood) but I didnâ€™t know about any of it until him. Itâ€™s been six months since I left him and most of the time I can function fine but every once and a while this pain will kick in and it comes back. Right now I feel like Iâ€™m sitting in the spare room back in that house. I can feel the walls. Alone, hopeless and in too much pain but pretending everything is fine, sidetracking myself and numbing the pain, because Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s all my fault. Iâ€™m sitting in that room and I canâ€™t get out. I can feel the walls around me. Itâ€™s dark. Heâ€™s either sleeping or not home and Iâ€™m alone. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m there and I canâ€™t breathe.
