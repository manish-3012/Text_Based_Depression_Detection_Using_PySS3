I'm going to hurt my friend because I'm a cowardI have attempted suicide before and I still feel as hopeless as I did then, if not more. I plan to do it and do it right sometime within the next few months. 

My relationship with my family has almost entirely collapsed (which is a big reason why I feel suicidal, but I won't get into that) so I'm not scared about hurting them when I'm gone. I have a few friends, but I don't think I would impact most of them too negatively if I ended it. But I do have one friend who I know I'm going to hurt a lot, and I feel like dirt every time I think of how my death would make them feel.

This friend is the only person who realizes how depressed I am, and they are always offering their support and doing what they can to try and make me feel happy and cared for. They are nothing but kind to me, and I can't thank this person enough for being my friend.

Despite having an amazing friend like this one, they are pretty much the only bright spot in my life. The rest of my life is becoming shittier each and every day. It's only become worse since I first attempted to take my life, and I want to be successful this time if I do it again. I love my friend so much for the positives they have brought into my life, but the good in my life is far outweighed by the bad in it and I feel a strong need to let go. 

I just really hope this person would be able to handle my suicide. Nothing else bothers me about ending it. I have to let them know how much I appreciate them before I die. I hope I don't change their personality, because they are a great person and the world needs more people like them.
