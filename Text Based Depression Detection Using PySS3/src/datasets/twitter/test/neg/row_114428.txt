Happy 22th birthday to me..So yea, todays my birthday, a total of 6 people.. out of 1100 on facebook whished me, 3/4 of them family members.. if that doesn't hit the nail on the coffin what does. to think i knew all those people, and to not get asked if im doing anything, wishing me anything, or even getting a message hurts, you know.. it hurts quite abit. It really does make you think that you wouldn't effect anybodys lifes if i just vanished.. nobody would notice, nobody would care, it fucking hurts
