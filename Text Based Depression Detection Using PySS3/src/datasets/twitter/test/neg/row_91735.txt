23, DUI, shit job, my friends are pessimists.I just got home from a show some of my high school friends are playing on a tour through the country. I'm a musician as well, and I feel like my friends are distancing themselves from  me in order to make better connections. These guys I've known for years just treat me like shit and call me gay now. I don't know what happened. I'm not gay, I'm just a sensitive dude. I got a DUI in August and I have court next week, probably the last hearing. I feel like such a worthless piece of shit, and I'm turning here after learning that you can't kill yourself with a toaster in the bathtub. I'm afraid of myself, my asshole friends, and the very real possibility that I'm going to die like this. Sad, and fucked up. My Job prospects are greatly diminished now that I'm going to have a record, and my baseline feels like a state where I'm just wishing I had a gun. I sound negative, and I've been trying to get into mindfulness recently. Ordered a few books and I've been practicing meditation. But, now I just feel like I'm fucked and stuck here. My friends suck, my job sucks, and my car is trashed. I have to come with enough money to pay for all this DUI bullshit, and all I want to do is to fucking die. I feel melodramatic when I try to explain to people how I really feel, but it's the truth. I come from a fucked up family just like everyone else, but I don't think I can take it as much as most people seem to be able to.
