ProcrastinatingTruth is, I don't really want to do it. I thought I did earlier tonight and was going to. I had everything I needed and I was waiting until midnight. I went to call my mom and got my uncle instead and then I didn't want to at that point because I'd want to at least talk to my mom first. Or I am procrastinating. I *am* procrastinating. I keep procrastinating saying I'll do it at 1am, I'll do it at 2 am, I'll do it after I figure out if this will work or if that will work or after I send this message. 

I've thought of many options, but this one will always work, but I can't. Or I can. I don't know if I can. I tried before once. Not with heroin but with percocets. I took 57 and I survived. And from then on, I was convinced I was invincible because who the fuck survives 57 percs? It was weird, divine maybe. I fell asleep but not all the way, I could hear my breathing. I couldn't sleep. I laid there four hours, high as a kite. I sat up to read the clock, got nauseous with that motion and puked everything. And I fell asleep. And I woke up. Crazy right? But no one pukes IV heroin taken with xanax, so I'll die for real this time. And I worry that I might get some revelation after I shoot up and realize that I don't want to do this but it'll be too late by then. I don't know if I can.
