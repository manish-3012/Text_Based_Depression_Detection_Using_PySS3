I feel like I only have 1 hope to keep me hereIâ€™m a 30 yo male and the weight is unbearable. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ve made it this far. Everything in my life seems fine from an outside perspective probably. I exercise 4 to 5 days a week, have a few great close friends and a great family. Not bragging but Iâ€™ve been with a lot of attractive women that other guys consider â€œbucket list girls.â€ Havenâ€™t had sex in 6 months though, and not by choice.

The problem is that Iâ€™ve always longed to love someone and them love me back. Iâ€™ve always been sad because of it and always fantasized about suicide. In the last 2 years it has gotten much worse. At that time I met a girl that I love very much but she doesnâ€™t seem to want me the same way. Sheâ€™s hot and cold towards me. But, I finally felt pure joy and excitement to be around another person. The first time ever! I absolutely adore her.

I mentioned the attractive girls in order to describe her as â€œmiddle of that packâ€ but definitely still very pretty and a beautiful body. Itâ€™s not shallow at all though, my feelings for her are immensely deep to the point where I literally canâ€™t enjoy a single second of my life if I feel like I canâ€™t have her. Itâ€™s constant pain and she has been in my mind all day, every day since the day I met her. I finally tasted what it could be like to be happy. If we were together every single aspect of life would be pleasurable, I know this because it felt that way for a period of time when we were at our best. But now that I know what that feels like and that I canâ€™t have that now, I feel like thereâ€™s no point to anything at all. Itâ€™s like my chance finally came and itâ€™s slipping away. It all probably sounds silly but Iâ€™m just kinda.... getting through life. 

I want to share my thoughts of suicide with her. I see her all the time since we work together and hang out outside of work some. Sheâ€™s the only person Iâ€™m comfortable speaking to about it. I had it all planned out and had written 2 suicide notes (1 for her and 1 for friends and family) to provide everyone with a sense of closure. I just couldnâ€™t find a way to make sure they saw the notes after I was gone without finding my body. 

I donâ€™t want to put pressure on her, become a burden to her, or make her feel like itâ€™s her fault but I somehow want her to know that I plan on taking my life if I canâ€™t be with her. Iâ€™m afraid sheâ€™ll think Iâ€™m just wanting attention or threatening her or being manipulative. But Iâ€™m also afraid of pushing her away completely which I know there will be no bouncing back from. It will cause an indefinite suffering and thereâ€™s no possible way I could make it through that. But I care about her and love her. Iâ€™ve met so many people that I know sheâ€™s my only shot. I would rather die before seeing my only experience of love being shared with someone else. What do I do? I know it doesnâ€™t make much sense but I promise sheâ€™s the only one that can give me the happy, healthy, effortless, productive life Iâ€™ve always dreamed of. Or her self-removal from my life will cause pure misery until I relieve it myself. I will have no choice but to kill myself if she wonâ€™t be with me. How do I tell her this?
