I have no worth so my death won't matterI did good things in my life. Military service, community service, donations, stuff like that and a lot of it. It was all to fill this void that I had. An empty black pit. That pit was my self-esteem. 

I've since given up on filling up that pit. It can't be sated. So death seems better. No one to judge me, no more anxiety, no more wasted weekends laying in bed with the lights off staring at the ceiling, quietly wishing that IED blew up you instead of the guy on your right. 

Funny isn't it. A guy who probably wasn't so fucked up mentally blew up downrange and I got away with some shrapnel and no long standing wounds. Oh well, the world is cruel. 

Nobody will actually miss another dead young man. They never do.
