I cant take it anymoreHumans are wired to not fucking listen. Every one who has tried to help has only told their own shit off their chest instead, they never just stop and listen. human conversation is just the other waiting for the next quiet place to Start talking next. Its just nature. People have said they cared but they dont really they just act like they do. even when help does come its not forever. Mental hospitals, suicide hot lines, suicide web sites dont not help at all. They just make every thing worse. Retarded anxiety and meditating techniqes only make the time between your death a little bigger. At least this reddit is honest about every thing.

No one wants to really help. They just want to make them self look good. Its human nature. Fuck every one I want it to be over already.
