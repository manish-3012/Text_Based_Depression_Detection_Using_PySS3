I've just created an account so that I can join r/SuicideWatch. I am a burden and don't deserve/want to live, but I don't want to hurt my family by committing suicide.First of all i want to apologise for the crap writing. I used to be a literature student and loved writing, but i just cant be bothered anymore, and the fatigue and cognitive dysfunction stops me from being able to do it properly anyway. its embarrassing but meh who cares. 

...tldr; im ill, i have no hope of getting better, every day is torture, and i can't kill myself because i would leave behind the only two people left and it would break them. also the world deserves better...

 3 years ago I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, after falling ill the day before my 18th birthday. The following year, at university, I lost all of my friends (including those from home), who I presume ghosted me because they couldn't be arsed to deal with my illness any more. I also met the love of my life ( I am asexual so I wasn't suspecting this), who is the only person who actually cares about me besides my mother. The year after that, I dropped out of university- I couldn't keep up with the course because my illness combined with my depression made it impossible to do anything. Due to this, I also couldn't hold down a job. I am now almost completely bed bound, half due to the illness and the other half due to my disabling depression and anxiety. My partner works full time as well as caring for me, and has a rough time with his family, and so we are all each other has. I feel like I am a burden on him- he isnt even 21 yet and he is both employed full time as a labourer on a low wage and also an (almost)full time carer; he has his own health and mental problems that he has to deal with as well. In return, I can't even give him sex being as i am asexual, let alone support him by working, or even just keeping the house tidy. I love him more than anyone else on earth, including my self, and coulndt bear to leave him with the aftermath of my own suicide. We have already discussed the fact that we would both probably kill ourselves if the other died, because we couldnt cope. My mum is in a bad situation at the moment and is dealing with the death of her own mother (died on saturday evening) and grandmother (died during my first year at university, coincidentally at the same time that everything was happening with me). and she has always done her best for me, despite being a single mother, etc. I can't tell her the true extent of what i am going through, as it would break her heart to know how i really feel, and i couldnt imagine how much my suicide would break her heart. She would have no living relatives except for 1 estranged father and a handful of distant cousins that she hasnt heard from in years. I am not as close to her as she thinks i am, and i am hiding a lot of secrets from her. I want ti tell her but i care too much about how it would affect her. All in all, i feel like a burden to both of them, I am a failure, and i believe that my life is worthless, and would be better used by somebody else who needs a good chance at life. Obviously by killing myself there isnt miraculously going to be another person in my place, but at least i wouldnt be there to ruin our beautiful earth any more than it already is by humanity- it would be 1 less person adding on the strain. I also just dont want to exist because my existence right now is painful. I am in pain every minute of every day, and it can only get worse with a flare or whatever. I can't do the things i used to love, and i can't even do basic things to keep myself going. its now 4pm and i am still in bed, havent eaten or drank, havent taken my meds, or done anything, because i just can't do life by myself anymore. Every time i speak to anyone, i am constantly being judged for not looking good, for not being able to work, for being lazy and unproductive. My mind is on a constant loop of self hate that i can't tune out. I lay awake every night doing nothing until 7am because my brain doesnt work properly and i can't live normally. I dont want to be alive anymore. I will only spend the rest of my life- 60- 70 years - in the exact same state doing fuck all and being miserable and in pain. what is the point of living if i am constantly being tortured and simultaneously have no worth or purpose or meaning for being there. If it wasnt for my mum and my partner, i would already be dead. ive tried everything i can to keep on going. ive had all sorts of therapy and medication and alternative stuff and nothing is working. i am now being weaned off my antidepressants because they were too strong for my body to handle and werent doing enough for my mental health, and now my depression is even worse. my only relief is weed, which is both illegal and very expensive, and my mother doesnt know and doesnt agree with it. ive come to a standstill that i can't get past, and the only way out is suicide, which again, i can't do because of the pain it would cause to everyone else in my life that i actually care about. i wish i could just not exist or ever have existed.
