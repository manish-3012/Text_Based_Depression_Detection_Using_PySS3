I missed college application deadlines after a second extension.I feel so worthless right now because I know I brought this onto myself. I keep on thinking about how I could have submitted earlier if I didnâ€™t have a breakdown and pass out or if I just worked harder.

At the last minute 2/3 of the schools I wanted to apply to closed at 12:00 (deadline was 11:59). i applied to the last one but struggling with depression in earlier yrs mademy grades shit i am anuncompetitive applicant why would they want me

Itâ€™s all my fault. The deadlines were extended twice, first because of technical issues and second for a few campuses for some reason i dont know if only i worked faster ot did it earlier I always do this to myself Iâ€™m the only one I can blame for this and now I have to dealw ith the consequences just thinking about how my parents will react makes me feel like thereâ€™s nothing else i can do 

I know there are alternatives and iâ€™m trying to tell myself this I can transfer in or just go to that last school but the fact that I keep on doing this to myself putting things off til the last minute makes me feel like thereâ€™s not even a point. also how will my parents react i know theyw ill say its myfault and it is
