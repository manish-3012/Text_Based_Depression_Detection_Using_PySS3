Pain no moreI cant feel pain anymore. Music was my escape. But not anymore. Everything is going down. I cant stop the thought of me wanting to die, useless human being, selfish, foolish, trust people too much. I just want to be happy :) I come clean for 4 months, but recently everything was hard, I start cutting again, worse than before. I am scared of myself. Little voice inside is louder than before even music cant help it anymore. Im all alone.
