Tired of the pain ~ subconsciously ? sabotaging any good for myself to the point of no returnI'm in tears. The realization of how absolutely alone I am, how pathetic I've become. Anything I've had, I've lost or am close to losing - from family to possessions. My boyfriend just left me, and he was a piece of shit, and I would be better with out him, but right now it only confirms the pathetic state of my being.  I don't want to exist anymore.

I have a lot of childhood abuses from sexual abuse to PTSD from an alcoholic mom. My mom died of cirrhosis in my home, and that day I lost my best friend (codependent as an adukt). I cheated on my husband during her hospice care with an old friend because I wanted to feel anything but pain  He walked in and saw. A week later mom died. Husband left me and kids a year to the day later - I was a stay at home mom as he wanted me to be. The struggle has never stopped  

I've struggled with permanence at jobs. Then my older brother died (there were 4 of us and my mom). Then my younger brother got involved with drugs and moved out of state. He's now in prison for a long time several states away and our other remaining sibling is in another state - though she's half and after my other brother (also half) died it became clear that my younger bro and I were merely siblings in name only. We don't talk anymore.

. I've pushed everyone close to me away for fear of losing them also.
I lost my place to live and my job within 2 weeks of each other (bullying by female employees and the owner let our rental foreclose and lied about having made arrangements on defaukt) A friend 90 miles away I knew as a teen offered I stay with her, as my only option I did. my kids go to school and their dad is still in town so I had to leave them and unable to do my share of 50\50 custody  

The kids dad badmouths me to them because I haven't been able to see them all the time as I had. I finally find a job and get a reliable car (the other was breaking in every way and  couldn't make the 190 RT drive), only to lose my job a couple weeks later. I'm now unemployed with a car payment and I haven't seen my kids in over 6 weeks. I have no family or friends and my boyfriend, whom claimed to love me for 2.5 years, was cheating on me the whole time and just left me, being so absolutely cruel and hurtful to me. I'm "self righteous because I'm upset that he is sleeping at another females house.to

 I'm a good person, I've been told I'm beautiful and things should come easy in life, but I've never wanted to hurt anyone, take advantage of anyone, cause problems... I try to exist the best I can. But I'm tired of existing anymore. I've hurt, I've gotten up only to be pushed back down harder and lower than before. Something is saying I don't deserve it and reflecting on seeing that's in line with all that's happened in my life. Today my friends brother is moving in and I have to find someplace to go. I'm now penniless,  homeless with no job and family, my kids are being turned against me, and about to lose my car. I m broken. I'm sinking further in quicksand and beyond hopeless. Show me a glimmer of hope in all of this..
