Lost My Best Friend In A Bad State Of MindI just don't even know what to do anymore, a very close friend of mine was getting more and more ill and passed off four days ago. Every single day that moves on everything just feels more empty and there feels like there is an obvious void in my life. Before she was gone, if I stumbled into a dark state of mind like this she would remind me that she was still there, and that was one good thing in my life to live for at least. But now she's gone, and everything just feels meaningless I don't have a clue on what to do, my family doesn't care. Nobody does, it all feels like it would be better if I was just gone. Because right now I just hate life, it only brings me suffering.
