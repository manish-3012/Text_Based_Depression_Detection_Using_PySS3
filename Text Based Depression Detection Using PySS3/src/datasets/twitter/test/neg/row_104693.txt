How do people get over heartbreaks/break-ups without killing themselves?I've been in a relationship with an amazing girl for over 3 years now. This girl is the girl of my dreams, and whenever I think of getting old/older, she is there. She is my whole life, she is the only one I want. But she says her feelings are fading away, and though she "still loves me", she can never imagine herself being with me in the future, forming a family with me. She says our personalities clash, she says her feelings changed. I say her personality is my favorite in the world, and my feelings are stronger than ever. We're still together for the time being, but we're LDR now after living together for like 2.5 years. So pretty much, even though we're still technically together, the near future of the relationship is decided, her feelings are fading by the day, and I might never see her again. To add insult to injury, even though my relationship ending is the most depressing by far, I graduated a year ago, can't find a job for the life of me, had to leave the country of my dreams, and I have not a single friend besides her (not an exaggeration, I don't even have distant friends or acquaintances).

How do I not kill myself without her in my life? Logically, I know people break up, or die, every day and then they go through horrible heartbreak, maybe even worse than mine though it's hard to imagine that, but how am I personally supposed to go through it? I imagine my life now without her, I imagine my next year without her, then my next 5 years without her, then my next 20 years without her, and I just don't want to go on without her for even one more day, because ALL my plans and visions had her in it. And I know time heals, I really do, but I don't have time, because if I don't feel better right here and now, I can't bear this pain and I can't go on. So how do I deal with this? How does anyone? Does anyone know if getting depression meds/SSRIs would help at all in such an acute state of heartbreak, and how fast would be the relief? I just need to stop hurting because I am not mature or strong enough to take it, I really don't think I am.
