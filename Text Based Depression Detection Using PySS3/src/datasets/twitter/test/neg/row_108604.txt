Guilt over sexual actions when I was a kid. I'm really going to kill myselfIf you're curious, I have posted my whole story in other subreddits.  But I've finally given up finding a reason to live through all of this.  I am in a different situation than almost everyone else in the world, and almost everyone else who is suicidal.  I'm tainted with something that makes me a bad person no matter what I do in life.  What an embarrassment.   Anyways, I will not kill myself now, but I will be waiting for just a couple more years because I have to take care of some family stuff for awhile.  I already have chosen the date.  Once that date comes, goodbye!  

Thanks for reading.  Please note: I will not see a therapist, the idea is too embarrassing for me, and would probably just make life worse.  Also I hold myself to high standards in life, so there is no point in continuing as a tainted individual who has to have so much guilt and worry, that kind of life just isn't for me.  I'd rather be tortured in a concentration camp. Lol. 

Once again, thanks for reading my attention seeking bullshit lame-ass weak minded post.
