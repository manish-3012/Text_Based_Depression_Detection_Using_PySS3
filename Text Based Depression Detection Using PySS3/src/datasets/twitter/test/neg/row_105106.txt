My storyI havent had a bad life. Honestly. All things considered, I have been very fortunate. But, it still happened. That thought, that gaping blackness that lurks within all our minds rose up and took me in its grasp twice in my life. Twice I have looked death in the face, and emerged scathed, yet alive. Able to learn and move on. 

Both tines were because of a girl. Different girls each tine, but two I deeply cared for. Both were friends, and I quickly fell in love with them. They had the exact makeup to be my type: witty, sassy, sweet, caring, and always trying to make other smile. But when I finally got up the nerve to confess my feelings, they turned their backs on me. Both times, I thought about killing myself. Seriously considered it. In fact, I recall having a pair of scissors open on my neck, crying into a mirror. And I changed my mind. Just yesterday, I started crying at work and had to pause and look at my mom, completely oblivious to my pain, to bring me back from considering again. 

I an a 23 year old white man. Never had a girlfriend, nor kiss, nor relationship of any kind. Have body image issues related to my "manhood", and was raised in a religion that teaches lust and desire are sure fire tickets to hell. 

Perhaps I am not as important as others, but I wanted to say I struggle with this thought as well. Most do. The trick is to decide to keep going. It gets better. I know that sounds like a cliche, but I genuinely believe it. Don't give up. Fight on. Because one day, you will emerge victorious. 

I have faith in you. All of you. Have some in yourselves, and I catch you later. Have a good day, try and smile.
