I think about the endless wheelCircling around and around. The outcome is the same no matter the terrain. A pervading sense of a foregone conclusion.



Arrive home. Stay positive. Go back to work. Stay positive. Focus on your own lane. Don't look into the bowl of your neighbour. Negative thoughts manifest a negative outcome. A cruel reminder that I create my reality and no matter what I am exactly where I should be.



 "Everything will change in the next 4 to 6 months". Stay positive. Shrug it off. Don't take yourself so seriously. Be the fool. Be grateful. Stick to your rituals. Pretend to dream about the future. Call old friends. Go see aging relatives ("they're getting older..."). Stay positive. Give her a baby. Take risks. Dream. Stay positive. Move on. Go to work. Dream big. Breathe. The abrupt silence as disorienting as the noise had been. Relax. 



redundancy. recurring song lyrics. someone elses songs. not my words. i do not want my own songs. 



silence. laughter. do not draw attention. do not give them anything solid.
