What nowI feel like I keep rehashing this over and over so long story short. I am agoraphobic so human interaction is a no go most of the time. Due to the fact that my wife is avoiding me because I am terrible person conversation there just gets lost. I love my son but he deserves so much better. I am on Prozac and metropinal but still depressed with horribly low peak and my high peaks are usually agitation and ignorance with or without large quantities of alcohol. Pretty much I've reached the point of is my life insurance worth the people I do like suffering for multiple more years with me. There is still some apprehension but not much and honestly I have always had someone around which has prevented it up till now. I don't really know what to expect I am already medicated and therapied
