ContemplationBefore I begin this, let me say I am not attempting suicide at this moment, more like I am contemplating it and making sure I keep that door open.


About 2 weeks ago I was walking down the sidewalk when I witnessed a horrible car crash. A small compact car got T-boned by a pickup truck who ran a red light. The smaller car was so completely crumpled there was no doubt in my mind the driver was killed, and thats when it hit me.

I didnt care. In fact I started fantasizing about if that was me. I realized that I simply wouldnt give a shit if that had been me. I actually LIKED the sound of it. I would be killed, I wouldnt have the shame of suicide hanging over my families head, and I wouldnt have to deal with my life anymore.


Since then I have contemplated suicide multiple times, once I even went as far as holding a gun to my head, but only putting it back down when my beloved dog ran up to me and asked me to rub her belly.


I guess I am not asking for help, I just felt like I needed to tell someone this. Sorry if it doesnt belong here, but I have no one IRL to talk to about it, and it just feels good to let someone know what Im dealing with right now.
