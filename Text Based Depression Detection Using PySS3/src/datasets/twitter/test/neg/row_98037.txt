i called cops on my boyfriend because he told me he was going to kill himself and hung up. He wont forgive me.Now he hates me and is in the hospital now and got me kicked out of his room and says he wants to break up. his mom is also really upset with me calling me the reason he wanted to kill himself. I only called because I was worried and had no idea where he was and i'm 40 mins away with no car. we have dated for 4 years. He wanted to kill himself due to continuous bullying he has had from his sister. we are also moving in together in a week and already signed the lease.
