I can't keep goingI was diagnosed with bpd at the age of 18, and I'm currently struggling with high school, I live in a place where nobody understands you and makes fun of you for having a mental health issue, it's shitty, cutting and smoking don't work, the meds don't work, and my best friend who was the only person who helped me through this miserable life killed himself, I don't know what to do anymore.
