I can't stop thinking about suicideI'm male, 22.  I've had depression since high school but didn't really know it until it was explained to me recently.  Probably the reason why is because I don't think I have a good reason to be depressed.  I have a family who cares for me; a mother and twin sister.  Lately (since maybe the middle of last year), I've been having on and off thoughts about suicide.  Thinking about how I would go about it, why it would be justified, who it would affect etc.  It used to be every other week and bothered me, but now, any time that I'm not preoccupied with something, I'm thinking about suicide.  It didn't even bother me until I the night that I realised that I had been laying awake in bed for four hours thinking of how to do it.  

My depression seems to stem mostly from boredom, as silly as that sounds.  I hate the idea of nihilism, thinking life is meaningless and blaming the world for your problems, but it seems I became a nihilist subconsciously. Though, I blame myself rather than the world.  The world had nothing to do with the state that I've gotten myself into.  I'm lazy, incompetent at everything and can't finish anything I've started.  I find that I can't think of any state of being in which I'm satisfied and enjoying living.  The only thing I enjoy is my hobbies, but playing videogames, writing and building model kits isn't exactly the most fulfilling of lives. 

Aside from that, I feel like my family is disappointed in me.  I can't support my mother, my sister resents me for some reason that I'm unaware of, but tries to act like she cares, and the rest of my family sees me as a failure and speak to me in passive aggressive language and condescending stares.  I'm unemployable due to only having an equivalent of year twelve certificate as a result of dropping out of high school and completing a college equivalent course instead.  I'm also too old to be underpayed, but too young to have experience, so no place will hire me with only some volunteer work on my resume.  As a result, I'm living off of government benefits like a leech.  

I'm in university now, studying Languages and Linguistics, but I'm too lazy and forgetful, and end up procrastinating with all of my work.  The only reason I'm attending university is so that I can apply for the Japan Exchange Teaching (JET) programme in hopes that living in another country for a few years will let me experience a different kind of life, a fresh start so to speak.  I want to see if I can enjoy life somewhere else.  I've already planned to kill myself at the end of my contract and written a letter to my family which I have stashed in a locked drawer in my desk.  I don't know how yet, but the most convincing ways seem to be jumping from a building or something less dramatic like cutting my arteries and then taking sleeping pills to pass away quietly.  

I know I have to talk to someone and sort it out, but I can't bring myself to, and I don't know why.   
I don't know if it's to do with not wanting pity, not seeming needy, not wanting people to feel burdened by me and my emotional state, but I've always struggled talking about my feelings.  I can't even bring myself to say "I love you" or even just "thank you" to my family a lot of the time, let alone tell them that I'm in despair and planning to kill myself.  I want to go see a professional but every time I tell myself I will, my feet won't move.  

I've reasoned myself into a hole.  I believe my family will get over my passing after a while, just as we've all gotten over the grief of losing some loved ones before.  I haven't seen any of my good friends for years outside of occasional facebook chats as I've lived in a different state from them for the past six years so my passing wouldn't impact their lives at all.  All my friends in this state are no more than acquaintances that I have occasional small talk with and wouldn't really miss me.  I graduate in one year and six months from now, and then there's a countdown of about five years maximum to change my mind.    
I'm sorry for the essay-length life story post and don't expect you to help, I just felt like I need someone to know.  Even if it is just preaching to faceless anonymous strangers on the internet.
