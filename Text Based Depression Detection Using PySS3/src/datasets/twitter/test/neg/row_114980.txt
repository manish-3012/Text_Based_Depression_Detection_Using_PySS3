I'm tired of this life but I'm too much of a pussy ass bitchI just can't fucking do it. Life is miserable and hopeless, full of fake friends and people who couldn't care less if you were in their life or not. Part of me hopes that I'm wrong, but more often than not it's the actions that speak louder than words. If anyone really cared they would show it, or at least make an effort. Blatant lies and broken promises. 

The only thing stopping me from finishing the job is that I'm a little bitch. I can't  handle a rope or a bullet on the off chance that I'll survive and become a vegetable. People who do attempt are the bravest fucking souls in the universe. Everyone dies and has to face the afterlife eventually, but doing it on your own terms is next fucking level. If only there was something quick and reliable.
