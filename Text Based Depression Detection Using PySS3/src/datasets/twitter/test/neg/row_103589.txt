Friendship over and can't live without themFriendship with best friend of over 8 years has just ended. I am the reason the friendship has ended. I am heartbroken. He has been my major support system throughout my life. I have had feelings for him the entire friendship but never had it in me to tell him. His feelings are shared. Ive always seen myself as someone who people deserve better than.  I have made so many mistakes and now I have lost contact with him. The thought of him being better off without me is unbearable. I can't fucking live without him. They are diagnosed with the same illnesses as me and they are the only person who understands me 100%. 
This has just been the icing on the cake of things that have been making my life a living hell. I have been in extensive treatment for 8 months. I have been attending group therapy weekly and individual therapy. I should feel lucky but it hasn't made my life anymore worth living or helped me with any coping skills. I feel like if all this treatment hasn't helped then I have exhausted all options.I feel tired of fighting. This is the darkest my life has been and I see no light at the end of the tunnel. Every night has been unbearable and I'm exhausted.
I have bought the means to end my life. I have written them a letter. I need them to know how much i care about them. I keep trying to distract myself but the thought of them keeps returning. I feel trapped because I can't afford a hospital bill if I were to go get help. I'm currently at work and I'm scared to go back home when my shift ends because I don't have fighting another night left in me.
