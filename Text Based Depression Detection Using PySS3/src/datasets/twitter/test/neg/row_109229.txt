[TRIGGER WARNING] The humiliating story of why I am sitting here in tears about to kill myself... (crosspost /r/depression)This is hard to type because I can't really collect my thoughts, there is so much anxiety coursing through my mind right now, but I need to get this off my chest. So I'm going to try.

---

To try to make this as least complicated as possible, I'm going to try to not ramble into details as much as I can, but forgive me if I do.

Over the past year and change, I have been suffering depression that started that way and has since started to develop or reveal previously existing PTSD syndromes.
I experienced a very painful, sudden, and outright abusive breakup on her end, and it hurt me deep. I had never had anyone close to me before; my mother is an alcoholic and my dad physically abused the hell out of me as a kid so he's gone now. (Hence the PTSD, btw)

Leading up to now, this year, I have experienced extreme personal trauma and abuse in important and close relationships on if not just a monthly basis, even more frequently than that lately. Close friends with their own problems, romantic relationships that nearly started but ended before because, again, personal problems. And in each of these, I took just heaping amounts of person abuse. Berated for things about myself that I hate, intentionally saying things that they knew would hurt me really deeply, some of the more mentally ill people got really vicious and terrifying.

...

Anyway, so for the past few weeks, I had been feeling extremely lonely, and missing my girlfriend still, and my depression was hitting rock bottom. SO in one of my nights of loneliness, I went to one of those fuck cam sites with girls in chat rooms and shit and just kind of hung out. 
There was this cute girl whose thumbnail I saw and to be honest my libido was dead and she was just hanging out not really doing the cam girl thing. I started to do this a lot, until for a while I was in there almost every night for at least a couple hours.

And I tipped her, a lot. I mean; *I sent this girl probably over a thousand dollars*. Because I started to relate to her. She was/is clearly very depressed as well. And she seemed to be struggling in her life the way I was, so I wanted to be supportive, which she told me she was appreciative of and all that, and we would chat privately and stuff and text during the day on Snapchat, so it seemed like we were getting along.

But over the weekend there was night where she seemed especially sad/lonely, so while we were chatting, I offered to talk to her if she needed someone and said I would help in anyway I could. And what surprised the shit out of me, is that she was...extremely offended. Like, at first she sort of brushed it off in hindsight (which I couldn't tell - she was very vague about "security and not having any leaks" so I thought, uh ok,  I mean, pretty sure you're not going to get hacked...), so I said oh well if chatting here isn't secure enough, I could see if there is a more reliable program or something. And then she just lost her shit, said I didn't respect her boundaries, was pushing etc. 
Meanwhile, I'm at a loss for words, but I told her anyway, hey sorry, I just meant thought you were worried about hacks etc., we can always talk here blah blah which seemed to cool things down.

But I felt uncomfortable at this point, and so last night, I got on, PMed her and said, hey how are you and all that, and then I said, I don't think I can come back, the nature of this is too personal for me now but you're like pushing me back at arm's length, and it's causing me a good deal of pain, so I need to move along.

And she just like...ripped me in half. Told me how entitled I was. Just all this shit over and over. Like she said something about having been stalked, and the whole time, I'm just sitting...speechless. So I just left.

I got drunk, and she snapchatted me something an hour or so later. then I replied with something like "I'm sorry I didn't mean to disrespect you. I just wanted to help, because I can tell that you feel the same sort of things that I feel. I know you value your privacy, but if you really do need help, I can send you websites where you can find therapy, and if you don't have insurance or something, I'll gladly contribute enough so that you can go. I think you are a good person, just one that's hurt right now. But you can get through this and you can just again, I promise."

so when I woke up this morning, I got this message back yelling at me, saying what a piece of shit I am, how ignorant I am, how I have no idea what I'm talking about, continued to go on about how I was pressing her for personal info. (???), THEN took to twitter to start publicly bashing me, to which all her pathetic drone ass fanboys started piling on, and well...here we are.

This isn't what killed me. A life of trauma and depression and abuse did. This is just the straw the broke the camel's back. But I can't take it anymore. This is a big blow, and its the knock out one, I cant. I cant face myself anymore after this. I'm just shit. A piece of human scum. An alone, worthless scumbag human being.

tl;dr - abused entire life, emotionally hurt and abused constatnly heavily by friends/family this year especially recently, started an internet friendship with a camgirl that I sent over a thousand dollars to, was publicly betrayed and mocked. Now going to kill myself.
