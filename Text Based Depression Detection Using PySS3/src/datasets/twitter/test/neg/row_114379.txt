Iâ€™m tired of living for other peopleHow can I just let go and stop worrying about having to put others through my death? Iâ€™m not happy, Iâ€™m not normal, I donâ€™t deserve a place on this planet and Iâ€™m tired of breathing. I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m still sitting here living for a bunch of people that would move on a month after I was gone. I just wish I was born in a normal household, with normal parents. Iâ€™m a perfect example of what happens when someone gets beaten down and rejected their whole life. Iâ€™m just a broken person and I want it to end. If tired of being the â€œfunnyâ€/â€œhappyâ€ one of the group while I canâ€™t even tell anyone anything cause that would just make them think even less of me than they already do
