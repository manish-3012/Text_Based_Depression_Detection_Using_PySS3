life isnâ€™t even bearable anymoreiâ€™ve been in so much pain since i was 9 years old. 5 years later and iâ€™m still in pain. i know people have it worse. i know people experience things that are worse than iâ€™ve ever experienced, but iâ€™m sick of hearing that. iâ€™m sick of hearing that my feelings arenâ€™t fucking valid because iâ€™m young.

from the moment i wake up, to the moment i go to bed, iâ€™m in so much emotional pain that itâ€™s hard to cope. thereâ€™s always this heavy weight on my chest, suicidal thoughts race through my head. iâ€™m so sick of living. iâ€™m so fucking tired of life, how long is this pain gonna last? itâ€™s like it doesnâ€™t have an end. iâ€™m a tiny insignificant dot in the universe, it wouldnâ€™t matter if i was gone anyway. iâ€™ve gone through 3 inpatient hospitalizations, countless medication changes, two therapists, almost 10 crisis evaluations, multiple suicide attempts, etc. iâ€™m sick of hearing life is worth living, thatâ€™s a fucking joke. iâ€™m sick of hearing MY life matters, it doesnâ€™t. iâ€™m one out of 7 BILLION PEOPLE on this planet, itâ€™s not gonna make a difference. everything is getting worse, thereâ€™s no way out. everyone says itâ€™s not gonna last forever. fuck off, please.

it literally feels like an effort to move my body at this point. things that used to be effortless require enormous amounts of energy to do, if i even build up the energy to do them. normally i donâ€™t, normally i canâ€™t. nobody understands how serious itâ€™s getting either. i try so hard to scream for help, but nobody realizes itâ€™s this bad. i canâ€™t do this for much longer, iâ€™m 5 years worth of tired. 

TLDR: iâ€™m 14, kinda wanna die, iâ€™ve lost energy and my will to live, itâ€™s not gonna get better, my life doesnâ€™t matter, etc.
