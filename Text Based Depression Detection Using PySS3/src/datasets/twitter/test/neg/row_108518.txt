Thereâ€™s no way outIdk even know what to say except I think I should plan my death soon because I see no way out right now. I donâ€™t give a fuck anymore. Iâ€™ve essentially stopped caring about school, friends and who i am. I just want it all to stop. Iâ€™m in so much pain. I just want to stop worrying. Death seems like the most likely option. This past year sucked. I lost my best friend now she wonâ€™t even talk to me because I fell in a depressive episode and essentially stopped all communication with 85% of all people and just did drugs. I havenâ€™t been high in a week and it fucking sucks. The world is so scary but I know Iâ€™m not meant to be here. Maybe itâ€™s time to leave.
