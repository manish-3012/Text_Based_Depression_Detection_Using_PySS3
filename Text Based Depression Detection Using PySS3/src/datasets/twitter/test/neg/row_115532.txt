I just want to talk.This might be my only post. I haven't hit joined and sorry for the horrible grammar and format, I'm on mobile.

The only reason that I haven't killed myself is that I don't want my family to have to deal with the aftermath. 

I'm a 27 year old bisexual, alcoholic, non transitioning, trans woman.
My younger brother and I work at the same restaurant and I fear that he would have the hardest time with it, especially with work. 

I am constantly berated at work, being called retarded and the plethora of "gay" jokes and jabs. 

It's gotten to the point where I don't find joy in anything anymore and I don't even really like my job anymore.

I think about suicide atleast once every day.

I have even made attempts.

The call of the void is so strong.

But I keep going, despite my comfort, 
Because I don't want to hurt my family. 

I have that I have the nerve to exist.

So I drink about it 

Thank you for listening.
