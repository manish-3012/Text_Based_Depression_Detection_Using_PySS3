Hi, I'm in pain. Sort of a midlife crisis. I have a kid I don't want, and women in my family don't live past 65. My grandma died at 62 aand my mom at 63. I've turned 30 this year.My child will become an adult when I turn 40. I really hate my kid, and guilt doesn't make me go away. Knowing that it's not my kid's fault that they exist doesn't make it go away, either. That being said, I'm doing my best to hold off on welcoming death until my kid reaches adulthood.  People try to guilt me into spending more time with my child, but when people spend time with my child, they spend an hour max actually interacting, and then put the supervision ball back in my court. I can't leave my kid with basically anyone I haven't known for several years, because about 2 years ago, I left my kid with a coworker's little sister. The sister fell asleep and some guy who came to their house while I was at work molested my kid in the family bathroom, and now I'm too paranoid to enlist any outside care whatsoever. I could just abandon my kid and kill myself in prison, but I'm worried the foster care system will bring more'bathroom' experiences. Should I kill myself and leave it to foster care, or continue parenting a child I don't want?
