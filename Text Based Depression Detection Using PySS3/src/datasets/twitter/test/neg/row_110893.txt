Suicide hotline in English in Germany?Hi, I know it is a long shot, but can anyone here help me find a suicide hotline in Germany that speaks English? Or Spanish? Or almost any language other than German?

I almost committed suicide today. It would have been 100% effective and easy. I hesitated at the last second, and couldn't. Now I feel the urge again. Please help.
