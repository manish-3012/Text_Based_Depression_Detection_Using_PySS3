No purpose in my life19. There is no job that I want. There is no career Iâ€™ve ever thought sounded interesting. There are no â€œgoalsâ€ for my future. Iâ€™m just alive. Just being. 

If I could sit on the top of a snowy mountain in silence for the rest of my life Iâ€™d be more than content. Sometimes I close my eyes and imagine myself there and I feel at peace for a little bit. 

Thereâ€™s nothing I want or need from life. 

Life feels very useless. 

I want to live but everything feels out of place and I donâ€™t feel I belong here. This life just wasnâ€™t meant for me.
