Am I depressed?I am 23 and have been entertaining suicidal thoughts for a while. Nothing major. And I have a normal family, a good college degree, a great job, a caring boyfriend, the whole works. I just keep thinking that once my parents die, I'll work on the suicide part. I am not even close to my parents though, we don't talk everyday etc, it's just a normal relationship. I just don't want them to be at my funeral. Hence, the wait. If they weren't alive, I think that I'd have jumped off a building a while ago...
