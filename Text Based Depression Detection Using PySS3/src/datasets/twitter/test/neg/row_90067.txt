Living alone around the holidays sucksIâ€™m 19 and just got an apartment recently. I live in a small town so thereâ€™s not much to do or people to hangout with. Iâ€™ve never really been the type to have lots of friends anyways. Probably why Iâ€™m depressed as heck lol. I donâ€™t have family to be around either so Iâ€™m just sitting at home lonely as hell. I donâ€™t even want gifts or any of that stuff, just someone to be around that might actually care about me for once. Life sucks
