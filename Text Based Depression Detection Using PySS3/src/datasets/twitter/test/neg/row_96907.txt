Cannot Fuckin' Get a Proper JobEvery advertisement asks for at least 2 years of experience, a bunch of requirements like, be highly motivated, be flexible and highly available even on the weekend (basically do as we please), have great communication skills, have skills that they didn't even teach in college particular to the profession, be a fast learner and dedicated (basically die for this shit job), be good with people (I fuckin' hate people), do everything perfectly (or you'll be fucked basically), be fluent in multitasking. 

I fuckin' hate this piece of shit country, they ask all this shit for an entry level job. Yet, how the fuck are you supposed to have 2 years of experience when you're 21 and have just finished school? Even if you apply someone else who has 5 years of experience and a PhD will steal the entry from you. No thanks, fuck this world. I don't want to stay anymore, there's no use. Currently, I barely manage to live from charring, but it's not life, just living paycheck to paycheck. It's not a life. It's fuckin' slavery. Good bye, farewell.
