At the breaking point again...After a shitty year and things are only getting worse, all I want to do is end it.  Give up and leave.  Ive felt like this for a long time and always pushed the feelings away because of one person. That person just gave up on me. So why should I bother anymore?

Ive thought about getting help, but they probably wouldn't care anyway.  This is more of a rant than anything and I've probably wasted your time like I have everyone else's in my life.
