ApatheticI donâ€™t really feel much. A bit numb. Struggled with suicidal tendencies for about 4 years now. Serious attempt back in January. 1mm left of the radial artery landed me in surgery. Life went to absolute shit after that, started to get better and genuine enjoy life. But depression still crippled me and occasionally in day to day life Iâ€™ll feel bored and pathetic and numb. My mind begins to wander and trail off to the worst possibilities. Iâ€™ve wanted to die more than now before, I donâ€™t feel very intensely about anything right now. I almost want to say I feel fine. But Iâ€™m apathetic. And kinda just want to fade away into the long dark.
