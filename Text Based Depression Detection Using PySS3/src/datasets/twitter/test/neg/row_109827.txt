I feel like I reached my lowest point and I need some encouragement.I donâ€™t think ill kill myself. Im too chicken. I want to, I really want to though. But I donâ€™t think I will. Im sorry my mind is so frazzled and I just want to die and I know its selfish but if anyone could send me encouragement or happy messages i would really appreciate it. I feel absoutely alone and scared and worried about the future and I feel like theres no point. I feel like no one cares about me. I just really want to be cared about. now im alone. im sorry
