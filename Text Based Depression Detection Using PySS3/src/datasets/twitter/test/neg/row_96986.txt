Today is my 25 birthdayI don't care really but now when I think about it, I'm closer to death with each year and that puts a smile on my face.   
I'm also having a bad day which is the reason for this post and to be honest I simply want to take a pistol, put it in my mouth and pull the trigger. I think about it a lot.  
This life, it's not worth living. I'm not living, I'm simply existing hoping that I feel slighty less pain the next day.  
I dont really live for myself, I live because I do not want to bring problems to my family.
