Officially made a planIâ€™m gonna record a message and address it to a friend. Once my body is found, theyâ€™ll be given the message to listen to. They deserve to know why I did it and have me reassure them that theyâ€™re my best friend and thereâ€™s nothing they could have done. Iâ€™m in love with them, not sure if Iâ€™m going to include that part. But I never said anything because I donâ€™t want to drag them down, they can do so much better
