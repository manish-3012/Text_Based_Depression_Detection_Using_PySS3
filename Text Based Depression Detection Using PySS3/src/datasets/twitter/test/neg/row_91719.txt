My brother is going to kill himself, please helpMy brother is 18, and is currently in a mental hospital receiving psychiatric care for his depression and anxiety. He has some of the best professionals in the country working on his case.
He isnt getting better, and because he is 18 he will be able to check himself out if the court allows it. He has a lawyer and everything. I know that if he checks himself out he will kill himself.
As his older brother, ive tried a lot to help him. I tried to get him to the gym everyday (before he was in the hospital), eat healthy, and improve his lifestyle. I feel like it is just a matter of time before I receive a phone call telling me my younger bro is dead :( .
Has anyone been in a similar situation, with a sibling with severe depression, who has already had professional help but it failed?
