No one would care.I always feel so alone. I have friends and I have family, but they are all so paper thin. They are sick of my issues. They are sick of my needs. They are sick of having to hear me rant or deal with me. I know. I just want to kill myself at this point. My mother continues to emotionally abuse me and I feel like no one cares. I am a 17 year-old rising high school senior and everything that made it seem like my life could go on now makes my life seem so worthless. I feel empty and hopeless inside.
