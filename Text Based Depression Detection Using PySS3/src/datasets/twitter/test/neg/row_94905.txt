If I died, no one would even knowI'm 19, I live alone, no school, no work, no friends, no acquaintances, no family of any importance, and nobody to talk to outside of the internet. I'm completely isolated. If I killed myself right now, I would just rot away until my neighbors noticed the smell. 
That is how impact less and insignificant my existence is. I don't know how I managed to fuck up my life so bad in just 19 years, but here I am. Now the only thing I can think to do is kill myself in public. At least then people would know that I existed...
