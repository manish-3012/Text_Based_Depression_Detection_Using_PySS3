Life is a net negativeLife to me has always seemed to be a baseline of below zero, if the y-axis is emotion. Sure there's spikes into the positive. We call that joy.

But it doesn't stay, it can't. It doesn't make sense for it to. Joy requires input, energy; you can't sustain energy indefinitely. Just like the laws of the universe.

Life at baseline zero would be neutrality, which doesn't make sense either as that would mean that the negatives are also spikes, but they're not. We're taught and shown that life isn't fair so that sets the tone that things are not and will not be good. So that leaves the baseline below zero. Perhaps not at the bottom, but below zero no less.

Life, living, existing is pushing through the bad to find those positive spikes. Why must one do that? I see it as a simple metaphor. Life is a game; albeit it is one where you don't get to decide whether or not you start playing. However, just like games within life they can be difficult, annoying, and unenjoyable. If you were to tell someone that you're not having a good time playing a game, and that you don't find what ever win condition is at the end, or whatever "satisfying" challenge happens along the way, to be worth the effort they would surely say to you "well then stop playing the game". How does this not apply to the ethereal game that is *existence.* 

  


Why keep pushing through the misery to find those spikes? For what purpose?

So long as misery exists life doesn't seem worth it to play.

  


  


This is all just ideation. I don't intend to act on these ideas currently but they creep into my thoughts now and again. They're something that's hard to tell people face to face because the mortality of it seems to upset most.
