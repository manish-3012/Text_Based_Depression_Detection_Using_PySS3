Whatâ€™s your suicide song?Out of curiosity. Iâ€™m feeling sad tonight, looking to listen to some music. I think mine would be something like Wolfman by the Front Bottoms. â€œI was a birdcage and you were meant to fly.â€ I donâ€™t know, I relate to that lyric too much, and I always saw myself trying to â€œflyâ€ off my nearby bridge to kill myself. Iâ€™ve also been listening to Paradise by Coldplay. Never really liked that song but itâ€™s so euphoric and the idea of Paradise as death, I donâ€™t know. I can really envision myself jumping when the beat drops or whatever. There are a couple others too, but Iâ€™d love to hear other peopleâ€™s â€œsuicide songs.â€ Thank you.
