Still alive &amp; "trying" - not for myself, but for my familyI did not "OD" or try to kill myself. I was self-medicating by increasing certain meds that were not working.

I decided to go the the hospital myself, to keep from hurting myself and thus my family.

Going there was my cry, my scream, for help.

I spent the day in the ER - when asked what brought me there, I just said "mental health crisis".

I did go prepared to stay if they thought I needed to be committed, but up until the final doctor I saw, I had been given hope they could give me a crisis/distress med for a short time &amp; go home. 

I went there for help, yet they couldn't give me anything to stop my hysterical depression/mental pain, but they quickly handed me 2 Tylenol #3s for my migraine.

I couldn't be strong enough to choose committing myself after they told me I wasn't a danger to myself &amp; could, against doctor's opinion, leave. This is mainly because of my severe agoraphobia - I've left the house maybe 3 times this year. And it took all I had just to go to the hospital. I would have probably stayed if it was one night, but no - I am too complicated a case with a crazy cocktail of meds, which means at least staying/being alone with strangers for 7+ days.

Mental Health care is a joke.

I'm not well enough to get better.

I feel worse now.
I am too broken.
The only reason I am not dead is because I could never hurt/do that to my family and friends.

I am empty.
Nothing is real.
I want to wake up now.
I either can't stop sobbing or can no longer cry though I want to.
I'm doing the minimum.
I am stuck on survive - all while my mind is flooded with thoughts of ending it all.

I am miserable.
Nothing gives me joy.
Everything is far away.
I give up.

I'm given up, yet I feel I must continue "trying" for my family.

I feel like a prisoner.

This is a non-life.
