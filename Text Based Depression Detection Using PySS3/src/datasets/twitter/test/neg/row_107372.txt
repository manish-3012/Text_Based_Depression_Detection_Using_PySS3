I didn't want toI didn't want to kill myself. I wanted to live. I wanted to experience positive things. That ability was never given to me.  I can live a life of pain and anhedonia or I can end my life. The only reason I'm still here is that I haven't been able to answer a single question: "why haven't I killed myself yet?"
