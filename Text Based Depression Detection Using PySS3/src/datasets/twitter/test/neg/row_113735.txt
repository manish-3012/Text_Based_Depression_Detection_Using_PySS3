Missing person who is suicidalMy daughter's (35) fiance (37) has been missing since Friday.  He left for work that morning per usual, but came back as the neighbor said his car was there all day.  He he answered texts until 10:30 am, but nothing after.
When my daughter got home from work, he was not home but his car was there, his keys and his phone.  The only thing missing is his inhaler, his bible and a few books.
The search history on his phone shows he had searched for "Ways to Commit Suicide" etc. for the last month.  He also called the National Suicide Prevention Line on Thursday.
She has filed a Missing Persons Report with the local police.  She has called friends and family and no one has heard from him.  She has called hospitals and hotels and most wouldn't tell her anything.
He has not spent any money on his debit card. 
This is completely out of character for him as he is very devoted to my daughter and his kids (they live with their mother).
She is a mess and we are so worried.
Any ideas from anyone who has been in similar situation?
