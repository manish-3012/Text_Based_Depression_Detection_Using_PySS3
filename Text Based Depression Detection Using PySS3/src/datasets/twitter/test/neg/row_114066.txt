I see no reason to stay hereI canâ€™t deal with this. I have to see My molester and abuser every single day. Nobody in my surroundings listens to me when I talk about my feelings. Once I had someone who cared, someone who cared for real. But heâ€™s gone now. Iâ€™m not even allowed to speak to him. Before I could at least count my reasons to live on my fingers. Now I canâ€™t even think of one. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing this. I guess itâ€™s a call to someone who has the energy to listen. I donâ€™t know why I havenâ€™t died already. The only thing that kind of matters rn is to thank the person who cared for me. But after this school year I will never see him again. He wonâ€™t even remember me. It would be in vain. Again, Iâ€™m sorry if this triggered anyone. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I donâ€™t know how I will make this coming week. I wonâ€™t be in school, we have vacation and Iâ€™m happier there than at home. Iâ€™m really sorry. You must think Iâ€™m an attention seeker. Maybe in this case I am. Some part of me is after all telling me to stay here even if I canâ€™t see it. Otherwise I wouldâ€™ve been dead long ago. Iâ€™m just scared that â€œsomethingâ€ will disappear soon.
