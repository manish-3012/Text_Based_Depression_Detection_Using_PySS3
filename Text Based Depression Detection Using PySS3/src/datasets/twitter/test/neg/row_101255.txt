Can't stop my suicide ideationI've been jobless for nearly 2 years...If I'm not busy, it is a fight for me.  This week has been especially hard...last few days all I think about are so many things to do.  I'm fighting the urge not to do things I will do to hurt my family.

I just feel like everyone else keeps getting their job breaks and i cant even get ANYTHING!  I send dozens of resumes and NEVER hear back.  when I hear anything...nobody follows up, or the company drags their feet SO much that nothing ever happens and the position just dies off.  

Being homeless...jobless..no money for food.  I am starting to slowly get homicidal ideation now.  Its starting to scare me.  I've never thought about hurting others but i've been thinking of thoughts of Aurara, CO and wanting to do things like that.  

I'm not mentally strong enough to fight the meds...I can't afford to get help or see anyone.  I'm scared the meds WILL push me to the edge and I might do something to myself or others.  I figured if I'm "sober" and more "coherent" on my body, I can fight out both the suicide and homicidal ideation. 

I need help...as I write this I'm uncontrollably crying.  I don't know what to do anymore :(
