What's wrong with me?I feel weak and shaky. I've been eating enough and living a healthy lifestyle. For a while, things weren't as bad as they were before. But all of a sudden things are getting bad again. I feel out of control. I feel bad. I don't know what I did wrong. I don't know what to do. I want to end it because then I won't have to feel this anymore. I hate myself.
