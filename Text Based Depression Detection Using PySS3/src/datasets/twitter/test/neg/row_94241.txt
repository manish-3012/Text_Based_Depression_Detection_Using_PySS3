My story and the cause of my depressionWhen I finished school 13 years ago I received a special award called most promising student. Two others received it one is a chartered accountant and the other did very well in banking last I heard.

I am 31 years old and and am unemployed. When I finished school 13 years ago, my father didn't want to send me to university but my mother did. My father eat her head and she came to me crying not to go to university. He sent me to a horrible place ti work and after two weeks a senior destroyed me verbally infront of everyone and my father got drunk a few days later and went at my mother again.

I gave up, I said t my self why should I fucking care, and did what I wanted. Sit on my ass and play video games. Thats basically what I have been doing for the last 13 years of my life. A few years later I did go to university but I had given up at that point I failed the most important module and had to do a weaker degree to graduate on time. Its bot one people get hired for too often.

He did the same thing with my brother, my brother never gave up though and got his degree. And was going to write his honours exam a few weeks ago. He had to drink and eat my brother's head to the point of my brother crying.

And my brother has been through alot in his life, from having me as a brother to being bullied everywhere he went.

The 2 times in my life I felt good is when a teacher and 2nd a lecturer treated me well and were like father figures to me. The spoke so proud when I did well, and were hard on me when I was lazy. When the lecturer a brilliant man with a phd and who had atleast 5 cars that I had seen and was admired by everyone told me infront of the whole class "oh my godness everyone you must listen to what this boy has to say, he received a certificate of merit in my other course" I felt like crying. He will never read this but thank you Dr MP from the bottom of my heart.

If I had someone like that in my life I won't be a 31 year unemployed loser. I don't sound like a most promising anything. Maybe in my next life I can do something. But I have played over 1000 video games from psp, ps2, ps1, ps3, nds, pc, n64, 3ds, dreamcast, wii, gamecube and gba games. Anyone reading this, unless you are making money doing this, PLEASE DON'T it was a waste of my life.

He finds a way to justify everything. He gets drunk and eats my mothers head and the next day he is the victim. He can only bully us, too the outside world he says things like thanks a million thanks a million and treats strangers with kindness and us like trash. Because of the fact that when he drinks he eats our heads goes away and keeps coming back, I shake when he approaches.

I am basically a shut in now who plays video games, too scared to do anything. He won but you know what, FUCK HIM, FUCK MY FATHER!!
