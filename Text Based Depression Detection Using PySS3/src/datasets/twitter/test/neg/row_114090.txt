I'm tired of living for others. I want to kill myself. My entire life I had depression and borderline personality disorder. I first tried killing myself in preschool because I had no friends. The pattern continued as I went through elementary and middle school. Constant bullying, constant suicide attempts. When I was in high school, I finally told my parents what was happening. That's the worst part. They had no idea that their daughter was trying to kill herself. They didn't know that I was even depressed. 

I was put on therapy and medication, but it didn't seem effective. I switched drugs and psychologists, but that didn't work either. After another serious attempt, it then dawned on me that I would be hurting my parents so much if I killed myself. So I stayed alive. I'm only living for my family. I'm in my sophomore year of college, studying physics, in a sorority, but I hate my life. I'm tired of it. Everyone says you have to do what makes you happy. What would make me happy is if I'm dead. So I'm going to do something for me. I'm going to kill myself.
