Pretty long post about the main issues I'm having some days just never end and I'm struggling a lot to deal with itOne month has passed since my breakup After 3 years, but I'll explain It again. We broke up after some months were not going well and we discussed it and eventually decided it was time to move on for both of us, most of the problems came from the fact that for a long period I took care of her in a lot of ways, her mother died when I was seeing her for 1 year and she just wanted to spend time with me talk with me and I realised only recently that I became his family during this years. She was alone being a single child and his dad never being a person that she talked to. This lead to all of my problems being left in the dust for a lot of time and when I eventually got overwhelmed buy my problems she was never there to help me like I wanted to or in a way that really helped me improve my situation. She also ruined my friendship with the girl that was my best friend for 7 years, because she was jealous of her, they lived together and they still live together and she always had this complex against her that she couldn't be for me what my bf was for me, she was manipulative many times and in the end my friend eventually gave up and decided she didn't want to deal with our relationship problems. All in all I gave up a lot of stuff for her and since I am a nice person in general who always try to help others out I slowly renounced to a lot of stuff, I started gaming less, I almost stopped watching football on weekends(because weekend are to hang out you know? Why do you always want to watch your team games), and despite me not watching my team games I always kept hearing every time I really wanted to watch something stuff like "we are always watching football why should we do it again". Basically I was in the most toxic relationship possible and the worst part of this is that I wanted to break up with her before her mother died but eventually we didn't because that happened and as warm hearted as I am I couldn't leave her alone, she had an affair with her ex months before her mom had a stroke but I was taking my time to think about it, but now after we were having a break I discovered that she was texting him again so basically for our whole relationship she probably hid this from me and despite me finding clear proofs(ie finding messages with her friends talking about messaging his ex again). In the end I just feel like a complete retard who wasted years of his life with a complete asshole who made me insecure made me drop some important people, ruined my relationship with my friends in general because she created an ecosystem where most of the time I was giving up all my free time to stay with her. I just feel so empty, angry and depressed and I just think world sucks, I lost serenity and I feel anxious about a lot of stuff I feel like I'm a really big fucking idiot who will be treated like shit no matter what I do. I have no idea how to get out of this sadness hole I'm stuck into I don't even wanna hang out with my friends tonight because I just wanna cry in my room. I should be already graduated but other than my fault, the fact that I took care of her issues for so long and continuous fighting about her jealousy or me not doing enough for years drained me like nothing else ever did. The only good thing in my life is that my sister is pregnant so I will be an uncle soon but other than that I can't see myself sorting things out in the short term some days I just go to sleep thinking I don't even wanna wake up, but then I think that if I die that would just be another failure in my life making everyone sad one more time.
