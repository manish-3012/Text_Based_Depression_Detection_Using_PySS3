So I met this guy, got really close, and now he tells me he's going to commit suicide.I'm a guy, I have social anxiety issues and I ended up meeting someone off of my college's subreddit, he wanted to talk. So we meet and end up talking about all kinds of things and he seemed to have similar struggles as me. We agree to meet later and he meets me at my place Tuesday, I think he came here yesterday and today also. I also got him to goto church with me this morning. It's so strange how I care so much about him yet I've only met him about 4 times. Messaged a lot though. I guess I saw someone with similar struggles as me and I trusted him and opened up and told him so much. I guess all my personal issues and everything. 

Anyways, back to him. He told me he's been skipping class since the 20th. He doesn't seem to care about school anymore. He told me he's tried counseling and anti-depressants and nothing has worked. He told me he ordered something and it should arrive next week and he's going to take it to kill himself. Idk, what to do. I was afraid to let him drive back home, he was tearing up when he left. I heard an ambulance and freaked out and he texted me he was alright... He has some type of online job and I guess he does that most days or just sleeps. He said he was going to meet with a priest Wednesday and talk to him and he would text me after that. I really wanted to meet up with him Wednesday and he said this was it and I probably wouldn't see him again... He kept saying "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I wish you could see this my way", I think I spent 2 hours trying to reason with him not to do it. Seems like we spent an eternity hugging... I didn't want to let him go. 

Well, I have the last week of classes going on right now and I'm in college. I have to meet with a group tomorrow and then have an exam and presentation Tuesday. Just started seeing a counselor for myself and I'm meeting him Wednesday. I was thinking of telling my counselor about this or calling this suicide watch-line or something my college has. There has to be a better way than this. If I let him go through with this I could never forgive myself. Idk why I care so much. I guess I love him and care about him, I don't see how letting him end his life is the best thing for him. He's only 22. So many more years ahead, I guess he just sees hopelessness. I hate this, when all you can do is just sit by and watch. I guess I can intervene and probably will Wednesday. He did tell me he tried to take it three times before... 

Idk how much more I can take of this. I had enough stress this semester without worrying about him. This will probably be driving me mad. Oh if he does end up doing it I'm going to need major support myself...
