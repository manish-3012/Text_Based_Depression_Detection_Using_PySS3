more depressive lyricsNobody listens, nobody cares

Pretty sure that no one will shed a tear

Don't want to run, don't want to hide

Just want to end it all and fucking commit suicide

Nobody listened, nobody cared

I know that no one will shed a tear

Can't run, can't hide

Gonna end it all and fucking commit suicide
