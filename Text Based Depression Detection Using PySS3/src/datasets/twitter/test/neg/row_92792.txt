Someone to talk to.. Hi, I can tell I am soon to be feeling down, I already am but I just need someone to talk to, help me keep my mind of things whatever we are talking about, I don't want to go back there but I can tell I am going to

Its 12am, I woke up 2 hours ago and I won't be going asleep anytime soon, everyone is in bed and I can't really go out right now so someone to just keep me company would be great, please. Right now I'm just feeling down but this is always how I feel before I start thinking the way I shouldn't

If this really isn't the place to post this please tell me where to.. Thanks
