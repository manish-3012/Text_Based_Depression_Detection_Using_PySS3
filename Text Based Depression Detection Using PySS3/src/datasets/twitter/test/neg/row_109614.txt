I don't want to be alone anymore.I didn't really go to middle/high school so I've never really had friends irl that I could talk freely to and hangout with. And now the first and only friend that I've ever made has decided to suddenly cut me off from them. I can't stand being alone anymore. I already made one attempt within minutes of them telling me that. I think I might try to make another one in a few days, or at least I really want to.

Also btw part of my stupid like towel holder thingy broke off of my bathroom wall so that totally helps my mood. Maybe my mind and my bathroom are psychically connected?
