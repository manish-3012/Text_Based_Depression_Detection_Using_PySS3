I Have A Great Family, and Have a Great Relationship, But I Still Feel Useless and Want to DieNo matter how good my family, or how good my life is I am constantly thinking about ending my life. I hurt mentally.

I feel like I have no purpose and my life is going nowhere. Or that i'll end up a disappointment and should end things now before I get people's hopes up. The worst moments are when I lay in bed at night and have no way to distract my thoughts.

I have driven off several friends with my depression. People I had given advice and helped with their depression or family issues, but would rather not deal with my problems.

I am recently out of a mentally abusive romantic relationship that was filled with a lot of guilt and manipulation. My current relationship, I feel like I'm not good enough, no matter how often my partner tells me I'm perfectly fine. I'm scared of my depression driving her away, even though I know it won't.

I'm tired of constant sadness, I'm tired of being scared all the time, I'm tired of feeling guilty for no reason. I just want it all to end.

(Sorry for how unorganized this is. I'm in a very bad state of mind and this is just a big depression dump)
