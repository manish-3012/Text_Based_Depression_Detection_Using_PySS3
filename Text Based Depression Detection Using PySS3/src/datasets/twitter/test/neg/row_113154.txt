I dunnoMy post doesn't really have a focus. It's just me expressing how I feel I guess

I have been in therapy for over a year and on antidepressants for half a year. I have felt no change. Walking into school every day is a dread. Coming back home sucks. Nothing has changed

Currently, I only feel two emotions. Apathy or a form of sadness. I haven't felt happy since my 15th birthday. There was nothing traumatic about it. It's just that it wasn't great. It just became another day in the calendar. It became insignificant to me. And from my birthday onwards, I lost interest in everything. I no longer felt the urge to pick up my guitar, or sing in choir, or to do anything. What I tried doing was finding things I thought made me upset and tried to fix them. One such thing was my placement in math in school. There's a lot of details involving that, but I eventually made it where I wanted to be in and realized that I dont feel any better. I hated this. I put so much work and effort and time into this. I did two summer courses and tried so hard to get into this class. It was disappointment when I realized this didn't make me happy. I tried writing an English paper on how to be happy, but ended up failing actually becoming happy. I played computer games a lot. Kinda like counter strike and stuff. I even got GTA 5 when it came out on PC. 

The thing is, it wasn't fun. Nothing's fun. It's just a way to keep busy. Last week, I lost power for 5 days and I had nothing to do (this was my spring break). And all I did was look at social media on my phone and realized everybody was having a good time except me. I didn't have a good time and I couldn't. And I felt sad. I dunno. The fact everyone hung out with friends or went on vacation seems fun. I then thought deeply about all my friendships and evaluated them as unhealthy. My best friend currently kinda just. I dunno. I dont feel like shit talking her. I think I've landed at the conclusion that most of my friends kinda are friends with me out of guilt or pity. I feel that I forced them into this kind of shit. My feelings for all of my friends are not reciprocated. It's unrequited friendship. I noticed all I do is complain, and they don't talk to me about their problems. My best friend said it was because everybody doesn't want to burden me with their problems because I have enough on my plate, but I think it's just because they don't want to talk to me. Im not a glass half empty person. It's just that I really feel like I'm trying to hold all by friends together in a chokehold or something. I think I'm trying too hard. I want friends. I tried talking to a lot more people at school to be honest. I tried expanding my circles. It didn't really work. Nobody continued conversation with me long. I dunno. I really don't behave miserably often in school. I try to make jokes and stuff and make people think I'm okay so I'm more approachable, but it doesn't do anything. So that stinks

I lost motivation in school recently. I no longer care about my grades. I used to strive for A's, but now I'm letting my grades slip and I don't care anymore. This morning, I decided not to lose sleep and work on my Spanish project. I would have worked on it over my break, but I lost power. I only had one day to do it, and I figured for my own sanity that I would sleep instead of do it. 

My mother tried to get me to finish it, but then I told her I didn't feel well, which I didn't. It didn't fit well with her and my father and she took away my computer, which I still need to do my Spanish project. An issue is that I have this poem a day challenge that is due at the end of this month and it's all on that computer, so that makes me sad. I also will have a lot more time to think which is where I think about my friendships and then I get sad. I prefer to be ignorant. Comforting lies are better than unbearable truths. In fact, I'm thinking right now, and this makes me sad. I hate thinking because I start piecing this stuff together and this also makes me sad. 

My mother thinks I have an internet addiction and that video games are the cause of my addiction. I try to explain to her that all of my friends who play games are fine and that there is no correlation between them. She doesn't believe it and likes to remain ignorant.

This morning my mother told me that she would take away the computer unless I worked on the Spanish project. I didn't. I couldn't function. I had a lot of worm yesterday. Sometimes my mom barged into my room and accused me of playing video games, when I was actually working on something. Occasionally id go on reddit, but I was focused for the most part. I think she just wants to find an excuse. I also currently don't have a door knob. That was because my parents removed the luck from my door. I, months later, replaced it. Now it's gone. 

I am not clinically diagnosed as anxious, but often times my chest hurts like when you get anxious. The other day, I felt my chest hurt so much that it felt like I couldn't breathe. 

Often times I feel like I can't hold on anymore. I promised people I wouldn't kill myself, and the whole suicide is selfish thing got to my head and messed it up. I began to think of every action I've ever done as selfish. I saw my friends actions as selfish. It made me cynical. I still do want kill myself, but I'm a cynic because of it


To be honest, most times, I fudge up the things I say so it can't be tracked back to me. I didn't change anything just now. I dont even have the energy to change those details. I dunno what to do. I'm just tired. I won't kill myself. I just want to.
