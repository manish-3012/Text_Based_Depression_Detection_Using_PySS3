I don't know what to doI need help, recently i've been really depressed. Over the years i've lost almost all my friends and im slowly losing the ones i still have because im constantly sad and lame and they've just had enough. I lost my girlfriend 2 weeks ago and it's really hurting me, i loved her so much she was the world to me and now she's just gone. My depression is getting so bad, all i feel is pain and sadness or nothing at all, i constantly think about killing myself and ive been close to doing it multiple times recently, i just really want to be dead so i can be free of all of this.
