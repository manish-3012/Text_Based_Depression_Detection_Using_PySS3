Failing the Bar examAfter my third attempt at taking the bar, if I find that I failed, I'm going to end my life. I'm 300,000 dollars in debt, cannot find a job in the law field to save my life. I'm a doctor of laws and I'm working retail making like 13 bucks an hour. I cant afford to live on my own. I'm a burden on everyone around me. I think I'm mentally and emotionally handicapped, leading to my problems with people. I'm a total asshole, even though I try to be fun and friendly.  My anxiety is so high, I think people hate me, so I end up being a prick. I've never had a romantic relationship longer than 3 months. I haven't had sex with anyone since July of 2015. 
I have had people try to get me in dating apps. I'm on them all. I've had other women approve my profile and told me it all the things I should do to make myself available for others to see me in my best light. I'm too old for someone who isn't as damaged as me. I'm too unattractive to feel wanted. I have swiped right tens of thousands of times, but I'm apparently so offputting that I cant get a match at all. 
I've had depression my whole life. I went to one of the hardest law schools in the country. I've done "great" things by most standards. I have lived a good life by most accounts. I cannot be happy as my depression is eating me alive. After failing the bar twice, I was urged to try again. After the heartbreak of failing twice, I see that there is no way out for me. 

If something wonderful doesn't happen by the first week of November,  I will be resigned to my fate. This is probably the only place I will post publicly about it. I want to die. I dont have a reason to live any more. No love, no meaningful relationships, no light at the end of the tunnel. It doesn't get better. It only gets worse. I'll only get older and sadder. I'll only get fatter and balder. I'll only get lonelier and more angry. Better to do this now than to wait until it boils over and I hit someone else. 

I want to do something where no one will ever find my body, like ever. I'm obviously a coward, so how can I do this without getting eaten alive by wolves or drowning painfully? I dont want to traumatize my family or anyone with having to find my gross body. I just want to disappear forever. No body. No burial. I've already thought of the ocean, but I need it to be something that will render my body completely gone with no trace. E.g. I cant use a gun if someone could hear it, or go somewhere in which I could be found. 

Any thoughts or miracles appreciated.
