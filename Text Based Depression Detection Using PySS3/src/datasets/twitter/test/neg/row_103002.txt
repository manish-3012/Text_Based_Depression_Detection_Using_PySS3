I just wanna get this off my chestHi, from an early age i've always enjoyed video games.
Im 17 now and i've started to play more competitive games for like the past 4 years. The genre that i usually play are mobas(dota 2 mostly). I've become depressed over a period of time with this game. Aside from the game just being competitive i guess its the people i play with that get me depressed. They are also very competitive and mistakes are not taken lightly. Anyways not being able to perform at expected level in that game has really brought my life down alot in general. this isn't the only source of stress in my life but i think its a big one. any advice on how to deal with this.
