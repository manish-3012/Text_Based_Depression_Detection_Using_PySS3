I don't know how much longer I will make it :/I was really close to killing myself last night, I've been really stressed lately. I'm a failure of a human, I've sat on my butt for the last 5 years doing nothing. I'm incapable of fixing my problems. It's been so many years since I realized I was trans, so many years since I realized I needed to transition and make something of myslef.

Everytime I try and do anything productive the weight of my failures feels so heavy. Doing anything reminds me of how shit I am.

The only reason I've made it so far is because I realized I was depressed and had no motivation. I decided to consolidate my energy by doing less and less. I was hoping that I would get decent at art and maybe be capable of getting a job that I could actually hold down. I've lived so long feeling like shit though, I feel like I'm allowed to give up now.

Everything that I need to do in my life I can't do and nobody else can help me with these things. My mom had a stroke and she can't even get a follow up doctor appointment because we have no money. Nobody can help.

My mom is my only friend and she can't even talk to me anymore. Not that she really liked to talk to me before anyways, nobody really does. :/ These things are all facts that I've learned over years of trying to be optimistic.

I've also tried a lot of things to make myself feel better, like changing my diet, exercising. I've been eating very healthily for months and I still have no energy, the only time I can do anything productive or important is when I have caffeine. :/

I feel like I'm doing everything I can and I'm still failing, but even if I succeeded it doesn't matter because even if I got on HRT my eds would most definitely get worse.

Idk this whole thing is really whiny sorry, I do understand that these problems are mine and are representative of my failings. I don't want it to look like I'm blaming my circumstances or that I think that people are obligated to help.
