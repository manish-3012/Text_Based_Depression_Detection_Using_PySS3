Dont want to make people happy anymoreI am dumb and ungratefull before anyone trying to tell me that. With that out of the way.. i just want to die now.. still scared because of the pain... cannot really find any immediate painless way to die.. so it will have to wait for a bit.. but getting that urge stronger and stronger again..

I devote my live to become a better in my religion. I devote my live to make my parents happy with the thinking of.. nothing is better than heaven. But now i just realize. No.. money is better than heaven. I am poor . My sister is rich and able to give my parents everything. My parents always say good thing about her. N always bad thing about me. I am lazy. Weak. Uselss. Satan follower. Everthough i am the one who kept the house clean. I am the one who never talk back to them.

I practically wasted 24 years of my life for them and religion. Frankly.. i have no reaso to live. And more reason to die. At least now they will not have a satan follower as their child. And i dont want to give them the satisfaction that they can treat their child that differently and still having them both alive. Being alive is good enough for them. Because it will never be their fault if i end up being a criminal or whatever.

I regret living to make them happy. Now i am just an unemployed idiot living off by skimming other people money.. and just like i suspected. As long as it is not their money and i am alive. They dont give a fuck and just keep on blaming me for being a satan follower.

Hoping perhaps there are ways to find a reason to live for you guys that can worth me giving away my 24 years of living. If not.. will just wait until i either find a painless way to die or until i am brave enough to face the pain.
