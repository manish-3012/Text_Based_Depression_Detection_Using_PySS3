Appreciate your supportive parentsI see some people here having a good family or a family member and still holding on for them. I met a friend who wasike that as well, his mother adored him and he kept living cause of her.

Meanwhile my whole family treats me like trash and my mother is treating me like I'm a punching bad since I remember myself. She even told me a neighbor offed himself so what am I waiting for.

I read people here that have good parents and I'd give my lungs, my kidneys and anything to have such a parent.

Of course there are other struggles as well in life but at least a portion of your life is good and worth staying for.
