Please talk with me, I really need itI have this overbearing feeling today that not living seem easier than living.

I feel really tired of getting through each day recently

I got noone to talk to

Noone to call

I tried some helpline, but I hung up after first signal. I guess "I need help and don't want to live won't come out of my mouth"

No friends being friends good enough to be able to call them saying come and see me cos i need you

No work I would be proud of and no more desire to continue with passion - it got killer recently by bully-manager

No family who would care either, parents divorced a while ago and behave like 5 yo shitheads dragging each others through courts .... and brother is just selfish turd.

My grandma who was like my mom died 2 years ago and I really miss her... Every day

My partner is good guy, but gets irritated and annoyed when I cry and try to tell him how low I feel and says : stop fucking dragging your self down. 

I also feel guilty of all this, of the fact that there is noone to care about me.
Must have wronged anyone who was left.

You know, even yesterday some random 12yo kid felt necessary stop by me and say I will die and that I am not from this country and have no right to be here...

I read through articles about painless dead but that was not much of a help.

I really need to talk to someone today.

Please
