My name is Chuck and I want to dieHello I'm Chuck and I want to die. I guess I'm not your typical suicidal person (wonderful wife, great kids, and a nice job). But then again I could be wrong. I came to this site and read heartbreaking stories that I could never imagine. Am I being selfish? Does my pain not 'rate' with the real crazy shit you guys are feeling? I don't seem to get it. Anyway, I'll probably kill myself in a week. Any thoughts would be helpful. Thanks.
