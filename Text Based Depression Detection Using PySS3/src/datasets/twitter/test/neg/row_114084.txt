I don't know what else to doMan I am just here at the moment really contemplating suicide. I am 25 years old, male, and I don't know what the fuck to do. 
Just to give some background I recently started a business with my "best friend" about a year ago and I am the one who solely dished out about $15,000.00 on the business. Once the money became a factor in this friendship things changed drastically. 
Now I am in debt with all this. And this person has turned against me and has used all the money purely for raves and money. 
At this point I don't know what else to fucking do, I am just wanting to move on but it seems I still need to deal with this and i also have my own depressive episodes that this does not contribute to my well being. 
At this moment I just want to talk to someone that doesn't judge me for my own mistakes. I am at the end of all this bullshit and want to fucking be done
