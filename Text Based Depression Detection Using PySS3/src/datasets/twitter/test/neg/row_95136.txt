when is the right timeI dont know what to do. I want to leave and stop hurting. Its so horrible I cant take it. I want so badly to just stop breathing. Just a break for once so I dont have to feel anymore and I wont be a burden on my family. I need help, I think I want to live. but it hurts so much I dont think I can bare the weight anymore. If I let go, I dont want my family to hate me. I know Iâ€™m weak but theres only so much I can take. I dont know what to do. I want to tell someone so they can help but Iâ€™m terrified. I dont want them to have to worry about me, like that I could die at any moment. Iâ€™d be so selfish if I did that. Just wasting their time when they could be holding their head up and moving forward. Iâ€™m so selfish. Iâ€™m scared that I wont be able to hold on. And I dont know what to do. I cant take it.
