tired of always being the "fat girl"I have had to deal with being fat my whole life and it has negatively shaped who I am. It has made me a shy person who lets everyone walk all over them. I hate leaving my house because I know people are probably thinking how disgusting I am. On top of everything my parents are always asking me when I'll get married (I'm late 20's) because their friends have children who are all getting married and since I'm their only child, they want a wedding, etc. However, no guy in his right mind would ever talk to a fat fuck like me so idk what to tell them. Finally, I self harm a lot and have depression/anxiety issues that I cannot afford to treat because I'm uninsured (and don't qualify for medicaid even though I am broke) so things just get worse and worse. I almost killed myself last month but decided not to and from there have found NO solutions on how to live a better life. I am at my wits end.
