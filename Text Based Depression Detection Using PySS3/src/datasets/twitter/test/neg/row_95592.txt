Im such a loserIm 15yrs old.. i havent spoken to a girl yet.. never in my life. Im super scared of doing it.. and scared of being alone forever because of being such an ass with the girls.. im an introvert and sometimes i just hate myself so much.. im thinking about how i could do it.. kill myself.. i dont think i could do it... im even weak to do it.. last few days a girl is chatting with me.. and i dunno what to do.. shed like to go out.. But my head would go crazy if that happened.. i would love to be with her.. more than friends.. just having her laying on me.. feel her body on mine sensually.. But i feel like i ruined this free pass to heaven as well.. i dont think i will ever find someone.. i just cant do it
