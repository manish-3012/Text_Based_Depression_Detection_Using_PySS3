I think I'm just scared and idk whyI have never met someone who was a bigger loser than myself, I left my girl, my job and my friends to come to Florida and be with my dad and brother who moved down here on a pipe dream they said they needed my help to pay bills and I always thought you cant turn your back on family, I've been here a year and I don't have any friends, I'm working two shit jobs and just living my life a bottle at a time. Now I don't go to college, I'm living with my parent at the age of 23, I'm always broke and I'm so awkward and shy that I just can't make conversation or any friends at all.  I've never felt this alone. I'm out of options, I drive for uber eats and when I go out I bring my 45. but for some reason I can't do what I know I need to do I was never happy before I moved and I'm not happy now. Why do I carry on when I know that I can just stop the pain? Is it just fear? All i wanna do is be free of this so why can't I.
