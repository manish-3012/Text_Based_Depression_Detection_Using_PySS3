i want to die i dont deserve to livei moved in with my abuser a year ago and that didnt go well so i got kicked out. i was 17. i got a job and found a place to live but i was so messed up id breakdown every week so after almost a year my family helped me fly back and be with them again. i still feel so much hatred and depression i just wanna die everyone whose hurt me has it better than me and i know its because im horrible.

my mom was asking what i wanted for christmas  and my stepdad said â€œwhy are we still getting them anything? theyre 18.â€ and i dont know why that hit me so hard because hes right. even jf i wasnt 18 i dont deserve gifts. ive done nothing but make everyones life miserable and i dont deserve anything. the only thing i have that makes me happy is my cat but she doesnt need me either and she will live on without me. i really think i need to die and let this miserable human being finally get rest. this is so stupid 

ive been thinking about going and jumping off a bridge or bleeding out i use to be afraid of pain but i dont think it matters anymore to me and thats scary. i know the only person who can save me is myself but i dont even want to because all i see is a miserable horrible disgusting person
