Does anyone here feels like they donâ€™t really wanna live anymore?Everyday I always thought of like taking my own life, like if that would make everything of my problem disappear, i know its a selfish thought but everyday i wake up feeling like i just dont want this life anymore, everyday waking up feeling dreadful than the day before, thereâ€™s always a new problem waiting for me once i get out of my bed. What is wrong with me?
