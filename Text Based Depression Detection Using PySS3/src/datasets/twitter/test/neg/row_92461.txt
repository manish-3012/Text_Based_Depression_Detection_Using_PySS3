I will never be enoughI have been used so many times even after getting so hurt I made myself vulnerable and open for new relationships. Used to give some people all my love, energy and time but in the end they either leave because they don't care, or I get cheated on, or they use me as a distraction and last but not least, when they leave me because I wasn't enough. I'm never enough. Trying so hard and yet get called selfish or not enough.
Everyone I once cared about so much just used me. I have been used my life, my parents still abuse me even though i'm 18, I got hit today and that just did it for me. I just broke down. My friends just manipulate me for their own reasons. My ex boyfriend was a dick who just used me. I'm so tired of not being enough anymore. I told my parents about my mental illness and they just yelled at me for being entitled and that I had no reason to be depressed. My dearest friend didn't care when I told them I was suicidal. No one cares. Depression has reached it's highest point and I think I will kill myself soon.
