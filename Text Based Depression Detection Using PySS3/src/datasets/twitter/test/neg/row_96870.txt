It gets better.I have attempted 8 times in my life 3 times in high school and five times while I was an adult. While in high school it was because of bullying and failing classes, while an adult it was because of mostly thinking I failed progressing towards my future or failing in personal relationships. But it does get better, i see a lot of people struggling on this sub Reddit and I hope they keep moving forward on there personnel journey without giving up as I have in the past. 

After all the attempts and difficulties in the past i can confidently say I have gotten better, each day is no longer a struggle to the next and every interaction never feels like the last. 

To anyone feeling like they want to kill themselves no matter what, there are reasons to keep moving forward. There are reasons to stay a live there, there really are I promise you, I love you all and hope that you can see that as I have. And if anyone and I mean anyone needs someone to talk to about anything HMU on here and Iâ€™ll give you my personal number to text/call. 

Last thing I know, itâ€™s an on going battle and everyoneâ€™s not the same, things that worked for me may not work for everyone but I hope everyone achieves a self purpose and self worth.
