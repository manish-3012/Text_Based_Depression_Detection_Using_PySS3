i think i am actually going to kill myself.it feels like i go from being ok to completely drained in a matter of minutes and now i just constantly feel drained. I am 15 years old and everything is just too much, ive just lost someone who told me they would never leave and i stupidly made them my source of happiness and now i have nothing. Before, suicide probably wouldnt of been something i wouldve gone through with but now i feel like i genuinely will. its a serious option.
