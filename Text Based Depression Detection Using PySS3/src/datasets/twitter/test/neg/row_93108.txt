Why should I keep holding on?No one would notice. None of my "friends" or my family would realize. I fucking hate my life, I just want this to be over. HRT has helped, but it nor surgery will ever be a substitute for having been born CIS. I lost my favourite job last year after coming out as trans, and then my savings as I held onto my apartment, and finally my apartment in January of this year.

I'm still homeless, still unemployed. Even if I get surgery, my medical doctor says that it hardly does anything for sexual function. That is, no pleasure. I won't be able to enjoy being penetrated. Ever.

All I have to look forward to is a life if expensive surgeries to mitigate my self loathing. Painful permanent/semi permanent hair removal (that's also expensive). Never finding anyone that'll date me because of the fact I'm trans, because mostly everyone is straight, and then the next biggest group of girls are Lesbian. Even a lot of bi girls wouldn't give me a second thought.

I hate myself. I hate my life. It'll get better, but it'll never get good enough. I don't want to try anymore. I have a ton of razor blades laying around since I use a safety razor. I've been thinking about cutting. Might get drunk first, because I hate sharp pain. Or find some weed. I hate weed but oh well, if it makes the pain more tolerable as I go out.
