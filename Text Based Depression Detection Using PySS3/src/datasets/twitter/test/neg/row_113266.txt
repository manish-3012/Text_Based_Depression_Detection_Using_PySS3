I'm considering suicide, im 13.I have loving parents, i have friends, i live in a normal house, i go to a large, popular school, i eat tasty food, my parents have a stable income, i don't have any major illnesses, i live a normal, average life.

And yet those don't matter to me.

I just want to die, i just want to leave this world behind, all which make it great, and all which make it bad.

People tend to say, 'Your too young to consider suicide, your just a child' but i gave myself to much time to think about it.

This is a repost of another post i made on this subreddit, i just dont really know what to choose anymore.

 

I've done hours of research on google looking for a painless way to die, i've read every comment on every thread i could find about how to die.

I always get mixed answers, some say that hanging is painless and they give a thorough explanation on why, but others say that its painful and they give a very detailed explanation on why.

I live in a country where guns aren't allowed, if it was, i would have shot myself a few months ago.

I want to die not because i get abused or made fun of, i have loving parents who care for me and love me, i have great friends who hang out with me even when people think its weird that they hang out with me since they are quite popular.

I want to die not because of how people treat me, i want to die just because of the worthlessness of life.

Such a stupid answer, such an empty statement, my reason to die is nothing compared to those who had fought in war or those who has lost family.

But i know that i will live a good life in the future, i know that i might be able to get a wife, a family, i'll be able to live peacefully in my house, playing games, watching movies and anime, i know that my life isn't as bad compared to others.

But i had always thought of the world very differently.

I'm an introvert who doesn't play sports, i have weak muscles, a bad voice, an unhealthy yet thin body, i lost my grandmother and my close uncle, but none of these is the reason i want to die.

I want to die simply because of its reward.

I want to die because im scared of life, im terrified of the words i will hear once my mother looks at my grades this quarter, i want to die because im afraid of the looks i will get once i walk out of my house, im frightened of the life i will live once im finished with school, and so many more reasons why, and the biggest one is something i can't describe with words.

Simple reasons to others, painful to me.

I'm sure you have never heard of this, but i have a thing called maladaptive day dreaming.

**Maladaptive daydreaming**, also called excessive daydreaming, is a proposed diagnosis of a disordered form of dissociative [absorption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_(psychology)) associated with excessive [fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_(psychology)) that is not recognized by any major medical or psychological criteria. It can result in [distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distress_(medicine)), can replace human interaction and may interfere with normal functioning such as social life or work.

Of course that's not the reason why i want to die, it simply benefits my will to perish.

The world is a beautiful place, if im dead i wont be able to see it, i wont be able to see the smiles of joy i will get once i get married, i wont be able to hear the cries of sadness that will happen once i die peacefully.

But the world's just the same, with the same people doing the same things, dying the same way, living the same way, thinking the same way.

We cry when a school shooter kills innocent children, we cry because those children had hopes and dreams unlike any other.

But aren't they just the same?

A shooter gets called a coward for killing children, yet who else is brave enough to pull the trigger of a gun on a child?

There are many reasons why i want to die, but i simply just cannot state it well.

It's like knowing the answer to a question you cannot ask.

I know my own reasons to die, i just cannot say it.

Simple words with simple meaning can mean a lot to a man, but i've never thought of those as meaningful.

Life has many great things ahead of me, but i'll have to throw those away the moment i stumble upon the end of my path.

Death is a gift to those hurt enough to want it, but I'm not hurt.
