I think its time to hang it up for good.Im depressed, aimless and im jaded about relationships &amp; friendships. I tried to kill myself 2 weeks ago and I think i'm going to finish the job. I have no support from family and I'm doing a lot on my own. The lonliness is killing me inside. Im drinking a bottle of vodka and see if I get the balls to wrap that belt around my neck. Peace and love to you all.
