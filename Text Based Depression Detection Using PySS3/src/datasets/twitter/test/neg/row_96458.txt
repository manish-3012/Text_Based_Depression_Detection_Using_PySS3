Emotional rollercoaster putting me at risk for impulsive suicideI am such a fucking insane person for the past couple months. Getting treatment next week but until then I am so miserable, I keep jumping from no hope and misery into some excitement for life and contentment.

I get so low that if I had my suicide method readily available, I would be dead. With enough commitment to suicide, all it would take me is a few hours to have what I need to die, which hopefully is enough to outlast the climax of my negative emotions to die
