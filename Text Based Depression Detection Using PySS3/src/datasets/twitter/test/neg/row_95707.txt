I feel completely normal, but still want to end it all.I am not depressed, sad, or any of those negative things. I appreciate life-everything about it. I feel happy, sad, anxious, excited, everything. Nothing is wrong with me. But one question always pops into my head: what is the point of living? What is the end game? Because of this, I am contemplating of suicide because I really dont see the point of living.
