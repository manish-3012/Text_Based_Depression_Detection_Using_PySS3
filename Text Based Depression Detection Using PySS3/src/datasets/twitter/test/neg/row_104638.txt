I wrote my suicide noteOkay, so a couple nights ago i decided i needed to have a suicide plan, i started writing my notes. When i was done i felt an odd feeling of happiness and peace. Does anybody know why it felt so good?

i had wrote five notes personally addressing people and explaining why i killed myself. And one disclosing how i want my stuff to be given away and stuff like that. (btw its so annoying trying to plan your suicide if you're bipolar)
