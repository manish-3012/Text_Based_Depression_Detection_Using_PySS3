No One Cares and they Most Likely Shouldn'tNo one cares.

No one cares.

No one cares.

No one cares.

It's not even that they've forgotten about you.
You were never there in the first place.
A black hole, devoid of anything worthwhile.
Cut your disgusting tongue out.
Spare them of your talk.

What do you want?

I want it to stop hurting so much.

Well, you know how to do that, don't you?
Your body practically begs for it.
Day in and day out.
Like a bitch in heat.
You don't belong here.
You make everyone you love unhappy just by being around.
You are incapable of love.
You are incapable of being loved.
Rationality drowned by screaming.
It will never go away.
It is in your nature to suffer.
You are addicted to it.
Masturbate to having your throat slit.
Get off to the memory of being raped.

There is no joy left for you.

No reason to stay.

Everything has gone away.

And it's all.

Your.

Fault.
