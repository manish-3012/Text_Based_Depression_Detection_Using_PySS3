Motivation completely gone just feeling like I am living a vacant lifeIn spite of being what most consider a very smart kid with a bright future I am suddenly finding myself living without a purpose.  I used to care deeply about marks and grades, however I am now very far behind in my university schooling and find myself not caring whether I wake up tomorrow or not.
