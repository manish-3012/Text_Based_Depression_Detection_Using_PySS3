If life fucks everyone over, whatâ€™s the point?Iâ€™m worthless, meaningless, and have absolutely no impact on this world and never will.

I just want to  get myself admitted into a mental hospital, runaway, or kill my self. I just need a break. I just need to be somewhere, anywhere, that isnâ€™t here. 

But, I donâ€™t have a car so I canâ€™t just drive myself to a hospital. Does the suicide hotline track calls? Jfc Iâ€™m just done with wanting to kill my self all the damn time.
