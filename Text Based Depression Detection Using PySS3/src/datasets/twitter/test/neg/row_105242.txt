Considering suicide but held back by the fear of entering a worse realityI have been thinking about suicide for the last couple of months. At times I'd actually go as far as to picture it in my head, and all I can see are twisted realities which surpass the absurdity of our world by a thousand miles. 

Most people fear not existing, when they think about suicide they just see nothing, the void, the lack of knowledge of what's to come. And it is scary, but for me that isn't the worst part. I picture the possibility of every other scenario of which people don't seem to have thought of. Whether it's hell as described in religions or something else, if it includes suffering from which I wish to escape I want nothing to do with it.

I'm still afraid of the "nothing" most people are afraid of, but unlike most, at least most that I know, that's not enough to keep me away from committing suicide, what is though is a scenario in which after I commit suicide I enter a reality of suffering worse than this world. That alone is really what makes my intent of killing myself impractical in the mean time at least. 

And it's fucking shit, it would be a thousand times better for me to know that if I kill myself that's it, no more suffering. Still scary but a whole lot less scary than the other options. This world is a sadistic circus.
