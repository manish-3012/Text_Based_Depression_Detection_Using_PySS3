I think it's time to do this.I was going to kill myself on the last day of May but someone intervened and I ended up in the hospital instead. It's been nearly two months now though and nothing gets better. My ex left me for my best friend, and now I've lost them both. I don't want to be alive. I'm trying to get pills from my friend (though he doesn't want to give them to me) but if I can't, I have another plan. It's time, I don't want to be here, I don't want to sit around any longer waiting for something to change, get better. I feel ready.
