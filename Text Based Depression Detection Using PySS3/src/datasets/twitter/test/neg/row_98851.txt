Can't Get Her Back and Life Doesn't Feel Worth Living.My girlfriend and I broke up five months ago, and for a while I really thought I was getting over her, but now I see that I'm not. I miss her uncontrollably, I think about her ALL the time, everything about her was so good, and because of \*reasons\*, I can't even contact her, let alone get her back somehow. Her family DESPISES me, I made a lot of mistakes in our relationship, and I don't even know where she lives anymore. I see her on social media sometimes, and I know she wishes well for me, but it's just not enough for me anymore. I feel like the rest of my life will be constant torment of thinking of her, wondering what she's doing and who she's with, and thinking about everything we used to do together. It's driving me insane, and it makes me want to stop living. I don't think I will ever find anyone that makes me happy like she died, and I don't think I can live with that.
