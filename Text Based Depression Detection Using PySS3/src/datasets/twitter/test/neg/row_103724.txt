A permanent solution to a temporary problem of existence.I have no joy in life. There is not a single person out of the many many people I know that make me feel ok to be me. No one loves me back no matter how much love I give them. There is clearly a flaw in my ability to interact with other people. I am in my mid 30s and have done more to work on these flaws than I can possibly describe. At some point the effort becomes more than the payout. I am at constant odds with everyone around me no matter who they are or where I am. 
Evolution is not a streamlined operation. There are enormous avenues for life to take and not all, in fact very few last long at all. The unfortunate side of this process is that many forms of life are brought into existence only to suffer and die as nothing more than a fluke or odd fuck up. The benefit of being human is that I can recognize myself as one of these flukes and take myself out of the gene pool before I reproduce or cause anymore harm. 
I live in constant pain and suffering. My quality of life is so low I  pray to whatever can hear me, every single night to, please let me die in my sleep. Why is it ok for people is physical pain and suffering to end their lives but not for people suffering emotionally? Instead I must go about causing physical pain and suffering to my body until I die. Donâ€™t let that last sentence go by you so quick, read it again. Do you have any idea how hard it is to kill yourself without a gun? 
There is nothing left to live for except the natural fear of pain and death. So I leave this posted here as a sort of note. I doubt anyone will ever give a fuck enough to break into my phone and look at all my stuff but if you made it this far and youâ€™re reading this after Iâ€™m dead then fuck you! Why didnâ€™t you show me more love in life? You care so much about me you had to go through my phone but when I died I never felt more alone. Liars, everyone Iâ€™ve everyone known has been nothing but a selfish liar.
