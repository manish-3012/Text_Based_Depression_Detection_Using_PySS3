Trauma (trigger warning)U feel like i need to get this of my chest somewhere.
Since i was little my life has just gone downhile, i've had so much trauma's that have just been building up inside me and sometimes it gets to much.
It all startend at 6y/o. I don't remember for how long it went on, all i know is that i got sexually harrased by someone older that knew it was wrong. If my mom hadn't come in the room and saw what he was doing i think he would have actually raped me.
Anyway i forgot about that for a while, cuz i was young.
Then when i was 12 and just started highschool, i became a victim of bullying. I got beaten and mentally abused, my grandpa and dog also died that year and this all justlead to me getting depressed. I wanted to kms and i stopped rating. I began hurting myself and for the following 2 years i struggeled with an Ed.
Then it got a little bit better and i got a bf. In the beginning everything went Well but after a while he started cheating which has now resulted in me having trust issues and doubting myself. (i was 16 at the time)
Eventually everything started to get better but then when quarantine came it all just got bad again. I don't even know how but i had a lot of argument and fights with my parents (mostly my dad). I got depressed again and then at the age of 17 on Jan 31 2020 i tried to kms. I failed obviously and i'm glad but sometimes when things get hard i think about all this and get sad again. I'm afraid i might explode one time. I feel like i have just so much anger in me and i don't even know why and i just feel like i don't know anyone who can relate and that i'm the only one..
