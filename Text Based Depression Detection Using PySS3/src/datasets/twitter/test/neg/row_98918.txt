I wish you cared, momMom

If I killed myself would you cry for me or for yourself?
Would you cry knowing the pain I was in, or Would you cry knowing I'd never paint you a portrait again?

Mom

If you knew I was going to kill myself, would you stop me?

Even knowing that it's not that easy?

Would you lock me in a closet in a straitjacket so I was physically unable to harm myself
Or would you actually put in the time to heal my mind?

Even knowing how long that would take?
Even knowing how fucked up I am?
Even knowing that you'd have to feel some of this pain to understand? To help?

I don't think anyone on the world would do that for me, and I understand.

But sometimes

When I'm depressed and I'm holding the knife
I wish I could call a mother and be comforted
I wish you weren't my mother
I wish I had a mother who cared about me when I was a child.

I wish I had the will to live

And I wish you cared whether I lived or died too.
