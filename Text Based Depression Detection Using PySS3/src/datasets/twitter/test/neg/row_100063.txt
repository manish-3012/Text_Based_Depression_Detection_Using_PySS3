I will commit suicide sometime before I turn 18I am so fucking scared of becoming an adult. I can't fucking see myself with any sort of fucking money-making job when I'm older. I have no fucking dreams anymore, nothing short-term, nothing long-term. I'm fucking considered "smart" too whatever the fuck that means. People like my parents expect me to go places. i'm about to disappoint so sorry in advance. 

i'm so fucking weak and pathetic. I feel like passing out after something easy like running. i'm so slow and fat why can't i just be athletic

i just hear constant replays of things bullies have said to me whenever i mess up. gets so fucking loud sometimes. i feel overwhelmed 24/7.

i can't feel anything right. I could look into the mirror and tell me I hate me and then laugh and cry about it for an hour. Fucking hate it

Why did I have to be born gay aha my parents can't love me now, fuck this religion or whatever. it's hilarious how i was such a devout Christian 2 years ago and now can't fathom the idea of someone, something, out there actually caring for *me.* imagine that.

everything HURTS like SHIT and i FUCKING hate IT

I want someone to stop me from breathing right now that'd be super convenient for a bunch of people

i love how i ultimately have no real friends. people would give a shit if i died, but they'd definitely forget me after a year. 7 billion fucking people exist and i'm one of the lonely ones. hah. pathetic.

my only reason for not trying anything before is cuz what if I failed then everyone would know and my parents would have to pay a shitton of money because i'd be in the hospital and they have so much financial shit to deal with already

why did someone, anyone, genuinely think it was a good idea for someone like me to live past the age of 3 lol I have absolutely nothing to offer 

i want to feel better, whatever that means but at the same time I just want it to end. maybe those are actually the same thing.

in advance, i'm sorry to my family. i'm sorry to my parents for being such a failure of a daughter. i'm sorry to my older brother; i'm not as strong as you think i am. i'm sorry to my "friends" why did you all leave me, but i'll miss you too. i'm sorry to any of my online friends. if i don't check in with you one day, maybe i'll leave a note explaining why. 

and i'm so sorry to my little brother

i'm such a disappointment and utter failure as an older sister to you. i'm so sorry i couldn't play all those games with you. i'm so sorry i couldn't listen to you telling me a funny story. i'm so sorry for just constantly shutting you out. i'm so sorry for abruptly yelling at you all those times. i'm so sorry for crying like the pathetic shit i am.  i'm so sorry for being a genuinely bad role model in general. don't follow my example, please. i love you so much, just don't follow me.
