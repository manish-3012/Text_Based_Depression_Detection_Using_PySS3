been thinking abt it latelyIâ€™ve always been like. incredibly susceptible to suicidal thoughts and behaviors since like age 10 (no one ever did anything abt it bcus it was always read as attention seeking behaviors and my parents â€œrefused to buy into itâ€) and now Iâ€™m nearing 7 years with the hell that is major depressive disorder and itâ€™s. not getting better. at all.
I am absolutely miserable beyond words even if my medications make me feel slightly better on a base level. Iâ€™m short as fuck (not even 5â€™ and physically cannot grow anymore because apparently my dad didnâ€™t love me enough to give me good genes lmao), wet koala levels of ugly, horrendously overweight with a metabolism that makes it genuinely impossible to lose weight, and my health is getting worse and worse every day because my dumb ass doctors canâ€™t be bothered to figure out whatâ€™s wrong with me beyond â€œwell you outwardly look fine so just take some ibuprofen, eat your veggies, and exerciseâ€ (if they even looked @ my medical records theyâ€™d know I canâ€™t even have ibuprofen but whatever ðŸ™ƒ)
I really could keep going on and on about whats got me so down. but the point is I genuinely do not think I should be here anymore. at all. none of that â€œbuhbuhbuh life gets better1!1!â€ bullshit because no, no it doesnâ€™t, not when youâ€™re like this. this body feels broken and malformed already and I supposedly havenâ€™t even â€œbegunâ€ living yet, whatever that means. and to top it all off Iâ€™m apparently autistic as well according to my mother, she just never bothered getting a formal diagnosis on me when my THREE YEAR OLD SELF saw a counselor since she didnt want me to have an excuse for not doing as well as my neurotypical classmates. yeah. I really wish I was making that shit up. 
so all in all Iâ€™m basically a prototype of a functional adult that failed before it could ever really begin. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for so long I genuinely canâ€™t imagine going to college outside of idle fantasy and living past 20 is a complete fuckin nope. 

not sure when or how, but one day, itâ€™s gonna happen. I just know it. and itâ€™s all I really know I can look forward to these days. itâ€™s sad and over dramatic but like, whatever, you know. what else can you really do about it.
