I can't take itI'm ready to do it finally, I can't handle my depression. I lost my relationship because of it. It's ruined my life, I had one person that loved me my girlfriend of 3 years, but now that's gone, and I'm empty. My depression has gotten worse and worse the past 5 months, broke up with my girlfriend I was living with about 3 months ago. Im broken. I'm so so sad all the time and just want to feel loved by anyone again. I've never felt so alone, I've never felt so low. This disease (depression) has controlled my thoughts, taken my self esteem, taken everything from me. On the outside I'm the guy that makes everyone laugh, life of the party, very popular, I attract women, but when I'm by myself and not trying to make others happy and feel good about themselves, I'm back to reality, one in which I hate myself, I miss the love of my life, I miss my dad, I miss feeling wanted or loved by any family or friends. I want to talk to someone about my sadness, but that's not my role, I'm the one others come to with their problems, but I need help with my own. I can't stop thinking of killing myself, as to escape this pain to escape being inside my own head. I really just want someone to fucking care about me genuinely, and not see my surface happiness and charisma as myself. My circumstances aren't bad, and people are off far worse than I, yet I feel this way, all the time, every minute of everyday. God built me with this brain, and I am angry at him for it.
