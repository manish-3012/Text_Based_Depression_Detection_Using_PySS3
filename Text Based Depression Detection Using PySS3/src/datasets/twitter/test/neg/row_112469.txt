whatâ€™s wrong with mei wanna feel okay. i rlly do. but iâ€™m so messed up in the head. iâ€™m barely 16, about to turn 17 (july 9th) and i aware itâ€™s not healthy to be thinking the way i do. specially for me age. life itâ€™s just so repetitive. it feels fake, like a game. it annoys the fuck outta me. Iâ€™ve tried so many things to keep my head busy but it all comes down to doing the same thing and it makes me go nuts. if life is just repetitive like this i really canâ€™t handle it no more.
