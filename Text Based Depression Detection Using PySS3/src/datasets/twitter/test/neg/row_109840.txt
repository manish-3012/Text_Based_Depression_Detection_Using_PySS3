I know I will never grow old.Does anyone else feel this way? Like you have planned to take your own life for so long that you know you will not just grow old and die? 

I have always said from the age of 16 that I will not live any longer than 25. Im 23 now and Im amazed Ive gotten this far, mind you though I have had countless failed attempts. 

I just know that I will either die by my own hands or in a car accident. I dont know, I just really feel that's how Ill die.
