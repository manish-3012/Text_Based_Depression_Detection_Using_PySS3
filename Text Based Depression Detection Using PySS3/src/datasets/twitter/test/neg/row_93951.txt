SexualityMy sexuality scares me. I know who I am I know what im into its the fact that im scared to come out. Im afraid of what people say. I know someone might say "Just be yourself," but its like I cant be myself without being somewhat approved by others. I love helping people and seeing people be happy is, in the end, honestly all I want. I want to see people i love be happy, I want to see them find love, I want to see them succeed and get the jobs they want, I want to help them in anyway I can, be the shoulder they cry on when they need someone. The fact that im an in the closet bi just goes against me though bc the city that I live in isnt exactly the friendliest place for the lgbtq community. Im not an activist either really im not in the news for the lgbtq stuff hell idc I just focus on my little bubble, the problems I can solve, not the big picture. I just feel as though me coming out would greatly hinder how those around me feel. My trust has been broken by those closest to me and some people i didnt want to know, now know. Its making me want to relapse. I want to grab my exacto knife and plunge it into my veins. I just want to stop. I dont want to breathe, eat or sleep. I just want to stop existing. If I need to reach that through a gateway called death I think I'm ready for it. All i bring is shame to those who love me so I may as well cut the flower in the bud.
