dark thoughts are goneSo a while ago I was seriously considering overdosing on my meds and whiskey. I can't understand why but after I got a call from a friend and he reminded how much he's going to miss me now that summer's almost over, I feel good almost great. Maybe it's because I haven't slept for like 40 hours, but it's all good. I knew these antidepressants couldn't create happiness, I just have to be awesome, be me. So yeah, the moral of the story is to not kill yourself before things start being awesome.
