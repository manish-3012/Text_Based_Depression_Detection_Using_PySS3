I have everything and nothing all at once, and it makes me want to dieI've (23F) been depressed since adolescence, many hospital trips for self harm. Suicidal ideation. Eventually I recovered...and now. I'm back again. I know recovery isn't linear, but there's something deeply wounding about having created a life and connections and then hitting the dark days and seeing the holes in it all.

I have a partner of 2 years who I am engaged to (27M) who I'm beginning to notice has no tangible ambition, doesn't care how they look, doesn't seem to care if I'm happy or even feign giving a fuck about the things I care about. They fuck me without foreplay. They never compliment me without me pulling and prompting, they don't help around the house. Conversations have been had and it just feels like I'm not worth it to them. After being abused in so many relationships before, I feel I should be grateful I'm with someone who is neutral...but I can't help but want better.

I'm renting a house from my dad with said partner. It's a really nice place for what we pay but it's too big for two people. I feel swallowed by the space and it takes so much to keep it clean (especially because my partner doesn't help at all) We got back from a vacation visiting my mom and got a puppy who I love but its just one more thing that I have to take care of. I nanny as a job too. So it's all non stop back to back taking care of everything and everyone else...I don't feel like I'm worth anything outside being everyone's caretaker. Unless I'm pleasing someone else I'm seemingly worthless. 

I'm sorry if the above just seems, whiney. It's just been such a long journey to try and recover only to slip back into feeling just worthless. I feel trapped in my current situation, a duty to my dad to pay rent and keep the house clean so he can get settled (context he moved away out of state). I'm so committed to my partner and my family adores him, I couldn't leave him now. There's too many attachments. I feel like I backed myself into a corner and the only way out is death.
