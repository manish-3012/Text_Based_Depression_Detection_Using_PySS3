I'm so fucking lonely.I don't fucking know what to do.  I've been on and off having suicidal thoughts for the past 6 years or so but it's the worst it's ever been now.  I've been missing classes and some days I just lay in bed all day.  I'm a long way from home for college and my only social interaction outside of the classes I attend is when I see my family during breaks.  I used to be really social and had tons of friends but now I don't have anyone.  The only thing that's kept me from killing myself is knowing how heartbroken my family would be bit the longer I'm away the less of a motivation that is.  I go to the campus center to get food some days just so I can sit near other people. I crave human interaction but I don't have any and I'm terrified of putting myself out there.
