I feel like the scum of the EarthWell... this is a throwaway I guess. Well about half an hour ago I made one of the biggest mistakes of my life. Well that doesn't explain much so I'll start from the beginning. I'm gonna keep the details vague because my family situation is so uniquely fucked up that even my most distant relatives would immediately recognize me from this first paragraph.   
  Well I've been spending this week at a family members house as a little vacation, and my step-sister is here as well much to my surprise. I've had a crush on my step sister since I was little but that was demolished tonight.   
  Long story short this relative only had one spare bedroom which me and my step sister were assigned to. Normally this would be fine because we're fucking related but apparently I'm too sick to have normally apply to me.   
  The whole week went fine up until tonight. It was around 1 A.M. when I woke up to find her scooting closer to me like she was trying to spoon me. I should have stopped it here like a normal person. I didn't. I laid like that for a while. She then stood up and sat down. On. My. Hand.   
  This was no accident as she did not move when she felt my hand under her... you know... I don't know why I did this but I started to ever so slightly move my hand.   
  This continued for about 10 minutes with me moving my hand about half a centimeter each minute. At this point she was laying down and her breathing would quicken with each minute that went by. Then she... I don't know how to say it anyway else, she reached for me.  
  I immediately felt sick and left the room. I didn't know where to go so I went to the bathroom and kind of just lost it. I started throwing up. I didn't want to face her so I shot her a text basically saying how wrong it all felt and how sick I felt.   
  I came out of the bathroom and she had not opened the text, she was pretending to be asleep. I know 100% No doubt in my mind that is not the case.  
  I don't know where to go right now, I leave today so I won't have to face her but the thought other telling anyone terrifies me.  
  I don't know how this is possible but I feel violated and like a fucking rapist at the same time. Pretty ironic huh? A violated rapist.  
  I just don't know what to do, I'm terrified, and I feel like a monster.
