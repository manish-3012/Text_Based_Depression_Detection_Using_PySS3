Does it count as being suicidal if you know you're too fucking scared of pain to actually go through with anything?I want to die, but I don't want my final minutes/hours to be filled with excruciating pain. The only things I have here are pills and knives, and I'd never be able to do that. Idk, I guess I just needed to say something. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. Sorry to waste everyone's time.
