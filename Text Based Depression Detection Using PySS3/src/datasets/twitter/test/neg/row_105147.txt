Iâ€™m sick of everyoneI know Iâ€™m gonna do it soon bc I am so constantly upset, rageful and emotional that I am losing the ability to act normal and interact with others. I wake up crying. I wake up and cut myself. Everything feels pointless. My research feels futile. Everything about me is bad.

Itâ€™s my third post on here this week. Iâ€™ve called the hotlines so many times at this point. Iâ€™m talking to my therapist today but what is even the point of that? Iâ€™m just going to minimize things so she doesnâ€™t 5150 me. I have no one else to go to. Iâ€™m done.
