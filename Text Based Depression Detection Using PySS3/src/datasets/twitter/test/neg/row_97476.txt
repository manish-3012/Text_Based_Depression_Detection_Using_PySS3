iâ€™m such a fucking disappointing fuck upi just impulse quit my job. iâ€™m sad about it. they liked me. i shouldâ€™ve done it. it was the first time in a long time i felt like i had purpose. now thatâ€™s gone again. i just saw the joker with some friends but apparently i agreed to see it with my boyfriend first. iâ€™ve been too out of it to really retain any information so i guess i didnt remember but now heâ€™s pissed at me. hes really all thatâ€™s keeping me here. idk what iâ€™d do if he left. heâ€™s so mad. i should just fucking do it. heâ€™ll find someone so much better than me. iâ€™m such a fucking failure of a human. waste of fucking oxygen.
