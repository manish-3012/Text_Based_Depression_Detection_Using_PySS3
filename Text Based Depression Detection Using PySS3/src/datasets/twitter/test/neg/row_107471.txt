Just trying to keep my head above waterStruggling to maintain life in my job, mainly waking up on time. Found out half of my leaders donâ€™t even think Iâ€™m legitimate about it and its just an excuse. Fuck em. Constantly haunted by thoughts of just ending it all but my mom is the only thing I can think of to stop it. Donâ€™t get me wrong the rest of my family loves me and I love them but thereâ€™s a bond with my mom beyond compare. I canâ€™t help but think that if I did it sheâ€™d be crushed, Iâ€™d ruin her life and likely fuck up my 17 yo sister and 1 yo sister who I havenâ€™t even met. Trying to go to therapy now but the thoughts are constant, just hoping by some chance I donâ€™t wake up or get hit by a truck or something. I constantly think of images of my dead body in a tub or something with wrists slashed. I think Iâ€™m just waiting for my mom to die then Iâ€™ll do it, itâ€™s probably a long wait but fuck if I donâ€™t wish there was an easier way or my parents were shittier so I had no hesitation. Probably wonâ€™t do anything soon but felt like maybe this would help since nothing else seems to. Too fucking tired of the daily grind to keep pretending Iâ€™m fine and Iâ€™m about to start planning for the inevitable
