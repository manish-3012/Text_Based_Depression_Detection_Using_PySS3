I screwed up.Hey, I'm new here, and just wanted to tell someone how I've been feeling this recent days and how I screwed up.  

So, recently I've developed fear to almost everything, I am anxious most of the time, I feel nervous, hopeless, scared, tired, depressed, and of course suicidal. Yesterday, I almost commited suicide, but then decided not to do it, I gave life another chance, but then something happened.  

My family doesn't know how I've been feeling because I'm scared to tell them and how they will react. And I really wanted to talk to someone. I searched for help groups on instagram hoping somebody would talk to me, I found someone trustworthy who looked like a nice person and when I finally told them what was happening to me, they posted it in their instastories (the account has almost 100k followers) telling everyone to pray for me.  

I was obviously nervous and told them please to delete it, but this guy started telling me I had to get help and he needed to contact my parents to tell them. I ended up blocking the guy and put my account on private but this "instastory" will delete itself only after 24 hours and I'm scared he will try to reach me from another account and tell my sister or anyone I know.  

I know this is a long post but I would really like some advice. Thank you.  

TL;DR: feeling suicidal, talked to somebody online privately, but they posted it in their account and told me they would tell my parents
