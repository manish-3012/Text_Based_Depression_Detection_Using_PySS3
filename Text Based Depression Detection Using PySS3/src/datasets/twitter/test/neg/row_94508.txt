planning and readySo i have purges most of my possessions and getting ready to end my pain of 30 years of pain.  I haven't wrote any letters and unsure if I will, I am just getting rid of things to make things easier to clean my mess up.  I'm struggling with my rope, I am able to make the noose but oddly making the knot tight where I will i will do it bothers me, it should be the easiest part.  I plan in 9 days maybe halloween.  my head won't slow down, I have been a failure my enife life never good enough for anyone or anything, job after job, relationship failure every time.  I can't find anyone that knows my pain so I keep it in isolate feom everyone and live in this awful place, medications and therapy hasn't worked.  I'm so lost and at 40 I shouldn't be this way.  all I hear anymore is just fix it, I haven't been able to.
