Well that flopped.Donâ€™t know what can be classed as an attempt these days, honestly. I positioned my noose (that I take everywhere with me) on my carotids and lay on my front, letting my head drop slowly as I went to sleep so that the more I drifted off the less aware Iâ€™d be of the tingling in my face and the numbness.

About five minutes in the sound of my fan behind me pulsates along with my heartbeat and I get so annoyed at the sound of it going on and on that I canâ€™t drift off so I just sit up and kick my fan over. Funny that thatâ€™s what stopped me for the night.

Iâ€™m so tired of everything failing for me. How much longer do I have to go on?? Why donâ€™t I have the tolerance to push through that pulsating and pressure??

Nothing works for me.
I donâ€™t even count my attempts anymore because theyâ€™re at least weekly. I havenâ€™t been in school
for five months and everyoneâ€™s preparing to put me back in there under the illusion that Iâ€™ve gotten better. But I canâ€™t turn back, itâ€™ll seem like Iâ€™m taking advantage, so I have to go in.

Iâ€™m so tired....
And my head still really hurts.
