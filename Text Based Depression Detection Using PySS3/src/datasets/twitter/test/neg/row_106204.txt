I'm tired.I'm just really fucking tired of life. Only real problem is school, where I have like 6 Fs this quarter alone and the quarter is almost over anyway, so I'm a failure in that aspect. 
I feel like a selfish bastard too. I don't have a horrible life... I mean I have great friends and decent parents, though we are poor. Its really just me being a lazy cunt who won't do shit to make himself feel better. I've decided tonight I'm going to try and kill myself, hopefully succeed. I've been able to stop myself for a while now, but whatever. Life is just way too fucking tiring, and I'm a weak and lazy son of a bitch. I've considered how it'll make my friends and family feel, but I'm really just done caring.

P.S.
Posting here about my not so bad situation but talking about how I'm going to kill myself makes me feel like an attention seeker.
Though this PS has no place here...
Whatever I'm going to die soon anyway.
