How do you cope with suicidal thoughts?I've been having suicidal thoughts for almost the past year, and I'm worried that I'll end up following through on these thoughts soon.  I don't want to turn this into a religious debate, but as a person of faith, let's just say that I worry about where my soul will go if I were to end my life.  Additionally, I know that there are many people in my life who would be devastated if I were to follow through on these urges.  However, I don't feel like I can reach out to anyone because I 1.) don't want to be seen as fragile or weak, 2.) I don't want it to end up hurting future job or relationship prospects, and 3.) I don't want anyone to worry about me.  If you were to meet me in person, you'd be shocked to learn that I'm considering suicide, as I'm good at concealing my true feelings.  I wouldn't want to break this news to anyone I know personally. 

As far as trying to remedy the problem is concerned, I've called the suicide hotline a few times, and I was seeing a therapist for a while.  The former wasn't especially helpful in the long term, simply because the people on the line didn't know me or my situation well enough.  My therapist was able to help me to some degree, but I still feel alone and misunderstood.  

For those who can relate and who are still reading (thank you), what have you been able to do to alleviate these thoughts?
