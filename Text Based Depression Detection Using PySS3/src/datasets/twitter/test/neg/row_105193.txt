I want to end it allMy serious partner and I broke up recently and I can't handle it. I was a disaster because of other mental health issues and now that she's gone I feel like I have nothing left for me to grasp on to for hope. I went to a gun store today because that seems like the only way out.

I hate this all so much but I just want to stop living so bad. Idk how I'm going to do it but I want to be gone so badly. I've been to a psych ward for suicidal thoughts and self harm back in highschool but idk if I can handle that again.

Please.. I just want to die and I don't know what to do
