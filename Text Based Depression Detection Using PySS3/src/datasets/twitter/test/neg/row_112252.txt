A group of teenagers ridiculed me yesterday. Iâ€™ve hit too many low points in these last couple of weeks.Groups of teenage girls still scare me and make me feel self conscious

And Iâ€™m in my late 20s.

Yesterday was payday for me and I always eat out on payday. I decided to get carry out from my favorite Shawarma place yesterday evening after picking up my medication.

My self-esteem has been exceptionally low these past couple of weeks. Iâ€™m dealing with a lot of health problems right now, I literally have no one to reach out to in terms of friends and family and have been ghosted by a lot of people who I thought cared about me, I am awaiting a cancer prognosis, etc. etc. Iâ€™ve also gained weight recently. I just feel like shit all around and I feel like if God exists, He fucking hates me and wants me to be miserable until I either die from some awful disease or kill myself. 

Anyway, I called my order in and I went to go pick it up. I was wearing my work clothes (business casual), and facemask. I was in the store for maybe less than five minutes. Upon exiting, there was a group of teenage girls approaching the door. They looked like they were in their late teens or possibly early 20s, and seemed like the popular type and wore a lot of make up. I held the door open for them and they all gave me the side eye, not even thanking me. When I let go of the door and started walking back to my car, I heard one of them go â€œew, did you see her? The girl who held the door open?â€ And they were all giggling. 

I fucking hate myself. Not even strangers are nice to me lmao damn.
