Is it wrong to feel this way?I know I donâ€™t have it as bad as others and I told my mom that I wanted to die and once she asked if my life was that bad. I didnâ€™t really know how to explain it. I canâ€™t keep living life this way. Iâ€™m guilt tripped everyday and I feel like itâ€™s my fault and I honestly feel like itâ€™ll be better if Iâ€™m just gone.
