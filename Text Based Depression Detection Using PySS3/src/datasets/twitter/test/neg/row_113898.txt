Is anyone else just "waiting it out"?...most of this will be the first time I've made these thoughts known to anyone, so please near with me :)

Backstory:
- early-30s male from an English-speaking area
- no serious past life issues that really confound things
- no drug involvement, though I do enjoy the odd drink ;)

So...what's the issue?

I've never really had a point to my life and have never had a desire to carve out out.  I've had this feeling starting part-way through my undergraduate degree, so for around ten years. 

- no interest in pursuing a wife or family (I like being with people but need to be alone after to compensate)
- jobs have kept my busy during the day, but certainly are not reasons to live
- I keep myself entertained in non-work time ( both with friends and solo activities ) but again these activities aren't reasons enough to live
- no siblings or dependents; closest thing to that are a few younger cousins I've been close to 
- parents are around...definitely a concern as I'd rather not put them through my death

It, more or less, feels like I am just "going through the motions" until I die...  This is causing depression-type thoughts, whereafter I distance myself from friends etc., which causes more depression...you see where I am going. I've had depressive thoughts since I was around 13 and they've been a constant in my life.  I keep them managed with distractions (friends, work, activities etc.) but they are always close by. 

I contemplate the idea of suicide on a regular basis, going between periods where I see it as a bad idea to periods where I think it makes a lot of sense. I've never made a serious attempt but have put thought into various methods. 

I've talked about the depression aspect with friends before; good quick-fix type conversations, but nothing to "give me a reason" to keep going. 

I'm not sure r/suicidewatch is even the right place for this as I'm a) not an immediate threat to myself and b) I feel extremely bad for people writing here who have so much more going on than my "being bored of living" thing. 

So...thank you for reading. If anyone has similar experiences and has any thoughts, I'd love to get another perspective.
