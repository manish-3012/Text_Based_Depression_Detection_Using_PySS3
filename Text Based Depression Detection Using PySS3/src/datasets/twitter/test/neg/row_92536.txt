Today it endsIâ€™ve been planning this for weeks. 
Iâ€™ve got a dead end job, the city I live in is crap, got nothing going for me in life. Iâ€™ve struggled with depression and anxiety for 12 years too long. Iâ€™m just done. Iâ€™m tired. Itâ€™s time for me to go. 

Iâ€™m so sorry David. I love you so much. You are the love of my life. Youâ€™ve been nothing but kind to me. Even when I felt like I didnâ€™t deserve it. Please keep living life for me like we planned. Get out of here and be happy. You have to do it. For me. Please.
