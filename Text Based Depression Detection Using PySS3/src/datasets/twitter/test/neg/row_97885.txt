BETRAYED BADLY BY ONE OF MY CLOSEST OVER A GIRL.Having a strong sense of hint about my best friend and a girlfriend that they are onto something. After having a video call they were both like completely ignoring me, cussing me, I stood good like it was a excellent friendly gesture. My girlfriend loves ear rings so much that she told my friend to bring one of then, instead of me, I was like ok. She never told me that she needs one of them, but she dis told him that. 

And now during video call, she gave a flying kiss to my friend, I dunno that she did that on purpose for making me jealous or whatever. They both smiled great. Even she showed me middle finger to me, friend laughed at me. 

After the call ended I called my friend to ask him that, only stop to cuss me. He replied with it was a friendly gesture of him, every time we meet, my friend always tries to belittle me in front of her to look cool. I said nothing, ignored it. 

Asking my friend that stop cussing, it hurts. He said leave it, it was a friendly remark. And then I angrily said that enjoy that kiss, he said Yes why not. 

This completely broke me.
