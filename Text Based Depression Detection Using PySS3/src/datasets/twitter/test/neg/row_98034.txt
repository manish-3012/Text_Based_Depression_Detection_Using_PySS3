I'm so uncertain about what to say for my suicide noteI want to tell my biological family how much I hate them and shove the most hurtful things they've said to me back in their face.

I don't know if I should tell my grandparents everything I feel so someone else knows just how bad my immediate biological family has made me feel throughout my life. Or if they would just take my family's side.

I want to make a will and state I want to be cremated and that my family can't have my ashes but I'm not sure if a note in the car next to my dead body is legally strong enough to enforce that.

I don't know if I should leave my possessions to a charity or support group I believe in so they can be sold to help fund themselves, or if such groups would even care.

I don't know if leaving my possessions to the government is the best way to prevent my family from financially salvaging anything from my death.

I don't know if I should call 911 or some hotline just before I die and state that I've felt emotionally abused by my mother father and especially brother, and that I should read my will aloud just so there's a legal record of it

But I don't know if a hotline would just dismiss what I've said because I have asperger's and a history of depression so my feelings would automatically not be valid.

Sometimes I think I just won't leave a note and let it be a mystery to my family, but then I remember all the shit they did to me and that if I didn't tell them how much I hate them then they'd win cause I'd die the way I lived, silent.

I just feel so trapped that no matter what I say or do I'll always be viewed as a crazy person so my thoughts and feelings automatically don't count and my brother will go on being his abusive asshole self and everyone will just agree with him that I'm this fucking psycho.
