HelplessnessI don't want to sound melodramatic or "edgy", but recently I've been thinking a lot of ending it. Everything just seems so dull and pointless. Death is the ultimate fate of all life, so why not just accelerate fate?

My only gripes with suicide are how my family and friends would feel afterwards. Recently I've become disillusioned with my friends, and honestly they'll get over it. As for my family, well they'll probably take it rather hard. My ideas now are to just go up somewhere into the mountains and never be heard from again.

A fitting end to this ugly world.
