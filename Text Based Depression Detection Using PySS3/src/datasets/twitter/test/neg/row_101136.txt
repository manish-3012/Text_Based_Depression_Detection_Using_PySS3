Ramblings from a throwaway who can't sleep.What's the point of living? Like, seriously, what am I even doing at this point? I don't feel a drive for anything, I enjoy things for a few weeks max. I don't like anything, I don't love anyone, I don't put in effort into anything because I fail to see the point of doing anything.

I'm going to die. Now or some time later, what's the point? Toughing it out for the good times is all well and good if you can manage it, but why bother? You'll die, and none of what made you happy will matter anymore. I'll die, the people that care that I'm dead will die.

I just don't see why I'd deal with all this sadness and pain and effort when the outcome, no matter what, is that I die. Why not just cut out the middle and die before that.

The only thing really keeping me around at this point is my family, namely my brother. It's impressive that the idea of disappointing him is whats keeping me from offing myself.

I dunno. Just wanted all that out there anonymously. Not like I can sleep anyways.
