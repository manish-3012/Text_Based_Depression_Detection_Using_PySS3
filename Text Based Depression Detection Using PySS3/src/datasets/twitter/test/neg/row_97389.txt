I don't know if I'm fucked or not, but I feel fucked. I know enough to realize that chemical imbalances make it impossible for me to be a fair judge of my situation.

I've been suffering from severe depression and anxiety for six years now. I'm frequently either positive I should kill myself or terrified I'm going to die. I have almost no friends in the town where I live, I'm marginally employed, and my degree is in the liberal arts.

I've been seeing a psychiatrist for months now, and every medication I've tried has just created a ton of side effects without any actual improvement in my condition. I can't afford therapy, and my insurance won't cover it.

I've considered going back to school by taking out student loans and doing something like computer programming. But that would mean going into severe debt in order to get an education I don't really want in a field I don't really enjoy for the sake of a job I'll hate to pay off the debt.

I'm at a total impasse here, and wondering whether the crazier parts of my mind might win out just because of the economic climate.
