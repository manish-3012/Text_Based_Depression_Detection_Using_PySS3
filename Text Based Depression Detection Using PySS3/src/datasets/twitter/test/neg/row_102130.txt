I just hurt myself for the first time.Can you tell me things that like make me not want to do that again? 
  
EDIT: I want to do this because I have sabotaged myself. I have done things (i.e. near-cheating/half-cheating) that has turned the person that I connect with and who understands me better than anyone else I've ever known against me. She can't trust me, and she's become obsessed with thoughts of me cheating on her. This causes us to argue about the most trivial of things.   

This morning we were cuddling in a sexual manner and I, half asleep, stumbled to the bathroom to take a pee. I stepped in cat shit and/or vomit on the way, and wiped it off. I came back to bed and my girlfriend asked me what happened (I swore under my breath when stepping in it). I told her the cat had puked. She asked me why I didn't clean it up. The half asleep me instantly went into "don't realize your faults, and try to give reasons as to why the thing you're being accuse of doing is actually okay" mode, and claimed that I shouldn't have to clean it because when we got the cats we made a deal that she will clean up everything to do with the cats.  
 
So because of this fight we're not having sex. And sex is all we ever fight about, so now once again it's about sex. We try to put past the argument and she tries to initiate sex. I hinted towards a oral sex; this makes her accuse me of "not being on the same page" as her, that I'm "obsessed with only pleasing myself and not worried about her" (for the record, I wasn't hinting at *only* having oral sex).   

I am extremely frustrated when she informs me that she needs to go to work, not giving any time for us to resolve this argument. So I run into the kitchen and slash my forearm with a steak knife. I've never done it before, but I had thought about it, and pressed a knife on my skin. She saw it and called my parents. They came down and we talked, but nothing they said resolved anything. They mentioned seeing a professional, but I sort of want to be forced into it.
