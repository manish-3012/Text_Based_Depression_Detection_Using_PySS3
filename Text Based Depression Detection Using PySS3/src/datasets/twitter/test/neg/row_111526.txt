The final nail in the coffin was overhearing my parents talk about me behind my backM, 17.

I've been depressed for about a year and a half with my parents denying I have a problem. They call me "lazy, unmotivated, useless...".
I don't have much of a social life so I spend most of my days either at school or alone at home. It's been worse and worse and I think just last week was my 7th or 8th suicide attempt.

This afternoon, I overheard my parents talk about me. I don't have much of a connection with my dad so I thought mom was the one I could usually go to, but I heard her say "he's definitely grown up to be much worse than I expected", "he can't even get out of bed, and to think that I was working from 14 and he can't even do his assignments". She seems supportive to me but I know now how she truely feels. Now, I know I can be free. Yeah, she'll be sad, but I'm a failure of a child and I wasn't gonna amount to anything anyway. Even if I do end up getting depression medication, I'll just overdose on it. I can really see my existence coming to a close soon. there's nothing here for me
