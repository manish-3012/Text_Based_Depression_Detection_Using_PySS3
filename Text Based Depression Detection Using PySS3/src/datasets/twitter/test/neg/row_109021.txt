please help me i dont know what to doidk what the hell is wrong with me but i just wanna stay in bed all day and I feel literally no energy to do anything, i used to be passionate about making music but now I can't feel anything when I listen to music, I'm basically scared about everything all the time and I feel nothing but fear 24/7, specially about the future, I just don't know what to do anymore, i keep pushing myself to talk to people and attempt to get help, but everything they say just feels like nothing to me
also yesterday i saw this tattoo on instagram, which was a whale flying in the sky with butterfly wings, idk why but I immediately started crying because I wanted it so bad, it was so damn cute ðŸ˜­, and then I realized how childish this is (crying over a cute tattoo)
idk most of the time I just can't help but feeling like I'm insane or like my brain is underdeveloped somehow 
 I'm scared that people will abandon me
