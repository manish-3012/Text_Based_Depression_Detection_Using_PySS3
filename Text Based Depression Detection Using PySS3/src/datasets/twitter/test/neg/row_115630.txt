Coming back to this subreddit after being a year and a half awayHello everyone, I used to be a regular redditor here a while back, but about a year and a half I moved  out, discovered weed, and tried to convince myself everything was now fine and that I was no longer suicidal/depressed.

Now ive found myself being depressed for a while and trying to cover it up, simply because itâ€™s not as bad as it was before.

Iâ€™m drinking and chain smoking tonight, but writing this as a tribute to all my brothers and sisters on this sub, make sure you donâ€™t run away from you problems and ignore your depression like I did because it catches up to you.
