itâ€™s getting worsei didnâ€™t know it could get worse but here i am. i feel like iâ€™m losing my mind, i donâ€™t know what iâ€™m doing and i donâ€™t know who i am. am i a good person? or am i a piece of shit? will i ever do anything with my life? probably not because i wonâ€™t live that long. i wish i could be happy, or at least cope like most people do. iâ€™ve lost almost all my motivation to keep going. if it werenâ€™t for my little brother and sister i would already be gone. iâ€™m supposed to be the role model, iâ€™m supposed to be the one that leads the way. but iâ€™m the furthest behind and my brother is just 2. my sister has her plans, sheâ€™s going to make it. my brother is so smart for his age and he has more support and reinforcement than i ever have. iâ€™m 20 and iâ€™ve done nothing of worth. nothing at all. my mom told me today that i need to get my shit together but how am i supposed to do that? iâ€™m not like her.
