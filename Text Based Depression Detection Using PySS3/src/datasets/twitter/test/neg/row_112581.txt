I almost killed myself.  And this song came up for me with my iTunes.  I hope it does for you what it did for me.This is a link to the song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2yeNzL7rTU  I can't get over how something so sad can sound so upbeat and happy.  This song may bring me to tears, but it always finds a way to make me happier then I can explain.  I hope it can do the same, even if it's just for one person.  I still struggle every day.  But this make the struggle easier for me.  Here are the lyrics:

And so she wakes up
in time to break down
She left a note up on the dresser
and she's right on time
You don't know anything
right or wrong
I said I know
and she said so
I wanna panic
but I've had it so I go
You don't owe anything to anyone

But don't take your life
'cause it's all that you've got
You'd be better off just off and leaving
if you don't think they will stop

And when you wake up
everything is gonna be fine
I guarantee that you wake in a better place
in a better time
So you're tired of living
feel like you might give in
well don't
it's not your time

Looking through the paper today
looking for a specific page
Don't wanna find her full name followed by dates
because when i left her alone
she made a sound, like a moan
"You're known by everyone for everything you've done"
Fuck buying flowers for graves
I'd rather buy you a one way non-stop
to anywhere
find anyone
do anything
forget and start again, love
She said she won't go
(and that's that)
It hurts too much to stand by
you've got to stop and draw a line
Everyone here has to choose a side tonight
the moment of truth is haunting you
Don't forget your family
regardless what you choose to do
You can't decide
and they're all screaming "why won't you?"
I'll start the engine but I can't take this ride for you
I'll draw your bath and I'll load your gun
But I hope so bad that you're bathe and hunt

Annie's tired of forgetting about today
and always planning for tomorrow (tomorrow)
Tomorrow and she says, "The saddest day I came across was
when I learned that life goes on without me" (without me)
Without me and she says, "If everyone has someone else,
then I ain't got nobody's love to save me" (save me)
Save me, and she says "I think I'll pass away tonight,
'cause it seems I'll never get it right, it's just me" (just reality)

And when you wake up
everything is gonna be fine
Guarantee that you wake in a better place
in a better time
So you're tired of living
feel like you might give in
well don't
It's not your time

Annie says she wouldn't mind
if they never find a cure for all her problems (her problems)
Proplems and she says, as long as she has someone near to make it clear
she does not need to solve them (solve them)
Solve them and she says, "oh, this loneliness is killing me,
it's filling me with anger and resentment (resentment)
Resentment and she says, "I'm turning into someone that I never thought I'd have to be again"

And when you wake up
everything is gonna be fine
Guarantee that you wake up in a better place
in a better time
So you're tired of living
you feel like you might give in
well don't
It's not your time

Annie's tired of forgetting about today
and always planning for tomorrow
Tommorow and she says, "The saddest day i came across was
when I learned that life goes on without me"
Without me and she says, "If everyone has someone else,
then I ain't got nobody's love to save me"
Save me and she says, "I think I'll pass away tonight,
'cause it seems I'll never get it right, it's just me" Annie says!

when you wake up
everything is going to be fine
I guarantee that you wake in a better place
in a better time
So you're tired of living
and feel like you might give in
well don't
It's not your time


And even if it was so
Oh I wouldn't let you go
you could run run run run but I will follow close
Someday you will say "that's it, that's all"
but I'll be waiting there with open arms to break your fall
I know that you think that you're on your own
but just know that I'm here
and I'll lead you home
if you let me
She said "forget me"
but I can't
