My life goal is to die.If it matters, at the moment, I'm a 17 year old high school junior.

But basically, my whole life, I've never been happy. Ever since I first can remember...like when I was 3 in pre-school, I've not for one second been happy about anything in my life.

I've tricked myself into thinking I was happy before, based on what society considers to be "happiness"...and I have forced myself to smile before...but I've never truly been happy on the inside.

I don't like nature, I don't like any type of food, I don't like music, I don't like movies, I don't like literature, etc...I don't like people, I don't like animals, I have no love for my family members, I have never had even a casual friend, etc. 

My whole life, I've never done anything that matters. The only relatively impressive thing I did was pull off an A in the class, and 5 out of 5 on the exam for AP Psychology. This current year, though, I'm failing all my AP classes.

Overall, my only goal and aspiration in my life is to get a decent job that enables me to live a relatively decent life...with about enough money to buy food and survive. Just enough so I'm not homeless on the streets. And then I'll just wait till the day that I die. I'll try to speed it up, by smoking, drinking, and eating a hell ton of junk food. Hopefully I can die by at least 50 years old. 

Also, the idea of acheiving immortality by like 2050 just absolutely sickens me. My life goal is to die, I DO NOT want to live forever.
