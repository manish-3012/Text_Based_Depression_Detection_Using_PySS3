My family hates me I have no friends, I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m still here. I have no one to talk to

My family hates me, and my mom has told me several times she hates me, Iâ€™m a waste of a human life,  has even said sheâ€™d disown me several times. I canâ€™t do anything right where as my siblings they treat like they are made of gold and can do no wrong. Both my parents have told me several times they donâ€™t believe in me. I never hear anything positive from my family. I donâ€™t know why my mom didnâ€™t abort me or give me up for adoption since Iâ€™m hated this much. I donâ€™t have any friends, in fact I was bullied because of my mom always yelling at me In front of people and the kids talking about it at school. I used to eat lunch by myself in the halls just waiting for the day to be over. Sleeping is my favorite thing because itâ€™s the one time of day I donâ€™t have anything to worry about but I struggle to sleep. I find myself staying up late at night just so I can have some alone time where no one is yelling at me.  Work sucks, I feel so out of place but I have to work to save money for school because my parents make it well known to everyone I havenâ€™t gone to school but yet they refuse to give me a penny because they donâ€™t believe in me that I can do it but they are handing my siblings money left and right for their school. My mom used to beat me,  one summer I had to wear pants because she found out I wrote something down as a way of venting and unleashed and whipped my legs so hard with some branches that left marks all over them. Sheâ€™s punched me several times in my mouth, sheâ€™s hit me, sheâ€™s thrown things at me and most of the time it was for something so small. Sheâ€™s also told me aunt she hates when I talk because itâ€™s annoying and she goes out of her way to not be around me. I sit up at night and wonder what I ever did wrong to be treated so awful, I cry myself to sleep most nights and then the next day I put on a fake smile and somehow do it all over again. I want to be okay, I want to look back in 5 years and think how amazing I am for getting over this but I have no one to talk to, the hot line never responds and Iâ€™m lost... so lost.
