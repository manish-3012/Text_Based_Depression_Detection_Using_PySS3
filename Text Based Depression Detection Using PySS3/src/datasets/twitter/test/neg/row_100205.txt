My never ending struggle.This isn't the first time I've reached out to Reddit to try to catch me from falling, but the last time only seemed to help for a little while, then made things worse. It's like drugs now that I think about it.

This is my first ever post here, and throwaway for obvious reasons, I have friends who browse Reddit and I would never want them to see something like this. I don't want to add extra people to my struggle, which is why I don't see a doctor or call a hotline. It's something about the internet that makes me feel better about being able to vent my issues out.

First off, I have had a history with drugs, I won't go into detail here, but it was rough and I've moved on since. The only drugs I consume now is Alcohol every once in a while and the suspense of watching more internet videos until it's 4 a.m. and I can barely walk to my bed. This brings me to my next issue. I'm not malnourished, in fact I eat a lot. I'm not fat, I'm actually slightly underweight. No matter what I eat or drink, I always feel out of energy though. I'll go to the microwave to heat up a Hot Pocket and I'll have to sit down instead of being able to stand up for the 2 minutes it takes to heat the damn thing up. I feel like it's a symptom of depression but I'm not sure. In fact I think one of the reasons I haven't ended it is that I'm too lazy to do so.

My next issue is that I've never been good at coping with stress. I used to use drugs to do it, but as I've mentioned I don't anymore. I tried meditation, but while it clears my mind for a certain period of time, it doesn't last forever. Now I'm lost when I need my relief mechanisms the most. I'm at the cross-road in my life where I have to make life decisions fast and I have to hope that the decisions I make are the right ones for me financially, mentally, and physically. I feel like this decision is a triangle where I can only pick 2 and have to leave the other one behind. I don't want to make this decision, I would rather end it and hope that what I've learned on Earth is really what happens when I die. The idea of everything fading to black, my thoughts, my feelings, my struggle, all being gone. I know these thoughts aren't healthy, I know it isn't right, but I can't fix it.

I've heard many people call suicide selfish and things like that, and I feel like I'm the textbook definition of it. I have a bright future ahead of me if I dig myself out of the hole. I'm one of the really smart kids in my school, my school reached out to me personally to tell me they wanted me in AP classes, I have friends, I've never really been popular with the opposite gender but that's fine to me, I have a family that supports me, I have a hobby that I love, but for some reason I want to end my life. I want to throw away my life like it's the Reddit account I'm using to post this. Perhaps I am greedy, but what does that solve? It doesn't erase the feeling, it doesn't make me feel better, in fact it only makes things worse. Not only do I want to kill myself, but now the people who think of me when I'm gone are going to think of me as greedy? Fuck.

If you're reading this, I'm sorry I made you read this. I'm a lunatic, even more so at 3 a.m. I'm sorry I brought you into this, but I'm lost. I don't know how to feel about this feeling other than wanting it gone, while simultaneously feeding it. I never thought that I would be doing this or thinking this, I always thought that I would be the one giving the advice. I guess depression gets everyone. I'll try to respond to these comments before I sleep.
