I hit my fiancÃ©eI'm such a fucking idiot. What the fuck is wrong with me??? 

We had an arguement. The first one in a long time. We never argue. But it got really heated this time. And... and... FUCK. I don't know why. I didn't think about it. It was an impulse. I fucking hit her in the face. The one person who loves me for me, and the one person who made me feel something other than sadness. She's my everything.

And I fucked it up. I ripped that away. 

I hit her and I couldn't believe what I did. I still can't. I stood there for a couple of seconds, looking at my hand. Thinking what a fucking peice of shit I am. And I fucking turned around and walked out the door of our apartment. I got in my car and drove to a cliff and now I'm sitting here venting to you guys and crying my fucking eyes out...

I think I'm gonna do it this time. I think this is it. The one thing that I can't forgive myself for. 

Shed texting me and telling me to come back but I can't. I can't go back there after what I did. 

I fucked up, guys. I fucked up and I think this is it.
