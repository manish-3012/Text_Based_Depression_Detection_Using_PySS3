To all the people hoping to catch coronavirus and dieBecause I've been reading it often in the last few days here - It's an incredibly shitty plan for suicide. Statistically, chances are huge it'll do nothing more than make you sick for a week or two. You might inadvertently pass it on to people that do actually want to live though and have loved ones they might pass it on to, and down the road that might kill somebody who actually did not want to die and will be missed a lot. Please don't be selfish and consider this.
