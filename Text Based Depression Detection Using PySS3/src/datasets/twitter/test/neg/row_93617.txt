I can't withstand myself.I just can't. I always go down into depression, again and again. For stupid reasons, to sum it up even. Every little insignificant thing affects me and my awful criteria so I'm always feeling terrible.

I cannot interact socially without feeling like I'm useless. I don't have anything to give to the world. I never have nothing interesting to say, I always pass by invisible. I'm not relevant enough to be seen.

Even those things that aren't meant to be bad, they make me feel horrible. Small competitions? Comparisons? How bad do you have to be to lose at everything? You have to be me bad.

I cannot improve. I don't know how. I can't. I've tried. I just go around in circles. It's so frustrating finding something that makes you feel... Momentarily happy, and then just realise you're bad at it. And you can't improve.

It's eternal suffering just being able to watch you fail and fail again and again, being upset and depressed by stupid and irrelevant things. But I'm that worthless. That worthless enough to leave things affect me.

I was born an optimist. I hate it. I hate that I always have to think good even though I feel like I'm a super deep hole and I won't ever go on. Everyone passes by me. I can see them shining in society. Being so relevant in the world, being something. I'll never be one of them. I'm not worthy of it.

And I hate how I keep on falling. How the ones that care for me and I care for always try to make me see the light, making me feel good. I feel terrible always letting them down by falling again and again in the well of despair and self pity. I hate myself for falling, partially getting out and then falling in again.

I can't withstand me anymore.
