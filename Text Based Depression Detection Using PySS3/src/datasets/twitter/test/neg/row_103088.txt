the thought of suicide is comforting?i'm in my senior year of high school and everything is kinda getting to me. i'm worrying about college and i'm completely socially awkward and i have no speaking skills. i don't even drive yet and it's gonna be a year or so before i start. i'm completely dependent on my parents and have no idea how to do adult things. all of these become overwhelming and the thought of dying almost calms me down in a way. it's almost like a cure-all: if i die then i don't have to worry about that stuff. if i do go to college then it's going to be for music ed, but i'm really worried i'm not gonna be prepared to go to college. whenever it gets bad, then i just tell myself it's gonna be okay when i die. this is the creepiest shit, but it's what i do.
