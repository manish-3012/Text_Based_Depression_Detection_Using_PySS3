I need to have a talk with my family about the point of living when I already screwed up life, but scared 2 start a family conversation and they would be very distraught to know that I think about suicide1: I'm frickin circumcised. Now I will never feel sexual pleasure, the best part of being human

2: I'm autistic. I cant talk to people in real life.

3: I am a chemistry major going to a university that isnt ideal for chemistry (utdallas), because I didnt do well enough in high school to go somewhere better. I didn't do amazing in my 1st semester, and now I'm a sophomore with a 3.612 gpa. I'm not 100% sure I can get my gpa high enough to go to UT austin.
