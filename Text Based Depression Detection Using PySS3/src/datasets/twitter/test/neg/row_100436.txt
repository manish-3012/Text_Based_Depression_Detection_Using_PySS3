4 hours ago I was happy4 hours ago I wasn't thinking of whether i should jump into traffic, or drink some laundry detergent. There's been a lot of family drama, which honestly shouldn't even be drama. I come from a loving family, but something is up with my mum. And she just lashes out. Lately she's been fighting with my brother. He got engaged, but my mum doesn't approve. She yells at him. And I guess I can't handle emotional abuse the way my brother can, because today she yelled at me and I don't want to live on. I hate who I am. I hate who I've become. I wanted to end my life 6 months ago, but slowly I've stopped wanting that. Well it's back.
