I don't want to fight for myself anymore. I just want to be goneI'm mentally unstable, completely unable to work, I can't maintain friendships and relationship, still a virgin, etc.

I just don't see any point in living. Pretty sure my parents turned me into a narc so even if I'm cured of all my symptoms one day I won't really be a normal human. Nobody would really care about me.

I tried to kill myself once when I was 8. I think I'll try again soon.
