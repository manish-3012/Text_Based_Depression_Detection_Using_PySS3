I really donâ€™t know what to do anymore.I have severe depression and anxiety. Bipolar disorder. The works. Iâ€™ve never consistently been able to treat it because I just... donâ€™t care. My head and heart is always so empty. I really just want to die and stop being such a burden. I recently quit my job because it was so much pressure. Iâ€™ve never broken like this Iâ€™ve always been okay enough to function. Iâ€™m going to give it till tomorrow. If I canâ€™t find a reason to live Iâ€™m going to do it. Maybe I should just run away instead and live on the street and disappear... Iâ€™m so tired.
