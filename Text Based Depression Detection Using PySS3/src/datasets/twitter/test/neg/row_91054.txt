One of my best friends is possibly in the process of killing himself, what can I do?I live over an hours drive away, and I have no car. I don't really have anyway of contact other than talking to him on facebook, which I'm doing now, and I don't think it's really working. I've texted a mutual friend about it, and he won't respond or answer calls... I feel pretty stuck.
