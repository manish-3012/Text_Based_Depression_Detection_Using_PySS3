this shit do be hurtingpeople donâ€™t care to listen or see that I am actually trying. Iâ€™m trying to be happy, Iâ€™m trying to change, Iâ€™m trying to get stronger but it gets so much harder the more people just shove everything bad I do in my face, then wonder why Iâ€™m so negative. I donâ€™t necessarily like attention but when I do something good or right it feels like nobody notices until I fuck up then they can recite every time Iâ€™ve messed up. how do you expect someone to get better when all you do is tell them how much they fuck up. why canâ€™t someone just congratulate me for once, even for the smallest thing? Thatâ€™s how you help someone, why donâ€™t people understand or care ðŸ˜ž
