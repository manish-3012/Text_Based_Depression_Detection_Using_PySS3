Think I'm finally gonna kill myself next week.I'm posting here cause I'm hoping that someone can change my mind, or make me realize something about life that I haven't been able to see as of yet. But I don't think I can talk myself out of it anymore. I'm at the end of my rope. Everyone is leaving or has left me. Every single time I try to make friends, I either push them away or scare them off. I feel like I'm gonna die alone, and nothing really means anything to me anymore. This is a cry for help, but I've done enough crying in the past 3 months and I think it's only a matter of time til I lose my voice.

Every month I get worse and worse. Anti\-depressants cured my sadness and helped me with suicidal ideation, but didn't stop me from feeling numb. There's something fundamentally wrong with me. I don't know what it is, but if I can't fix myself I just want to stop being myself. I want it all to end. I'm tired.
