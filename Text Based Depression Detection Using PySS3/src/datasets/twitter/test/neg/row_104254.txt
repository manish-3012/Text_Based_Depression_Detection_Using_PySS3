I donâ€™t know what to doSorry for the long rambling post. I donâ€™t know where to start. I struggle with crippling anxiety that makes every trip leaving the house a nightmare. Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™m going to lose my job because I keep having to call in sick. Every morning when I wake up for work Iâ€™m that wracked with the worry of having to go it makes me physically sick. If by a miracle I manage to leave the house and make it to the train station I have the worst stomach pains like clockwork. And I canâ€™t see any way forward. Iâ€™ve tried talking to my doctor and medication, and different treatments like cognitive behavioural therapy but it only ever seems to help short term, and then slowly but surely the anxiety and depression begin to take hold again. If I lose my job I wonâ€™t have any way to pay my bills. And itâ€™s got to the point where my partner is also really frustrated with me for not being able to go. I still live at home and in the current state of things I canâ€™t afford to move out even though myself and my partner want to live together. I feel like my partner thinks I just need to â€œman upâ€, I now donâ€™t feel like I can talk openly about this with them and have to pretend to be doing better than I actually am. 

Long story short, I just canâ€™t see anyway out. Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to lose my job, wonâ€™t be able to pay the bills and at the same time donâ€™t have anyone to talk to, and leaving the house makes me physically ill. I just donâ€™t have the energy to continue on like this and have to face constantly letting down everyone around me.
