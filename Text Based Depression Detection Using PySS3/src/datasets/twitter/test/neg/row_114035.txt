I resent my wife for keeping me alive.I want to die. Not sure how that's going to happen since I'm too much of a coward to just do it myself. Crossing my finger someone just shoots me but that's a different story. The only reason I've never tried anything is because I know I'd be guilty over what that would do to my wife. That doesn't prompt feelings of love within me, it just pisses me off. Like "I'd be done with this bullshit by now if it wasn't for you." I don't know what I want from anyone here. I just don't know where else to say it.
