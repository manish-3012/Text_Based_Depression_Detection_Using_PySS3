There's no feeling of painWhenever surfing around the topic of suicide, all sort of "you want to escape from your unbearable pain".

I don't feel any pain, my life is pretty allright, but it's meaningless and I feel nothing. I am nothing. There's nothing to be done. I'm a waste of life.

I just want to go away.
