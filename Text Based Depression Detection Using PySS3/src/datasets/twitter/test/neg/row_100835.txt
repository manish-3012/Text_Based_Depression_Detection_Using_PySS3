I am scaredI am on medication for depression and I feel very anxious lately. I work hard at work but there was a bit of a stuff up at work. I feel I am going to get the blame and the only way I feel I can cope with it is to know if anything happens I can always end it. I don't worry so much for myself but my wife and 2 young daughters. Even now as I write this I can't stop crying I am just so happy my wife is out. I am not going to do anything today while she is out as I am at home with the baby but I just feel so scared.
