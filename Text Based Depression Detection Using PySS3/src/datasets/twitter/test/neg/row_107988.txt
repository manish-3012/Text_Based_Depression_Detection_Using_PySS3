It's not suicideI want to end my life, I'm not convinced that it's a crime or a bad thing, i'm well into being an adult male, I have no prospects of a future ,be that a family or career and I'm not interested in either.

 I hate humanity on a whole and feel ill that I'm a part of it but I'm also a massive hypocrite as I hate suffering for others.

I'm lucky enough to have friends and family, I doubt anyone really knows how I feel and I think they'd all laugh it off given my deminour, I shouldn't be thinking this as I know there are millions of people worse off than me. But if right now you could offer my life to someone dying who has a family I'd offer mine up in a heart beat.

Im planning to end it in 3 months time, it will let me save for a funeral, give blood two more times and say good bye in my own way. I don't think what I'm doing is wrong, my existence has no purpose and I am a stain on resources best spent otherwise. I wish I could do this without hurting other people.
