ReadyHi,

I didn't know where to put this but I have no-one to talk to in rl and I don't even want someone to know that I'm feeling suicidal again. 

Everything keeps getting worse and worse for me.

I dated the love of my life for 2 1/2 years. We had our issues but we managed to stay together because of the deep feelings we had for each other. We fought and even broke up once but we couldn't do without each other. The last year was very hard for me, I struggled with depression and drinking and even attempted suicide in January. My boyfriend was there for me all the time, he helped me through everything.

Until he broke up 2 weeks ago. I got really drunk and started a fight which ended with him telling me he couldn't do this anymore. We met again, decided to stay 'friends' and there was a drunk night where we had sex and where he told me he loved me more than anything. We stayed in contact since but I know I lost him. He's made his decision and I have to deal with it.

So I spent the last two weeks crying and trying to stop drinking, I even went to AA. I felt like shit all the time, the only good hours were the time spending with my ex.

I only have one real friend and even though she and my sister were there for me, I felt alone all the time.

Yesterday, my grandmother died. I used to live at her place as a child and she was the kindest, nicest person I've ever met. I am devastated. I don't know how to deal with this. I cried the last 2 weeks and now I feel like there is no emotion to describe my current feelings. There is no-one I could call. My best friend has things on her schedule, I don't want to call my exboyfriend crying and my sister is dealing with her loss too - she was even closer with our grandma.

I don't fucking know where I am going with this post, I just can't anymore. 

Thanks for reading and a wonderful day to everyone of you.
