Can't afford a psychiatrist.When I say 'afford', I don't mean money. I mean time. My new job has got me working 13-14 hours a day. Talking to people is not an option, because in my experience, whoever I've talked to, to help me out, has noticeably kept distance from me after learning about my mental health. Any suggestions?
