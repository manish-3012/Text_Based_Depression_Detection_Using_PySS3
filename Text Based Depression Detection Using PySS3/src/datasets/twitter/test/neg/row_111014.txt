I still want to die after my drunk behaviour two months agoI horribly emberassed myself in front of an old school bully, verbaly attacking him and then nearly crying when he wanted to punch me. Also I basically harassed his girlfriend, even grabbing at her and making suggestive comments while everyone told me to fuck off and leave this whole ordeal took mabye 8min. At the end I was even actually crying and excusing myself by saying I have depression and anxiety. I am pathetic and disgusting. I was very drunk and have some mental disorders but alcohol and mental illness are no excuse. I deserve every bad thing that is happening with me. I cant undersand how I could have been such a person. I really deserve to die.
