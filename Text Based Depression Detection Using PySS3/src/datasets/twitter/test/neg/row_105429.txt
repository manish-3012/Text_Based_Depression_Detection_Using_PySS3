I dont love myself anymore and I just want to let goI've been having suicidal thoughts recently its because of how I get treated and I feel like no one loves me anymore, I was sexually assaulted a week or 2 back and its caused me to think back and question if im worth it and deserve life. I am unable to go anywhere or talk to anyone without being called a dike every second I just feel like my fiancÃ¨e is the only one who cares for me and thats 1 person in 7 billion in the world. My parents support me but i still feel as if im useless and annoying, I might just end it all.
