Why live for others?Seems just about the only thing keeping me around is one of two things... One being fear of an eternity of punishment and experiencing the recurring misery I feel every day for failing some bullshit cosmic test that is life. The other is that it seems more than half the people I know in my support network are battling with suicide and depression. 

Just seems that no matter what changes in my life, no matter how it "improves", the same longing for an endless sleep lingers. I have noone in my support networks to reach out to, as to do so would just drive them down instead. 

Sometimes I toy with it... Start an attempt, then think of how itd just hurt others, and so I force myself to stop. That and I never was good with pain, but I'm getting better at it. Hell, I'm an expert and making a noose now, and have an entire stash of goodbye letters written to people individually now... I dunno, maybe I'll try again tonight, maybe I won't. At least it'd be an out from a miserable week, and an unhappy and unfulfilled life that I live just to keep others alive and coping.
