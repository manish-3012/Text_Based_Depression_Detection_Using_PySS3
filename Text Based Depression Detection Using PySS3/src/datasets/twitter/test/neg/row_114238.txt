I think I'm losing it.I think I'm losing it. I don't trust anyone anymore. I just keep getting fucked over and over and over again. Why don't people care anymore? Why can't there be someone out there who will hold my hand and tell me it'll okay and actually mean it? Oh and someone who won't fucking leave me and refuse to text or call me. I think I'm losing it. I am self destructing and I don't know how to stop. I piled together two bottles of pills and was debating swallowing them last night but I couldn't do it but I know its only a matter of time before I finally do it. I am sick of being used.. I just want someone to love me. I don't even love myself. I hate myself. People say you can't love another until you love yourself but I don't understand how to love myself. I've lost it. I've gone through so many therapy sessions and different kinds of anti-depressants but none of them help me. I am so lonely. Why can't someone hug me and tell me it'll be okay. I'm failing all of my college classes because I don't see myself graduating anymore. I just want to die. I want everyone to see what they've done to me. I want them all to say, "oh wow. I could have been there. but I FUCKING WASN'T." 
Why do I always have to like guys that always just use me or have friend zoned me? Why am I having such bad luck? People say it can only go up from here but it hasn't. Not one bit. It's just getting worse and worse.
Honestly I fucking give up. I am a robot. I can barely feel anything anymore. Please someone tell me its okay to commit suicide. I want to feel better. I never will feel better though. I am broken. I will never love myself or be happy anymore. I just want to feel nothing.
