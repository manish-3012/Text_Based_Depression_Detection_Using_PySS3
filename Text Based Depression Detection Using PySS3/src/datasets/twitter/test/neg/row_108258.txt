I'm going to commit suicideI've come to the conclusion that I am going to kill myself. I'm 27 years old male, 6 years in the army national guard, a college degree and have been an audio engineer for 3 years. I am killing myself because of sexual frustration, I have a sexual fetish. This past summer i met someone with my fetish and we dated for three weeks before she dumped me. She dumped me because I was scared she was going to dump me after she brought up some issue about something. I cannot live knowing that the only person who was ever able to meet my needs sexually was only willing to be with me for two weeks out of my 27 years of life. I cannot live making less than 20k a year working like a slave. I'm going to take a gun and I'm going to shoot myself in my backyard in the next 5 hours. This is the best place for me to leave my final testament as it will take too long for my family or friends to find this.
Fuck this world and fuck being a millenial, it is a horrifying nightmarish time and place to exist.
