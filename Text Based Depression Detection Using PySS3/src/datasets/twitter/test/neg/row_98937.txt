Former guildie in WoW is talking for the second time pretty seriously about killing himself. Not sure how to handle this.So I've been talking with this friend in WoW for a few months now. Haven't known him terribly long term. But he's definitely depressed, lives by himself, has a very very low opinion of himself, I've talked him up a few times, trying to get him to talk to a professional, his doctor, his family, something. I have no idea where he lives exactly, his real name, only his battle.net ID and the way he's been talking today, I really really think he might try to do something. 

He's saying things in past tense, like "You were really kind to me" and saying he's clearing out his friends list, nothing personal. I've been keeping him talking before he's cut contact with the only way I have to speak to him, but he thinks he's worthless, useless, terrible person, etc. Won't get help, laughed when I suggested the suicide prevention line. He's told me specifically before that he's considered ending his life. 

How can I go about getting someone to help/check on him? I was considering putting a ticket into Blizzard since they have his personal information, could check messaging logs, see I'm not full of shit. I don't know what else to do about it and I feel useless. 

Does anyone have any ideas? I know the state he lives in but that's about it. 

EDIT: I heard back from Blizzard about an hour ago and they said they do take these things seriously and will investigate/review everything (I'm assuming that means they'll check the chat logs to make sure I'm not full of shit) and take any actions that they can if the situation calls for it. On the brighter side, when he signed off he was sounding a little better saying that he had a job interview tomorrow etc, sounded hopeful and like he intended to go and would talk afterwards. So I'm hoping he'll be ok at least until tomorrow.
