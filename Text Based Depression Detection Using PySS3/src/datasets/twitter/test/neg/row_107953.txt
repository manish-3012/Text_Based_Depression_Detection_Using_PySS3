I am thinking about itI have a few friends, not all real friends though
I have a lot of stuff : hobbies and no money problems but I feel like leaving, I think about it every day , not all the time
If I wanted I could choose a way to kill myself, I've always joked about it but I never thought about doing it myself until now
I know it's wrong, I live a happy life , I have hobbies, a few friends but I feel like having to go away, I don't know how and why, nor when
I'm scared and doubtful but my subconscious tells me **TO STAY ALIVE** but I keep telling me back **WHY?** 
Anyway I'm 13, if anyone wants to chat,cheer me up I'd be very thankful

Goodnight, going to sleep , reddit

**thanks**
