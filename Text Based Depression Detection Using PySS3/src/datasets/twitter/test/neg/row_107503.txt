this world we live in.im not sure this is the correct place to post this, but i thought id post it here. this world we live in makes me so depressed and demotivated. theres so much suffering going on and so much corruption yet we dont do anything about it. we as humans only really care about ourselves and the small amount of people around us. we're too busy with our social media life to think about our real life and how we could change it. why do we allow large corporations to control the media and bribe the politicians that are supposed to help us. the planet is slowly being destroyed by us and we fail to realise that we're not as intelligent as we say we are. i often think the planet would be better off without us. we're killing thousands of animals daily to meet our needs hearing about people getting bombed, getting thrown in jail for expressing their opinions and going against the system. its all a bit too much sometimes, and i think to myself, why not just end it all? because of my family. i dont want to upset them, but at the same time i could be somewhere else. on a completely different planet in a different universe, living happy. yet i live here sadder than i was yesterday. i dont know what to do. i try to make myself happier with music and creativity, but it seems the darkness in the world is outweighing the positivity i once had.
