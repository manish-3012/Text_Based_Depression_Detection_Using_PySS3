Negotiating Might work as a way outI \[30M\] have been giving a lot of thought to this idea and I can't seem to find a rational way of phrasing it. I feel like I should clarify that I am aware this is me attempting to rationalize the irrational, so bear with me here. 

Father cares about me enough to want me to be okay, but not really enough for his life to really be affected by my lack of "being okay" since I live on my own and he's got a good thing going. 

I don't want to live, but I don't want my family to lose me either. Bottom line it comes down to Hiya family, do you mind paying a bit and know I'm there if you want to call me or someone asks about me? It sure fucking sounds like extortion, but given that  I'm fortunate enough to have someone willing to help a little, and I know me leaving would crush them, can't we just agree on a small amount to keep me alive for now?
