How do u make sure that nobody has to take over my debts when I kill myself?My mom is a co-signer on my car loan and Iâ€™ve tried to refinance it before to remove her but my credit usage is too high to do that. Is there anything I could do to make it so she isnâ€™t responsible for paying my remaining debt owed? Like if I drive my car off the bridge or something? I have 22 months left of payments but I canâ€™t bear to be here that much longer to see this loan through.

Iâ€™ve been such a huge burden in my life I canâ€™t bear to be a burden after I leave too. I just want everyone to be free and happy and finally have peace when I pass, I donâ€™t want to add more hardship when my mom is already struggling to pay for everything while taking care of my sister and nephew.
