I can't even cry anymore.16 (M), I made some friends in my middle school, i have parents that love me but it's all going to shit. Every friend turned their back on me, my closest one, which I was in relationship with, is mostly partying and her solution to everything is to go to a therapist. No one ever speaks to me first, no one cares about me, i feel so left alone. I'm jealous, everyone of my friends is having parties getting drunk, whatever, and I don't even have courage to ask anyone out. I'm so tired, and keep thinking about killing myself almost everyday. It just sounds so relieving. No grief, no worries, nothing.  I'm too scared to go to the therapist, I don't know what to do, i just wanted a normal life.
