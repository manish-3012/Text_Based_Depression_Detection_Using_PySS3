I'm not suicidal, but I really need help/advice First of all, I'm not an angry or particularly depressed person and I've never had issues in the past. As far I as remember I've never been abused. I have good, loving parents. I've had a relatively easy life. 

I don't know how to write about this, so I'll just go directly into it. I have abusive, cruel tendencies towards animals. But I actually love animals. I know that probably makes no sense, but I honestly do. For the most part, the thoughts only come when I've been lonely or sad for a long time. And then I think about how much my pet loves and trusts me, and what I could do to break that trust... I have acted on it before, although I did nothing extreme, nothing that left physical marks. I can't explain why I do this. I hate having these thoughts. I've been as strong as I possibly can be, but right now all I can think about is doing horrible things to my pet rat just to hear what sounds he'll make and see if I can get him to be terrified of me. 

I have had these thoughts about people too. I think the main reason why they mostly involve pets is because they are easy targets, sweet and vulnerable and endlessly forgiving, but hurting my parents or a human would have lasting consequences. I really want to get help, but I don't know how. I still live with my parents, and if I told them I wanted to see a councilor, they'd want to know why since they would be paying for it. Explaining this to them is out of the question. I just want to find someone to talk to before I do something stupid. 

EDIT: It's not that my parents wouldn't care or wouldn't try to help me. I just don't want to go through the inevitable emotional break down that would result in telling them. The idea of them knowing is beyond embarrassing... I'd just like to get through this without their presence.
