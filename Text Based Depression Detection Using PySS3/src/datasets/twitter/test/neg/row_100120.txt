I wrote this shit poem and didn't have anywhere else to put itMy friends are sick of hearing this, I know from intuition.

If I don't shut up they'll all leave, my entire coalition.

So I'll just write this here so I won't be an imposition.

So here's where my heads at right now, no filter or revision:



I guess right now you'd say I'm in a pretty bad position,

I'm haunted by my suicidal predisposition.

Being led down a path to my own submission,

Like following the Pied Piper, the spiteful musician.



I've got visions of my future it's a dark premonition:

I try to go to college, be an academician,

But I wasted my shot and with all this competition, 

I'd my lucky if my shitty GPA got past admissions.



I can't start a relationship with all my inhibitions,

I try my best but it just won't seem to come to fruition.

I always mess it up and now it's like it's a tradition,

I try, I fail, I get depressed and go into remission.



I'm having trouble eating I just don't have the ambition,

I don't deserve the nourishment, I don't want the nutrition.

3 weeks without food will me straight to a mortician,

So now the question is whether or not that should be my mission.



So yeah, depression and anxiety are pretty shit conditions.

I want to blow my brains out I just need some ammunition.

I want to just be gone, just disappear like a magician.

I'll leave this here so that my reason for dying will go without suspicion.
