Sick of EarthI hate this place, and it's unfortunate that I won't have a future. It'll be either global warming, civil war, or what have you, but I just cannot stand it here anymore. I feel as if I should just end it all just so I can escape and not have to live with the multitude of problems that the previous generation left for us to deal with. Even my loved ones seem to either not realize how bad it is/is going to get, or don't care. I'm just so tired.
