I'm cursedSo much things have happened for them to be a coincidence...

I always bring the worst of people, I make them snap at me, or they end up drifting away...

Inb4 you say that they're all bad while I'm good, please, hear me out.

How can over 50 people I've met in my life, all of them whom I was something like a normal friend, close friend or best friend, end up either leaving or snapping at me?

And how can over 300 people I've tried to befriend in my entire life end up treating me with indifference, or bullying me or using me as a tool?

Majority rules (at least in this case), because I don't think all of them were wrong. Maybe a few, that's true, but I think I hold most of the blame.

I'm trying to live with this, I'm trying to cope, but I can't do anything anymore, everything is just punishment, indifference, rejection, betrayal and so on... 

It's something inside of me, I'm sure of that. Either a curse, or sadly my personality or way of being, but it's mostly my fault... 

I don't think I will be able to last much longer... I even have finals next week, and I don't think I'll be able to study for them properly...
