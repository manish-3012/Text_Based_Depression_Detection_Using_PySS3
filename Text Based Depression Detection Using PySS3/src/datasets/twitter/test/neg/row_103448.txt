Who should get my stuff?I dont know who should get my board games and such. I was going to give them to my boyfriend but i have a nephew now and maybe he would want my clothes. Or would it be too much of a reminder to my brothers if they saw him in my clothes?

What happens to peoples clothes when they die? Do people tend to sell them? Or keep them hidden in an attic? Im worried my parents wont follow my wishes on my note too. I dont want random people at my funeral if i even get one.
