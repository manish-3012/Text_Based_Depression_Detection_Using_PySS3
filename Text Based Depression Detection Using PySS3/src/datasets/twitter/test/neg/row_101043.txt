Anxiety has put my dreams on hold and it will one day kill meHi there, I have suffered from severe anxiety all my life. The kind you have to take benzo for the rest of my life. I have a lot of dreams and goals in life, but to achieve them they require a lot of effort on my part and I just cant. My mind is my worst enemy, now with covid isolation it just overpowers me and leaves me exhausted and depressed. I smoke to calm my nerves, but everyday at the end of the day I feel guilty for not having done anyrhing related to my goals and dreams and just spend the day fighting against my anxiety. Leaving me depressed.
