Messed up in the head.I am crushed. Finally can confirm that I am fucked up in the head.
I have had one police visit me to see if I am alright, I was at the time. Now I am seriously considering hospitalization.

The good news is I have enough experience to feel confident about writing but was that worth it. I got the person who liked me to hate me. I just need to wait until I can die in a place where she won't hear any news. Both so she won't get any more hurt than she is now. 

With my intelligence and personality I may have a good future if I bet on that but I don't care. I have never added up. I have always been useless. I have always tried to emulate. Now that I have something of my own, something to keep and derive a source of materials for fuel, I don't need to emulate so much but was it worth it.

First was earning emotions worth it? was earning content in my heart worth it? I am messed up and need people to talk to.
