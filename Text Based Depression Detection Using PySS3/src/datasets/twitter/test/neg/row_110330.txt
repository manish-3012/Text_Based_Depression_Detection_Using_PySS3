I'm so close to doing itI want to rid everyone of myself, i just actually attempted harming myself for the first time and just when i thought i was getting better

If i go for a walk now i will find a way to end it, of i stay inside i will continue to argue with the people i love, hurt them verbally and cry my eyes out until morning. I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE AND NOBODY TAKES MY CONDITIONS SERIOUSLY.  :(

i will either starve myself until emaciated so they realize that something IS wrong or i will kill myself. But if i do it, then they will blame themselves. I can't take this anymore i can't
