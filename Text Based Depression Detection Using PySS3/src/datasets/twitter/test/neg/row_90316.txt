Dead and hollowYou know that really fucked up feeling of nothing? Where you don't have any hope left, No reason to live anymore. That's how I feel constantly. Its been 2 years since my attempted and failed suicide attempt and I've reached that point, I wouldn't be here right now if my dad actually told me what time he'd be home, If he did, I would've used the shotgun instead. But that aside, I cant help myself anymore, I've tried and failed constantly, Everything I've done has come crumbling down. Think of this as my suicide note. Dad, I'm sorry for failing you yet again, But I was your mistake, I'm rectifying that mistake. You'll probably never see this, But thank you for being the best that you could be. I love you old man. 
And reddit, if i don't update this by next week, I'll be dead. 
I'm done, I'm out, See you fuckers in hell.
