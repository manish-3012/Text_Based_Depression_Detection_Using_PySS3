Full of Suicidal thoughtsI've been full of these thoughts for a long time now but I never take the next step (actual suicide). I always tell myself that it is a big sign of weakness and I keep going, but this time the jar us a bit fuller.
.
Why do I have these thoughts because I have nothing, literally: no job, no passion, no life, I am however in college.
.
Finding a Job is a pain in the ass (for me) with nor without coronavirus around and also my parents breathing down my neck pushing me to "go out there and find a job" is no help, I never had a job beforehand and I have zero clues how to find a job. All this gives me the "you are useless to yourself and your family" vibe and this has been going on for 2 years now and the feeling suicidal is like a necklace I can't take off.
.
I do have a strong passion for art, painting, drawing, music, photography, and filming, but I have to pay a lot to learn any of it as a college major which brings me back to the job part. Also, as my parents say "those majors wouldn't give you a job after you finish college, even it does you wouldn't get paid enough" and that's how I lose the passion for everything, even my current college major (Computer Science) requires me to code long hours but my parent can't stop the neck breathing.
.
I have no life because of all of this, no love, no best-friends, just me and my PC (and games) that keep me somewhat safe, also my humor keeps me out of troubled thoughts.

This whole thing is stupid, I feel like a crybaby but also feels like a confession.

Kill me.
