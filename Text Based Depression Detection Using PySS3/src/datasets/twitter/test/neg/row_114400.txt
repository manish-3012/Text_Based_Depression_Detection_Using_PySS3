I guess I'm just a useless bumI learned today that I'm basically a useless bum and pretty much not worth the oxygen it takes to sustain me.  

I work for minimum wage in a pizza kitchen at a gas station.  I've gotten screwed left and right by my boss (that isn't even me being whiny, even other employees acknowledge how bad I've gotten screwed).  I've applied for every job in town and every job in the next town over.  I've gotten a single call-back for an interview, and I bombed that interview today.  Basically all I'm worth is 25 hours per fortnight at my job.  I'm failing as man and as a provider.  

I've been forced to move to a whole new side of the state for the sake of my wife.  I have no family and no friends within a 4 hour drive of me.  I used to volunteer 20 hours a week, but there are no opportunities for me in this town that aren't through local churches.  Every time I try to apply for a volunteer position I get shot down because I'm not of the majority faith in this town.  My hours at work also got cut down to 25 hours per fortnight, and I can't get a damn callback for a new job (the only callback I've gotten in the last 2 months resulted in a denial). 

I'm starting to wonder if suicide is my only available option.  I realize I have people that love me (my wife, my brothers, my mom, my best friend), but it's almost becoming a case of the shittiness outweighing the good.  I'm drowning in personal debt that is pulling down my wife.  I don't have a college degree so I'm basically useless.  I'm apparently not worth more than a fucking gas station pizzaboy job.  The only reason my mom ever calls me is to remind me of how shitty I am for dropping out of college or to remind me of how good my younger brother is doing and how close he is to graduating college.  

I'm starting to wonder if it's just easier for me to off myself.  I know my wife will suffer for a bit, but lately I've been wondering if she even loves me at all.  I bet you she wouldn't mourn that long.  I'd give her 4 months at the most before she forgets me and starts to date again.  I've been such a shitty husband lately, I wouldn't even blame her if she did.  Maybe it'd be best if I were out of her life.  

TL;DR - am shit, wanna die

**Edit** - Out of pure providence, I'm listening to *that song* (we all have one) that just brings up all kinds of emotions and feelings and compulsions.  The first thing I think while listening to this song is "Man, I'm glad I threw away my last razorblade".  That's probably not healthy, right?  Maybe if I just keep listening to the song it will be enough.
