I need to hide my depression and suicidal thoughts from everyone I knowI recently made the mistake of telling my boyfriend I was depressed and possibly suicidal and the result was him feeling really shitty because he couldn't help and threatening to call helplines and hospital to get me to rehab. I told him I wasn't suicidal and those were just one time thoughts, but really I feel like eventually I'm going to give in because I'm such a failure.

 I can't afford therapy and I don't want my family to know about it because depression is considered something to be ashamed of where I am from. I'm terrified of being hospitalised too vmbc I'm afraid they will put me amongst clinically insane people and I don't want to get hurt.

My only decent option is to put up a facade but I don't know if I'll be able to keep it up for my whole life. I've heard people say the secret to be happy is to pretend then you'll forget you're pretending.. But is that really true?

I suppose I'll find out soon. Wish me luck
