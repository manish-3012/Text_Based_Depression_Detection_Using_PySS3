Everything that means something to me has been turned to ashWhat I lived for, what I loved, what I hoped for. It's all a sick joke now. The funny thing is I always knew this could happen. That's what made life worth it. "Back when I was living for the hope of it all".. my family is gone, my dreams are gone, my worth is non existent. I'm too young for this. I never had much but I loved what I had. Now I'm a joke. I cant live if I'm just a joke.
