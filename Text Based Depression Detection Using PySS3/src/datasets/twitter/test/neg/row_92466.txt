FinishedI am letting go today. Now that all the medicine has warn off I just do not care anymore. I am tried of being tortured by life itself. I just cannot endure it anymore and I have tried as much as I could. I have never really been afraid of it. Mostly it was my heart that refused. But with that gone I have nothing stopping me. And originally I was trying to make it for others. I dont have that anymore. So there is no one who would hurt from this. I always did as much as I could for others and tried to make myself look okay for them. When they are what pushed me away. It was being abandoned that hurt more then anything else. I am tired of being abandoned and hurt by others. It is just over. It never got better for me. Not in the 7 years I tried. I gave it my all.
