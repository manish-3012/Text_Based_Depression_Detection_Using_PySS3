I'm a hopeless loser and I want to fucking dieI guess the title says it all. I may be young, but I haven't achieved shit ever since I successfully made it out of a womb 18 years ago. When it comes to school, I should consider myself lucky if I pass classes, but nothing more than that. If I ever get into college, I will sure as hell end up a drop-out. I am a fucking failure, if I continue living I will end up a homeless alcoholic. I'm so useless I don't even deserve to fucking breathe. I tried to kill myself 5 times, but I suck that much at life I couldn't even do that. I just hope that sooner or later someone or something will put me out of my misery.
