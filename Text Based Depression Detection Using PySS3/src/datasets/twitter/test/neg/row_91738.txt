Iâ€™m doneMy mother is an emotionally abusive alcoholic, my dad died 3 weeks ago, Iâ€™ve lived with a dick step dad for 11 years now, Iâ€™ve been hiding in the closet as bi for 5 years, the only girl I have ever loved and the only person in this world who truly could save me because she is the most important person in my life has pushed me away and isolated me and I donâ€™t blame her. She has helped me for too long and itâ€™s not something she probably feels she can do for any longer.
And thatâ€™s just the main stuff. Iâ€™m in such a bad place
I am truly ready to take my life
