Sleeping tabletsBefore I went out with my mother to see her friend, she asked me to go grab something in the drawer. 
I happened to notice the sleeping tablets in there, decided to grab some without hesitation. 
Now I have four with me in my pocket. Havenâ€™t taken them yet since we are still at her friendâ€™s house. 
Donâ€™t think it will do any harm to me anyway, 
Iâ€™m just so numb, clearly dumb.
