I'm at one of the lowest points in my life. There is no one I can trust well enough to talk about it. I heard about suicidewatch. Help please?**I reposted this on a throwaway because I realized I have a friend who is a redditor and knows my account. Please do not post my oterh name if you know it.**

God today it hit me that I had suicidal thoughts in Grade 10, and now finished first year in University and the urge has never been stronger. I'm sorry I hate walls of text with a passion but it is the only way I can explain what I am feeling.

My entire life I was introverted loser who never went outside and always played video games. I was never very good in school. I passed but I was never smart enough for biology and the harder courses. I have had a job at Mcdonalds all through high school. It is not a bad job and I have been promoted a few times. All high school I was an overweight loser (nothing changed) with little to no social skills and very, VERY few real friends. I hung out with people who treated me like shit, and I currently still have to hang out with them sometimes. I had to stay back a year in high school because my grades were so bad, and then this year I did not get excepted into the Criminology major I wanted but Sociology, which I was offered instead. I'm done the year but I am not sure if I will have the grades to switch over.

At the end of High school I decided fuck it, fuck being suicidal. I hit the gym and lost over 70 lbs (thanks to r/loseit, r/fitness and r/motivation for the motivation and support) and started building muscle tone. I thought this would make me more confident and less shy. It worked, but ultimately I could not change my reputation with my current 'friends,' and everytime I am with them and with new people I fuck it up and just end up acting stupid. News travels fast, everyone is mutual friends because of fucking facebook. I cannot be a new person very long.

THE PROBLEM; I am going to be 20 on Sunday. I realized that in all those years of working, I have no money and am actually in debt. Not even for school, which my parents are paying for, but for stupid spending I (clothes and shit). My friends act like my friends when it is just me and the one or two, but when others are around I'm supposed to "wait in the car." It is due to my extremely poor social skills I know it for sure. I live in a world I am not prepared for. I have had 2 job interviews other than mcdonalds and was a mess for both of them, despite recommendation letters and my resume. One of my friends also went to the same interviews I went to and he got both of the jobs. I have two close friends who I am positive talk bad about me behind my back. They also constantly invite people out with us **when they know I hate the others and the others treat me like shit** who make fun of me to my face and laugh along with them. I am going to have a birthday event with two other 'friends' next saturday (and these friend incited several people who treat me like shit) and I fucked up. I invited a few people I am close with, (friends I met in Uni and my cousin) to the event and i think that someone will tell them (or I will make it obvious through my actions) that I am a loser. Worse still is that I am deathly afraid they will be taken from me and will become friends with the people who destroy my confidence. If that happens I know 100% I have nothing left. In fact, yesterday a friend, my LONGEST known friend dating back since grade 1, and I same to him, absolutely humiliated me in front of everyone. I did nothing to him. He implied I am a loser for working at Mcdonalds after all these years. I took a beating for this guy in grade 9 and he humiliated me. It didnt end there however, Once he got home a girl I once asked to dance as friends started talking to him and made it seem as I got rejected, when I just wanted to be nice. Why are people so mean??

td;dr Basically a lot of shit in the tub at the same fucking time. I held through for High School, but University feels like the same thing. I can't go through another four years of hell. What new friends I made will sooner or later hear about my shitty reputation.

**EDIT**


I picked up some advice that I'm gonna try for once. I'm not at all going to care if people say bad things to me. After my event, I'm going to do my best to cut out the horrible people. Thank you so much. 

rosefox for giving me hope and helping me realize I have a lot of time left to fix my mistakes. I still cannot beleive how I look now compared to last September and if you had told me I would have laughed. That you went on to a wonderful life makes me want to keep fighting.
chellecakes for showing me I'm not alone. It feels good that I'm not suffering alone.
spicypancakes you words did hold water. You helped me realize that I had many good moments in my life, and if it might not be my month it will be my day again.

and finally OptiMystic for the quick replies. I'm going to try your suggestion in the order of 2, 3 and then 1. Hopefully it will work by 2.

In the end, I have to admit I was feeling very down, but I am ultimately too afraid to kill myself because of what it would do to my family. Still, your words alone make me feel better. I never thought I would actually go about writing whats fucked in my life on the internet. I love reddit. I'm close to tears right now. Thank you so much.
