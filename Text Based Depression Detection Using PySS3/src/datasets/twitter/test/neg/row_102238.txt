Coping with restrictions, loads of parental issues.I have never really been the type of person to say my feelings to other people, I guess that is just how I was raised by my parents. My father has never really been there but I know that he is out there trying to support the family and all that jazz but if you ask me about my father I could just sum it up as him being there. We've never interacted before more than just hi and hello. 

On the other hand my mother is a contradiction of everything. All things she says she contradicts and she's saying somethings but shows differently, I really don't get it anymore. 

For the past 6 years I have plans of ending it all and just dying. And today I'm planning of going out and buying everything I needed to just end it all. I just really want to be free of everything. My mother and my siblings all ask me what I want to do with my life and I know that they expect me to say that I will continue with my job and all those things normal people say, things I wish I could say but how could you say to them that all you ever wanted is to just end it all? How could you say to them that when they ask you how you see yourself in your 30s you don't reply because you're just seeing yourself dead? I remember saying to them before that I just want to kill myself and saying that I'm thinking of suicide and I remember feeling so belittled and alone at that time because everything just became a shouting match after that and of course accusations of being dramatic. Sure they were crying but I'm just there still as a rock, and in that moment I just remembered that moment when I tried really hard to ask for help and advice, crying to them for help and they asked me to never cry again. And I think I never cried in front of them anymore and I've never tried to ask them for anything anymore but I guess it just hurts even now when you know they'll never understand. No one understands. Watching every day, day in and day out that nothing ever changes is scary and so useless I just want to end it all.
