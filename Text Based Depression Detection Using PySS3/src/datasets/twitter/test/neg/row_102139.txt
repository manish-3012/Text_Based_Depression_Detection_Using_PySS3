Being alive doesnâ€™t make you aliveI canâ€™t stop thinking about ways to kill my self, itâ€™s been about 2 months of this and I donâ€™t think I can take anymore of it... I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to about this, I donâ€™t even feel like I can talk about this with family. I have no one, Iâ€™m tired of being alone and scared. I donâ€™t know what to do...
