I adopted a dog and regret it so muchI've been very depressed for a very long time. I've always tried to do the things you're meant to, tried exercising, eating decently, socialising etc but it always left me tired and feeling like it wasn't worth it.

My boyfriend and I have just adopted a dog. I hadn't thought of how much work it'll be and don't want to have the added responsibility and feel terrible.

I just want to end it all so I don't need to end the mess. Suicidal desire has become much worse of late although I'm unlikely to act because most methods are painful or are likely to fail.
