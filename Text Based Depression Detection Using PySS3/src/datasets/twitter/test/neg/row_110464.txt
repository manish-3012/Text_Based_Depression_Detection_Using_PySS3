Just got fired, just buried a good friend, struggling to find purpose.Title says it all. I could just really use someone to talk to. I just keep looking at my termination letter and back at the picture of my friend who killed himself and just feel like he's the lucky one. What to do?

Edit: Thank you everyone. I'm feeling a bit better about things this morning. I'm up and looking for jobs and some meaning again. I really appreciate everyone's support.
