I'm tired. So fucking tired, and I have no escape. No one there in my time of need. I'm a depressed suicidal kid, that's ruining my parrents life. My own mom doesn't even want me. I'm going to finally end my miserable life. No one is home. I can finally do it. I'm tired of living.I tried a hotline, and they're fucking offline. I can kill myself now, no one is home. I can finally have a happy ending.

I realize I've been here more than once, sorry for wasting you alls time.
