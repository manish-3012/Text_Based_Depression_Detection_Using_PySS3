Iâ€™m jealous of everyoneLiterally everyone I know is better than me and more successful than me. I have never been motivated to do anything, I just donâ€™t have it in me. Coming to the realisation a long time ago that Iâ€™m an idiot and canâ€™t even function like a normal being sucks. Iâ€™ve wanted to die for so long. Iâ€™m tired of being broke and useless and donâ€™t have the capacity to just be.
