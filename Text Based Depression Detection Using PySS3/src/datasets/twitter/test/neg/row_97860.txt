I should just end everyone's miseryI'm in this state where I feel really trapped. Nothing I do turns out well and only frustrates people. I feel like the hugest mistake ever. At 25, I'm a huge burden to my family and I don't know how to stop being such a problem. Even if I don't do it tonight, it'll happen someday because I can't survive on my own without my parents. The only thing thats stopping me right now is the thought of my sister finding me dead as my folks are away. But I just want to end this pain. No one will really miss me anyway, I haven't done anything meaningful in my life.
