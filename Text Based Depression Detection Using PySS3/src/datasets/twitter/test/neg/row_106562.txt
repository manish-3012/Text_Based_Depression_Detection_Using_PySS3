Soon.[TW: self harm and suicide (obviously)]
Since we're in quarantine my mental health is just slowly getting worse and tbh I don't care. My arm and stomach are fucking covered in cuts and burns and it's getting worse. One of my friends read a post I made a few days ago on another account in r/suicidewatch and text me telling me he was walking around to mine because it was like midnight and there was nothing stopping him from going out of the house and I freaked the fuck out and literally ran from him and my own house and was seriously considering killing myself that night. The thing is I don't want to worry any of my other friends by telling them what's going on but if I don't talk to someone I don't know what I'll end up doing. The thing is I do have people in my life i trust but I don't want to give them my issues to worry about aswell because they all have their own things going on and I don't need anyone else worrying about me. I have a really bad history when it comes to self harm and suicide and other mental health related issues that I don't even want to get into now. I feel like something soon will tip me over the edge and I'll never see the end of isolation. I'm done, I just can't fucking take anymore. 

Anyways, sorry for wasting your time and i Hope your having a better day than me :)
