I would've killed myself for nothingHad I taken my own life, it would have been for something stupid. While I thought people hated me, or that I was toxic, I didn't think about others in my life, as I only let my darkness control me.

Hate, anger, resentment, envy, jealousness, self-pity and so on... I would have died as a coward, who didn't want to face the consequences of my actions. I was so blind, that I thought everything was over.

God... I was an stupid, selfish person...
