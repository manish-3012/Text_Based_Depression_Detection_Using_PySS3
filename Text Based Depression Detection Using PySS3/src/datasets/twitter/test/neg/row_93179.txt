Stuck and feeling extremely regretful.I'm 40, married almost 11 years, 5 year old son.  And every day I wish I was dead.  I made poor decisions many years ago.  I'll never be what I wanted to be, never be with who I wanted to be with. And I can't tell my wife because she'll take it as a slight against her.  I don't know why I got married in the first place - I guess I thought it was just expected, and time to do it, and all that. Every night I want to go to sleep and just not wake up.  I'm in love with another woman - she moved here for me, and then I said I couldn't be with her because I would miss my son too much.  Now I have lost her for a second time after I spent the last 17 years looking for her.  I am so done. This all sounds terribly selfish I'm sure. Dammit.
