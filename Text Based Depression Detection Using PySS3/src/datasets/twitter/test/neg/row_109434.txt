The latest Louis CK special changed my lifeAnd not for the better.

I've always felt I'm "depressed", I've even seen a doctor and taken "tests" and say I scored high on depression, stress, and anxiety. It comes and goes, but overall I don't lead a happy life and haven't since I can remember.

Over the last month things have gotten worse again. My doctor told me a story about the 4 "support networks" you're meant to have in your life; family, friends, work, &amp; community. And if all of them break down you're in serious trouble. I'm in that place again.

I've never really had friends, the last time I "went out with friends" (that wasn't work related) was probably... I can't even remember. I do not think I ever did it at high school and I am 31 now. I've never been in a relationship, ever. I'm a guy and I'm gay and I do not even know how the gay community works or how to even start. I don't find myself attractive and the only people who seem to do are older ladies at work who call you adorable and like to squeeze your cheeks.

I suffer from social anxiety that stops me even trying to go out. I love boardgames (I own so many, but can't play any with anyone, I just buy them for some reason), so I joined a board game club, thinking it would help, and went to an evening and embarrassed myself that I just feel I can't go back. I just don't know how to act around other people, I never have learnt the skills. I live in an apartment building and everyone I go to use the elevator I panic that someone else might be there. Once I saw the elevator climb to a level above me then start to come down to my level and I walked away from it thinking someone else might be inside and I waited a couple of minutes and tried again. Most days I am alright but that automatic reaction to the elevator and an interaction scared me.

I work retail. I am actually a manager. I deal with people each and every day. I manage a team of over 40 people and interact with them fine. I can publicly speak in front of them, customers, fellow co-workers, bosses, etc. But once I take off that uniform I feel worthless. It's almost as if the "title" is what provides me with the "value" of a human being and not who I am as a person.

I lie at work functions about "what I do outside of work" because I am too embarrassed to admit I do nothing. I watch netflix, chat online, sometimes I bake bread and eat it by myself. I definitely Reddit and I'd be interested in seeing how many upvotes I've given out over the years as I always am eager to provide happiness in others (10,000's maybe?), but seem to struggle with my own. It's sad that I find this a milestone in my life, giving virtual happiness to others is apparently a major accomplishment of mine.

Over the last few weeks I've felt one of my only "real" online friends, definitely the closest get more distant from me. I am boring, I do not have tales to tell her, we've had every conversation there is to have. She used to tag things to me on Facebook but that has stopped and I see her tagging other people on things I'm sure she would have tagged me in the past.

I shop to fill in the "void" and I am broke. I live in a fancy apartment to have something nice in my life but it's sending me broke. I have credit card bills that are sending me broke. I am struggling.

I'm overweight and definitely lost weight over the years but I've been struggling over the last year (again). My apartment building has a gym that I never used (social anxiety) but I decided to support my online friend who was struggling with her own gym and get her back into it by agreeing to finally go to mine (she knew I was terrified of going, but maybe not the entirety of my social anxiety). I went a couple of times and stopped. I even bought a set of scales a couple of weeks ago and since then I've measured myself twice and put on 3kg and haven't weighed myself since. I now eat ice cream and beef jerky as "meals".

A month ago I woke up and decided to get things done and have a nice day. I even did my hair really well, got dressed into my nice shoes and decided to go to Costco for some shopping. I watched two people walk in and not show their membership cards and I went to do the same thing but the woman stopped me and asked me "can I see your card?" and I felt insulted, and also felt stupid for feeling this way. The one day I decided to make myself look "good" and it can't even get me into Costco without my card. I showed my card, went in, didn't buy anything, left and drove home feeling dead inside. I didn't cry, I didn't really feel anything. I could have had a car accident and wouldn't even care.

I came home and opened Netflix and thought maybe the Louis CK special would make me feel better.

His first bit is basically "suicide is always an option" and since that day an hour doesn't go by (unless I'm sleeping) that I don't think of that "comedy bit" and think, is it?
