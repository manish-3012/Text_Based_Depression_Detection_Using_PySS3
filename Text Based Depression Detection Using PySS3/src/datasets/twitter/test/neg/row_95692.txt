Follow-up to "Hit a new low"Original post can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/30spwt/hit_a_new_low/).

So today I met up with them, they had some beers and whatnot. And as I started talking about it, they looked at me weird and thought I was kidding. But then they realized it was not a joke at all. And they were genuinely sorry that I feel this way and they are usually just kidding around and don't mean anything bad by it. They also promised to cut back on making fun of my shit, so I guess they are friends after all.

But thanks to all the people who found the time to reply. It felt so much better to be able to talk someone about it firsthand and not freak anyone out. Also, I don't think about killing myself every morning anymore. Just sometimes, but hopefully it will pass.
Life is worth living.
