Is the suicide hotline worth calling?I don't have anyone in my life I am willing to turn to or open up to, but I'm tired of letting all my emotions and suicidal thoughts bottle up. I've considered calling the suicide hotline but I've read some stories on the internet where its just made things worse for people. Have any of guys had any experience with it, if so was it worth calling?
