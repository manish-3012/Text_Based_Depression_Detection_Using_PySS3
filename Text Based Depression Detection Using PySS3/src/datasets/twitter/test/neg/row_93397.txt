Everyday is almost too much to bear.I left a post in r/depression (http://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1b09hv/i_want_to_disappear) explaining how I feel 2 weeks ago. I don't know how long I can do this anymore. I scare away everyone I love by loving them too much. No matter what, I'm always abandoned. I don't know how to live for myself, so if I am not wanted, I feel as though I have no purpose anymore. I should be happy. I get showered in reassurances, but I can't seem to believe it. My parents won't take me seriously. Neither does my shrink and I don't see him until June. Please help me. I am tired of living this self fulfilling prophecy.
