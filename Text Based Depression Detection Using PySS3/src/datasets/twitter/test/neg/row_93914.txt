My sister attempted suicide. How can I help her?Sorry if this doesn't belong here, but I don't know where else to post. I live a few states away from home right now, but I'm considering going back to see her and my mom. This is the second time she's attempted suicide, but no one knew about the first attempt until the second one. She's in a psychiatric ward until they feel it's safe to release her. She's going to college in a month. We both will attend school far away from home, but my school is only a two hour drive from hers. 

I care about her more than any person or thing on this earth. What can I do and what kind of support can I offer her?
