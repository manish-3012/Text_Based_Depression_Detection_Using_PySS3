No hopes left i think it's the timeFirst, English is not my first language, I hope I can able to explain myself.

I'm 25 years old, graduated from University 3 years ago. When I graduated I immediatly start to look for a job but I always rejected because you need to go Military in my country. 1 month after graduation I learned that my gf was cheating on me, this was the break point in my life. I become suicidal only thing I was able to think was suicide. I didnt wanted to think anything so I go to military but before going to military my dream company called me and asked me if I wanted to work with them i said i cant because i was going to military.

So military service is over i return back to my parents home I kept sending resumes and applying for jobs. One day i found a great job. Interview was really good. After sometime they didnt called me so i called them they said they hired someone. And that someone was my ex gfs boyfriend. My long gone suicidal side was returned again i couldn't stop thinking it. I was failed againts him. This was 1.5 years ago.

Im unemployee since that time. I make myself lonely im not answering anycalls from my friends i blocked them all because they all have good jobs working marrying and stuff, i don't want to face with them i dont want them to see me living a miserable life.

I just want to disappear. I tried to jump off from 10 stories building today but couldnt do it because i don't have bravery to do it. I dont want to kill myself because of girl i want to kill myself because  I'm a failure and I wasted my life.
