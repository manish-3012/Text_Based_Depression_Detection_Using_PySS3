What do you guys think about 2020 and what are you doing to prepare for it, if anything?I donâ€™t want to live to see it. I want to die.

I donâ€™t think my mom would cry if I died. She wonâ€™t respond to my texts. I told her that I was feeling borderline suicidal but she didnâ€™t reply.

Why doesnâ€™t she love me like when I was a little girl? Why isnâ€™t she capable of it? She doesnâ€™t want me anymore. I want to be loved and be good enough. I want to get off all of my medications but I canâ€™t.
