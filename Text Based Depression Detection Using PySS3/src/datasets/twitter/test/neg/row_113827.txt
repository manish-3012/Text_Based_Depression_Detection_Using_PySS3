I love Jesus but still want to die.I want to die everyday. I have 3 beautiful boys and a husband that I love so very much. One would think that just those things alone would keep me here on earth. We go to church and I am, as far as I think, a pretty devout lover of Jesus. I just donâ€™t understand why I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Itâ€™s frustrating. I find fault in everyone. I am on an anti-depressants. 
Last week a friend committed suicide and Iâ€™m jealous. Iâ€™m not even sad, I am freaking jealous. I just donâ€™t even know where to turn for the moment.
