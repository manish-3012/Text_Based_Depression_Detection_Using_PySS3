How am I supposed to commemorate Christmas?So my parents are pretty much obligating me to go and commemorate Christmas with my family.

How am I supposed to do that, if I want to kill myself? Am I supposed to pretend that nothing is wrong? That I am not misarable? I can't laugh it out ffs.

Christmas just became a reminder of better times. A time that people gather around to share their happiness with others. But I am not happy. I don't have anything to share. For me it feels like a big theater play, in which, for one night, I am being obligated to fake my happiness.

Fuck that.
