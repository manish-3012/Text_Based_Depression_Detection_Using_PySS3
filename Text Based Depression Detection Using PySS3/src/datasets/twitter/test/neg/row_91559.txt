Losing the willWhen an individual loses the will to live, there is nothing anyone can say or do to bring it back. Heaven knows this will not stop others from trying, but others don't sense their limited powers in curing mental illness. Some think it is like a light switch that can be turned on or off at will. For the sufferer, it is more like a cancer of the mind, that is embedded in the physical brain of the ill patient, growing each day until it fully consumes the body it directs. The very severely mentally ill patient understands his position in the cosmos. Time goes on and on, he knows he will pass and never return, and once he understands the ultimate doom of all, he cannot escape the madness. It is everywhere at once, and it kills him. I am one with this illness. I will blaze out like a supernova. Why did the star ever exist? It shone for a time, and it was done shining. Time blew out that candle, just as it does to us all. But some see the doom and it is all-consuming, preventing life as it is happening to take on a passion. I will hang myself in a matter of days. I have no regrets. I leave no spouse. I leave no offspring. Other family members will grieve, but death is as natural as life. They will be cured walking along a hiking path breathing the fresh air and watching a tree's leaves ruffle in the breeze. The birds will still fly. The fish will still swim. This is life and death. Or it was.
