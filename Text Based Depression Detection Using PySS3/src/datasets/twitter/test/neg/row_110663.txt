Most people have not accepted the fact that we die eventually no matter what we do.Thatâ€™s why they try to keep you alive. They donâ€™t realize that they are only delaying the inevitable and prolonging the misery. Long-term suffering is worse than short-term suffering, and death is unavoidable. Convincing someone to not commit suicide just increases the amount of suffering they have to deal with before reaching the exact same outcome. Life doesnâ€™t get better as you get older; it gets worse. You lose your mind, body, and youthful spirit. You also experience many more years of boredom, frustration, depression, and tragedy.

Would it be better to die young of suicide?

Or would it be better die elderly because your body slowly ceased to work? 

Either way, you still die. One option has less years of suffering through physical/emotional pain beforehand.
However, it is the option that the majority of people deem as less rational...
