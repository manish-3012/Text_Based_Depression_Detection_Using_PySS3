I Told My TherapistMy depression was transient. It would come and go until about a month ago. I was talking to my therapist today and she remarked that while I'm depressed it seems like I'm languishing. Like I'm not fully committed to giving up on life but I'm not fully committed to life either. We had discussed my pill habit and how detrimental it will be to my life long term and I told her I didn't care. She asked me in the past if I was considering suicide and I lied...until today.

I told her about the google searches, eBook downloads, and pricing I had done researching painless and most successful suicide methods. I told her how im not fully committed to suicide, that I would never actually do it, but that's not the truth of how I feel. I just didn't want to be hospitalized. I am honestly a little worried about myself. 

The truth is I know why my depression worsened, I started Zoloft and things got bad quick. But there something I like about feeling this way. Its calming, relaxing, and quells my anxiety. My depression is always like that. I mean I had been considering suicide for years but being on the pill has exacerbated these feelings.

So I'm making this post for a couple of reasons. The first is just to put it out there that antidepressants can make things worse and maybe someone here is experiencing that and hasn't realized it. The second is just to get these thoughts out of my head. 

I guess I'm not fully committed to ending it all yet.
