I told all my friends I loved themI just got home from going out with a few coworkers. One of them I've had pretty serious feelings for for about a year. I'm really quiet and shy so he has no idea. Anyways we all went out and he started hooking up with another coworker even though he's seeing someone else. I'm  just drunk and I can't believe this is happening to me that I'm actually even experiencing a typical drunk girl moment. I never show emotions no matter what. I feel like this entire time my feelings for him have been a reflection of my own self doubt. I felt like I've come so far with my skin (my biggest insecurity. I dealt with severe acne) my weight, my style. My hair...everything. I always felt like I never had a chance with anyone, him Included. I feel like I just had my fears validated that I am not good enough.  For anyone's standards but more than anything for my own standards. I don't even know what I'm really talking about I told my friends I loved them all not so that they give me compliments and say shit about how I'll find someone else or anything. Just being there is enough. Just having them and feeling something else besides self hate is enough. Like I said I sent even know what I'm asking for on this post or anything, I'm just looking for an outlet I guess. Thanks for reading.
