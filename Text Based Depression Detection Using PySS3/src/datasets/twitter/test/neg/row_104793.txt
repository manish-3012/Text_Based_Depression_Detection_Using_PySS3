Life is overwhelmingIn the last two years I've been cheated on, divorced, demoted, fired and recently unemployed for a month with my previous job smearing my name for potential jobs. I have 2 kids which makes this much worse, but I frequently debate my worth in their lives and anyone else's for that matter. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm facing eviction, homelessness and losing custody of my kids because of it. I'm at a loss. If anyone here has words of wisdom, please share.
