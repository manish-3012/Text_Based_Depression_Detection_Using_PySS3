I'm being held hostageI'm not sure why I am here since I know this subreddit is just free therapy but I'ce reached the end of my rope. I'm tired, treatment is not working and I feel very lost. Im diagnosed with bipolar and my life typically has lots of ups and downs but recently life has been harder than ever. I'm 21 and I've been living in my own house for about 2 years now and things are starting to catch up with me. Mental health issues are a lot harder when you don't live with your parent. I'm missing more and more work every month and am really starting to get behind on my Bills. I'm not going to get fired thankfully since my job is extremely accommodating with my mental health but the stress is getting to me. Anyways, I want to end my life or disappear, not sure yet, but I've reached a weird point in my life where I really dont want to hurt my friends and especially my parent. I've lost a close friend to suicide and I know how devastating it is. I've also seen how devastating my previous attempts have hurt my parent. This is the only reason I dont want to go but I cant help but feel like I'm being held hostage baby my friends and family. I want out, like I said I'm tired and not sure what to do. Any advice is appreciated.
