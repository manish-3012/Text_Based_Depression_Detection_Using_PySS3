it feels like it'll never work out for mei'm a parasite, i will never go to school and get a degree and no one will truly love me. i don't see myself with a decent job, husband or kids, i just see myself dying in the near future. i want it to be over with. i grew up at an early age because i had a rough childhood and i still to this day have ptsd episodes. i thought i could get away from my problems and i moved, but now im just a waste of space to this couple that took me in for the time being. and now that i can't find a job i feel like time is running out. i don't feel hope. i never did but it's worse now.
