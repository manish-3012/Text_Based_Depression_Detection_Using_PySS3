I felt a funeral in my brainI want to stop existing immediately. I've been suicidal for years, and my ideation has worsened in frequency and intensity over the past few weeks. I'm experiencing violent visions of my own death -- not simply a hanging or overdose... But worse, more gruesome. I'm rapidly losing the little grasp of reality that I had left. A tiny part of me fears the devastation my death would cause my family and friends, but I'm fairly certain they will eventually recover. Please. 

I felt a funeral in my brain,
        And mourners, to and fro,
Kept treading, treading, till it seemed
        That sense was breaking through.
And when they all were seated,
        A service like a drum
Kept beating, beating, till I thought 
        My mind was going numb.

And then I heard them lift a box,
        And creak across my soul
With those same boots of lead,
        Then space began to toll

As all the heavens were a bell,
        And Being but an ear,
And I and silence some strange race, 
        Wrecked, solitary, here.

And then a plank in reason, broke,
        And I dropped down and down--
And hit a world at every plunge,
        And finished knowing--then--
