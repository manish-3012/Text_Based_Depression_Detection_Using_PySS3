Trying not to pull the age cardI mean, how do you not?

As a forty-something, childless, partnerless woman (not for lack of trying), who likely can no longer breed, who isnâ€™t particularly successful career-wise...from a social standpoint, I truly feel irrelevant to most of society. What good is a woman if not a young, thin, potential incubator, a mom, a grandma, or someone professionally successful?
And so when I see people under 30 on here, certain life is over...I think...how? You have potential. You can switch careers without getting side-eyed. You arenâ€™t considered â€œtoo oldâ€ to be with. Unless the person is ostracized for a truly incurable disability or other factor that absolutely leaves them permanently on the outside- this I understand- I find myself looking at their situation and I donâ€™t know how to NOT think â€œBut youâ€™re so young!â€ And thatâ€™s with me remembering being suicidal in my 20s (yet now baffled by that- what was I thinking? As it is, things did not turn out well but still...at the time...there was a chance then! And not everyone will necessarily turn out like me, where suicide makes so much more sense now, and that will likely increase as I age and become more invisible).

I recognize they may have gone through such more awful things than me...but itâ€™s their potential I just canâ€™t shake and it always seems to be a knee jerk instinct in my responses. Does this kind of thinking from older people- about potential (again, if they donâ€™t have some sort of incurable condition that alienates them)- offend younger people seeking to die?

Please donâ€™t come at me. Iâ€™m genuinely trying to figure out how to relate to young people in this situation, coming from where Iâ€™m standing as a middle aged female.
