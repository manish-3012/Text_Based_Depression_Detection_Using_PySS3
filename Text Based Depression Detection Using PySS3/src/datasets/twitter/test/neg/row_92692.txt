CheesecakeI hate you. I fucking hate you so much. I hate that I love you. I hate how much I love you. It hurts. It hurts so much. Without you, it hurts. It's like living without breathing. I hate how much I love you and how much you didn't. I just want to be good enough for you. How do I know I love you? How? Rain told me that I'll know when I'm ready to take a bullet for them, that's when I'll know. When I'm ready to give up anything for them, that's when I know I'll love them. And I would jump in front of a bullet for you. If there was a threat to your life. I would protect you, I would protect you over mine. I would. Because it's you and you were meant for great things. You were meant for great things, love. You were. You are. I love you more than anything else in the world. I love you.  I may be off my rocker but it doesn't make me love you any less. I love you. I would never let anyone hurt you because I fucking love you. And when I love, it's all in, everything. Like Elizabeth Gilbert said, you can have me, you can have my dog, my ass, my money, my house, my everything, you can have everything. Come back because all I want to do is jump in front of a bus and die and I can't do that anymore because they are people who love me like I love you and I can't cause them pain anymore. They can't suffer because of me anymore. They can't.

I have so much love to give. So much love. Let me love you. Let me.

I choose to die. I choose death everyday. I'm not going to kill myself but I'm not going to stop myself from dying. I'm not going to look when I cross the road. I'm not going to not jump off building or stab myself. I won't kill myself but I won't stop me from dying.
