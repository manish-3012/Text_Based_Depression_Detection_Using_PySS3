Bluh. What the fuck am I even doing. Ive been suicidal for years at least since I was 12 or 13. Things are finally turning from bad to worse. Years of doing poorly in school have led to me nearly flunking out of college. I moved from one broken household to another, and after seeing every relationship in my family end in total catastrophe has left me little hope for any future relationships. My whole life my family scapegoated me for everything, and being the first-born of my family and family's friends no one even knew how to raise me. Fuck my dad for leaving, fuck my mom for not knowing how to choose a mate or raise two kids. living off-campus I feel like all I am doing is spending my family's money. Not to mention the fact that I fucked up my schedule this year and am not a full time student. Goodbye financial aid. I care as little as possible about the reaction of my friends or family to my death. Ill be dead. I don't think there's much of a future for me, and even if there was it will all have to end sometime. Does it matter if I'm 20, 40, or 80. Memories are worthless in death.

Now by my family's suggestion I'm spending the weekends traveling 150 miles regularly to spend the weekends with my uncle and to see a counselor in his town. More money. I'm just a drain on these people. I don't even care about what a huge waste of my time it is. All my friends are ignorant or uncaring assholes who aggravate the problem, and my family prefers to pretend the problems not there. 

And my fucking inner monologue that runs every second I am awake. I cant talk or listen or watch or even read anything without keeping a second or third mental track running involuntarily and its just driving me fucking nuts. I'm always speaking to myself inside my own head and I cannot turn it off even for a second. 

I know you people all want to help me live fully but what I really want is someone to just help me die. I want to die and that's all Ive wanted for a very long time.
