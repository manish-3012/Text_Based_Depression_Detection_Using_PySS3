feeling alone is the worst feelingSome times...I just get so low...I try to show it...but I don't think any body wants to see....ya...I may not have the worst life...but something inside me just makes me feel like I'm scum...like I'm not worth the air I breathe.... 


Too many times have I screamed out for help..and have it fall on deaf ears...I don't know...maybe I dont know how to express my feelings...maybe I don't know how to just be normal either...then again...what is normal?and I have had help from friends...lots of you are there for me...it's ibdont know how to take the help... Sorry if you are offended 


I am in love with a woman...I never felt love like this..not since my daughter comming into my life....she is all I ever desired..but sadly..something inside me just can't see it....I just can't see the love..I mean..she lives with me...so that must mean she loves me..but my brain just shuts down with her...maybe she isn't good for me...or maybe I'm the one that isn't good...regardless..I love her... I would move mountians for her...I just don't think she wants me to...I don't think she sees how hurt I really get...it's like a dog getting yelled at...I feel so terrible when I hurt her...and even worse when she hurts me...her words make me believe...but her actions make me want to never love again..it is hard..but love isn't supposed to be easy...I let her walk all over me...I'll make her food everytime she asks...like a fool o take the mental abuse...I can't get out...I want to but I can't.....I tried... 


Not having a job is ridiculous..I feel like scum...I have put in apps...but no calls back...I don't know if working in the same place for so long helped or hurt me....I'd still have a job if i was normal in the head..but I let my demons run my life.. 


Then there is Lilly...the one thing that I love to see...is her smile...I melt every time...I feel like I have failed her...in so many ways...I don't feel like a good parent...and with her seizures...my mind is in constant worry...I don't know how to just not...but it eats me alive...to be so help less...and watching her motor skills her brain not funtion...for her to not have a chance this early in life...it breaks my heart.I feel like it's my fault she is like this...genetic..or mental...I blame me. 


I'm not a good friend at all...I have let many of you down...I lost my job...my boss was my friend...I was too blind to see he was helping me and I just couldn't accept it...I don't call..contact..hang out...I lost my family because of my torment..my friends are my family... 


So I sit here and wonder what the fuck I'm supposed to do...am I supposed to just take this all wait it out??? Should I just up and leave??? Not many of you know...but suicide is something I struggle with... On no meds...I'm a stubborn asshole and won't get help....I don't even like to ask to borrow money..even if it means no toilet paper....tears have filled my face as I write all of these words....I'm so lost...and the one person that I really want help from...treats me like I don't exsist.....it's all my fault...I'm so lost......
