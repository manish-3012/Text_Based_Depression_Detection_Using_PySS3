I am a 59-year-old woman whose life has never been my ownBorn and raised in California, moved to Texas at the age of 14.  When I met my husband and I followed him to Houston for his job, he promised me that in five years we would move to California.  That was almost 40 years ago.  I looked up retirement communities in my hometown, and the houses were cheaper than the one we bought in Houston.  Now he says, "NO! We are staying here!"  The rest of my life will now be spent in a place I never belonged, and I will die here.  I  was going to drive away from the city, park in a place where no one could see my car, and commit suicide.  Then I found out that the way I was going to do it would not kill me, just screw me up.  I still want to die.
