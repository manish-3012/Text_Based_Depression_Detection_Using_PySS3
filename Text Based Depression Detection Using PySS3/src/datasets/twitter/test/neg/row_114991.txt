I'm done.I've officially checked out. I'm ready to go. I've been wanting to do this for half my life. This year I was almost successful.  And then my brother took his own life and now it's just worse. 

I'm just pissed my husband won't let me do it. I have everything I need to be successful this time. 

I understand because I wouldn't want anyone to go either but I'm just in a great deal of pain and i don't want to live my life like this anymore. 

I'm medicated, not working. In therapy. It helps. But when I fall it hurts more and more everytime.

I wish the ones who love us understood why we have to go.
