I hope Christmas will bring me love when I wake up.Life has been quite cruel towards me all along. I had to be the boss. The unbreakable. Which meant I was always on my own to face whatever would come. I feel very lonely and not cared for.  I am not a mentally stable person who should not be left alone anymore. But people still do. I feel so insignificant when I always held strong to save others. I hope I'll wake up to some love for Christmas. I don't even know if I can feel it anyway. But I hope. I'm miserable.
