The moment I knew my parents didn't care about me.I grew up an only child to my mother (dad had 3 kids from a previous marriage, they were all in college when I was a baby). My mom and dad always said to me they'd do anything for me but I quickly learned that was a lie.

When I started to get bullied in middle school I tried to talk to about it to my mom but to no avail. It always went down with me telling her how I felt only to completely invalidate and blow over what I said and told me how she think I felt. She also threated to put ne in the looney bin when I started to express suicidal thoughts in 7th grade. She dragged me by the arm into the kitchen one day and dialed 911 and said "uh oh off to the funny farm with you". That day crushed me, it destroyed me and my mother refuses to acknowledge what she did, she always claims vicitm and cries about how much she gave up for me and how hard it is being a mother.

My dad on the other hand is a mix bag. He cares but he's also a dipshit. He's a little less inept as my mom but I never felt he understood my trauma or my life as a whole. I never felt like his son, I felt like a stepson to my own biological father. I knew he didn't care about me when I was 20 while I was being escorted from my therapist's office to the psych ward to be involuntarily committed. He's cracking jokes about how I'm faking this to get out housework WITH MY THERAPIST RIGHT FUCKING THERE! If it weren't for his presence or the security cameras around I legitimately wouldn't punched his lights out.

Theres many more incidents with them but those are the highlights that proved to me my parents don't actually care about me. They're better now but it's too little too late. The things they're doing now is what I begged and pleaded for all of middle and high school but for some reason me being in college when I needed it the least that's when they step up. I only use them for food and money, if I had the chance to cut them out of my life I WOULD! I'm tired of feeling like a stranger to them. I just want my mom and dad back, I want to go back to being a 5 year old when things were happy with them. I'm crying now, I wish I could get a reset.
