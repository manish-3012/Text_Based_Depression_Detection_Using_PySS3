The darkness has passed. This morning is bright.Hey SW reddit, just a status update. Its been a long time since I posted, about a year I think, but what really matters is what happened in my life.

It happened when I was in my room, depressed, and my bro came in and he talked to me. All he did was talk. I forgot most of it by now, but he said that "you should just snap out of it, because it was so unlike you." Compared to the 'nice' treatment I was getting from others, this was completely unexpected, and yet it moved me. I don't even know why, but I felt better slowly after that. 

I got out of the slump that I was in and I got my life back on track. My grades are looking better, I've gotten a job and I picked up new hobbies and new friends. I even started waking up every morning and looking up to the black sky and seeing how far I'd come since then. The feeling is exhilarating- to be free of something that I felt like I would never escape.

SW Reddit, you carry a hard job. It is amazing that you can deal with so much pain and suffering, and yet still be so supportive. After reading through some posts, I felt moved to write these two words out.

"Continue. Living."
