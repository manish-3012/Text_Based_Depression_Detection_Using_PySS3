I donâ€™t see how it can change.Does the pain of being alive end? Or does anyone else constantly think that itâ€™s just a matter of time until the suicidal thoughts win? I was passively suicidal for a loooong while, but I keep getting right back to this low.  But now itâ€™s just a matter of time until it just eventually gets me. Like addiction, cancer or diabetes. Some just give up?
