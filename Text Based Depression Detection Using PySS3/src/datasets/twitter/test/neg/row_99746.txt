I Am NothingI don't have abusive parents, or a troubled childhood. If anything, I shouldn't feel like this. I just feel like a stain upon society, I'm only in high school and I am already setting myself for failure. I have all B/s and a C and no college is going to accept me. I'm nothing but reasons for my parents to argue(they have nothing about me to be proud about), a pathetic excuse of a role model to my younger brother, a hinderance to my girlfriend from having someone who deserves her, an annoyance to my friends, but most of all, a burden to society. I'm not going to contribute to society, I'll be a leech. So why exactly should I be alive? I know what my future is going to be and it won't be a happy one. Besides, everyone would be happier if I just simply died, they may not realize it then, but once time passes, they'll be happier. I know it sounds like I'm just being angsty but these are just the thoughts I can't keep down anymore.
