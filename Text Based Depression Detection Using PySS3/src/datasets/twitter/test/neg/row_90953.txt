VentIâ€™m a 17 year old senior in high school, and Iâ€™m planning on majoring in biology and going on a pre-med track. I have close friends who care about me and Iâ€™m from a middle class household with average income. I want to apply to an Ivy League college. 

I canâ€™t even look in a mirror because of how disgusting I look. I am an awful person who really shouldnâ€™t be here, literally wasting oxygen on a planet thatâ€™s already too small for us. Iâ€™m overweight, unattractive, canâ€™t draw even though Iâ€™ve practiced for years, canâ€™t play sports due to asthma, never learned any instruments or dance, am just smart enough to stay at the top half of my class but never smart enough to be recognized, canâ€™t drive, and I canâ€™t make meaningful relationships or connect emotionally anymore. 

Every day I keep wondering if itâ€™s all really worth it, the constant pressure to succeed. My parents want me to become top of my class, with a 4.0 GPA, all while hitting the gym and becoming more attractive. Itâ€™s been done before, they argue. Every day they tell me that I should go exercise or that Iâ€™m useless because I canâ€™t do a simple chore fast enough or good enough. I always feel like Iâ€™m failing my parents and if I come out as bisexual to them, they will cut me off. My relationship with my parents has been deteriorating ever since I said I hated living at home and that I couldnâ€™t wait to move out for college. They laughed at me and said that I wasnâ€™t smart enough to get to an out-of-state college (to truly get away from them). 

My grades in school have been nothing but average, As and Bs with a couple of Cs. I excel in certain classes and completely fail others. I feel like thereâ€™s no way out and that I just have to repeat the cycle again and again until the end of medical school. 

Iâ€™m completely untalented. I canâ€™t speak my first language anymore, I donâ€™t speak any others, and I have no particular skills in anything. I donâ€™t learn things quickly, and I often have a hard time paying attention to things (which often makes me unable to pay attention to class, even though I try- and itâ€™s gotten to the point where I have to stab myself with a pencil to pay attention). Iâ€™ve been interested in painting since middle school and though Iâ€™ve practiced for years on end, I still canâ€™t paint anything. It feels like Iâ€™ve lost my creativity and that itâ€™s only a matter of time before Iâ€™m completely drained of the will to do anything. I canâ€™t play any sports or play any instruments. I canâ€™t sing, dance, or act, and I have a hard time speaking to people. I constantly stutter. 


Itâ€™s gotten to the point where I honestly wonder why Iâ€™m even here. Iâ€™m not anything particularly special, and chances are, Iâ€™m not going to do anything thatâ€™s going to be remembered. Iâ€™m too much of an awful person for anyone to consider dating and I donâ€™t plan on having children. 

The more my parents berate me, the less I honestly want to live. I feel like a stranger to my friends even though I know that they care about me. It feels like Iâ€™m just standing in the eye of a hurricane waiting to get blown away by everything that happens around me. 

It feels like my life is one gigantic joke and Iâ€™m only taking up space that could have been for someone else more popular, more intelligent, or more kind. The more I try to be those things, the more I realize Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m just a person, out of many millions. 

The more I think about the future, the more I realize that the sooner I end it all here, the better itâ€™ll be in the long run. No college debt, no worry about relationships, no need to impress anyone.
