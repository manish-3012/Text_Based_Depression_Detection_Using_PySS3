Im slowly pushing everyone me away im giving upThis is like my second post on reddit so I don't believe anyone will actually see this or even give a crap.

When I was 5 my mum left me and my 5 siblings (2 brothers, 3 sisters im the second youngest). She left because of my father. He cheated on her with many women. She knew he was abusive, drug addicted and a alcholic. She left regardless. I only saw her from time to time. The earliest memory I can think of is when my mum and dad were arguing. Now I'm 14 I no longer live with my dad and my mum is now back full time. But the damage has already been done. I've been self harming for 10 months I think. I have depression, anxiety, I can't control my anger and possibly PTSD. My anger has gotten me into a lot of trouble in the past and still does. I believe the only reason my "friends"  hang out with me because they're scared of me. My little sister (who recently came out as gay) told me that she wanted to tell me (that she was gay) a lot sooner but she kept thinking back to some stupid gay joke I made. If anyone has got this far than thanks I guess. If anyone one wants to hear more than DM  or whatever. This was written on mobile so sorry for any mistakes or whatever. Bye.
