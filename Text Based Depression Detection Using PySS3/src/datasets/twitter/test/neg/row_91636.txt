My life ended on Dec 31st 2015I was a pretty happily married man who struggled with drinking in moderation and have two lovely little children and a wife (now ex) who stood by me. 

I had problems communicating my issues and dug my head in the ground for the past few years hoping it would go away but it didn't. 
Communication broke down between us and I drank more. I isolated myself for months, then on New Year's Eve we had the fight that we both knew was the beginning of the end. 

Something inside me snapped that night, and I lost my sense of self ever since. 

I began to drink more, and went on a rampage with filthy online girls and paid them money until I was in so much debt. 

My wife left, and she tried to fix things, but I was too broken inside to even respond. 

It's been 5 months since the divorce has been final, and I'm here in our "Home" all alone and have been having very dangerous thoughts. 

I've cut myself a few times, don't know why, but I have, and more and more the options of fixing things in my life seem to disappear into the air. 
I'm too much of a coward to end my life, and I'm too much in love with my children and how this would affect them. 
But if I was able to cut myself, I'm worried I might easily tip over into a darker side of myself where I could in a moment of complete despair just take the short cut out. 

I'm terrified of my thoughts, of my feelings. I hate my life. And I hate who I have become. 

I have become a ghost of myself and feel as though I have died a year ago. I'm just a shell of who I was. 

What have I done? Why did I do this?

I'm so terrified of reaching out to anybody I know. Yet feeling so alone and isolated it's killing me inside. 

I'm sorry if this is too long or if I am supposed to say something particular to the sub but I honestly don't know where else to turn.
