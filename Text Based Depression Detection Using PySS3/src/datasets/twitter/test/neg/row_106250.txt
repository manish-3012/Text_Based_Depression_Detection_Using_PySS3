Last day, just wanted to say goodbye.Thanks to everyone on here who's said nice things. they haven't been in vain. unfortunately 99.99% of the people I've encountered don't like me, and seeing others in love and happy, when i can't be with the one i love, because he only sees me as a fuck buddy, makes life no longer worth living. 

I've fought a long hard battle and I'm giving in. I've been on the losing side even in spite of my constant striving to improve. truth is, if i'm not good enough for him, i dont see a point in anything. i'm messaging family now to let them know about my decision. they cant help me because i live in a remote location where they can't get to me.

Like all my suffering and lack of love and especially his love will now go away. if i can't be with him life isn't worth living. I finally feel at peace dreaming about not being here tomorrow. 


Edit: WOW no one cares??? Thanks... this makes it all that much easier.
