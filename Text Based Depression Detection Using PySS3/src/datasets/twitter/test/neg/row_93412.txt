I donâ€™t want to deal with this anymoreThere is so much shit going on in my brain and they should probably only be minimal problems but I just canâ€™t deal with them anymore. Everyday itâ€™s like I find a new reason to hate myself more, everyday itâ€™s a chore to get up and live - I get told to take things day by day but every fucking day there seems to be a mountain of things I donâ€™t want to wake up for. 

I hate feeling this way. I hate staring at my wardrobe, telling myself I can do it - feeling the relief that it sends through me. I donâ€™t want to hurt my family, I donâ€™t want to be in pain for my final moments but I donâ€™t want to wake up anymore. 

I was never built to cope with this world, I really canâ€™t. I want to leave but I know my method isnâ€™t foolproof and Iâ€™m fucking terrified of failure. But Iâ€™m also terrified of waking up.

All I ever wanted was to talk to someone and feel cared for. Iâ€™ve asked for help so many times and no one cares. And now I just cry every night, begging to anything that listens to not let me wake up the next day. 

I live because I cannot die, but it feels like thereâ€™s no other way now.
