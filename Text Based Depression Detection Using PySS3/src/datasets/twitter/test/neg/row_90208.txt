I'm having an episodeIt's been one year since I last wanted to die. I think I would have gone through with it, but I went into this weird catatonia...thing. I don't really understand it. I don't understand anything about my life. I've been mentally ill (is that the preferred term?) since I was a little kid, I've had severe anxiety and panic disorder with derealization and mild OCD and I developed depression in my mid-teens.

Why won't the depression just go away? It just hit me that I'll never be able to get off meds (I'm on SSRIs) because every time I do go off, I spiral. And why won't my parents talk to me about my childhood illness? I only remember it from a child's simplistic and patchy perspective, and I need need NEED to understand it as an adult. I don't think I'll ever get over what happened to me unless I get an adult perspective of what happened. I remember the days when I wouldn't eat because I thought my food was poisoned. I remember avoiding the restaurant by my house because I had a panic attack in one of the booths. But I remember so little.

I feel out of control. I know rationally I don't want to die. But my mind is shutting down except for that part of me. I can't think to my parents or my friends and how much they love me. I can't think to my future. My mind is running away from me, just like it did last year. I don't understand what's happening. I don't want to die. I'm scared.
