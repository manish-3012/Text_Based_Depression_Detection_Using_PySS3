Feeling like I'm coming to the end.I'm crying my eyes out right now. 

I just can't bring myself to do it but I dream for the day when I can put an end to it all. All my misery and everyone elses misery of my undeserving body being on this planet.


Tonight I've thought about doing it I tried to bring myself to do it I figure it's maybe 3-4 months away before I actually bring myself to doing it.

Uni is going shit. No job or girlfriend and obese as hell. I mean what hope does someone have like that? My 'friends' just use me for money/somewhere to crash. What life do I have? None. I just want it to end the only thing stopping me is the pain I imagine on my mothers face but I fear in a few months that won't be enough to stop it.
