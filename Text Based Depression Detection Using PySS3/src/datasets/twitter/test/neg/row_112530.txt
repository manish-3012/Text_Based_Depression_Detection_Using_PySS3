After almost a year of no longer cutting myself. Im in a worse spot than ever.All throughout high school cutting myself seemed like the best vice, I wasn't hurting anyone else so I didn't feel guilty. After three years of cutting one of my best friends found out and put it too a stop(she's the best). A few weeks later I met and eventually asked out my amazing gf, I had never been in love like that before, no one had ever made me care so much. So when she told me she had to move, I was crushed. To make a long story short she became incredible distant to the point where she would text people I was around(knowing we were together) and not answer me. We had been the best couple so I tried to make it work. She told me she would come to visit, but she never did, and when I asked when I could come down, she told me it would be too expensive. So I stopped kidding myself and broke up with her. A month later and she is still leading me on, telling me I'm the friend she wants to date and occasionally joking that its my fault because I made the move to end it. I still love her and she's an amazing person, but I feel fucking worthless. I've tried so hard to be a good person, and every fucking day it gets a little harder to get out of bed, I'm not even sad anymore and I've dealt with depression for a long time. But it feels like I'm living through life with fake smiles and hollow laughs, I've only been happy once, but looking back on it,even it was a lie. Cutting doesn't seem like it's enough anymore. Life is just disappointing me and I don't know how much I can take.
