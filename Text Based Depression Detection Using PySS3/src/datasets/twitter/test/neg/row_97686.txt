I've set a dateI managed to push away everyone that tried to care about me. I had been going through a rough year, with over 8 months of job applications and not a single call. I made some unwise decisions while at school - not 'bad', but unwise - and I'm paying for the choices I made at 14 into my adult life, with no way to fix it.  

In June of this year, I lost the one thing that I had been holding on to, and now everyone is trying their hardest to keep it away from me when I'm scratching and clawing to get back the one purpose I had. Everyone is holding it away, knowing that it's all I was living for, like they want me to lose all hope.  

I have subpar education, no extraordinary skills, no money, no work history, no hope, and only one way out. I'm an ordinary person living in a world where you need to be spectacular to get by.  

I don't want professional help, because that only leads to a life that I don't want to have. There are other people that want and need the help more than I do, and I don't want to take the resources away from them.  

This just isn't the world for me.
