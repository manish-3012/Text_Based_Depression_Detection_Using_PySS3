Love and HateFor the past three years, nearly every moment of my life has been stained with the desire to end it. I have mentally prepared myself to accept death and I am sure now, that I am more than capable of ending life on my terms. 

I've had a decent childhood, not unlike many people in the US, I had a loving family, friends and lived comfortably in my quiet hometown in Pennsylvania.

Fast forward to 2008, 18 years old, newly enlisted Into the Air Force Reserves. I was going places, my family could not have been more proud me. I was becoming a man, a vision of integrity and success. 

Three weeks after entering Lackland AFB for basic training, the migraines began, two weeks after that, I was no longer a part of the US Air Force. I was crushed, and defeated, my dream shattered. 

Now, I'm 19 years old, struggling with addiction to pills and alcohol. Nothing made me feel good anymore, I had no backup plan and had no useful skills to apply in the real world. It was at this point In my life that I fucked up. I don't want to go I to details, but I found myself in prison with a 2-4 year sentence and a felony on my record. I had already pushed away everyone I know with my habit and was as alone as anyone could possibly be. But somehow, I kept my head up and prepared for my release by educating myself. I learned how to fix stuff in prison and gained skills I could use in society. I learned a lot about myself and made it top priority to be a better person.

Now, its 2013, I'm finally free. My Father had gone out of his way to go d me a place to live and even paid for it until I got a job. But, after just a few days, I started to realize my plight was hopeless. Jobs don't exsist for felons, at least not the jobs that pay well enough to live on your own. Despite what my father had done for me, he had only done it out of obligation. Everyone was distant now, and I knew it was my fault for pushing them away, they had In effect, given up on me. I had nothing, no friends, family or an SO to rely on. I was completely alone and terrified. But still, I pressed on and worked hard to survive. I tried making new friends, but, it was too late. I was broken, I had become an introvert. 

People, I don't like them. Or, I'm afraid of them now. I don't remember how to forge connections with people, or how to carry a conversation. Most people think of me as slow or stupid because I rarely speak and treat me as such, further beating me down. I've worked so hard to try to make friends, but, Im no fun, so I'm left talking to a fucking spider in my fucking living room like it understands me. 

Now, its 2016. Everyday drags by in a blur of sadness, regret and confusion. Ive tried everything at this point from antidepressants, support groups, herbal remedies, excersizes and healthy eating, I've even tried hypnosis, which may not have worked, but I've learned how to fall asleep at will. I don't know who I am now, I have no reason to live, no will to move on. Everything seems hopeless and cold. I no longer enjoy playing music, my favorite hobby. My keyboard and guitar are expensive decorations. I feel so empty. No, religion doesn't appeal to me, and meditating only allows me to dig deeper Into the things I hate about myself. 

Life used to be magical, exciting and filled with the desire to explore it. Now, when I think about life, its like a cancer on my soul, if I even have one. I no longer care to live, but, I also want it back. I want all of it back. If even for a moment, to feel the warm embrace of a mother, or the joy of becoming a Husband, a Father and a friend. I'm afraid that Ive been irreparably broken, and I have no chance at all in regards to recovering who I was. 

Goodbye isn't so hard to say when you have no one to say it to. Today, I've decided the best way to go, is with a razor blade, and a little research into where and how to effectively cut. I am ready. The tiny spark of light in my heart is dying out and the darkness is threatening to enshroud my very soul. Please help me grow that light, teach me how to let it shine brightly again. I'm calling out to myself in the darkness and pleading me to come back. There is only silence and a chilling voice telling me my time is almost up. My heart beats, but, how many are left? Fate will decide that for me, I can only hope the Fate is kind.
