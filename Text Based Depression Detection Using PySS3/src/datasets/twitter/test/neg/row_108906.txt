I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreI suffer really bad from SAD (social anxiety disorder). So for me talking to people and social interactions is something that causes me to have super high anxiety. Lately about a month ago I lost a close what I would call a friend because Im a fucking idiot and always seem to say the wrong things. Anyways I feel like this sparked something in me and realized my Entire life has been an endless cycle of Loneliness. 

Every time I try and better myself my fucking social anxiety kicks in and pulls me in to stab me in the back.  I CANT even talk to people without going into shock or having a panic attack. 

I canâ€™t open up to people in real life either because of this mental block. Itâ€™s like trying to dig though a brick wall with only your hands.

Iâ€™m what? Almost 19 and Iâ€™m a completely broken mess of a person that canâ€™t even function in society. Ive never had someone that I could call a true friendship. It doesnâ€™t get better  it gets worse every single day. Every day I get a bit older, a bit more lonely, a bit more depressed and a bit more afraid to talk to people and Iâ€™m fed up with this. 

It killing slowly and the only thing holding me back is my family
