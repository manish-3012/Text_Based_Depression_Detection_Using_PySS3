I am too inferior to live. I should die.I am a genetic defect, a waste of space, a fucking leech, a parasite, an inferior lifeform. I am sub-human. I am even worse than other peoples' shit. Both of my parents are drug addicts, mental illness and developmental disabilities run in both of my families (aspergers, schizophrenia, you name it), my IQ is below average (I barely passed high school), my critical thinking/reasoning/interpersonal/assertive skills are shit, and I have absolutely no redeeming physical qualities (I am fat, ugly, and everything about me is just pure disgust.) 

I have been bullied and harassed by various people all throughout my life, including both students and teachers in 
middle and high school. I have never ever had a single friend or anybody who legitimately cared about me. I always felt like shit compared to everybody else around me.

There are people my age who have graduated college and are making a life for themselves and their loved ones. There are people younger than me who are more ambitious, intelligent, beautiful, intuitive, and optimistic than I am. They are the ones who should exist and reap life's benefits. I should not. 

The world is already overpopulated as it is, and we are already at the point where some humans have to be sacrificed for the greater good. After much contemplation, I have finally determined that I am one of those humans who need to die. Sacrifice is necessary for growth and survival. 

As a genetic defect, I do not have the right to pass my defective genes and bad personality traits onto any other living creature. I do not want anybody else to suffer the same as I. I am posting here just to accomplish the one milestone that I could actually reach with my existence - create a physical proof that I actually did exist. In some strange way, I have some odd desire to leave my mark on the world, even if I know I can't contribute to its greater good and development. It's probably the result of my genetic defects and inferior thinking ability. 

I am currently in my room and very close to death. (Don't want to discuss any specific method as apparently it is against the rules here.) Let's just say that one quick decision can ultimately end my life. What should I do?
