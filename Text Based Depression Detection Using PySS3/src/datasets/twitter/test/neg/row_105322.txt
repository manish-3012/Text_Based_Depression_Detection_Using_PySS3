Today was my 35th birthdayYes, this is a novelty account. Figured I'd start one for those times when I can't post under my own name. I turned 35 today, and for no particular reason, I'm tempted to chase several beers with all the pills I have on hand. It seems like such an easy, peaceful way to just not wake up tomorrow. I'm not going to do it, I have a family who need me, and most of the time I love my life and am not suicidal. Whaddaya think Reddit? Normal birthday malaise? Midlife crisis? Mental disfunction? Do I just need to get over myself?
