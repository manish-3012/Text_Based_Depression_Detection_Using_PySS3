i dont know how to make it through the rest of today.my dad is a recovering alcoholic- or, was. he started drinking in june, dropped it a month or so ago, and im quite sure heâ€™s picked it up again. he drank heavily for 20+ years, and was clean for 10 years before his recent relapse. the thing is, he canâ€™t afford to pick up drinking again. he was supposed to die in the hospital one day when he had pancreatitis but through some miracle, he didnt. but he wouldnt survive 
today i realized he started drinking again. i canâ€™t handle it. today everything is fucking with me. 
i have 0 friends around, the only person i have is my boyfriend (who is amazing btw) but we argue so fucking badly sometimes.
my friend killed herself in april, and ever since then iâ€™ve seen signs of her and even though youâ€™d think it would help, it doesnâ€™t. 
all iâ€™ve thought about the past couple weeks is offing myself, even while iâ€™m at work all day. i feel like iâ€™m too ugly, awkward, weird, anxious and sensitive for this world. iâ€™ve been the outcast since fucking elementary school. 
i want friends so bad, but they just donâ€™t want me. 
i feel like a waste guys. i canâ€™t even go get help without losing my job or my family. fuck everything. i need help.
