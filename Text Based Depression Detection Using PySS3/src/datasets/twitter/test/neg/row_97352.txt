I canâ€™t keep doing thisDad: why are you suicidal :( I want you to live
Also my dad: yells at me for getting absents in class, yells at me for not clean the bathroom to his standards, is over all a bitchy person because work is treating him like shit so he needs to push it on to me.

Look, I love my dad I really do. And heâ€™s often a good person. I donâ€™t have as big of a story as other people here. But, my friend, only have the one, is always busy, school is kicking my ass but my grades are good so who fucking cares, Iâ€™m on like 3 different medications and when I try to tell my doctor one of my biggest fears is being on a bunch of meds and never getting better guess what she said!?! 
3 medications isnâ€™t actually that many.

I hate it here
