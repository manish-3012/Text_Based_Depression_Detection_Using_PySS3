I'm just so tired.After trying all kinds of mental exercises and medicines i still constantly think about ending my own life, im in a relationship where i feel drained emotionally, im in a long distance relationship and she never seems to want to talk to me. When ever i bring it it up i become this needy jerk who wants all of her time. Im just tired of fighting this losing battle with myself, my grades, and my girlfriend who just seems to want to talk when she has a problem. It just seems so bleak.
