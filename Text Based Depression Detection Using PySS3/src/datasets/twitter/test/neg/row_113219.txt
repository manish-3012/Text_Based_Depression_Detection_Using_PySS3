Still not seeing any particular pointHowdy, I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/31fkh4/ive_wanted_to_kill_myself_for_10_years_ive_been/) a while ago, tried to rally, find a job and overcome, but pretty much everything's been shit.

I've finished up my Dad's will, so I've effectively fulfilled the only thing I was needed for, and despite the hurt it would cause, suicide seems deeply attractive. I'm just such a useless person. I don't want to be around, like I said, I'm so tired. I told one of my friends offhand "living is something I do out of habit, rather than any great passion for it".

Don't know why I'm posting here actually, I'm actually kinda done.
