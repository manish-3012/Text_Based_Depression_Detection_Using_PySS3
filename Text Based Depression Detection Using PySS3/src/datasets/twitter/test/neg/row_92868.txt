I think I suffer from so-called "Pure O" and I have contemplated killing myself for the past days (X-post from OCD)Hello all, I am a soon to be 18 year old male. So I have had some psychological problems before, I once had severe sleeping problems for about half a year and I've been obsessed about my eyes, that I would go blind and stuff like that.

However, this past week, I have suffered from intense thoughts like "what if I would rape my cousin". Just typing it out makes me sick to my stomach and I just want to die. My cousin is 6 years old and the best kid in the entire world, and I would NEVER do anything to hurt him. Even so, his name keeps coming back to me and I have this picture of me kissing him. It is fucking sick. My normal sex drive is completely gone and I suffer from great anxiety. I do not want to celebrate christmas with my family.

I also read that people with Pure O try to "prove" to themselves that they aren't crazy by actually comitting the act. My cousin is coming here over New Year's Eve and I just don't want to meet him, I feel so guilty. I am also afraid that I will do something awful to him. I keep telling myself that I would never but then my thoughts respond "yeah, you would, that's why you are thinking like this".

I've struggled with sexuality before, I am homosexual and have been a "late bloomer" in puberty, leading to insecurity and anxiety. But this time it isn't about me and I can't seem to stop thinking about it. I don't want to talk to anyone in my family about this.

Is there ANYTHING to do? Am I crazy or a pedophile? Can I celebrate christmas as usual? I just cry when I face my thoughts and I honestly kind of want to die.

I'd really appriciate help, if possible. Please have a nice Christmas the rest of you!
