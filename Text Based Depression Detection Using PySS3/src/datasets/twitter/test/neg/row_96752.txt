I really don't see another way out of thisI'm in such a mess right now that I am not really seeing any alternatives.

I lost my job last week. I don't have any savings as I was living paycheck to paycheck (and sometimes it didn't last the whole week) and leaving my job was unexpected. I have several loans from those sleazy little places which have me stretched to the limit, plus my car payment and the usual utilities.

What makes it all so sucky is that I was so close to closing on a home equity loan that would have saved me. Now that's caput unless I find a cosigner. I don't really have any friends or family so that's not going to happen.

All anyone tells me is get a job get a job get a job. I'm fucking trying, people. I've sent out 12 resumes so far. Places like Walmart or Kroger won't hire me because I have no experience and I'm really HR.

I think I can get by until the end of the week. Maybe. I have no one to help. All I have are my cats.

In really thinking of planning for Saturday. I have a lot of my prescription pills saved up. Is this worthwhile? I've tried to overdose twice before and just would up in the er. The second time I was unresponsive, but they pulled me out.

Maybe carbon monoxide would be better. I know that something has to happen Saturday.
