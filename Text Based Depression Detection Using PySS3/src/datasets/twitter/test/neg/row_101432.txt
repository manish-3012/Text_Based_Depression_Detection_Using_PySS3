mmm it's lateIm so tired. I want to gauge my eyes out and rip off my skin. Im so heavy. I have so much work to do and it is crushing me. I can't imagine myself getting better. Nobody understands, I cant explain it well. It feels like torture. I tried counselling but got nothing out of it. It always gets worse and I dont feel like a human anymore. I feel like i'm going insane. I have lost all my passion, any emotion that was real. Everything is dull. I have been powering through, ignoring everything but it always eats me. What's the point of keeping going if this is what it always comes back to. Nothing in my life is worth living for. I had so much potential. I was so happy and capable. I knew who I was and loved myself for it. I am nothing anymore. I am just a lost soul who has been suffering with herself for so long. I can't get better. Nothing works. Maybe it will stop if I die. I want to feel my life ending. Make reality match my mind. I just want to get rid of it. I wish I could chose another life.
