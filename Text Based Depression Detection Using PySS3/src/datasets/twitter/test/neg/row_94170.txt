All my fault but do i really deserve this punishment?Sooo i never thought of sucide but some deep shit just went down and it can't be un done,fucking hell i can't even type right now without feeling guilty.I don't think i'll resort to sucide now but it really seems like the only way out of this shit hole i'm in.Soo..in my house are 4 people including me.My father,mother,older brother and then me.I'm the one who shouldn't be there,i don't fit in well,the only person i can talk to is my mom but she works too much and i can't talk to her in private all that much,I feel like she's the only one who understands me but even she was the one today who went like "it was your fault" so i believe her,my dad wants everything his way,i try to do what he says but i end up failing.If he sees me playing video games or doing something on the computer that isn't productive he commands me to get the fuck off.My brother is my older brother and he somehow has the right to hit me because he's older,that's the thing in our family.Good thing my dad hasn't hit my mom yet because he's older,i'd rip the guy's head off.I'm not weak,i did get in physical fights with my brother and did scare off my dad because he didn't wanna get hit when we got in little fights,My mom told me to bite my tounge and do the bullshit they call "turn the other cheek" and not get in fights with them because after all they're older.The way it always starts off is by disagreement on little things and my dick of a brother has an ego problem of he's always right and if you argue/talk shit you get hit,and that is acceptable to my dad,speaking of my dad,he comes from a family of 7 siblings,5 brothers 2,sisters,he never got along with any of them really.I don't say stuff like "you could have done better" because i know what he's gone through and if i do he would commit sucide,or something close to that.This family is broken and all because of me,i said earlier my brother has an ego problem but now i believe them when they say i have an ego problem,i gotta always throw my 2 cents in(or whatever they say) I'm in an east Asian family where moving out isn't the option to make your family proud but right now i don't even give a shit about them,only one i care about is my mom she's the one i would actually support and send money to if i get a job.Jesus christ,what the fuck am i writing,must be cringe worthy,Ok so that was the background of my family and now we can get to what happended today:We got chromecast on our TV,i had the phone in my hand to watch whatever the fuck i want on the TV,phone was on 4% and connected to the charger near the corner of the couch,my brother asks me to give him the phone about 3 or 4 times and then kicks me(he was laying down so you can imagine what that would look like) and then i respond(i was just out of the zone for a few seconds),so since i didn't respond to him saying my name and asking me for the remote the first time,i was at fault according to my family(even my mom) i admit i was wrong there,i shouldn't have ignored him saying my name 3 or 4 times and i should've responded but i didn't,we go inside our rooms,don't talk.Dad comes home,everythings peaceful,until he calls my brother from his room and he doesn't come,he doesn't come because he's pissed at the incidence where i was at fault.My dad just fucking starts yelling at him and me and tells me to not talk to him and him to no talk to me,because according to him that works and solves all the fights,i argue with him to preserve my integrity and he just says "i don't fucking want you"(not directly in english but thats the translation of what he said) "i just wanna get rid of you","i told you a million times and it just doesn't work" so that hit me real hard,i have a feeling to quit it all and i don't think that will ever go away,nor am i talking to him again to be honest.There is that side of me which just wants me to exclude myself from those 3 because i start fights in this house,and there is the other side of me which cares about my mom and what she would think of looking at my dead corpse,My dad once told her to not talk to me and then left,i still talked to her because i'm not really scared of him when he's gone and she said that she loves me more than him and is willing to leave him for me anyday,Of course they didn't split up or divorce it was just her way of telling me how much she loves me.Summary:I live in a family where hitting of someone younger is allowed if he makes the older person angry(which is possible since the elders say some crazy/stupid shit),my mom is the only one i love in this family,i'm the odd one out,i start shit,i really don't belong with them.What can be the logical thing to do? My dad did say "i don't want you i tried everything with you" like do i really deserve that? I said im not weak earlier but i really am,i can't even think of doing it but i just wanna quit somehow.Just anyway.
