Idk manSome people come out of acid/shroom trips trying to conquer the world but I just come out trying to leave it.. Honestly I get in these moods where Iâ€™m just numb mentally and actually feel like going through with something. Itâ€™s crazy to me. I also know that this is probably the happiest Iâ€™ll ever be, I have everything I want and know deep down I got nothing to prove to nobody. For the most part I want to live life because I feel like Iâ€™m being trolled and the sunsets are always beautiful but hey.
