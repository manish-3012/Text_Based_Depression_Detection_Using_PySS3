Another year alive, my promise is almost complete.So, if you go through my post history you'll see I posted about a year ago. This is going to be another long post full of self-pity and self-loathing. I'm not the most talented writer, but feel free to laugh with me or at me.

I'm 34 now, I can't believe I've made it this long. I REALLY hate life. I do not recall ever requesting to be born, if I did I surely wasn't old enough to make that decision when I did. I know no one ever gets to "choose" whether or not they're born and that's just the very first example of life being inherently unfair. You neither get to choose to be born, and society damn sure doesn't want you to choose when you die.

Before I digress too much let me get back on track. You now know my age, that I hate my life, and probably have put together the fact that I want to die. It won't be this week or next, but soon a promise I made will have been kept, I will not agree(even if it's on her deathbed) to further extend my life. 

When I was younger my mother discovered a close family friend who had committed suicide by shotgun, I don't know whether it was the gruesome scene that stuck with her or the fact that the family friend had made the decision to end his life unilaterally and didn't allow anyone to act to prevent him from doing so that stuck with her, but I promised as long as I had a roof over my head and she was alive that I would not go through with any plans. 

Fortunately(for me) my mother is nearing the end of her life. A few years ago she was diagnosed with Acromegaly, basically a tumor grows on the pituitary gland and causes excessive amounts of HGH to enter the blood stream. It doesn't cause too much damage on its own, but it caused enough problems that she had to have it biopsied. She was also diagnosed with Lupus. 

She's a strong woman, no it's not an oedipus complex or anything. She was a single mom who raised my brother and I virtually alone. My father was around but was never much of a father. He cheated on her, they divorced. She went back to school and became a nurse and despite growing up in(and continuing to exist in) poverty I know that I was loved. 

Because of her, I've avoided most of the major pitfalls in life-drugs, tobacco, gambling, alcohol addiction. I've got a borderline addiction with computer gaming, but I frequently go weeks without touching the computer just to prove to myself that I can.

Anyway I was not the best student. I was too smart for my own good. I always HATED teachers who used to assign tons of homework and say "If you don't do my homework, you won't pass my tests." 

Don't get me wrong, I get why homework is given-I always have, it's just I always took that statement as a challenge and I accepted it if the subject was not one of particular interest to me. 

Long story short, I wouldn't do the homework, WOULD pass their tests, ace their finals/midterms and end up passing with a low-mid 70's grade. Towards the end of High School I finally grew up a bit and realized that my stubbornness was only hurting myself, and would not cause the teachers to be honest. I did better in my junior year, and made high honor roll for my entire junior year and the first half of my senior year. Sadly, the damage had already been done and my transcript made me look like an idiot. 

Thankfully, I had never really envisioned college in my long term plans. Back in the 7th or 8th grade there was this test called the Occupational Outlook Handbook which was supposed to help you figure out what you wanted to do with your life. 

I never enjoyed computer programming. I had a buddy that was in to that, the closest I ever got to coding was back when I had an old Tandy and had that spiral bound notebook where you had to manually enter the code for the games BEFORE you could play them. I wish I took more enjoyment from coding, but I've always enjoyed building and troubleshooting them. 

I remember saving up and ordering an AMD K6 166mhz processor, buying the parts and building my first system. First teaching myself what goes where and how everything connected.

 Then firing it up and learning post errors and FINALLY getting it to start up, learning how to format a HDD and install DOS, Windows, an old game Fokker, eventually I got a hold of a game called Descent. Anyway, long story short I LOVED that stuff. 

So when I took this test and it told me about the wonderful opportunities for PC Repair Technicians and the impressive salary(45-60,000 a year) that technicians were supposed to make I was sold. Getting paid to do what you love, that's every mans dream, right?

So, I planned High School out to situate myself to get into the workforce as a technician. My city had this program called BOCES which prepared students for a career right out of high school. They had a ton of different programs from Electricians, Electronics repair, automotive repair, CIS programs, nursing programs, they had a TON of programs. Naturally I saw the CIS program and jumped at the opportunity. My Junior year I began taking CIS I, which sadly was basically a joke. It was a course teaching people how to use Microsoft Office(Word, Excel, Powerpoint, some Access). It seemed more like a course designed to train secretaries and "Executive Assistants" but whatever I was learning something about computers. I was not exactly thrilled, especially when my brother went through the program a year before me and was learning about AS400 systems and windows servers. 

I was told when I finally asked about this towards the end of the year that "some of that" would be covered in year 2 of the program. I was pissed, but then something happened I never expected. My senior year was coming ahead and the school announced that next year they'd be piloting a one-year program called "A+ Computer Repair". I was like a kid in a candy store when I found out. 

I signed up and was(no exaggeration) the best student in the class. I graduated with a perfect score, I'd sometimes skip regular school and stay there to do a double class some days just to learn more. 

I would be sent to other classes that were having computer problems to fix their shit-I once saved a paper a Finish program(single mothers finishing high school) student had on a floppy disk that was corrupted(her 3.5" disk was failing). 

I opened the file in edit and copied/pasted all that I could into a new file on the HDD. The girl was hot as hell and was so grateful she didn't know how she could ever thank me enough. I felt like a hero and a pig for having a response in my mind that I'd never dare speak. On that day I felt like I was made to do that kind of work.

So I graduated High School on schedule in the year 2001 with a somewhat crappy GPA(except this program where I had 4 quarters of 100+'s). I took my certification exam, got certified and I went out to search for those lucrative "PC Repair Technician" jobs I was told were coming and were going to be in such high demand.

Ok, so not very many available in/around Buffalo, NY. I did what I had to do to get some experience and earn some cash. I took a job at one of the first "Outsourcing Technical Support" companies, a crappy company called ClientLogic. They handled support for a bunch of different companies from Sony to Iomega to Netzero. I was hired on at Sony. 

I put in the time there, hating it. I was making 8.25 an hour and it wasn't about solving problems, it was about getting people off the phone in under 8 minutes. Call after call of being yelled at, being told how shitty Sony products were. I wasn't just supporting sony PC's, I was supporting their WebTV products, their TV's, DVD players, DSS receivers, and yes their VAIO PC's and laptops. I grew to hate my job, but I was earning experience. Until...

One day I showed up for work and was told they were relocating their operations and closing down their call center. It turns out they were moving to India or the Bahamas, I don't remember- I just remember that was my first encounter with "outsourcing" and "globalization."

So I moved on and found another(better) job working for an ISP called Adelphia. Long story short I was hired during the beginning of their bankruptcy process. I was told I'd have job security and would be doing technical support with an opportunity to advance through the company.

I did the job and got great performance reviews and helped a lot of customers. Every so often I'd get some crappy supervisor who'd tell me "It's not your responsibility to fix that, you need to transfer those calls to tier 2". I was only in tier 1, we were classified as "reboot monkeys" by the tier 2's/3's. I refused to wear that label so I fixed everything I could. 

I'd argue with my supervisors, who'd wonder how I managed to keep my AHT so low(so I could earn my bonus) and go so far beyond. Well, I'm not saying I was a great employee, my phone had a lot of problems with calls randomly "dropping". One 15 minute call and 1 2 second call creates an AHT of 7:30. I justified it to myself by reminding myself that when I was hired I was told that my job would be to help customers resolve their internet connectivity problems. I was also told that I'd have the opportunity to advance.

Long story short, after 3 years the company was sold off to Time Warner and Comcast and split. Our "secure" jobs now weren't. I walked out the day they rebranded us from Tier 1 Support to CCRHSIT1. CCR standing for Customer Care Representative. 

Along with the re-branding came a new QA policy, if I failed to offer to take a credit card payment at the beginning of EVERY call I'd get a Zero QA(which DQ'd me from my bonus for the month and would get me a disciplinary warning/write up). I said to my supervisor "Fuck this, I was hired as technical support not just customer service. I refuse to ask people for money when the service they're already paying for isn't working". 

I walked out and about 15 others did as well. Later that day I got a call from that same supervisor offering me my job. The TAC shut down a year later. I was now unemployed and job hunting. I managed to get unemployment by arguing that the position they hired me for no longer existed and I lost my job due to the transition to Time Warner. So I was looking for a new job, and not finding any. There were no computer repair technician jobs to be found.

In 2005 I came out to Las Vegas to see what it was all about and opened the "help wanted" section of the paper and saw...jobs.

Needless to say after this I moved to Las Vegas, where I've lived since December of 2006. I quickly found a job after moving with a Tradeshow Technology Rental company. There wasn't a ton of "PC Repair" work, but there was a lot of customizing machines, imaging, on-site networking. I got to do some traveling on the companies dime. It was a cool gig. 

I was promoted to Weekend Operations Lead, a SMALL raise along with the added responsibility of overseeing local weekend operations. I was happy.

And then the national economy tanked. The company only made 1.6 million in profit that year instead of the 1.9 million from the year before. The head of the company decided he wanted out of the industry and sold the company to a competitor. Just like that I was unemployed again. Only now the economy was in the shitter and there were no jobs to be had. 

I had to sell my place and move back in with my mother. Even though my place was next door to hers(yes, a trailer) I couldn't afford the lot-rent without a job, so I sold it off. Yeah, good luck trying to date when you're approaching 30, unemployed, and live with your mom. 

Finally, a friend from that past job got me an opportunity at a major casino doing IT Support for the Hotel and Casino(hint, their symbol is a giant Guitar). The pay was nowhere near the 45-60k a year I was promised but it was better than any job I'd had before($18/hour). 

There were tons of new systems and technology to familiarize myself with. I had to learn so much, and I did. IDF locations, Virtual Servers and machines, network monitoring, active directory, the IBM i5 system, and so much more. About 9 months later in early December of 2012 I was called in on my day off along with 4 other employees.

We were told that the new VP of Operations was hired earlier in the year and has decided that the IT department didn't need to be manned 24 hours a day. As such the budget would be slashed significantly. That means personnel cuts. That means we're out of our jobs. Don't worry about the chaos that happens when the night club can't process all of their credit card transactions at 3am because one of them is "stuck". Don't worry about the hell that happens when the print server crashes at 3am and NOBODY can print in the entire hotel/casino. But that's ok, because the new VP gets to say that she cut 150+ grand in annual unnecessary costs in the IT department.

No severance package for me(because I wasn't there for over a year), no unemployment either(I was only there about 9 months). And that's when I gave up.

I realized then that there's no longer such a thing as employer-employee loyalty. Gone are the days where you can expect to hold a job for 30 years and then retire. How sad is that, my goal in life was to work for some place at a modest wage, be a good little wage slave and then retire. I couldn't even be granted that dignity. Nope.

Our society's become a place where the only people that have any sense of job security are the people at the top or those who make themselves indispensable to a company. IT support is an industry where that's just not possible. Now you've got entire companies outsourcing their IT to MSO's. Who do everything in their power to drive down the wages. 

So I said fuck it, and I haven't had a job since. I refused to be a part of a system that would use me and discard me like a dixie cup. Secretly I wanted a comet to kill me and put me out of my misery.

I refused to get a job. My mother had an injury and went on workers comp, I still refuse to get a job). She insisted everything be put in my name(so if/when she gets sick and needs hospice they can't force her to sell it). This also means she can't throw me out, because everything on paper belongs to ME. 

I don't defend this, I know I'm being selfish and childish and risking homelessness. They've stopped her workers comp(her lawyer's fighting to get her comp for life, so the insurance company is playing hardball). 

She's worried about not being able to pay the rent and winding up homeless. That would suck, but I don't care. I refuse to be a part of that system. I told her long ago that I wouldn't end my life as long as I had a roof over my head and she was alive. That's it.

We're now living off of her Social Security Disability. A little over 1,100 a month. Rent, utilities, car payment, insurance. SNAP and Medicaid. 

If her comp doesn't get restored soon, I imagine the first thing to go will be my car and the insurance. Then we should be able to get by, barely. As for utilities, we have Cox, I have a phone, she has a safelink minute phone, and we qualified last year for LI-HEAP. 

If the worst case happens and we end up facing eviction she can move back to NY with her friend. I'll just use that 80-grain .40 cal S&amp;W that I've got stored in my safe. I've told her as much. 

I've been to counseling, but I refuse to even try anti-depressants. On the permit to carry concealed weapons there's a question "Do you currently or have you ever taken Anti-Depressants". Answering yes to that denies you from being issued a permit.

Additionally, there's been a lot of push and talk about disarming people who are on anti-depressants. They also take away your firearms if you're ever taken in on a 5150 hold. 

My firearm is a part of my "Exit strategy" it's elaborate and it insures that the police will find me, not some random housekeeper. If I ever get taken in on a 5150 or lose my firearms another way I'll have to switch to plan B which involves turning a firing range into a bloody mess and traumatizing a bunch of people. Removing my firearm wouldn't stop me, I'm smart enough to know how to gain access to one legally. 

Anyway, I talked to a therapist back in 2014 and laid all this out to her and explained that I am suicidal, but not imminently so(so she isn't required to call 911)because of the promise I made to my mother. Her response "If something ever happens to your mom, you should give me a call and we'll get you some help". Are you fucking kidding me, does she think I'm an idiot? I'm telling her I want to die, but won't as long as she's alive and you think I'm going to call you when she dies so you can have me committed-so the police can take my weapons and the doctors can force-feed me pills and evaluate me until I can convince them I'm not a risk to myself. 

She insulted my intelligence, and I called her out on it and told her as much. She smiled...wtf?

A few sessions later, she tells me I should "go get a job to let my mind focus on other things". As if it wasn't the never-ending pattern of getting a job/losing said job to no fault of my own that put me in this headspace. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. I'm out. I haven't went back since. 

So now here I am, my mom's health's deteriorating, every day I wake up knowing my mom's one day closer to passing away. I love her dearly and have honored and will continue to honor the promise I made. 

Having said that I will not be granting any deathbed pleas she may make. I know she wants me to go on living, but I don't want to live in this world. 

Even before Trump got elected president I didn't like where this country and the world in general were headed. I didn't like that I was constantly shamed for having my so called "white privilege" even though I grew up just as poor as possible.

Even though I watched less-qualified applicants get jobs because of affirmative action. Only for those applicants to quit or get fired a week later and see the same job opening back up. I didn't like that globalization and automation were utterly decimating jobs, leading to staggering levels of unemployment(and the creation of a class of people like myself who have been unemployed for so long we're now excluded from the unemployment percentage). Those jobs that remained after automation and globalization are now so heavily in demand by applicants fresh out of school or recently unemployed that wages have become a race to the bottom. A culture has been created where we should "just be grateful to have a job" even though the jobs suck, the pay sucks, the benefits suck, you're constantly under threat of being terminated by terrible bosses. 

I hate that it seems like I want my mother to die. I don't, I love her dearly. I just refuse to be another cog in the machine called "society". I wish we lived in a world with an implemented UBI, so I could actually just focus on enjoying my life or doing something with my life and time instead of hating myself for being alive. 

I realize my behavior is that of a damn parasite. 

Let's talk "romance and sex life" for a moment, I've had 1 girlfriend in my entire life. She was my first everything, she also cheated on me and I was dumb enough to take her back about 6 different times over our 3 years together. 

Eventually she got pregnant by another guy, that's when we finally ended it for good. I've had sex in total with about 7 different woman in my life. 5 of which were prostitutes. I'm no Brad Pitt. I'm fat, have a hunchback(from having to walk home while lugging about 50 pounds of books every night during my freshman/sophmore years of high school.) Oh about those prostitutes I mentioned, I once disgusted a prostitute to the point where she made a sound indicating she was repulsed when I sweat on her face during the missionary position. Not saying that was traumatizing, but for fuck sake. 

I realize that many of you may be judging me, some may be laughing at me, and others may have platitudes to offer to try and cheer me up, I appreciate you reading all of this, I realize it's been a giant wall of text with no TL;DR. Having said that, I don't think anything you have to say will help. 

You may think I need anti-depressants, and maybe according to some doctors I do. Then again maybe I'm just an example of a genetic mutation that should be removed from the gene pool of our species.
