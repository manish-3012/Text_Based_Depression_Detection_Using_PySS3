I was just starting to get my life back togetherI have been in a severe depression for years, I was just starting to get out and be social again, hell I even lost my virginity a couple of months ago, things were looking up. Then they break up with me, the Coronavirus epidemic hits and all social events or gatherings are closed, and you canâ€™t date or go anywhere, and the stock market crashes and all my friends are starting to lose their jobs. I am so starved for the most simple human touch, every night I cry myself to sleep clutching my pillow desperately wishing I had someone here for me, and with the pandemic potentially lasting more than 18 months there is no hope of things getting any better for the foreseeable future. It looks like society is going to completely collapse or this country is going to go full-blown fascist. If there is a god he is cruel and hates me, I just wonder what I have done to deserve this. I just want someone to hold me and tell me everything is going to be ok
