Couldn't go thru with it, but I still might. Had a stupid question.So I'd got the noose tied, put it on, and tried to man up and go through with it, but only was able to lean forward a bit until I started feeling some pressure on my neck.  Tried this a few times but then chickened out every time, couldn't follow through.

I'm kinda a weird one, so my biggest question is...does this count as a suicide attempt?  Or is it only an attempt if you try to fully 100% go through with it and fail?  Just asking on the off chance I don't fully go through with it for the rest of tonight and I have to describe to a doctor later on if I actually "attempted suicide" before or not.

Yeah, this is the kind of thing my brain dwells on.
