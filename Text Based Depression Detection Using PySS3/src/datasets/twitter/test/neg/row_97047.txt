Existence is so dumb that I want to dieLike...I think I may be experiencing some manic dissociation right now, but, just the very fact that all my life is. is what I experience and remember makes me want to kill myself. I'll never be able to revisit 5 seconds ago in real time, nor will I get to jump ahead and see what's poppin' there. All I have is now. And for some reason, that makes me want to die, like, right now. 

I just had deja vu after writing that last paragraph. Something important is going to come from me posting this, maybe. 

Anyway, just noticing the way existence and conciousness its-very-self feels makes me feel so gross that I want to die. It almost feels so synthetic and surreal the more you pay attention to it. 

Nothing feels real, but then, real and unreal are, as far as we know, concepts of our being anyway. The very rules of the universe and logic and the words I'm using to say what I'm trying to say are all relative at the end of the day. This deeply bothers me. 

Why bother existing here? What if there's a better existence in another dimension? Why bother going on if this life of mine could have possibly played out infinite times before? Life is quite possibly just a game of senses, higher conscious-memory, and manufactured reality that just infinitely loops and defies our idea of time. 

Or I'm losing my mind and everything is real and I'm wasting time I could be using to make myself a happier person. 

Honestly, even if that's true, killing myself is just so much easier than spending the next decades being a person. I could slit my wrist with my X-acto in the bath, I could swallow every pill in my apartment and see which kills me first, I could stick a knife in a wall socket, buy a toaster from Wal-Mart and drop that in the bath...it could be so easy...nobody is here to stop me...

...except me. I just can't bring myself to do it. Why the fuck do I choose to be alive? Life is so dumb. Existence is dumb. It feels weird, and only really feels "real" when your not actually paying attention to it. 

I don't know. I'm gonna jerk off and sleep this off. Maybe I won't want to kill myself tomorrow. Or if I do, I'll stay trapped in this existential hell I keep myself in by instinctual obligation because I'm a weak piece of shit.
