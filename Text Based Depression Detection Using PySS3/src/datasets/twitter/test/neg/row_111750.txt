Itâ€™s torture to exist.I donâ€™t want it to get better. Seriously, I do not. I just want it to be over with. With death, there isnâ€™t any uncertainty for me. Poof, youâ€™re gone, no more pain even if there isnâ€™t any possibility of joy or happiness after itâ€™s over. I donâ€™t care about that, I just want to be gone.

Iâ€™m tired. I donâ€™t want to talk about it getting better. I donâ€™t want that encouragement or support because itâ€™s not something Iâ€™m receptive to. The world is a shitty place for so many people. Life has honestly been too fucking much to deal with since I was a child all the way until now, at age 22. I donâ€™t have a gun to kill myself. I donâ€™t have the access to buy one. I canâ€™t access or afford the drugs to guarantee a fatal overdose. I have a belt, but even with research, the possibility of succeeding is low when I have people who could find me in time. I feel so trapped because of all of this. I just want to leave this world and life behind.
