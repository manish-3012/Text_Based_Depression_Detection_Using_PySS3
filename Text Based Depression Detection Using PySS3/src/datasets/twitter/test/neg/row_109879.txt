I hate that people say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problemI might be in a temporary problem right now, sure, but my life is filled with temporary problems. Every three months a my self worth drops a thousand and it takes so much time and effort to do anything. Eventually things get better, but I know that something else will happen and in a few short weeks life will be hard to continue. I don't want to kill myself because of the situation I'm in ruby now, I want to kill myself because I know no matter what I do, my life will be filled with situations that make me want to kill myself and there will be no stopping them for the rest of my life. Suicicde is a permanent solution to all problems.
