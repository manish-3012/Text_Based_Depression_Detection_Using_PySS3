Not finding happiness in anythingI haven't been happy since my girlfriend and I of 2 years broke up a while back ago. I cannot for the life of me find anything that makes life worth living and I really don't know why I'm trying. I wish I could feel the same way I felt when I was with her but now she's off fucking some gross incel dude and I just want my life back. I genuinely just want to stop always being miserable, there's nothing waiting for me after misery. There's nothing. No pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, so I want to be done.
