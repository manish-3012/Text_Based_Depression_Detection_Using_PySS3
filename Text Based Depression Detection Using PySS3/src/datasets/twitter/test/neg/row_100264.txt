My kids are the only thing that's keeping me goingI can't imagine not seeing them grow up. I can't hurt them. They are the only reason keeping me from lying down for good. I think I can help them and be positive in their lives. But it is so so hard. Everything else feels empty and bad and hurts. There's also fear I guess. I just wanted to get this off my chest. I'd hoped it would help. Good luck to everyone.
