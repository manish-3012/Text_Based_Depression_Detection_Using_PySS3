It doesn't get better.Im not a native English speaker so please forgive me any grammar inaccuracies. Straight to the point - it doesn't get better. It doesn't even stay the same way. It only gets worse every year, month, day. I am only 23 but I tried changing many things - I tried living in 3 different countries, I tried cutting my friends off and living by myself (no wonder I lost them after I realized it doesn't help) then I tried to be super enthusiastic towards the other people. I tried hitting the gym, I tried to develop a passion, I tried to find a girlfriend (never worked out, I did not even handle hands with any girl in my entire life). I am still going to the psychiatrist, meds dont help me at all, I dont believe in a God or in any kind of the afterlife. I dont feel any support from my family and as I have mentioned before due to me being a person that you just cant stand after knowing me for a while I have no friends. I don't have a plan on what else I can do, what more crazy than living in 3 different countries in a such short lifespan I can even do. I feel like I tried to change everything (my body, mindset, friends, love life situation, living area) and it was only getting worse... It's hard for me to believe that there is anything I can possibly do to make my life better after so many fails. And it's also harder for me to even want to do that. Euthanasy is illegal and I feel like failed suicide attempt might be worse than my current life. Why am I forced to live when so many people would like to live and they are about to die? I am willing to trade my life for the life of someone who wants to live. It would be a really fair trade for both sides but its impossible. I dont even know, I am mad, I am dissapointed with myself, I want to die but it is hard for me to believe that I can succesfully kill myself.
