Intending to kill myself tomorrowI meant to kill myself today with charcoal, I went out and bought everything I need except the charcoal itself because the only store that I know has it nearby was closed before I could reach it. I'm thinking I am going to skip my classes tomorrow, pick it up and kill myself. I am sad but not depressed, I feel past that, I'm not crying anymore, I'm not beating myself up, I've no strong emotions in one direction or the other which is weird because I tend to get incredibly upset and miserable. I'm just tired. My brain refuses to let me get help, I've been dealing with depression for over 5 years but no one else knows, recently though people have noticed, I've been given opportunities to get help and I just can't. Even right now I don't even want to write this, I don't want to talk about anything or get help, I want my problems gone but I do not want to talk through them. I was meant to have a meeting with my counselor today but I cancelled on him and don't intend to return. I've tried antidepressants and they turned me into something I didn't want to be. I am just simply tired, I don't want to die but I am sick of living. The guilt of my actions and thoughts are what kept me around so long but I feel like I'm disregarding them more and more. The way my brain makes me refuse help and instinctively fake being okay means I am afraid no one will take me seriously or that I wont be able to open up to help, I didn't with my counselor. I also don't want my friends or family to know about this. My mother got concerned a few weeks back and approached me about things and I had a complete breakdown and even in tears I couldn't explain what was wrong, even thinking to myself about my core problems make me tired and make my brain shut down. I'm at a loss.
