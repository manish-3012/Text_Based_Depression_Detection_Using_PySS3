Dreams never die."The pain of not following your dreams is far more worse than the pain of failing the dream itself."

As long as one is avoiding/running away from there dreams, they will be miserable. Go out there and grab your dreams with your own hands.

Goodluck.

Edit: Dreams. They are buried deep inside you with all the pain and suffering over the years. You need to pull them out and bring it to life.
