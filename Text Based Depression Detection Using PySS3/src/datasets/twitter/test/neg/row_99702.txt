I really don't know what to doI've planned on ending my life tomorrow. I bought a plane ticket to California, I want to see the ocean one last time and I don't want to die in my hometown. 
But now I'm wanting to back out. I think it's because I'm nervous to travel and be around strangers. 
However, I really need to end it all soon. I'm living with my uncle. I'm unemployed. I was supposed to move out at the end of August. I told him I would pay him back this week, it was all a lie, since I planned on dying tomorrow. 
if I miss the flight I will have to end my life in my hometown. I really don't want to do that.  

Maybe I really don't want to die, so I'm making up these excuses. But I know for a fact that I don't want to live either. I really don't know what to do anymore.
