From someone who understands, be careful about what you ''say''...When we are suicidal we tend to be at the brink with the ''I have nothing to lose'' mentality. 

You may call a crisis line or end up in the E.R in a psych ward for 24 hours or a week. You may say things to the crisis worker that wouldn't tell anyone else. You see this is a serious problem because anyone that ends up in a ward gets a ''label'' more than likely. If you choose to live (which many of you will) you are still left with the consequences of the reporting your suicidal feelings. 

Most tragically it's usually young people in their late teens and early 20's that get into the situation the most. You don't realize how much a stay in a psych ward or a diagnosis can affect your future career. 

I understand why you have suicidal feelings, life is getting harder and people can be the biggest back stabbers but please for the love of God, from someone who's been through this before do NOT get yourself admitted.
