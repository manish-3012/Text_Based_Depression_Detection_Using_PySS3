Not depressed, just disappointedI'm seventeen years old and I feel like my life isn't going how I want it. People always tell me how good I am. "RHChaotic, you're so handsome" or "You're so smart, RHChaotic". For all of my life, I've believed it and have jumped through hoops to maintain that status.

I wear expensive clothing, I keep myself groomed, I keep my grades up, take college level classes, etc. Yet, it's not enough. I find it very difficult to bond with people and it's very hard for me to make friends. Hell, most people at school try to avoid talking or noticing me. They probably all think I'm an awkward asshole. 

I've been thinking maybe I'm not as smart as everyone thinks I am and that I'm not so handsome. I've looked up ways to be able to connect with and attract people, but they've all failed. I've decided that I'm not good enough for any of this. I feel that my mind is failing me, I can't focus on anything anymore, causing my grades to slip, and my memory is getting worse, forgetting things that happened mere seconds ago. I refuse to become an idiot, I'd soon kill myself.

If I'm not good enough for anyone, I'm not good enough to myself. What's the point of living if no one but your family wants to be around you? 

Before I end this, I want to make some things clear. As stated in the title, I'm not depressed. At least, I don't think I am. I'm just disappointed in what's become of me, my mind isn't as good as it once was, and if I am attractive to people, it certainly doesn't show. I've started to consider suicide more and more. Maybe they'll care when I'm dead and I won't have to worry about impressing anyone anymore. I'd be free.
