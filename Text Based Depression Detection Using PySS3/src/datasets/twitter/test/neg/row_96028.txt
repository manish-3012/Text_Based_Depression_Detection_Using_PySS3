I think I'm done. I need advice.Not sure if it helps but I'm f, 23. I want to end my "life."

1. I have debt from college, I don't want my family being stuck with it.

2. I don't want anyone to know, at least not for a little while. Or, ideally, find me at all. It seems cruel but the few people left in my life know me as the adventuring type... I feel the unknown would be easier on them.

For me personally, it has gotten to a point to where nothing is helping, and I am slowly becoming more and more pitted in this. I have been depressed my whole life, I remember having an interest in suicide when I was younger. Moreso, I found it fascinating and often found myself contemplating, as I feel I had a good understanding of it even at that age. 5 months ago I took a box cutter to my wrist for the first time, didn't tell anyone hoping I would die, just ended up at the hospital anyway because of others, now I have a nasty scar still healing.

I get surged with deep, awful waves, just... waves that flood me. Agony is all I can describe it as, the word seems cliche but fuck, it's just agony... Face hot, throat knotted, chest tight, emotional overload, agony. I've become so apathetic, so cold and every day, all day I feel as thought I am millimeters from crying. I feel all the motions behind my eyes and I have to excuse myself so much (from friends, work, etc) to sob like a little bitch. Almost always (if I am not sleeping or trying to alleviate it with cannabis) I feel myself on the urge of crying, and when I allow myself to, it's so painful and exhausting, usually I fall asleep right after.

I wake up and are exhausted, engaging with people is exhausting... my apartment is... well, hardly one anymore. I can't bring myself to clean, to do anything. I won't go outside at all unless to walk to work. I don't remember to eat, or drink most days. I'm fucking tired. 

I am alone. Not in my depression but in where I am, I have no true friends, no outlets, no family (I only have a mom and some nieces now...) that takes it serious. I no longer show or feel emotion, I'm starting to look a little ill...? It's just... when it becomes a point to where "it'll get better," "I care about you," just makes me feel worse, more alone, stuff like that makes me cringe, and cry. It just upsets me to hear, because I've heard it for so long and it's only gotten worse.

tl;dr... I want to die. Please give me suggestions, or refer me to informative sites. I can handle some pain prior, but want to avoid any sort of possible frightening deaths. So no jumping off buildings, medicine that'll make me seize out, come to, seize out again, etc... Also, the two questions above. 

I've waited, I've hotlined, I've cried for help, I've tried to help myself, I've tried committing myself to old hobbies I used to adore, it doesn't get better. I'm done now, please help me.

Thanks...
