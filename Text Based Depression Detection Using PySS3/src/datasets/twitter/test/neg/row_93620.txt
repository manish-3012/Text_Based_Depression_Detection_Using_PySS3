2 years thinking about suicide daily. Now starting to actually consider it. It's fucking scary and sadI don't wanna do it. I don't think I will, but who knows at the minute. Life has turned into a horror show. I hate that I'm actually thinking of taking a knife to my throat, actually physically have been sliding a knife over my throat. Fucking hate this, I don't want to die. Life just gets worse. I'm just so sad. It's so sad that many of you feel the same if not worse. Trying to keep strong because I know life can be good. But is it worth this fucking sadness and pain
