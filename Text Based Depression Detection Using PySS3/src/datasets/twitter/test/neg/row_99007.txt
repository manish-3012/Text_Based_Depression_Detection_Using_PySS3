Same oldHi. First of all I want to say thank you all for giving people encouragement and words of support when they post here in their time of need.
Personally, I have no clue what to do with my life to feel like I've progressed or succeeded. After all the hard work and education I'm working in a store, grinding my life away like the rest of us. I feel like I have lost my passion and don't really want to continue living if I'm acting fake and feeling miserable every day.
If you are also suicidal and reading this, I believe you can pull through. I don't have the energy to fight my feelings and at this point they feel like my identity and I honestly don't really want them to go away. I think if anyone wants to hard enough they have a chance at getting better. 
Good luck.
