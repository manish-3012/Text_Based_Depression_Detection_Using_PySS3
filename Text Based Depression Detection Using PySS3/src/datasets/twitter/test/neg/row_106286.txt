Pills + alcohol + bathtubHey I want to ask about this don't judge me or try to talk me out of it I tried everything I could and I don't want to carry on anymore. What can go wrong if you swallow like 20mg of rivotril, 70mg of olanzapine, 7,5mg of mirtazapine and drink 5 beers on top of that in full bathtub wouldn't you just fall asleep and submerge and die without too much struggle ? What can possibly go wrong ? I tried to OD on klonopin and olanzapine before I ate 200mg of olanzpine bunch of klonopin with 0 tolerance and 3/4 bottle of vodka and was unconsciousness without even remembering anything my mom found me vomited in my bed so why it shouldn't work in full bathtub? I just want to go unconsciousness and forget everything..
