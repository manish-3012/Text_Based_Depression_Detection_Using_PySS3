Ever thought you'd be alright if you got this one thing, then you get it and you're the same?My depression really spiked in the months leading up to some important entrance exams I had to give, mainly because I didn't think I'd make it into the programme of my choice.

Now the results are out and I got my first preference (a dream college for me), I was happy for a week and thought "well, now I should be fine"; but I'm off too grad school and still feel like shit over other things.

Are people like us meant to be happy SW? :(
