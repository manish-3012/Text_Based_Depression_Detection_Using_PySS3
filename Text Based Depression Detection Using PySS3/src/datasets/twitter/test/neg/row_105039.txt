I'm so tired of hurting. Nobody even cares that I'm in hereI was going to post this on a throw away but I don't even care anymore I basically don't even exist. I've made a few posts on Reddit in lots of different sub reddits over the past few months but alas I have ended up here on my way out the door I guess as a last grasp at anything. So here goes... I'm a 21 year old boy with no friends obviously no girlfriend. I go to work every morning at 6am and I work until 6pm. I hate my job so much it makes me so sad and everyone is mean to me and makes me feel even worse about myself if that's even possible. Everyone treats me like I'm a monster. I can't find a job anywhere else because I'm so stupid. I'm a drop out and I have no talent at all. I have Social Anxiety Disorder and OCD and I'm afraid to talk to anyone and even when they talk to me I panic and don't say anything at all. I had been living with my girlfriend for the past few years and she took really good care of me until about 5 months ago I found out she was seeing another man and she decided to end her relationship with me once I knew. She said she couldn't stand me anymore and that she wanted a normal boyfriend who isn't afraid of everyone. Since she has been gone I have found I am so alone. Nobody talks to me and I hate being at home just as much as I hate being at work. I feel like I could do anything because nobody knows I'm here. All I do is lay in bed when I'm home and try to sleep. Getting through work everyday is a huge challenge I feel so weighed down and useless. I keep thinking about suicide a lot. I keep getting the nerve up but I'm afraid of what will happen to my puppy and he looks at me with sad eyes and I don't know what to do. My family doesn't like him and I don't want them to give him away. I love him so much but even he is miserable without his mommy. I also feel guilty because I don't want my family to be upset and they have spent so much money on my life. I've thought about maybe trying to open up a life insurance policy so that I could try and give them something back. I know this is a terrible selfish thing to do but I just can't keep living like this over and over again. I thought things would get better with time but I just feel worse every day. Accepting I'm alone forever is worse than when I was upset about losing my girlfriend. I know I will never meet anyone as a friend or anything more because I'm so afraid of even leaving my home besides for work. Even if I could nobody would like me because I don't do anything or speak much. I also don't make enough money for therapy but I tried anyways and my insurance would not cover any of it. I'm afraid to speak to anyone because I don't want my mother to try and commit me again and I don't want them to ask me to take medicine anymore. I'm just so alone and scared. I don't want my life to be like this anymore.
