Everything in my life is falling aparti donâ€™t know what happened. i was such a bright and smart kid but ever since high school everything just started falling apart. i donâ€™t really get happy or excited, i donâ€™t have friends so i donâ€™t leave my house for up to months, i donâ€™t eat or sleep, i canâ€™t get sexually aroused, i always feel bored and depressed. i just donâ€™t know what to do. therapy doesnâ€™t work. i donâ€™t have friends to talk to. iâ€™m not comfortable to talk to parents about this stuff. i need help. ive tried suicide 3 times, and i donâ€™t want a 4th try.
