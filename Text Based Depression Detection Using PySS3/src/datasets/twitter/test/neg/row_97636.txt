I'm WorthlessI have nothing to look forward to except burdening everyone around me.

I'm got so much physical and mental illness that I'll never be able to manage a job, have a relationship, do anything meaningful. I applied for disability and it took them about five seconds before they just said 'yeah, this guy's never going to be of use to any employer'. These issues will never go away and no medicine has helped improve them.

Every friend I've ever had has forgotten or betrayed me. I have people who still go out of their way to make sure I'm not allowed to interact with new people. I don't even want to anymore, since seeing other people having fun or living normally just reminds me how pathetic I am.

Whenever I tell others my problems they just lie to me. 'Things will get better!' No they won't. 'You have worth!' No I don't. 'You'll get your dream job, your perfect relationship, you'll be happy!' No, I fucking won't. Instead of proving to me I have value they just beg me to lie to myself, and tell me to read a book or something.

The only reasons I'm still around are keeping my family from being saddened, and because I'm not entirely sure if being dead will actually make me feel any better. Non-existence is just a possibility, you know? Heaven, hell, reincarnation, a void, all could exist, and if I end up in some sort of afterlife I'll just be miserable for all eternity.
