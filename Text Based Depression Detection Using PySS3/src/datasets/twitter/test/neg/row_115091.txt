Why bother going on. I'm going to die alone whether it's tonight or in 50 years.Is it too much to ask to have someone that'll love me as much as I love them? It's too late for me. I'm undateable. I'm a 27 year old that has never had a relationship and it kills me. I don't have an awkward first date story. I don't have that first kiss as a teenager. And I never will. 

I just want what everyone around me has. It's not fair, no one cares and I'm fucking done
