Feeling like I'm living in a bad joke that just never endI just can't get any more of that, all my personal life have been a mess, I'm 25 and only had 2 girlfriends and both "long" relationships (4,5 years and 2,5 years respectively), both ended up very bad for me, the last one ended about a month ago.

They both cheated on me on the worst way possible, It's way too long to explain on that post..

My social anxiety prevents me to meet new girls. 
For both my relationships the girls came to talk to me, I never had to take the first step, I don't know how to do that, and it scares the shit out of me

I feel like shit, knowing that my ex is actually fucking with other dudes makes me sick, I feel like I'm losing my mind, It's been a month that I can't work properly, I just sit in front of my computer but can't focus, I spent days learning all the options available to kill myself with the least pain and the cleanest ways possibles, I just want all of that to stop, I just can't hold it anymore, everyday I stare at my rifle wishing I have the balls to load a round and blow my head out...

I think that the only thing preventing me to do it is the fear of failing and ending up being a vegetable for the rest of my life, and the idea of my parents seeing their son with half a face rotting in his apartment for days if no one care about the sound of the shot in my building.

When I was younger I thought I wouldn't turn 21 because I would have killed myself by that time, didn't had the balls to do it, I hate me for that, I just want all of this to stop, as the days goes I feel more and more desperate, I really don't see the point of being alive and never did, It's just constant suffering, one week I can be like "Well, life's not good but it's okay" and being obsessed with my personal projects, and the next one I'm just willing to end it, unable to focus to anything, and it's been like this since I was like 13, I don't know what's wrong with me, but it's unbearable...

I really hope that I'll have the courage to put a bullet in my head in the next few days...
