do i matter?all of my friends

a few online, only one in the real world

i can't tell if i matter to them

what if they're just lying

they all could be lying

i can't kill myself

i'm being pressured into not hurting myself

that's what it feels like

and i'm not sure if they want me alive

because they actually love me, and might really care

or because they like seeing me suffer

it's 5am here. i stay up for an out-of-timezone friend.

i needed to get this out before i went to bed.

good night, or good morning, reddit.
