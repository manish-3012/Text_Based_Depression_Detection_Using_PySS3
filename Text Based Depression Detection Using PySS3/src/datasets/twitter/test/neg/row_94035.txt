I donâ€™t know anything.Iâ€™m 18F. And yes I know thatâ€™s extremely young but I have a problem and I no long know what to do. I have a great life, I have people that love me, I have a family I havenâ€™t lost any close relatives. But I still feel like ending it all. I still just want to close my eyes and never open them up again. I hate this feeling, I feel so fucking worthless and useless and absolutely stupid. I just want to feel happy and I canâ€™t even do that right. Iâ€™m too young to be feeling this way and I havenâ€™t lost anything. 

I no longer know what to do. All I know is that something is wrong with me and I can no longer handle it. The only things I can consider to be impactful was a car accident I was in, being falsely accused of rape and assault, growing distant from friends and getting out of a three year relationship. Iâ€™m too young to be feeling this way. I donâ€™t know what to do. I really donâ€™t. I feel like a fucking failure to everybody around me. 

I want my self doubt to stop. I want to stop the voices in my head. They trigger a fight or flight response and I freeze up. Iâ€™ve given up and it doesnâ€™t feel right, but trying feels wrong. It feels like everything I do is wrong. Please I just want help. The suicide hotlines donâ€™t do much except blame me, Iâ€™ve been passed from therapist to therapist because there was nothing they could do. My family has given up on me because they donâ€™t know how to help and I wish I just knew what to do. I canâ€™t even get up in the mornings. My uncle told me he loved me and I asked him why. I fucking asked why he loved me? I just want to get better. 

I moved to a different country in hopes of it settling down. And it worked for about a week. But it all hit me at once and I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m lost in my own mind and I just want the noise to stop.
