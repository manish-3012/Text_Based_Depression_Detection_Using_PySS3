I want to try againTried last week. It was a quick decision. Adderall and alcohol. Kind of upset that it didnâ€™t work because I know I deserve to die. High school isnâ€™t gonna get any better and I donâ€™t want to deal with adult life. The only thing thatâ€™s really keeping me from doing it is disappointing my parents. I donâ€™t want my parents to blame themselves for my decision because they are fine people. Iâ€™m just sitting here with no idea what to do and where to go with my life.
