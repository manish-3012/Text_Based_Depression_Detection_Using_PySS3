Anybody out there to talk to...?(Throwaway account.)

I'm going to make the leap soon and I'd just like someone to know my story before I went. I'd prefer to talk over an instant messaging service of some kind -- AIM, YIM, MSN, Skype, whatever. A tad bit more personal that way. I'll be on the rest of the night, so don't be afraid to respond.
