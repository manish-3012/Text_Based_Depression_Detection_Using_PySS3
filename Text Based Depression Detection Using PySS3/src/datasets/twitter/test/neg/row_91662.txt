caught in the system.Was given a first offense MIP in august two months before I turned 21 and have been on probation ever since. Just tested positive for mj. I would rather face death then go through this horse shit called a justice system. In fact weed is the only thing that keeps me from being depressed. So here's to hoping my story may change something.
