My life sucks...My world is becoming smaller and smaller. Right now there is a party going on in the neighbourhood. I was there for eating but went home afterwards? Why? 



Well I have something called social anxiety, maybe I don't know what it is. I went home, started crying because there was so much tension going on that I had to cry. I don't know ... this is becoming terrible. Why? Because we have to live next to each other... on a party, at work. 



Everywhere I am encountering the problem of social anxiety. It's like the world is just one big cage and I am lost in it. I feel isolated. This makes me wanna cry even more. Fuck that! I want to destroy everything around me, destroy everything! Really I was sitting on my bed and I just wanted to destroy it.  Throw it around!
