feelin' so super grossI've been depressed for basically my entire life, but I've never felt this constantly terrible. So few things are fun, my anxiety spikes over almost nothing, and I just feel like I'm burdening my friends and partners with my unrelenting unhappiness.


For a hot second, my partner really helped me feel better. I would spend time with them and I would forget all about my gross feelings. But lately, whenever it's time for me to leave, I feel like the rug is being pulled out from under my feet and I get very sad and I wall myself off because I don't want to cry and make them feel bad for leaving. I don't want to be that partner that ends up being emotionally manipulative because they get/act sad whenever their partner does something they don't like. But also, I don't want to deny my own emotions or distance myself from them... I like being vulnerable, but sometimes it feels too painful or like it would be inappropriate.


Anyway, I guess that was kind of a tangent. The point of all this is that I'm almost constantly thinking about self-harm or that maybe it would be better if I was dead, because then I would stop hurting and I would stop inconveniencing people through my hurting. And I guess that's part of the reason I hate leaving my partner's apartment; I have a knife in my room and I feel like I'm constantly aware of it... like's it's there for me if I ever decide I finally wanna take the plunge and start cutting and that utterly terrifies me. I would get rid of it, but it was a gift from my other partner (I'm poly) who lives far away now, so it means far too much to me.


Bluhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh


p.s. - Sorry if that was too "explicit". I'll go back and edit it if it is.
