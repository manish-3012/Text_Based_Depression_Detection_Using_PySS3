Iâ€™ll be dead before the end of the week at this rate.I canâ€™t get in control of my thoughts. Iâ€™ve been trying to stop drinking, today I havenâ€™t drank. I stopped eating a couple days ago because I thought that would be an easier way to go out. But Iâ€™m realizing I donâ€™t know if I can last that long. Iâ€™m so alone. My best friend is sick of my depression, I have no family, Iâ€™m living with friends because my roommate kicked me out. Iâ€™m barely making ends meet whatsoever. All I did was come home and drink and hope Iâ€™d wake up and it would be a bad dream. But now that Iâ€™m sober all I feel is the pain, and the hurt of a broken heart. I just want to die
