Iâ€™m not sure where my head in life is right nowIâ€™m on my anon account because of private and personal reasons. So Iâ€™m not sure how long this will be, as Iâ€™m just gonna type to let everything out and hopefully someone will understand and maybe give me some advice or, whatever Iâ€™m really looking for.

So for some context, I am a cancer survivor. I had Non-Hodgkinâ€™s Lymphoma and was diagnosed late 2015 and treated from then to midway 2016. Before then, I thought of myself as relatively happy. I just started college, and performed really well for the first semester. But my life was put on hold and well, it never has sort of come back I suppose. I guess if I had anyway of phrasing this, my life has sort of just been destroyed ever since. If I had to start with what Iâ€™v lost, itâ€™s probably just gonna be listed. 

One of things I potentially may have lost, is my ability for children. Itâ€™s a 50/50 shot that I may not have kids in the future and it was always something I looked forward to having. Iâ€™ve yet to go back and test my â€œdude nectarâ€ but Iâ€™m so afraid of the results

Another thing Iâ€™ve felt I lost is a relationship. A relationship with a girl who I knew for years. We met in high school, itâ€™s been on and off and very confusing for the both of us, but Iâ€™ve always loved her and the feelings were mutual but, she would never act on them but we would maintain the relationship. In a sense... we were lovers who never called it a relationship. Lately the girl has moved out of her parents house (for many great reasons) and yet she has started a relationship with another man. However, she still maintains contact with my family and constantly speaks to me and comes over to my house all of the time to see my parents and spend time with them, whether I am there or not. It is very hard for me to understand what to feel about this or how to move forward. I love her, and she doesnâ€™t feel the same yet manages to maintain everything about a relationship between us. I canâ€™t let go.

And the relationship with my parents is detrimental. I have been flunking and not performing well in college since Iâ€™ve come back. Iâ€™ve lost scholarships which has put some pressure on my parents unfairly to pay for certain classes that financial aid wouldnâ€™t cover, but it has only happened once ($600) and I have not taken more classes than financial aid can cover since. But my mother always tells me that if I fail school, or drop out, I must move out and be removed from everything. These past few weeks, Iâ€™ve had a seizure, had $840 stolen from me, and just today I had to borrow more money to buy new tires from my parents because my tire was blown out. At this point, I owe them $2000 and Iâ€™m failing school.

My current job is a nightmare, as my dad is one of my managers, and the other managers and employees seem to neglect the amount of work I put in, and I maintain 32 hours a week for a $240 check a week. Iâ€™ve worked at this job for around 6 years but I feel I am garbage to these people as Iâ€™m consistently in trouble for not doing work, yet I consistently am helping people and maintaining a quota above average but the strain it has on me, comes home because of the relationship me and my father have being employee and manager, but I cannot seem to find a job that pays as well for now at the time given.

The only thing I have right now is that Iâ€™ve gotten a second job that pays well, but Iâ€™m very new to it and I have to keep training until I can make decent money and consider it a future career.

Iâ€™m struggling with the thought of life because my parents want me to move out if I donâ€™t go to school that I hate going to, they want me to pay them $2000 I just donâ€™t have or make because they feel Iâ€™m ungrateful and achieving nothing with my life. Iâ€™ve put the strain on myself because I feel my future is doomed. I feel like my life is screwed before Iâ€™ve gotten started. My parents have covered me and now are just telling me Iâ€™m ungrateful and have nothing to offer them in terms of repayment and want me gone. I also struggle medically and socially because Iâ€™m such a depressed person and I feel my medical history is completely dooming any chance Iâ€™ve had for a future. 

I donâ€™t know if I need tough love, sympathetic assurance, but right now I feel like my life would be so much better gone. Iâ€™m hopeless and Iâ€™m afraid I donâ€™t have a want for a future. I have my means to end it and Iâ€™ve been teeter tottering on just doing it but I donâ€™t know what holds me back. What can I do? How can I fix my life? What steps do I need to move forward?
