I'm just done.This is a throwaway, for obvious reasons.
I'm done.

I've been sexually abused since the age of 12, and it's never stopped. I've been raped twice in the past year and a half, the last time was the worst sexual assault out of the near dozen that I've faced because it got incredibly violent.

I have NEVER been able to stand up for myself when it was happening. I was terrified. Finally, FINALLY, this past time, I did. I pushed him away. I wasn't going to take it anymore.

And he started choking me. I couldn't breathe, he was behind me, his arm wrapped around my neck. I was a virgin until I was raped a year and a half ago, and now, I just feel like a cheap slut even though I still haven't even slept with anyone willingly, or anyone I've loved.

I can't eat. I haven't eaten more than one meal a day in the past two weeks. I'm hurting myself by not eating, by not talking about it, because I can't hurt the people that hurt me, I tried getting them expelled when it was on campus, and it was 'too much he said she said'. Garbage.

I want to die. Please, someone just give me permission to let myself die. I want to die so badly.
