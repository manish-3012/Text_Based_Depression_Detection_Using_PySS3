I want to be done.There's no point in fighting anymore. I found out today that I've been booted out of a group project for poor attendance. I can't complete the course without doing the project. I'm never going to be done my degree. I've been on meds and seeing doctors/counselors/psychiatrists for more than five years and I'm barely any better than when I started. I have no friends left - they have all graduated and moved away, or they sided with my ex-boyfriend when he dumped me last summer. My only hesitation in ending it all is how upset my parents would be, and it makes me angry that I can't end my suffering because I know they would suffer as a result. I just can't keep going on this sad, empty treadmill kind of life in which I'm not going anywhere. I want out.
