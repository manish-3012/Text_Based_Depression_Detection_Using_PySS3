I donâ€™t have any friends or anyone I can hang out with. I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreI donâ€™t have anyone I can vent to or have sleepovers with or just ask to hang out, and I donâ€™t know why. Is there something wrong with me? Am I ugly? Does everyone think Iâ€™m annoying? Iâ€™m 18, and everyone says that this is supposed to be the best years of your life, and I feel like Iâ€™m wasting it. I donâ€™t know how to make friends and I feel like a worthless waste of space when I see how everyone else has someone and I have no one at all. I would be asked to hang out sometimes before the pandemic, but ever since it started, no ones asked. But I still see photos of them with friends, and I feel left out and lonely. I just want a friend that I feel I can be myself with. I am incredibly insecure and struggle with a fear of rejection, and so initiating conversation is very hard for me, and I feel like no one wants to talk to me anyway, so thereâ€™s no point in bothering. Iâ€™m just so alone.
