I don't know what to doFirst of all, I'm not native speaker so please understand my English. So, here it goes. I had no traumas, deprived background or such, but somehow I was always little depressed. Around 2 years ago, that thing exploded into major depression which dulled my emotions. Now my life has become more convenient that I rarely feel depressed, but the problem is I lost fond of life. I have nothing I want to do, nothing to care about even my families and friends and don't want to live really. I've been to therapists and taking medicines past 2 years, but the depression is getting worse and have become suicidal. Now I'm planning to die in few months. Well, I'm still taking medicines and therapies hoping something would happen, but all in futile I guess. To be honest, I don't even know why I'm writing this here, but felt like I still want to give it a shot.
