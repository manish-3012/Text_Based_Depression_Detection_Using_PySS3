Holy crap manâ€¦I didnâ€™t think anyone could be as much as a worthless failure as I am until I actually get tested or when someone asks something of me. Then I even surprise myself with my own ineptitude. I made a promise to the people I love not to try and kill myself again but **holy fuck** is that a hard promise to keep. Especially when I think about suicide everyday.
