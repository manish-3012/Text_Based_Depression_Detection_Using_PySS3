I just want to sleepAnd I donâ€™t want to have to wake up. I want to leave this boring, dragging, agonizing existence behind me. Life is going on for far too long and Iâ€™m done with it. Iâ€™m done waking up and having to go to work, to get money, so I can pay bills and have a place to live, so I can try to keep my entitled wife happy. Iâ€™m so sick of everything that is going on. Iâ€™m tired and Iâ€™m never not. I want to sleep forever.
