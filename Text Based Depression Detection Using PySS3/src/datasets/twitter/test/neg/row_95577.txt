Begging for help.Iâ€™m so fucking lost. I have nothing anymore. I donâ€™t want to die i just want to escape all this suffering. I pray every night for god to give me a sign that itâ€™s going to get better, but the next day is always worse. I used to be so happy, I hated seeing other people hurt and i always prayed for god to heal them and put their suffering on me. I just wanted my sister and mother to be happy. They didnâ€™t deserve all the pain and suffering they went to. I begged and begged and begged god to give me the suffering. I told myself that i was strong enough. That them being happy was worth all the pain i would have to endure. But i donâ€™t think i can do it. All i think about it death. Iâ€™m so alone, I moved for college and now I have no friends. The only thing keeping me together was this girl. She meant everything to me and i knew as long as i still had her i would be okay. But now sheâ€™s gone and i have nobody. I sit in my car for hours just staring at pills but iâ€™m too coward to take them. I just want someone to ask me if iâ€™m okay. I want to be saved.
