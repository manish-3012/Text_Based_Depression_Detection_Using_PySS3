I am ready to dieI have an illness that has been torturing me for four years without a single respite. I am constantly in pain, constantly restless, constantly abused by my illness. I cannot get the medications I need because I abused alcohol and the VA told me no on any medications that can be abused. My suffering is endless.

I have a noose tied up in my closet and I am writing my suicide note to my family.

Putting the noose over my head gave me a strange feeling. I crave it. I crave death in such a genuine way. The only thing that bothers me is hurting my mother.

I am constantly thinking about ways to end my life. I suffer so much and I just need to get away.
