Waiting GameEither now or later in a few years. I can't live like this or get pass any of what happened. I thought I could go to school and improve myself but I realize that I am not capable of that or anything. People taughy me to hate myself and I am forever grateful for everything that occured because now I know: I thought I had lost it all or the possibility of a better life but I never in the running track racing and competing with others. I am just waiting to see how the end of the aftermath. I wish I could get to the end where I will most likely blow my brains out. I just want a gun and a bullet through my head for Christmas.
