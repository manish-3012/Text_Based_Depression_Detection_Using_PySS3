Why is it so hard to die when I've made peace with it?Is it so unreasonable to want some certainty in death? I just want to know that if I try to kill myself, it will work. This is one of the biggest things that I struggle with. I don't want to be found passed out and bleeding in a tub, or have a rope break on me and have to go to the hospital or wake up after getting my stomach pumped. 

The otherwise of the difficulty is the impact it'll have on the people around me. I've isolated myself so much that outside of the people I work with, less than a handful of people will know, but there always seems to be something. My brother got married, my mom was depressed, my brother is having a baby, my grandfather died today, my mom's birthday is next week... It's just a neverending litany of impacts my death will have on their lives that I don't want. 

I feel so stuck, so helpless; and yet I have to keep chugging along each day, relying on substance abuse to make it from one to the next. 

It's getting closer and closer to the point where I feel like I should just try and hope I get lucky. I'm at work with what feels like a black hole in my abdomen threatening to disintegrate my carefully constructed composure and this is the only way I know to make it another few minutes until it's time to leave. 

I wish someone could save me, or at least care for me.
