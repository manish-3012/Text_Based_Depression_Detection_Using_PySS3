I just want help.I just want help I constantly feel like I'm a disappointment and that everyone one hates me and that just leads ðŸ˜‚ n to my social anxiety the only person I truly love killed them self because of the mental and fiscal abuse she was experiencing from everyone in her life I always tried to stick up for her and we almost made a suicide pact but we never thought it would get that bad but it did and I tried to stop her, if your wondering what happened I called her to see if I could come over that day and she said yes so I came over and when I got there I heard crying coming from the bathroom and I opened the door to see her bleeding out in the bathtub with her wrists slit I almost just did it there but I was in to much shock and today was her birthday and I just give up I want help but counseling make my depression worse so if anyone can try to help then thank you, sorry for the inconvenience.
