I'm trying to get help, but nothing is helping.I got my shit together enough to go to therapy again. The therapist told me last time to think about whether or not I really want to be in therapy at all, because she's not sure it's helpful for me. (She's doing her job, but damn. I feel like I failed therapy.)

I got more meds, too. I've been doing all the things my doctors want me to do. I'm not better. If anything I feel worse because I'm putting all of this effort in and it's drudging up all my shit without giving me a solution.

This is honestly the most helpless I've felt in a long time. If doing the "right things" doesn't help, then why the fuck am I pretending that my life might get better?
