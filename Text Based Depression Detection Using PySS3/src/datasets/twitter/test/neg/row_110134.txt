Medications aren't making me betterTaking SIX different medications now, and I kept my suicide plans so far. It's not that I want the pain and my life to go away, I don't want to exist anymore. An afterlife would be hell for me, I don't want to be "me" forever. I want to lose consciousness for all eternity and not know a world ever existed, a universe ever existed, like time stops and it never resumes. And this brings me such relief and peace...

My therapist just shrugs at my suicide plans and says there's nothing anyone can do to convince someone to not die if they have their minds made up (which I think is a way for her to cope with my inevitable suicide). My psychiatrist just panics and piles in more meds. Six, now. My anxiety and anger vanished, but life didn't miraculously solve itself, I still want to die.

So this means I'm justified and rational about it, right? I really want to die and I am justified to think so, it's not an illness making me think that.
