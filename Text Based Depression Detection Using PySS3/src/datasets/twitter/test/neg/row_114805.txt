Is there anyone that feels the same? All my life I've put on a face of happiness. I have friends, I have a lot more than others, parents were great, had everything I had to live a good happy life. I've never been truly happy though. I don't know why. At the same time, I am happy when I do think about not waking up tomorrow. I'm not alone, I could talk to people about it, but I rather not. I just wanted to know if anyone else feels this way? I know not many people probably do (or maybe they do, I don't know). I'm just so tired of putting on a persona in order to avoid questions from family and friends.
