Dude I'm having a hard timeI just feel really beat up by my metal illness and I just want friends my whole life has gone so downhill in the last year i lost so much and I don't have any friends I can talk to. I just feel so bad yaknow I don't know how to cope this well I might not be on the edge of a bridge but I think about suicide every day and I don't wanna be alive a lot of the time.
