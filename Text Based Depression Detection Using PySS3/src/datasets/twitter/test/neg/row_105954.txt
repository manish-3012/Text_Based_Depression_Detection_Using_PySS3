In Evolutionary Terms, How Can This Be the Case?How has the genetic make-up that results in constant suicidal ideation get passed on? I assume that I am not the first person in my genetic line to have a constant drum-beat of suicidal thoughts every day of their life. So were my ancestors also people that went through the motions of life while harboring these thoughts every day?

I'm just confused. On paper I have a very privileged life with nothing to complain about in terms of interpersonal relationships. I don't think it's normal to constantly think about and consider suicide and I don't understand why whatever is wrong in my brain didn't get snuffed out of the gene pool generations ago.
