Jobless and running out of timeI lost my job, and while I did have enough stored up to make my rent for next month, I dont have enough for my other bills, and I've been putting in applications to all the places I can get to but none of them have responded. And I have at best 2 weeks before my phone and internet get cut off because of not being able to afford the bill, and then I lose any chance of getting a job whatsoever. So I don't know what to do anymore. What's even the damn point anymore?
