I've fucked up! My life is ruined! My teaching career is destroyed all because of my past mistakes!I've fucked up! My whole life is ruined and now I'm going to get arrested! I'm scared because I fucked up! My teaching career is destroyed! 

I'm going to start from the beginning of this story. I'm 34 years old, female and I've been teaching since I was 25. I'm from New York and I've been teaching high school students since I began my career. 

When I was 27, I began a relationship with one of the high school graduates that year, he was 18 and the relationship lasted over the summer. When I came back to work, I was told that I've been fired because of my relationship. I was told to find a new school and I began to teach in Texas. I began another relationship with a young male student shortly after that. 

I got fired again and I fucked up again all because of my sex drive and my attraction to young men! 

Now, everything has gone to shit and I'm going to get arrested because I had sex with a 17 year old male student! 

I know everyone here is going to look down on me as you should, but I fucked up and now I'm going to shoot myself in the head so I don't have to feel the pain that would happen when I get arrested! 

I love you mom and dad, I'm sorry for being such a fuck up!
