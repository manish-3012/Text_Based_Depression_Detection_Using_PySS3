WelpBeen always thinkong about it since I was 8 no biggie to me. Used to be personable etc in teens.  Tried once died once week after I was randomly given something that makes me go. It's not an identity so much as I am it, this musical instrument. Spent 5 years homeless stealing squating anything literally anything to survive and practice it and learn about it. Things came to fruition recently started playing live with people. I get shoulder checked by a stranger and call him out and now the band thinks I'm some ( diagnosed schizoaffective and told them my bad) crazed violent dude or w.e . Haven't said anything directly but strange social media shit  ( blocking  [ haven't ever sent a single message] unliking and shit on texts) as well as they had a show without me tonight supposedly. Just tired man don't wanna keep moving and making new friends like shit I know it's a college town and life's been rough till now  clashong cultures but I'm always nice and attentive to how I make others feel but I stand up for myself and I'm dogshit. Just tired man fuck
