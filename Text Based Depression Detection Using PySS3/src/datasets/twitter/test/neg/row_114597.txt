Don't feel qualified to post but don't know anywhere else I can eitherThis is mostly going to be waffle because I don't have time to draft (says the person that's having suicidal thoughts right now). I'm privileged with an okay relationship with my family and at a world-class university but I'm really lonely. I hate my uni, it has drained all interest for my course out of me. I've got abysmal grades that are improving but I haven't had much luck with job applications in my field because of them. The people are all either really nice or complete jackasses, both are extroverts which to be honest sometimes make me uncomfortable. I'm by no means a disinteresting person but I just don't fit in despite the large student union. I only have 1 friend that I don't even hang out with outside of uni because we don't have similar interests. I've become even more quiet since I've left school in which I had a group of friends that I don't see often anymore, I've experienced more racial stereotyping in one and a half years than the 6 years I'd been at school. Being short and chubby as a non-drinker doesn't help.
And it all started with heartbreak. Might sound silly but having harmless crushes as a kid is normal, wanting to cut (and kill) myself because of it isn't. There's not much to expand on it but if I had to single out a 'reason' why I want to kill myself that would be it, as I almost did October last year.
I thought letting it out here would be better than on Facebook when people would suddenly pity all over me when they usually don't care. 

edit- Thank you all who replied for your encouragement. It means a lot. I don't have hope for better days but I'll keep going on.

edit-I'm so sick of it all, I keep thinking of killing myself every time I think of them. I don't want to die but there's nothing to live for. I'm unloved, I'm ugly, I'm not good at anything, I'm good for nothing. Too many missed opportunities, regrets, thoughts I can't articulate. I realise all change starts from within but why is society so materialistic?
