LostFeeling as if ending it would be easier than continuing to disappoint my parents every semester. Finding my new bad grades again because I donâ€™t go to class and smoke because I feel trapped and lost. It feels like my college â€œfriendsâ€ use me as a joke and a pity case. It feels like everybody is against me and Iâ€™ll always be at the bottom. Honestly struggling to not end it rn
