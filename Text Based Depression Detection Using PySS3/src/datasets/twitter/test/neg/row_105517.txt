What the fuck is wrong with me?Im not a good writer but pls bear with me.

So bascicaly since the last 2 years I have thes kind of on/off phases where I think about killing myself,cutting myself or where I am just depressed and have no motivation. These phases usually last like 1-7 days and afterwards everything is okay for like 2 weeks to 3 months. These phases are usually triggered by something. I fucked up on a paper, I feel abandoned by friends, lonley , see other people being happy, or something completley random

And it is not that I have bad friends. They usually listen to me when I vent,try to give me advice and invite me for shit. I even managed to have a girlfriend, but we are no longer together. I feel like I should be happy: I have good friends, my parents are good people and I had some kind of romantical success. But still I thing about killing myself and actually researching stuff how I want to do it. 

I dont know what to do. I feel lonley and I dont want to bother my friends anymore cause they have their own shit to deal with.
