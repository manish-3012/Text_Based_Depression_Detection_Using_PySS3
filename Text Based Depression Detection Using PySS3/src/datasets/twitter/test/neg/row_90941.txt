How to survive loneliness?My relationships with family/friends have always been the most important thing to me but Iâ€™m starting to feel so distant from everyone. My ex (my best friend since we broke up) found someone new and I donâ€™t feel like she needs/wants me in her life very much anymore. I donâ€™t talk to my other friends very often at all and we barely see each other because theyâ€™re busy with school or work. It just makes me feel that Iâ€™m not terribly important to anybody anymore, and I feel worthless without that. I still hate myself and I donâ€™t really care enough to help myself or have any interest in living for myself. Maybe thatâ€™s not very healthy but I think Iâ€™ve always felt that way. Itâ€™s gotten to the point where Iâ€™m really considering an attempt, even if itâ€™s possible I could suffer some unintended consequences. I really donâ€™t think I can make it on my own.
