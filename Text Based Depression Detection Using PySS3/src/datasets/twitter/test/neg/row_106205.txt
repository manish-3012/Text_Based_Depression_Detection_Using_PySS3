HelpI thought I was getting better. I'm not better at all, it's worse than ever now. I've made attempts before but thinking of my dad or even my dog nudging me once stopped me. It's all I can think about. I drove an hour today thinking I could just go off one of these cliffs the whole time. It's all I can think about the last few days. Ive been disabled since I was 17. I'm sick every single day of my life. I have something hardly anyone has heard of and no one understands. I hardly understand it, and watching the medical "break throughs"  was not a good idea. One guy thought inflating a balloon near the jugular vein would work, now they've moved on to a neruo stimulator in the neck. None of it's going to work, it's a brain wiring problem. My stupid brain can't get the signals out right. So basically anything that's supposed to be automatic is either under or over stimulated in me. Not in any predictable pattern tho, that would be asking too much. I don't have good days, I have Maybe good hours some days. So for example, I don't digest food right, so I'm always nauseous... My eyes sometimes don't dialate so even a winter day can be blinding, sometimes only in one eye... My blood doesn't circulate properly so my legs get pins and needles and sometimes go blue... My heart rate is ridiculous, I can be sitting watching Netflix and it's pumping like I'm running (it's not a good feeling)... I have trouble standing for any amount of time without feeling faint (standing is the hardest position for your heart)... My hands are always freezing and mostly shaky... Mouth is dry no matter how much I drink... Hair is falling out on my head (I'm a girl so that one hurts)... and the doctors are no help, I've literally only ever met one other person who has heard of my condition. I'm at the end of my rope, I don't want to wake up knowing it's gonna be another bad day for the rest of my life, it's been years since I could function like a normal adult... there's the usual not keeping the house clean which is probably the depression, but I have trouble with everything, doing my laundry, lifting anything, even the essentials like paying bills get away from me because when you're that sick you can't think.... I've looked into the Right To Die laws and I don't qualify to do it in what I think would be the "right" way. I don't have X amount of time left, it could kill me at literally any point and is severely impacting quality of life, I literally do nothing for society, I would if could, but I cant. People tell me to just volunteer somewhere but I'd be more of burden than a help. I think suicidal people can be helped, but in cases like mine, where it's just prolonging this horrible, sickly life, I think they should give me the option to get my affairs in order and take a pill. I don't want anyone to find my body, I don't want to make a mess, I don't want to shock anyone. I want to calmly tell them I've made my choice without getting sent to the hospital for weeks. I doubt anyone is still reading this rant but I needed to get this out and I feel better having done so. I love reddit for being a place I can speak my real feelings and get feedback.
