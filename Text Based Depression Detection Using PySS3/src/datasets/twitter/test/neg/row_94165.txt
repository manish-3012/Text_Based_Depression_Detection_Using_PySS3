Mood tracking is honestly helpful for me. And so are betta fish.I've been tracking my mood since February of this year, and it's really helping me to see the reality of things. I use the app Pixels. I've only had four "good" days this June, which is really concerning. I put the word in quotation marks because it wasn't great--just better than okay. The bad days were severely bad. The sad/angry days continued into this month. I had my first "good" day today, the previous one being 25 days ago. 

25 extremely suicidal days with no break. It's been a month of hell. My therapist situation has been all up in the air, and there is little help for me. So experiencing my first pretty okay day has been a little breath of fresh air. 

I got myself a betta fish so I can have a companion in this house, and honestly, he is making me feel a bit better because I have a distraction, a pretty animal to look at, someone to take care of, and I feel less alone. I'm super excited to talk about him to everyone. My suicidal thoughts have been slowly going down. I still have suicidal thoughts, but they are less severe and they stay for a lesser period of time. I still hate myself, but I have a pet who doesn't hate me and that's something. 

I'm not thriving, but surviving.
