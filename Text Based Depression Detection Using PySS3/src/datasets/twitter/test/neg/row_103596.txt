I tried for 10 years, depression has cost me everything.I tried to kill myself 10 years ago by crashing my car. I am depressed and tend to date women that cheat on me or hurt me somehow. Im not a psychologist and I dont know why I feel or act the way I do. I carried on without medication or therapy until recently, when I was dumped by a girl that might have more problems than me. I hate myself for still being in love with her after all this time, and everything she did. I dont really want to die, but i havent felt any joy in being alive for such a long time. It seems logical that I want this to end. I was very optimistic about medication and therapy, but its been almost a year and I cant help but think Ive had enough. I cant sleep without the meds, I dont have any friends in this city, I feel crushed by every failed attempt to make new ones. Everything has gotten worse and i think about suicide all the time. I just dont want to hurt my family. My parents are still alive and it would (probably literally) kill them. But i dont think i can wait until they arent around anymore. I feel selfish. But it could be over and that just feels like the light at the end of the tunnel. Ive failed before but I know I wont fail this time. Ive imagined it a million times, trying to figure out if I could go through with it. Idk what im even doing here, maybe im just desperate for a strategy i havent considered yet. But I think Ill be gone by the end of the year. Everyday I care a little less about the pain my death might cause, because I feel like Im in far more pain as it is.
