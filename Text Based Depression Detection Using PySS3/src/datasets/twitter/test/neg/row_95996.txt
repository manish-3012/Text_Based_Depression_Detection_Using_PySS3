Having a real hard time lately.I go back and forth between wanting to end it and wanting to live.

I was in a very abusive relationship with a man who raped me and forced me to try and have sex with men for money. I never had sex, mainly because of the distance he was never able to force me but it still really fucked me up because it turned into me doing snapchats and sending pictures to men that I can never undo. He was also a serial cheater. And yes, I have reported to police. Has not made anything better and in fact has made things worse.

My ex recently contacted me. he misses me, loves me, all that. I do really still have feelings but could never be with him again. Eventually, I confessed to him that I told the police everything. Obviously, he denies everything and instead puts the blame on me. Therapy isn't something that will happen anytime soon due to money.

Each day is getting harder and harder to go through and I am just not seeing the bright side of things anymore. I'm not even sure why I'm posting here. Just need help I suppose.
