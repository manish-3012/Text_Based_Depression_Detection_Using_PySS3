What's the point of being alive if i don't want to do anything?I stopped caring about everything, i don't have what people call "goals", i don't have the will or motivation to keep doing the same thing over and over again, i have no discipline whatsoever and i'm too sensitive and weak to survive in a society full of narcissistic assholes.
