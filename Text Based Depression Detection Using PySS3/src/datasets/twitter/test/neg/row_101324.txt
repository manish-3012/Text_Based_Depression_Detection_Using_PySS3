ApathyI can't fight for my survival anymore. I'm 28, no career, no degree, no friends, no memories. I hate myself for wasting the past 10 years. I spent my free time in bed lifeless browsing the internet or sleeping. I have no savings or skills and am done working dead end jobs just to feed myself and pay rent
