Ketamine - Experience?Decided to try and do some Ketamine therapy. Read alot about the studies and successes (and challenges) but I was curious if anyone had any experiences they could share. 

I'm not looking for a cure all, but I am looking for some help fighting the good fight and felt it was time to do more than talking, exercising, etc.
