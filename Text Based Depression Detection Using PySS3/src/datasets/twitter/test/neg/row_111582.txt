Had a nightmare about my dead mother, I just want out of this existence In 2007 when I was 21 I lost my mother. We had a very close mother-daughter relationship and were best friends. She died suddenly from an unexpected infection in hospital after an operation for cancer. It happened right in front of me. The sweet, kind, darling, oh-so-huggable woman who reared me went limp. Her eyes rolled back and her tongue was hanging out. Red frothy stuff started to pour from her nostril. I sat there for hours on a chair with my knees up, pressing my face into the pillow I was hugging.

I keep having dreams where she comes back from the dead to be with me, and I tell her much I love her and try and do everything to make her stay, but at the end of the dream there's nothing I can do to stop her dying all over again. Last night's rendition of this was particularly vivid and has left me feeling wrecked ever since.

I also lost my wonderful friends after that. I had to move back home to take responsibility for the house and my sick father, leaving all my beloved friends in another state on the other end of the country. We kept in touch via phone and MSN for a while, but you know how these things go.

I spent a year in complete isolation with only my non-conversational father for company before getting my journalism degree and going straight into the workforce. I guess a lot of people would envy my life- I own a car, a house, and earn decent money working in the highly-competitive media industry. 

However, I feel... isolated. Lonely. I miss that love and affection that only a mother can provide, I miss warm hugs from friends who were willing to go out on a limb for me. I have "obligatory friends" who I hang out with just to escape the confines of my house, but they're mostly wrapped up in their own lives and get weird if I'm sad or go in for a hug.

I am in a lot of pain. I have self-harmed in the past (lots of scars, used to bash my head against walls, punch my self, force myself to sit in freezing rain). I have been on anti-depressants in the past and have just ended up overdosing on them so my doctor says I shouldn't take them anymore because they make my suicidal urges more erratic. I can't afford therapy. 

Also, having a full time job means I have no "me time" to recover and makes me feel very trapped. I know working is something we all have to do, but I have regular freak outs about not being able to run away home or interstate when my depression and anxiety get too much.

I guess I am just in dire need of an exit, an escape. I'm such an emotional, huggy person who has been left completely love starved and trapped in the workforce. I need out.

I'm not much of a talker, just wanted someone to read this I guess.
