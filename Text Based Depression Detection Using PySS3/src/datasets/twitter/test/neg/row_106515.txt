I just want someone to talk to... the feeling is stronger than ever.My liver problems are getting worse and I really don't care. I have a bottle of vodka right near me and I want to drink it until I die. So many things have gone wrong for me this summer.                                        
* I can't get a job in my area so I am stuck at home with my manic depressed mother whom I always get into a fight with verbal and physical(mainly just physical for her, I try to protect myself).                                                                                    
* My family is extremely close to financial ruin.                                              
* The college I got accepted into to transfer into (aka my dream college) has denied me financial aid. They basically just gave me hope to do something with my life and then just said "Nope! You won't be able to fulfill your dream no matter how hard you try."          
* My liver has been acting up yet again.         
* My bf from college just left me and I was just starting to love again after 3 years of not being able to feel after an ex cheated on me.                                                                            
The thing that has set me over though has been my recent ex. He has been toying with my heart and it hurts just so fucking much. I have taken a few xanaxs already just to calm down and put myself to sleep, but the hurt and disappointment just runs too deep.
