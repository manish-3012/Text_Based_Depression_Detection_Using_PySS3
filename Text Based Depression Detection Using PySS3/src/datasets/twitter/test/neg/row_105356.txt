What's the purpose if everything just repeats itself?Everyone tells I should talk about what's wrong, but why should? They all just say the same shit.  "Everything will get better", "You'll get over it", ...
Well what's the purpose of getting over it if it just gets even worse shortly after? Everytime it feels worse, I'm at the point that I somehow feel physical pain because I'm feeling so bad.
Why should I even give everyone the satisfaction of stayling alive? The only reason anyone cares is complete selfishness, they just don't want to feel guilty because they think if something happens it will be their fault.
I feel like life is just a spiral that keeps getting worse and worse. I got a heart condition that runs in my family and will probably die in a few years anyway but all I can think of is to just do it now because I can avoid these pain filled years.
