It happened againThings were finally looking up. I thought I'd found someone else who could look past all my flaws and drive away the loneliness, but instead she dumped me out of the blue and told me she never wants to see me again. 
I can't even begin to explain how painful it was. Things have been getting worse lately, and this was just the icing on the cake. I'm so desperate to die already. I'm just so exhausted from having to live. I want something where I could just drift off to sleep and never wake up. I'm so tired already. I've just had enough.
