Worried about my sister.Hi reddit, I am worried about my sister. There are several factors that make me believe she might be at risk.

1. She got prescriptions for Escitalopram and Quetiapine, after talking to a clinical psychiatrist. Are these drugs described for people at risk of suicide?

2. Relationships: she recently broke up with her long term boyfriend. She's having short-lived affairs now.

3. Work: she put a break on her studies, shortly before she was supposed to get her degree. The breakup happened just after that.

4. Family: Our father is dead, her relationship to our mother is best described as "hostile".

5. The other day she arranged things so that she can ride her motorbike again.

Please help me.
