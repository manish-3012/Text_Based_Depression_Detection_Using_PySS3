What's the point of living anymore?I am a 21 year old college student taking one class this quarter. Never had a stable job in my life and most of my jobs are just seasonal. Basically I suck at every job I have had in the customer service department. I used to be the fun and crazy guy back in high school but I have been more depressed day by day. I am slowly getting fatter and lost motivation in working out. I am pretty spoiled and I have no friends. The few that I do have always work 24/7. The only reason I want a stable job is so my parents don't have to keep nagging me to get one. I have no idea what I want to do in life and my current major is Business Administration. I love technology but the classes I have to take for anything related to computers involves a ton of math. I want a stable job, a girlfriend, a career I am happy with and a lot of friends but I have no idea where to start.
