School is a place where learning sucks and people depress and wanting to dieHonestly, school is supposed to be fun. 
When it's NOT! School has make me suicidal every day. Stress, test, EOG, exam.. I don't give a fuck about that. It has made me from loving, happy, caring person to agressive, sad and suicidal. So, what's the point of school when it's suck up all the fun?
