Would committing suicide really be THAT bad for your mom?Everyone always talks about how they are skeptical to end their lives because of how devastated their moms would be. I think about this too. But would it really be that terrible for our moms? I read that the way people think about happiness and sadness is not congruent with the reality of happiness and sadness. People think bad situations will make them really sad, and for a really long time (like deaths of loved ones.) People think happy things will make them happy for a really long time (like marriage, children etc.) But really what happens, is people get a sharp increase in happiness when something good happens, and sadness when something bad, and then their emotional states go back to default relatively quickly after that. Hmm. My friend Alf died last month by suicide. His mom was crushed. But sheâ€™s much better now, and all of his siblings are much better. Other moms have survived the suicides of their children so why canâ€™t ours.
