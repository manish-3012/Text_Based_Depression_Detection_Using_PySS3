I have the pills in my hand Every day my life is an embarrassment and I don't have any friends to reach out to. My family doesn't even give two shits about me anymore and never sends one text to see how i'm doing at university. The only thing that's making me hold on is the so-called comfort that things might better, but the chances of anything good happening is zero. Why do I even try anymore? I hate how people around a suicide victim don't give a fuck about them, but then when they commit suicide they act so sad and are like "oh no, I wish they were here!" and im fucking tired of it. Maybe they should have done something about it before they died. Their death is the only thing that made them notice that person. Life is a fucking joke.
