telling friends and family? [update]Last week or so i posted here about telling my friends and family about my depression and the kind of thoughts it was making me have. I didn't know if i should tell them because i was worried it would freak them out and what not. 

well, a few days after that first post a friend texted me saying they and my other friends needed to talk to me because I've seemed sad recently and they were a little worried. two of my friends said if i needed to talk about it they'd be there. I thought having people like that would make me feel better and have some support. But, now all i can think about is there is something wrong with me that other people know about and them being concerned and worried makes me worry about myself and how bad this is getting. I highly doubt ill turn to them to support just due to me being embarrassed about myself and all this shit
