Student Loans make me want to kill myself.I'm taking out 20k a year in student loans at a PUBLIC STATE UNIVERSITY. And I absolutely hate the situation I'm in. I never tried that much in highschool because while school was easy, it was also very boring. I very much regret not trying because I used to be a straight A student- and I'm sure I could've gotten scholarships if I tried. 


Now I'm a rising sophomore in a stem major (cs). I got nearly all A's and my gpa is sitting nice at a 3.7. Yet I don't get shit for that. No extra money in grants- no scholarships from my university I applied for, no private scholarships, no major corporation scholarships, absolutely fucking nothing. 


I was hoping that my financial aid would increase my second year in college if I got good grades so I worked my ass off. Spent many sleepless nights in the library studying and doing assignments. I missed out on a social life because I really was aiming for a 4.0. I didn't get it- but I got close. It's all for nothing. 


There's no hope for me. I tried applying to jobs for the summer but even places like Mcdonald's would not hire me. That's how pathetic I am. I can't imagine I'll get a good job after graduation because nothing ever seems to go my way. When I graduate I'll have around 80k in loans- more than half of which will be private loans. I'm scared I won't have a good enough job to pay for it and I'm scared I'll end up homeless or something. 


I don't know what to do. Everyone told me to go to the state university because it would be cheap. Yeah right. Those people can go fuck themselves with their full ride scholarships. I should've looked harder for colleges. I fucked up my adult life before it even really started. Why shouldn't I kill myself?
