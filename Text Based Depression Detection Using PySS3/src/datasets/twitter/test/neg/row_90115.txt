Unintentionally unhelpful relativesSometimes I have a moment where I make a flippant (but too real) remark in the wrong tone, and my sister catches it, and she knows I mean it. We aren't super duper close, but we're close to the point where we can read each other, and we did a lot of our growing up together, but not all of it. And for background, she attempted to kill herself when we were in middle school, and sometimes I forget. It was during a period of time we were apart, and I wasn't there for her. The situation was shitty. But she did, and went to the hospital and stuff, and seeing her like that was hard, because I didn't quite understand it. I didn't know. But now, like. Twelve years later. She's so confident, so happy. She has all her ducks in a row. And we've talked about it, what she tried to do, how she felt, etc. And she says she's just not depressed anymore. She gets sad, but she doesn't take meds anymore, and she's okay. 

But the advice she gives. The 'pep' talks. *"It gets better."* No, for you it did. That doesn't mean it will for me. *"Anyone can overcome anything with the right attitude."* No, they can't. She also flipflops on whether one 'needs' meds for depression. *"I would be really upset. The kids would be really upset."* The guilt doesn't help. 

It just. She means well. But sometimes I just see her, and talk to her, and then I feel worse than I did before visiting her. Like she thinks she's helping. 

So now a usually happy visit (to see my nieces) is causing me a massive amount of stress. And I have to drive to see her tomorrow, and I don't really drive anymore, because my mind wanders to dark places.
