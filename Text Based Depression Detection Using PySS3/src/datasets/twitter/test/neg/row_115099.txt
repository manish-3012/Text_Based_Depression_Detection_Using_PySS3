I'm already dead insideSo... I lost two of my dearest friends last year. It was shocking and unexpected. The pain has been slowly growing since. I was already suicidal before, and these two were a big support for me. Then poof, gone.

I want to become happy again just as much as I want to jump in front of a train.
