I need change.ive suffered with depression for pretty much all of my adolescent life. Its strange but when im outside i automatically feel better. My home life isnt the best, but it could be a lot worse too. My mum is an alcoholic and my dad is away a lot for work, i only really like my dad in my family hes the only one i can talk to about anything. I have really bad insomnia and anxiety,depression and panic attacks. I think my house makes me feel worse, but most days i cant physically leave. I have a shit job and cant afford to move out, im so sick of this life, i desperately need change but i just cant get it. Im stuck in a never ending cycle of sadness.
