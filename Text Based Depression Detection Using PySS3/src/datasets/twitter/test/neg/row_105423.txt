Is it possible for depression to go away?Hello, everybody. I havenâ€™t posted here in awhile now, I have taken a break from this subreddit, but I have come back to update my progress. Last winter was really tough for me. I was going through a huge bout of depression. It was really hard for me to get through it all, I really didnâ€™t know if I would be able to get through the constant, everyday sadness, numbness, and suicidal thoughts that plagued me. But for some reason, my depression has disappeared. It all ended when winter ended. I havenâ€™t really been thinking about suicide at all lately. I actually found many things in life to enjoy, after all of the shit I went through that made every day hard to get through. I donâ€™t know what happened. Sometimes I wonder if I even had depression to begin with, sometimes I wonder if it was all bullshit and I was just faking it subconsciously. Iâ€™m not sure. But thanks for reading this everybody. I hope you all can get through this living hell. Depression is fucking horrible holy shit.
