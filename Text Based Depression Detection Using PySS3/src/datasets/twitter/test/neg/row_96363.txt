I hate everything about my existenceI ended up writing 500 words about this earlier today. Keep in mind this wasn't intended to be posted before reading it, so it might be a tad confusing.

My life fucking sucks and I want it to end. Those people who say â€œOh, youâ€™re only 14, you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re talking about, give it time, blah blah fucking blahâ€ can just shut up. It doesnâ€™t matter what age I am, I want to die and thatâ€™s that. Just because you donâ€™t think me capable of thinking out why doesnâ€™t mean anything. Iâ€™m not thinking of this because I didnâ€™t get some toy. Age doesnâ€™t mean I donâ€™t have a rational reason.

Where do I even start with reasons? I have no friends, for one. Oh sure, on the surface it looks like I have friends, all of us sitting at our little table at lunch, talking away. Only if you paid attention youâ€™d notice that these arenâ€™t really friends. Just people to talk to as a way to ease the boredom. I have online friends, sure, but in the end they are nothing more than random strangers who took a passing interest in the stupid shit I post online. For fucks sake, the people Iâ€™m closest to are the community of /r/WormFanfic . A fucking fanfiction subreddit. That thought hurts so, so much. And, even then, itâ€™s not even being close to them, itâ€™s just having some small form of recognition for posting a lot - my absence won't even be noted.

I once thought a while ago that it didnâ€™t matter if I had friends or not, but loneliness fucking sucks.

I like to read a lot. I love reading so fucking much. But I constantly come across these characters with these best friends/love interests who would never betray them and are constant companions to them. The fact that I fully recognize Iâ€™m likely to never have that hurts a lot.

One friend. One friend that I could rely on passed all else. Thatâ€™s all I want.

Oddly, Iâ€™m being reminded of a scene from one of the Thor movies. Where Loki, locked up in his cell, all pristine and fine, is revealed to be just an illusion, the real Loki being an utter wreck. It reminds me of myself; I like to put up this little facade that all is well with me, that nothing could do anything but make me laugh. That facade become a role, the role became an act, and I acted so hard I forgot it was so. That just makes it all the worse when it comes crashing down.

And being lonely isnâ€™t the only reason. There is the sheer, crushing boredom. What is the point of living a life that is constantly the same thing day in day out? Wake up, get ready, go to school, come home, read a book, rinse and fucking repeat. Over and over. Then, in some far away future, it becomes the same thing with work.

As asinine as it sounds, Iâ€™m bored. Reading books constantly, every single moment I have, relieved some of my boredom, but everything goes back to the same shitty world the moment the book ends.

I could go on, but those are the main points. Iâ€™m not even sure why Iâ€™m writing this; hopefully it will help. Probably not.

I was told writing it out might help, but honestly it's pushed me further. I'm probably going to kill myself soon.
