Man, I used to love Summer... Now I just want everything to end.I didn't think I'd be back here so quickly, but I guess that my "good vibes" had to end eventually.  
Got an email today from my mother, it was addressed to everyone in the house.   
For a while now, she has been working two jobs, just to help make ends meat.   
She recently got fired from Microsoft and has been looking for another job.  
And she apparently was in talk with the landlord again, and they are getting upset again.   
We had another one of those "Family Meetings" this time with both of my brothers.   
And basically it turned into the "Randy and Ralph Show".   
They say how worried they are about me, but their words ring hollow with already knowing the fact Ralph is just going to move out after he gets a better stable job.   
Especially when they made their snide comments about "You can't be staying up all night and locked up in your room all day little bro!"  
I bet their where waiting for the right moment to say some shit like that, the fuckheads...  
And to make things worse, my mother is suffering from high blood pressure do to all the stress of worried about having to pay bills and pretending it isn't bothering her.  
She doesn't even talk about it with my step dad, so he is trying to talk to his doctor and get her in for an appointment sometime soon.  
I guess that means I'm going to get forced into finding a new job soon, considering how serious this has become.  
Wal-Mart was the worst fucking thing I had to deal with, and now I'm supposed to fucking do it again else where?!  
Why did it take so fucking long for my fucking dickhead brother Ralph to start paying bills!?  
We took the dickhead off the streets of being Homeless and only now when the shit is hitting the fan does he fucking do something about it...  
Seriously this pisses me off so badly, this "session" of family business was just an excuse to yell at me...  
They can scream, "I care" all they want I know they are lying...  
Should I just make my fucking Suicide Note now?  
Because don't think I'm going to make it to the end of this year, I barely was able to do it in 2018...
