I want to die so badly.I hate myself and Iâ€™m ready to die. The only reason Iâ€™ve stayed was for my boyfriend but Iâ€™ve shown myself time and time again Iâ€™m an awful girlfriend and nobody deserves to date someone like me. I feel terribly bad for everyone Iâ€™m going to hurt but Iâ€™m done living for other people instead of myself. And I canâ€™t find one single thing to live for. I hope that my boyfriend wonâ€™t follow me because I know he has a great future ahead
