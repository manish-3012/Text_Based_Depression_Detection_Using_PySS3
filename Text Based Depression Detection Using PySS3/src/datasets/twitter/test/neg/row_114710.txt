I want to die all the time, its just the fear that stops it. It's getting worse and I dont have access to therapyI don't have any family except my partner and my mental health is ruining our relationship. I don't think it will ever get better. My partner is so stuck on me that they are willing to pour unlimited energy into trying to make me better but they can't because they are my partner not a professional pyschiatrist. So they try  to push me to fight certain things when they start happening and when I give up  we fight. I just want to not be afraid. I just want it to stop.
