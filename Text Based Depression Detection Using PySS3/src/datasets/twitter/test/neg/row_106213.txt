I want to kill myself but i'd feel incredibly guilty for my catsI've had suicidal thoughts for around 4 years straight now, but 2020 kicked me right in the ass and they've been worse than ever. Being autistic and having severe depression REALLY doesn't mix well.  Every time I see a high building i'm just like "damn.. wish my skull would crack when I hit the ground from jumping", but I have a fear of heights and i'm just a pathetic little coward in general, so this plan backfires quite often. I wanted to commit this year, I had it all planned out, but I can't bring myself too. This is because i'd feel guilty for my cats. Yes, my fucking CATS. Not my family nor my friends, just my 2 cats. I'm like a safeguard for them, they come running to me when they're scared and I don't want them to have no one to protect them anymore. I also hate knowing that they'd be scratching on my door to come in and the door doesn't open because no one is there. I'm just gone and they don't see me again. I don't want them to be alone or upset. They're both 9 years old, so I have no long it is until they go. I know it won't be long but I want them to have a good life even if I feel like i'm living in hell. I think i'll kill myself when they're dead so I don't upset myself more than I already am. They keep me slightly sane. I love them so much.
