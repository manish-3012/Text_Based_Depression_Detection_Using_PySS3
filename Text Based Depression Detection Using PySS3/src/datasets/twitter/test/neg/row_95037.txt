I don't even know what to sayI'm so lost right now and I just want to kill myself. My girlfriend consistently tries to help me and I keep ignoring her words for no reason. I'm afraid of the future and I don't want to go through college at all but if I don't I wont stand a chance in life. I feel like i'm never happy, I feel most people don't like me, I think i'm annoying. What is the point of going on when i feel so sick in the head everyday? People say what about your loved ones? But I won't be around to know and i'm sure they will get over it. If only killing myself was easier.
