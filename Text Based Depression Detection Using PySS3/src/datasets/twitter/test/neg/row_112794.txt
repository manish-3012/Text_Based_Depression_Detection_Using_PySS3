No one will help meI'm 17 and I feel like I've been trying to tell my parents that I need help in regards to my mental health for fucking years but they don't listen. I tried again tonight with my mom and she just boiled it down to "yeah I worry too, goodnight" and I just feel so alone and hopeless at this point idk what to do. I just need someone to fucking help me but no one cares. I just relapsed with self harm after being 40 days clean and I actually thought I was gonna make it a long time this time. I only sh on my legs usually but I cant help but think about how easy it would be to go at my wrists and end this nightmare right now.
