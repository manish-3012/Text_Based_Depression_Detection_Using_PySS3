Soon to be my last postI'd at least want to reach out to the single fellow that directly messaged me; I've never followed a faith but the messages can always be seen as applicable. It's good to know that maybe some people can have their mindset changed; even if it's just recitations of [a faith's] writings; or even general chit-chat.



I don't intend to contact anybody that personally knows me; as the thought that I even tried (should I fail) would crush them.


I'm currently awaiting to check through my 'check-out ultimatum'; disposing of drugs/paraphernalia and generally cleaning up; out of respect. 


Last of which happens to be whether I will be allowed to resit the year at university; it's the only thing that matters to me, even if I don't succeed again. I miss when life was easy. I miss when I could do what I wanted and get away with a lot more. We're all being crafted into the next generation of workers, which is fine, but I often feel like a mistake. I have no real marketable skills, I'm not good with other people and in the eyes of society, I'm just a junkie.


A few weeks ago after a bout of amphetamine psychosis I came around and deciphered a hand-written suicide note which has really resonated with me. I think this may be it with the time I've had to mull it over. I'm hoping for my opportunity to arise, but I'm ready to check out. I'm sorry to those that feel the same way; and to those that wish upon me sympathy that I really don't deserve.
