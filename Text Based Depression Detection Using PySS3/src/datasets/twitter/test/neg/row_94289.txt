I hate thisHonestly I don't know how much longer I can keep telling myself things will get better as long as I don't give up and keep pushing myself forward. Like there's some hope for me when I'm such an empty person. Every day it feels like the world's pushing me down a little more, and no matter how hard I push back I ultimately just end up deeper in this hole. Just what is the point, when will I finally not feel like a shell of a human with absolutely nothing to live for.
