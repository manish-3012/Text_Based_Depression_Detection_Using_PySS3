I'm just so exhausted.I just can't do it anymore I hate my self so much there is not a single thing about me I like I'm not even a good person I just do good things so people think I'm good and treat me better. My friends are amazing and my family truly love me but that just makes me feel stupid and selfish for being this way. I have never wanted to live, there is nothing I want to do, no goals, no aspersions, no knowledge I want to pass on, my girlfriend told me she was pregnant and we always discussed if it ever happened we would not keep it, but over Facebook she told me she was keeping it, I reacted selfishly and ask questions why as apose to how she was and she broke up with me no matter what I say she wants nothing to do with me. As cliche as it may sound she was the only thing in my life that made me want to live. On top of that I'm stuck working a 13 and a half hr shift in a bar that I hate. I don't drink alcohol, I have been drunk 7 times in my life but I'm sitting here talking fucking shots just to feel the burn as it goes down and to pass out and wake up somewhere other than this or hopefully not at all. All I want to do is sleep, forever, quite and on my own.
