I'm really scared and feel I'm running out of timeMy suicidal feelings have been really intense the past two weeks. For over a year now I've been suffering with depression, anxiety and BPD and have had periods where I've felt really bad, but right now feels the worse. I feel like I can't do anything but disappear. My boyfriend is getting sick of listening to me, and last night I snapped at him and said I didn't want to talk to him any more. I feel really alone, as he's the only one I usually talk to, but I feel by not talking to him I'll make it easier for him when I do kill myself. I need him to move on so that I don't feel so bad about doing it. I feel really hopeless and I can't even put what I'm feeling into words. I just want to disappear but I can't, I can't get out of my head. I don't know what to do any more but end it.
