My story could be yours tooSo I'm posting this here to help prevent suicide

A couple weeks ago I tried to kill myself,and failed,luckiest thing that ever happened to me.After that I started to realize how good life can be.I took up a few hobbies,and here I am,no longer depressed.People,before you do whatever it is you're planning,look into life a little more,and ask yourself "do I really want to die?" please consider life again,you're all great people.
