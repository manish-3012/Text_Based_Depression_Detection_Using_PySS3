Ive never felt what you would call depression my life was turned upside down cos my long term  relationship failed finding out my x started sleeping with my bestfriend no less thena few weeks after and all my belonging being halfed with her and just life after

All i keep thinking about is how everything I knew has failed and the one thing i had was this and its fucked now so I'm just falling in my head and i keep thinking about killing myself i know its wrong I know it solves nothing I know it will make things worse for all i still care about but I just don't know how to act anymore
