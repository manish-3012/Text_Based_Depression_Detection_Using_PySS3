never been so ready...I have been suffering through major depressive disorder for 6 years now. It hasn't gotten better and it's progressively getting worse. I never thought I would get to a point where I have a plan, but I really think I am going to attempt. The fact that my depression caused me to fail a course that I was doing so well in first semester makes it all worse. I don't feel like I will ever be a productive or normal part of society. Next weekend I am renting a hotel and I'm going to do it. I really can't handle the pain.
