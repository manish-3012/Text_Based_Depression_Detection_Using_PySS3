Will an air embolism in the arteries hurt?Iâ€™m not sure if I can ask this here, but Iâ€™m not sure where else to post this... 
How much pain would a self inflicted air embolism have?

Iâ€™ve been suicidal since childhood, and after 20 years (since my first suicidal thoughts) I canâ€™t help but to think life is suffering.
Iâ€™ve tried many times, but Iâ€™ve always had someone who could safe me or found me while I did a suicide attempt. Iâ€™m still not sure if I hate it, or if Iâ€™m thankful. 

I really donâ€™t mind dying, even right now. My life is going quite good, things are looking good and great, but I still donâ€™t really feel like life has anything to offer me. Life is suffering, and Iâ€™m so fed up with that. I used to find the same thoughts with many of my friends, but they managed to commit suicide and at this moment Iâ€™m the only one who hasnâ€™t succeeded. 
One of the people who I met recently (he doesnâ€™t know about my suicidal thoughts) said that making your own gun is not that difficult (a more painless way to kill oneself), but Iâ€™m from Belgium, so making your own gun or taking your life by gun is not really an option. 
I donâ€™t really care about the pain which might occur during the suicide, but I really wonder if a self inflected air embolism would be an easy way out. Easier than making ones own gun I would expect.

Is there anyone who knows what the pain would be while having a self inflicted air embolism? Google doesnâ€™t really give any answers, so I thought of all places, Reddit might give some insight on this topic.

If Iâ€™m posting this on a wrong subreddit, Iâ€™m really sorry, I do not wish to offend anyone,  but the question has been on my mind for so long, and I donâ€™t have any friends to share it with anymore, so I thought asking here might clear some of the questions I have.

Sorry for my bad English, itâ€™s not my first language. Thank you in advance.
