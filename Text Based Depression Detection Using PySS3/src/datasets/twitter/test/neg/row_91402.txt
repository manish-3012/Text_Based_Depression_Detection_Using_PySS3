I've been cyberbullied, harassed, and I have had enough.I am broken. I am shaken up by recent occurrences in my life and the life of those who I consider to be pals. But most of all i feel a persistant ache tugging at my crumbling heart. I appreciate the kind words I recieve from internet strangers, but their compliments are elmers and I am in need of gorilla glue to keep my shattered mind in one piece. I might do it, I might not. But boyo, I have considered, and boyo may the afterlife be lively.
