I finally got my first job and I want to kill myself more than before I think.For the longest time, I've felt like a burden and a piece of shit because I hadn't had a job yet. My fiance is a full time student and I just do nothing. 
Well I finally found the all important job that is required to feel adequate in a capitalist shitshow like America. 
It hasn't changed much. 
Everyone keeps telling me how proud they are and how excited they are.
I don't feel anything.
I got my first paycheck and there was no big moment of "wow I earned this, that's so cool"
It was just money that happened to be in my account suddenly.
I've noticed that I don't find anything inspiring or beautiful anymore.
I used to just be in awe of the sky here and lately it doesn't even phase me anymore.
I can't do photography anymore.
I either don't have the time, and when I do I don't feel like it because I'm so sore from work and standing all day.
I don't see my friends anymore, I don't even talk to them much anymore.
I can't make plans with anyone because my assigned schedule doesn't mean shit because my manager just changed it whenever he wants to.
My depression is getting worse, I can feel it.
But it doesn't matter, because I have a job which is the only thing that matters.
If I kill myself, then at least I won't go back to being a burden.
