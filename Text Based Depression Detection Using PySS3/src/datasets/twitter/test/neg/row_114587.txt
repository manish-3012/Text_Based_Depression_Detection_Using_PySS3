Im a 13 yr old male and i chose my expiration dateIm a really stupid person and i did some unspeakable thing in only thirteen years i feel so hopeless and depressed. I have only about three friends and i dont think they are even my real friends but i'd rather not talk about that i got a couple of things i want to get off my chest i really hope this doesn't go viral. when i was 7 i raped my 6 year old sister i know she knows but we act like it never happened i think she just want to have a regular life but i feel like things be way better if would've never been born .when i was 9 i nearly killed myself but my mom called an ambulance and saved me i stabbed my self in the stomach and passed out my sister found me and screamed thats when my mom came in and call an ambulance. at the age of 11 i hit someone with a text book and got sent to an alternative school(we dont stay the night there) i took a knife to school one of my "friends"at the time told on me and i got in trouble .at 12 i started to get these hallucinations i thought i had gotten a girl pregnant in my head she had an abortion and that still has me depressed i know its fake but why does it feel so real. when i first turned 13 had a sleepover at my house and one of my friends wanted to touch my sister in the rapey way so i went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife i nearly stabbed him but my mom grabbed me and slapped me. after thatÂ  i lost control i wanyed to die so badly. i made up my mind im killing my self on cristmas eve i got it planned out because i know that nobody will be awake during that night so i will slit my wrist i cut myself before so im guessing it wont hurt im just sorry to my mom and sister
