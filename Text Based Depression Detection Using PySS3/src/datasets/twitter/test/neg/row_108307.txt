It's all piled onI've had OCD and GAD my whole life, and recently have had very severe depression. I started college in August. I had a good group of friends. I started feeling down and I opened up to one of my new friends. I freaked her out and we don't talk much anymore. I don't know if she told them or if they just don't like me, but everyone else in my friend group has been being cold to me and doing things without me. I broke my ankle a few weeks ago, so now things that would help my depression(exercise, getting out to eat healthy meals) have become impossible. I have a long term girlfriend and a good friend from high school here and they help me with my mental and now physical problems, but I just feel like a complete burden to them and things have been tense. I don't really have the drive to do anything, including going to class.
