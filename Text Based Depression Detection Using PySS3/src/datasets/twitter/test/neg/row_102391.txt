My goodbyeI turned 18 years old today. I am a terrible person. I recently felt like I have hurt many people. Too many. I wish I was never been born. I don't deserve everything I have. I have been talking with therapists and they don't seem to care. I think I'll drink too much so people just think I am having fun. But actually, I am attempting to kill myself with alcohol. Vodka enough at my place. If I die it's on my birthday. 10 hours left to die on it.
