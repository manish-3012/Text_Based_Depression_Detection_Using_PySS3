Iâ€™m just writing here to try and distract myself from what I really want to do.The last few days all Iâ€™ve thought about is ending it all but Iâ€™m too scared to do it and it makes me feel like such a coward. Because I know if I could just man up and do something I could easily make all this go away. I donâ€™t remember when I posted here last but nothing has changed. Still struggling to get a job at all due to lack of experience and social skills due to years of me isolating myself from the world. My mum pretty much looks as me as a nuisance in her life and my sister has moved out two days ago. She was my only support and now I feel more alone than ever. My mum has gone out partying and Iâ€™m stuck here in the house as I usually am just laying in bed trying to distract my self. I spend all day hoping to find a date online or find a job and every day I go to sleep with the same dejected feeling. Iâ€™ve had two interviews in the last few months and that was it. Iâ€™ve been so broken before I had to go to the hospital but they barely helped me at all. Now I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel more alone than ever; more sad than ever and Iâ€™m just scared. I want to die but I too scared to do it so Iâ€™m stuck in this stupid limbo. I have no idea what to do.
