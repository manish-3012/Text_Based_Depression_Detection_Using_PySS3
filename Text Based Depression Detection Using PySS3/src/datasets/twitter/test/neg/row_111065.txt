Fuck it, done with Throw-away accountsI need something.. Someone... I'm not going to make an essay for you all to read just for sympathy, but I just wanted to try reaching out to reddit. 
I don't really know what to say other than I am in a deep depression, it has been eating at me for the majority of my life, atleast to what I can remember.

I don't really have many set friends, aside from a few that i try to talk to about this sorta stuff, but to this point I guess I am just annoying them with my pettiness. I have tried reaching out to my friends, my family, everyone, they all just brush it off, or they just ignore me now.

Tonight Ii have tried contacting many friends over texting,fb,league of legends, wherever I usually talk to them. Each time we start out with a normal conversation, and when I try getting to talk about my feelings I either shut down completely and change the subject, or when I do talk about it, they just ignore me, like they don't want to put up with me.

Idk what to do, I need someone to talk to, Or someone to listen to with the same feelings, whatever.
