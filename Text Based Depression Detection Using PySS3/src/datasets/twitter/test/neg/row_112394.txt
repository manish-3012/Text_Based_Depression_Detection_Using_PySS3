Plotting my death30 year old female, reconnected with my father after 16 years of silence and his whole family after molesting me at 13. I moved in with the devil when I had to come home during the pandemic from another country after a year living there. 

Came home broke my foot, dad started messing with me, got me pregnant had an ectopic pregnancy, his wife got an order of protection against him. Judge ruled to kick me out, two nights ago dad and I got into an argument, I ran away and sat in a cold wet field behind a post office.

The police brought me to a hotel, I got a car rental and drove to stay with some family on his side. No job, no future, highly contemplating suicide. My mom wonâ€™t help she wishes she aborted me.

Trying to research painless ways to end my life. Tired of feeling disregarded, my family got me a job at a warehouse handling packages,... More of a reason to end my life.

Thatâ€™s it. I am done. Whatâ€™s the point of life when all you are is alone. My dad has taken Everything from me. Iâ€™m broken.
