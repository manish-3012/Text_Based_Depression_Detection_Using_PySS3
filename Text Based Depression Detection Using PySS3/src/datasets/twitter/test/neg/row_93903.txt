Hello reddit, this morning I got confirmation that a friend of 5 years committed suicide.I truly did not see it coming. I am in shock right now and it feels like my heart has shut down. 

She suffered from epilepsy for many years . The doctor gave her about 3-4 months left to live before the severity of it overtook her and a fatal injury occurred. Unfortunately she decided she couldn't wait for her possible death and ended her life. 

I don't know what to do. I feel numb, lost and broken. I'm not suicidal or depressed.. Just sad. This is my 3rd friend I've lost to suicide.. And this one has probably hit the hardest. 
I'm sick.. Sad and hurt. 

I'm lost reddit. Lost for words and feeling. I wish there was something I could've done to help her.. No one deserves to end their life in that way..
