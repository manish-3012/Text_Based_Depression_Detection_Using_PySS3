Suicide feels like a dignified exit from an increasingly inhumane worldHuman societies are the most fragmented theyâ€™ve ever been. Everybody has been commoditized, you are an employee judged by the level of â€œhuman capitalâ€ you can provide a company before you are a person. Executive and investor interests take precedent over the well-being of 95+% of the planet. 

The insidious-ness is so far reaching it permeates everything. Weâ€™re told status is everything. And yet high status is completely unattainable for almost everyone from the moment theyâ€™re born. â€œWork hard, hustle, grind,â€ are the supposed ingredients for a good life, yet the end result will leave a person no happier than the person with literally nothing. Everything is a false promise designed to get you to shut up and produce and/or consume.

Iâ€™m tired of being an â€œemployee,â€ or a â€œconsumer.â€ Iâ€™m tired of being a single line in a near-infinite database. Iâ€™m tired of being the subject of market research analytics. Iâ€™m tired of people refusing to see how it actually is. And Iâ€™m god-damned tired of being told suicide isnâ€™t worth it. Because as far as mental health goes, weâ€™re trending downwards, getting steeper and steeper with each technological innovation that leaves us further encumbered by the heavy, soul-crushing weight of a world designed to appease a minuscule few.
