My safe space got taken awayThe gym was the only thing that gave me happiness, a break from life. Today after I was done with some equipment a guy came up to me and started arguing with me why I didnâ€™t clean it after I was done

I told him I understand his point and not to be angry with me, but he just kept yelling and talking about how he works for the government and how he canâ€™t risk catching the coronavirus from my dirty hands. I kept telling him I understand, and I will clean it next time but he just kept screaming at me 

My mind doesnâ€™t know how to take aggression from other people. I want to kill myself. I cut myself really bad this time, but it gives me the only positive thing I feel
