Backed out in the last moments of 2019, Happy New Year I guess.I had everything planned, parents not at home, my second suicide attempt at midnight into the new year (Corny I know) tied the rope around my throat but in the end, I was too scared to commit. its 1:10 right now and I'm alone in my house just thinking about what I just did, and I made a point to at least make a post to let some steam out. It's just a shit 18 years of existence, constant loneliness, and constant depression without anyone to talk to about how I feel. I can't remember ever being happy and with the New Year celebrations I just end up feeling worse. I just don't know why I can't commit to killing myself and just getting it over with.
