Thank you for helping me standingThis is not a sad message. It's just a goodbye. Some months ago i wrote in here, desperate to die, and some people cared. I just want to say thank you to these people.

This is the end of the line for me, finally I've got enough meds for doing it without been afraid of the predying phase. Tonight, I will take my care, drive 200km away and go to sleep. Finally, after all these years, I will have some peace.

Thank you for what you do in here, I really hope the world and you people get better in time.

Goodbye reddit
