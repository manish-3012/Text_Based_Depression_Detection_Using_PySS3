ECT Question (Electro Convulsive Therapy)Curious how many people here have tried it.

Personally I did for awhile, and it was one of the only times I ever felt truly â€œgoodâ€. Unfortunately Iâ€™m no longer in a position where I can continue treatment (I have to drive a couple hours to another City to do it and I have to bring someone with to drive me back which means we both miss work).

Iâ€™m curious about otherâ€™s experiences with it. Was it helpful to you? How did you feel? Which method was used on you and did the loss of memory impact your life negatively?

My experience was good. I did a more advanced version of the procedure which caused a LOT of memory issues. But other than that, 100% worth it.

Also if anyone is curious about it, I can give some info about my experience but your psychiatrist can also explain it and help you find a hospital that does the procedure (and hopefully is local unlike mine).
