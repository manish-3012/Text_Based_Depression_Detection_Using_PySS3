Im killing myself tonightI just got caught for self harm and my parents were not happy. My father turned it on himself and said I am making him a failure of a father. I have 2 real friends who are seperating themselves from me. I try to be outgoing but I just end up being weird. Same thing with dating. The girls either straight up reject (no problem with that btw) or ghost me. The only things I enjoy are anime, videogames, and animals but thats only on a good day. My religious leaders are pushing college or a mission but i dont have an interest in either. Plus nobody I know actually understands depression they think you can will youreslf out of it. I good throat slit should be enough to end my misery. Thanks for the fun times reddit.
