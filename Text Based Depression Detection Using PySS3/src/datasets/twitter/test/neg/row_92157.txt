I just dont know what to doAll my friends are ahead of me in everything, I'm not very masculine in any way, my mom used to yell and punish me for having stress spasms, my dad said that I made him depressed, my parents constantly won't let me speak or just dismiss any of my problems by saying that I have it so much better than them, my mom said I was destroying the house and everyone in it, my younger brother makes fun of me when I have stress spasms, I have terrible self-confidence and I lost my only source of confidence after I started getting lower grades last year (far from failing but it still affected my confidence), I have terrible anxiety/stress, my parents love my siblings way more than me, I got constantly locked in my room for sometimes days for doing the tiniest of things like putting away toys that my younger brother was using, I know what my parents did wasn't that bad compared to others and they have gotten better but what they used to say and do still hurts, and all of this has made me just wanna give up on life.
