I want to do it, too much painI can't do this anymore. I'm not good enough. School is an issue.  I have no friends and whenever I get any I get betrayed or backstabbed. I've resorted to try and find people to talk to on the internet,  but it is too toxic even worse. I don't know,  I hate the name calling,  the disrespect and I hate myself. I'm in a quandary and I'm crying,  I can't.
