This is my (20F) last cry for help.I can't believe I'm here again. I wrote on this subreddit about 6 months ago and didn't think that things could be worse.

Here is that post in case you're curious:

I've really had enough.

I'm lonelier than I've ever been. I don't have anyone to talk to and saying I'm overwhelmed is too much of an understatement. 

I really need help because I don't want to feel this way anymore. I can't type anymore, my mind is racing.
