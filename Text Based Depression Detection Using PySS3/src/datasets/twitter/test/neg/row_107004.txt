What should I do?I am 33m, diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, Severe Generalized Anxiety, Severe Insomnia, Major Depression with recurrent suicidal tendencies, Diabetes Neuropathy, and general intense pain through my whole body due to several attempts to end my life which involved car crashes and jumping off a building. 


I've been on everything, for years. Nothing seems to help. I have tried the medications. I have been hospitalized about 8 times now. I have thried a psychologist and cognitive behavioral therapy. I have lost 100 lbs, went out of my way to socialize, tried to improve my life. I had hobbies and dreams. I even managed to get into a handful of relationships all which ended badly as they just took advantage of me and my money and all 4 of them went back to their ex after a while. I ultimately gave up on work and relationships. I don't enjoy my hobbies. I have no dreams or desires. I lost all my money trying to buy happiness in games and alcohol. I keep thinking about ending it all. I have no reason to keep going except not hurt my family, but even they are sad and hurt because of my life. 


I am having thoughts about suicide. I have the plans. I have the means. This time I have ways that can't fail. I know I can go through with them if I ultimately decide on it. The other option is to go to the hospital again. But would that solve anything? It has failed me half a dozen times before. I have no friends to talk to, since they all got tired of my "moods" and "fake" attempts to kill myself. They slowly ghosted me until I stopped hearing from them. They don't answer any of my texts. Talking to my family just makes them feel like shit and I don't want that. They also give some horrible advice like "pretend you are happy and one day you are" or "don't feel depressed" which are annoying. I don't know what to do. I feel defeated. My last attempt was like a week ago or so with my insulin and all it did was make me feel like shit for a while then ok then back to shit then ok, until it leveled out. My body kept producing glucose somehow every time it dipped. 


I plan on driving to the beach, getting drunk, and jumping into the water. I don't know how to swim. I'd do this at night and isolated. Also planned on buying a cheap gun with what I've been saving and shooting myself in the woods. Or simply piss off the wrong people or cops. But that one is not 100% sure. Should I go to the hospital again? Talk to parents? Go with the plans? I don't even know what I want to do
