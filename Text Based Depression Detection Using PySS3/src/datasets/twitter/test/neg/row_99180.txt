No more. Just no more. It is time.I'm just so tired of it all. Misery, poverty, a terrible home life, mental illness, and the inability to improve anything simply due to lack of money.

It's clear that I can't escape any of it in life. Death is the only escape. There's no other way. I have a method picked out. I want so badly to go through with it.
