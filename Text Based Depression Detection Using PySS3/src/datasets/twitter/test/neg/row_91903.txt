My advice after 8 years of existential depression/how to find meaning/how to find happiness/why you shouldnt kill yourself/how to deal with the limits of the human condition and the mediocrity of society"Meaning can be obtained through
pleasure,

through a sense of legacy of leaving something behind,

of attaching your identity to things that will outlive you,

of believing in a religion because all of them promise a survival of our consciousness,in some form or other

of waiting for a technological immortality which wont be afforfable because of overcrowding considerations


Life can be seen in the positive light like this:
as the only chance to do what you want ,the only chance to vibe with a friend,to see a sunset,to get high or just to exist,to drink a cold glass of water on a hot day,
you are the result of an unbroken link of life, billions of years old ,with an even rarer goldy locke- likeÂ  background of conditions ,that could be extended as far as the laws of physics ,that allow this universe to exist.
You live in the best time historically ,no king has ever had the luxury you have,life expectancy,life quality,this spectrum of experiences andÂ  sensations,most peacefull period in history, music,other cool people shaped by theese nice conditions,all the human knowledge at our fingertips,psychedelics etc.

life is linear from 0 to 0Â  whatever you do in the end doesnt matter,but since you shouldntÂ  kill yourself ,since you die anyway ///you do what you can and the rest doesnt matter 

Â  
If you learn to embrace stoicism and underestand that happiness shouldnt be the main goal of your existance because,you are just thrown in a context,you are influenced by powers far more reaching than you, because this is not your world,people just joust for position to get bread on the table,of course not every whim will get fullfilled.

If you learn to want ,but to be free of the outcome,or to not want some things at all,you will become happy.


There is nothing youre going to be doing thats gonna radically change how reality or existence works aside from your own perceptions
+use out of sight out of mind/or optimistic illusions if you have to

Emotions are low resolution solutions to problems that cant be computed 

Learn neuroplasticity,learn about how the dopaminergic system works: that you only feel happiness if you have a purpose and are closing in to that purpose,that evolutionarily youre built so the pleasure of advancing toward the goal is more intenste than the pleasure of really achieveing it, so that you keep striving,
it is advantageous to keep busy; in a world where everything keeps evolving you must run as fast as you can to remain in the same place

Learn about the psychological article bad is stronger than good,and how were evolutionarily built to percieve better longer and more intense the negative stimuli,coupled with the realism achieved when being pessimistic(arguably the most calibrated to reality worldview possible)

Learn to not be driven crazy by things not going well ,especially after years of effort,Ceaser's death,a flood or a fire are the best examples, every action is like a coin toss at each throw the chance is 50â„…,it doesnt matter that it came tails for 9 million times in a row,
it doesnt matter that ,through effort and strategy and discipline and whatever you did ,it came tails for years ,at some point itll be different,destroying everything you built, realise that it was the wrong exprctation all along,thinking that things will HAVE to work out,solely because of your wish and track-record.
This is what we do,we consume order and we rearange the previous order- to surive and occupy our time after thats achieved,through constant effort and managing conplexity as we can.

One of our species superpowers is to adapt,if youve studied psychology or evolutionary theory this is an axiom.As such ,the hedonic baseline (happines),is one of the most important informations,we revert back to the mean no matter what happens, if we win the lottery 
or almost get killed,it will always go back to the mean,the more time you have spent feeling bad the more youve skewed the baseline (cat videos have their purpose as well ,not just philosophy,dont feel guilty and take all the worlds pain,from all cultures and all historical periods on your shoulders).

death is both a release to my pain and an end to my joy

Emil Cioran On The Heights of Despair
Mitchell Heisman suicide note

the last two are the apex of human rationality,the last one's conclusion is that life is an irational force ,the result of the self preservation instinct and nothing more,if you can interiorize what i said eralier after reading this book,you will underestand that life is just a matter of perception and if you havent tried LSD,Psylocibin or DMT you will never underestand the power of this statement,and your probably an unknowing victim of depressive neuroplasticty.You will underestand that even if limited,you can choose to focus on the positive side,to be pragmatic,and encourage the thoughts that will get you to extract as much out of this chance as possible ,not just linger in the abyss forever with your very correct and missunderestood worldview.

Suicide should be an option when life is unlivable,
and be consoled you have that option as long as you live with probably no repercussions except complete cessation of everything,that being said human resilience cant be underestimated,and the storm of emotions of some life episodes shouldnt necesarilly be generalised."
