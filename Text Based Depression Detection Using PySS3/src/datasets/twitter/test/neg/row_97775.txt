I spent tonight sobbing face down on a church lawn... just waitingEither for someone to offer help or to be struck dead by lightning, I guess. Neither happened. 

I just feel like the little pilot light inside my chest was snuffed out, and there's no joy left in my life. I really don't want to feel like this anymore, and I can't see a way up. I've lost so much. Where do I go from here?
