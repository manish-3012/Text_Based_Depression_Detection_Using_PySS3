why is life so hardi donâ€™t know how much longer i can take it all, school, parents expectations, etc. itâ€™s never good enough. i doubt they even love me at times. everything i want in life seems so distant that it doesnâ€™t seem worth trying. iâ€™ve fallen off mentally and physically over the past two years... iâ€™ve forgotten what real happiness feels like. iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend, i donâ€™t know what love feels like, i donâ€™t have genuine friends, i donâ€™t know what a healthy friendly relationship is like.  god please help me i need it so much i donâ€™t want to do something drastic but itâ€™s coming to that point
