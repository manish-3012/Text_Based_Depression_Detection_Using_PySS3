One More DayI've posted many times before on r/anxiety, r/depression, and here on r/suicidewatch. Occasionally, I'd post a morbid, but truthful response on r/askreddit to see what the average joe had to say.

I'm not going to go into details about my situation right now. If you're curious, either ask specific questions so I don't have to retype many paragraphs, or dig up some of my previous posts.

Anyway, to sum it up, I've wanted to kill myself for a long time. About 3 years I'd estimate, although I've considered it my whole life. I've never sought real life help because I don't want to be stopped from killing myself, and I've never tried because I don't want to fail and be discovered. This all changed about a month ago when I discovered a method that didn't have as high a success rate as I like, but I have the materials, and if I fail, nobody has to know I attempted.

I haven't had an opportunity, but tomorrow night I'll have a 17 hour window where nobody is obligated to know where I am. This will give me ample time to kill myself, or alternatively replace the materials and hide any trace.

I just took a walk in the cold, and did a lot of thinking. I came to conclusion that I should still try and kill myself, and do one last consideration if it looks like I can be successful.

Tomorrow I will continue the normal routine of doing a bunch of school work, anxiety driven to continue to do well at this damn academy with an undesirable, equally anxious future ahead and nothing to look forward to but escapism.

I have a little over 24 hours until I will attempt. If anyone has anything I haven't heard or considered before, (and believe me, I've lurked the likes of these long enough to hear a lot,) I'll be willing to discuss it.

For the first time in a long time I feel as if I have power of my situation. I feel sort of happy. This is a passing opportunity, however - I won't be able to go on if I know I just passed it up. I need to try and kill myself - I want death so badly.

I don't care who I'll hurt. I don't care what I'll miss. I don't care what comes after death, and I certainly don't care what I'll leave behind. This action is illogical, but no more so than life itself. I do not need an explanation for my actions, any more than you'd question a man for choosing to get vanilla ice cream over chocolate. It is as much my right to die as it is my right to live. I'm going to kill myself tomorrow, or at the very least, I'm going to try.

EDIT: I'm still here. To whoever managed to trace my IP and call my school... thank you, I guess. I'm still kind of in shock right now, but it seems like things might get better. I guess I was unable to ask for help, but now the ball is rolling. Thank you.
