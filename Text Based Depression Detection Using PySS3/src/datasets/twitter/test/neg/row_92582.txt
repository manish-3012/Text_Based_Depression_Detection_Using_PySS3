I know when.So far, I haven't gone through with it. I know how I will if I decide to go through with it (asphyxiation in the garage). I know exactly what I'll say in my final letter because I've been saying it and writing it and basically just shy of screaming it to everyone for the last 3 years, and nobody will truly listen.

Very recently I've received some good news, and I know when part of this hell I've been living will end. 13 months. I can try to get everything in order by then so that when the time comes and it's at the "make or break" moment, I'll be ready for the permanent break.

Basically I found meaning in life and that meaning was ripped away from me 3 years ago. In 13 months, I'll be able to try and make that meaning happen again, to try and become whole again. If I can't, I can honestly say it will be THE most likely time I'll kill myself. Not when I was in jail, nor in the years after, nor losing all my friends and having no career or income and becoming the fattest I've ever been in my life... But all hinging on this one thing.

And that's okay. Because if it doesn't happen, I know it never will, and then there is no longer a reason to live. I know I will hurt others. I know it's a selfish decision. I know I could keep living and struggling and being unhappy. I've accepted my life up to this point, and accept my fate should things not work out. I used to believe that "there's always hope" as my ex used to tell me, but should everything count for nothing, then that's where my hope, and thus my life, will be.

I know I'm being vague, but frankly even here I would face judgement should I say what I want to say openly, and I don't want to explain myself or my situation.

I don't expect this to be read until after my death, if at all. I just wanted to get this out into words as it's been something on my mind lately.
