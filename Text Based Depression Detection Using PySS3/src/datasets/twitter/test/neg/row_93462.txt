I messed upI hate to be one of these people who are like 'teenager' or petty about relationships.

I tried to push always my boyfriend. I didn't want to. I wanted to focus more on my studies and my parents have engrained in my mind that boys are just distraction. I've been distracted with studies, even before I met him. I wanted to talk less to him because I've been finding myself talking and skyping with him more and more. I adore him but my automatic response is to push away people who care and love me. I told lies that I knew would hurt him so that I would give him reasons to hate me but he saw right through me. He pulled me back in. 

It's not the first time I've tried to push him away, but the first time, he reassured me. 

He's been nothing but support and understands me. And I am to him. He's depressed and have anxiety like I do and I've comforted him when he gets scared, he said I made him happy after a long time. I just like his company whether he's just sleeping and I'm studying or when we go silly to each other or one of us just rambles about shit. 

He fixed it up. We took a couple of hours off. He talked to me and said he understands. He said, if I still really don't want him, it's okay to just stop it. But I'm not okay with it. I realized how fucking stupid I am and swallowed my pride and I'm still lucky to have a person still want me after pushing him away twice. But then I realized I know things will not get back like it used to be. It will not be the same. We took a couple of hours off again while he worked and I continued studying. He called again on his break and said he's gonna try to gain my trust again. He said it'll take time but it's okay, he'll come up to it again sooner. That's when I know I messed up something good. I know it'll be hard for him. I would too it I was in his situation. He also wanted to know, if I still want him because I want him or because he's around? I honestly know what to say.  Want him because he's kind and he fucking understands me but a part of me doubts that maybe I only like him because he tolerated me and he's the only person that have seen my shit and still like me. 

All of these triggered my hatred for myself, why did I let my dumb brain entertain theses bad thoughts. As I talk to him I just started to scratch my knuckles. Enough to leave welts at it. It hurts but I feel like I deserve them. I wanted the pain. I deserved the pain. My head started hurting. I wanted to pull my hair out. The last time this happened, I gripped and scratched my hair line. I want to bash my head in to the wall. I want to puke. I feel like I need to puke. It hurts everywhere. I regret all I've said and done and I want the pain and regret to stop. I want to kill myself to stop the pain, to stop these feelings. I hate when this happens. I hate when I get too emotional I just have these thoughts and body reaction. I need a break. I don't want stress. I just want to sleep. Sleep will keep me calm. Part of me want to take a nap and wishes to die peacefully in my sleep. How do I stop these physical pain?

Yeah... Maybe I'll take a nap now.
