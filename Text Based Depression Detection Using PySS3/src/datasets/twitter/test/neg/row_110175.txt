A Good Dayim not quite sure how to word this. ive made an account primarily to make this one post. Early this year, i decided that enough was enough and i should probably just go forward with the end. as i drank at my second job on an off day, i was more and more ready for the end. as i made my walk to the bridge, i was stopped by a former boss of mine. i cried into his arms "why am i so weird" and he carried me to his car (leaning on his shoulder because i could hardly walk) and took me home. when i woke up in the morning, i was angry. i was so ready to go and he stopped me. that was in january and although ive made strides to better my situation, ive come to the realization that life isnt bad. life is wonderful, im just not fit for it. im not fit to have friends or family. theres just a disconnect between me and social life. ive had a lot of people try to hang out, but i cant talk about anything but my job. all i talk about is food and it is upsetting to me to know that i lack any ability to make a great friendship or relationship that isnt based on sex. which leaves me to my burden. ive decided that the 30th of this month will be my last day. im going to try and get my affairs in order and shop for my daughters birthday and leave a testimony for her and my family about how much i love them before i go. does anyone have any advice on this? this is also my first post, so i apologize if i wrote this wrong or anything. thank you
