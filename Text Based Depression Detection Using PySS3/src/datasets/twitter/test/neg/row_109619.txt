Not really suicidal anymore, just a bit unsettled at 
the momentIt feels a bit weird to type all this out, but the tl;dr is that I had an extremely vivid dream in which I was startled by my readiness to die. I'm not going to kill myself, this is not a high priority emergency post, just need some reassurance and to talk out what I'm feeling.

Background is that I attempted suicide a few years ago in college; I've been "better" since then. I haven't actively wanted to kill myself in a long time, but I still go through bouts of depression where I don't want to be alive anymore.

I occasionally take melatonin to help me sleep, which sometimes has the side effect of ridiculously vivid dreams. The other night, after reading [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/108fcr/you_get_to_listen_to_one_last_song_before_you_die/) on /r/askreddit (and commenting my own answer under my primary account, and thinking about it maybe a little more than I should have) I had one of the most real-feeling dreams of my life.

The particulars are unimportant (and embarassingly cliched from a writer's perspective) but it comes down to the idea that the scenario put me in a position in which I was critically injured and it would be socially acceptable to seek my own death. The AskReddit reference comes in from how in the dream I took the opportunity to listen to my "one song" before ending it. That's all... whatever. But what disturbed me most about the event was my thought process in the context of this narrative. Basically, it came down to a profound feeling of relief, with the thought that "Finally, I get to die."

It's a few days later, and I'm still kind of shaken by the whole thing. I'm not looking for answers or even responses, just seeing if it helps to talk myself through it all, and see if anyone can relate. It seems silly and childish to get this upset over what basically amounts to just a bad dream, but I can't deny that in the moment I felt those emotions so clearly, I'm still a bit flustered to admit I'm not as "over it" as I had hoped.
