I've lost everything.I spilled water on my laptop. My dad says it's unfixable. I didn't have a backup.

I've lost an entire film script, TV show pilot, novelette that was meant to be submitted for publishing in less than two weeks, and two finished songs.

And the archives of several years in my life. Including all that's left of my first girlfriend.

I don't know what to do.
