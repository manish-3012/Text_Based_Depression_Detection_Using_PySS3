Will this be enough to successfully kill myself via overdose?Iâ€™m just throwing a bunch of stuff together. 

I have:
- under a monthâ€™s worth of 15mg Mirtazapine, 
- a monthâ€™s worth of 25mg Quetiapine, 
-about 90-100 25mg Pregabalin, 
- an unknown number of Hydroxyzine and Lorazepam (probably 30-40 pills combined), 
- a handful of Propranolol, 
- 2 weeksâ€™ worth of 300mg Effexor XR, 
- 2 weeksâ€™ worth of Tianeptine (25mg daily),
- maybe 20-30 7.5mg Zopiclone 
- a ton of other medication for flu / headaches / etc.

How much will it take to successfully kill myself? What are the chances for me to pass out and die? Or will i be in intense pain and seizing / vomiting / shitting myself while on my way to dying? Please tell me, I canâ€™t do this anymore. Nobody takes my suffering seriously anyway so I might as well just get this over and done with since thereâ€™s no point in guilting myself to stay alive for people who wouldnâ€™t care if I was gone â€” otherwise they wouldâ€™ve taken all my cries for help seriously, right? 

Just tell me what needs to be done. I donâ€™t plan on just an attempt. I want this completed once and for all.
