Iâ€™m tired.My friend asked me how I was feeling today. I seemed slumped. Told her I was just tired. She offered me a mint. Nope, I had gum. Which I did. Thanks for the offer though. She asked me if I was sure? Yep. *yawns*

Not really, though.

Tired can mean a lot of things. I just want to be gone from this world. I canâ€™t tell my parents. I donâ€™t want to. I donâ€™t want them to think they failed me. I want to be admitted. Iâ€™m not safe for my own self. I just want to die so bad. So fucking bad. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m making this post.

I havenâ€™t been the greatest for weeks. Relapsed. Canâ€™t sleep. Iâ€™m so tired. So exhausted. Iâ€™d do anything to be out of here, nonexistent. fuck graduating. fuck taking care of myself. fuck everything.
