Life is a curse, it doesn't get better for tranny freaks like me, i'm killing myself tonight.Life is a fucking curse. nothing gets better it only gets worse and worse and worse and worse. Everything I've ever worked for has been stolen from me. I'm just a homeless unemployed tranny frankenstein monster freak that no one will hire for jack shit. I'll always be poor and homeless. i'm 30 i have no time left to build a future. everything is over.
I need to kill myself. Tonight I'm laying down on the train tracks. I'm sick of being a pathetic waste of life. I'm a fucking tranny monster and i need to die like one. No one will ever hire me. I have no future and I have no life. There is no life for me to live and I need to die. Life is suffering, life is a fucking curse.
