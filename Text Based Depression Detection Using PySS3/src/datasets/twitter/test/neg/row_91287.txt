Last 8 min of my bday 11:52Every year I always regret this day. Means another year has gone by and I'm still alive. I've tried to off myself before and after seeing what my family went through I told them never again. That hasn't stopped me from wanting to die. For 7 years I've thought this way. Cried into the black in bed asking, taunting, pleading with "God" to make it my last night/day. I'm tired, 24 years out of the 33 years of being on this Earth has been torture. From an abusive bio mom to going to Iraq (my mistake for joining) cheating girlfriends, loss of friendships, to the inability to relate with others thanks to my plethora of issues. I struggle with the thought of dying daily, and hope one day I'm the "unfortunate" one who is hit by a semi.

Today was shitty, my life is shitty but I've accepted I can't change my stars. I just wanted to say I'm still here. You can too.
