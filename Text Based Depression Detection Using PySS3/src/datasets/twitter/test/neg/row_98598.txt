can you choose to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital for depression/feeling suicidal?I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this question, but I really need help so I thought I'd try here...

So about 6 years ago, I overdosed in an attempt to kill myself, got scared, went to the ER then ended up in a psychiatric hospital for 4 days. Lately, I've been going through some awful stuff and all I can think about is killing myself. I don't think I actually want to die, but I'm really scared I might hurt myself or someone else. And the more depressed I get, the more appealing a stay in a psych ward seems- I seriously can't stand being around all the people at my school and I can't deal with my depression. I think it actually might help me to disappear for a couple days and get help. But I'm scared I'm going to try to kill myself so I can stay in a psych ward to get away from everything here ( I really want to leave my school, but I seriously have no where else to go). So, is it possible to admit yourself to a psych hospital? Or how can I go about getting help and getting away?
