failed plansWhen I was little I told myself I would kill myself on my 18th birthday. I was positive about it. Lived my whole life knowing I wouldnâ€™t live past 18.
Now Iâ€™m almost 20.  The past two years feel so wrong. I didnâ€™t do it then but I still feel like I shouldnâ€™t have lived. Like â€œmy timeâ€ has past but I didnâ€™t end up dead so Iâ€™m just here without any future.
I should be dead but Iâ€™m not and itâ€™s terrifying. I wasnâ€™t meant to live this long.
