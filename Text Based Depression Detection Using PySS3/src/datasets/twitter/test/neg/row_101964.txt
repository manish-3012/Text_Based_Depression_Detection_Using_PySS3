I may do it tonight.I feel like such a burden on everyone in my life. My girlfriend and I broke up and I thought it was the right thing to do but now she is miserable. I try to be a good friend and I fail all the time. The number of friends I have is slowly declining. I got really drunk this weekend and sent out annoying texts and Snapchats and Iâ€™ve had so much anxiety about it, even worse than usual which is bad. I hate the way I look and the only girl I am romantically interested in is in a long-term relationship that doesnâ€™t seem like it will ever end.

Iâ€™ve been thinking about it for a while.

I feel like donâ€™t really have a lot to live for even though I know I do.

If no one in my life reaches out to me to spend time or talk or anything tonight I will probably do it. I already have a plan. Iâ€™m not going to ask anyone for help because I already feel like so much of a burden.

I just feel like iâ€™ve lost all my hope
