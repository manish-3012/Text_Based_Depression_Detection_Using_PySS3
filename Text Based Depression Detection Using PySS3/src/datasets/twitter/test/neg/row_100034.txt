Iâ€™ve been suicidal for over half of my life, why continue?Iâ€™ve been sad and suicidal for as long as I can remember. Iâ€™ve been hospitalised, tried 20+ meds, seen a therapist for 5 years. 

Everyone has given up on me, I have less resources than ever now. My family wonâ€™t pay for regular treatment anymore, my health insurance wont cover me for mental health anymore, I donâ€™t have faith in my local NHS mental health team. 

Suicide is common sense, the smart solution. If youâ€™ve been this way for x amount of years, itâ€™s VERY likely that this mentality will continue in the future. 

I wonâ€™t kill myself tonight, Iâ€™m tired. But itâ€™s the LOGICAL solution, it makes such perfect sense I canâ€™t imagine thinking otherwise. One day, itâ€™s my life goal. 

I tried to kill myself on March 19th. My biggest regret is not taking more pills or trying again before my big stash of medication was confiscated.
