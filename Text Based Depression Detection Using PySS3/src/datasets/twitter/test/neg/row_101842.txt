I'm want to jump but I'm not brave enoughTo give a little context, my plan is to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge during the middle of the day. I'm not gonna try to hide my distress, I'm not gonna pretend like I'm okay, and if a single person asks me if I'm okay, I'm gonna beg them to help me fix my fucking mind. 

That being said I've been depressed for pretty much as long as I can remember and I decided in 6th grade that I didn't want to live. Fast forward several years, the thing that made me feel like I could stay was helping other people. I got into a pretty good pre-pharmacy program for uni and I'm studying to become an emergency medicine and trauma pharmacist. But I'm slowly starting to realize that I'm not equipped to help people and all I've ever done in life was hurt the people I love and care about. I made some bad decisions, which I don't really want to get into, but a lot of them hate me now and my reasons to keep going are slowly dwindling. How can I hope to help strangers when all I do is hurt loved ones?

Anyways, I want to jump, but I'm afraid I won't be able to. Some part of me wishes I hit the water, my organs rupture, and I instantly die, and another part wished that I hit the water, I get pulled out and I can start all over again.

I just don't wanna be able to harm anymore. I wanna fade away, be nothing, and never have to be someone else's problem.
