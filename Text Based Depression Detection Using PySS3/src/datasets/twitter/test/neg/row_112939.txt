HelpMy friend has posted a note on their private Instagram story yesterday, I only saw it it today, basically saying that this seems to be the end of the line for them after trying everything and says this may not be a suicide note but something might happen so obviously I am terrified. They say about how much theyâ€™ve been through and theyâ€™ve been in and out of therapy and they donâ€™t have anything planned for the future and nothing makes them happy anymore. 

They were online an hour ago. I just have no idea what to say to them to make them reconsider when Iâ€™ve seen firsthand just how much theyâ€™ve been through. What can I say to that?
