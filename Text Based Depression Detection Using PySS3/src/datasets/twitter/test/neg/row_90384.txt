donâ€™t know what to titlei donâ€™t know why im writing this i just havenâ€™t felt like myself in months. 

itâ€™s pretty much been getting progressively worse since my girlfriend of three years told me that she just doesnâ€™t love me or feel anything for me at all and completely cut me out of her life. 

people tell me that everyone has had breakups and that iâ€™ll feel better and there are other girls out there but itâ€™s clear that theyâ€™ve never felt like this. thereâ€™s a whole lot of other things in my life that makes me feel like everything is pointless but i could forget about all that stuff when i was with my girlfriend. honestly i hate how stupid it would sound to kill myself over a girl. 

my dad told me it would be so selfish for me to hurt myself but that really just made me feel like itâ€™s my fault for wanting to just disappear. 

honestly itâ€™s not the girlfriend part that hurts me. i can and have met other girls in the last few months. what really hurts me is that she was my number one best friend ever and was the only person who could help me through times like this. so now that she doesnâ€™t feel anything for me and doesnâ€™t care about me anymore, i have no one.

my friends are tired of me being sad all the time and iâ€™ve reached out to so many people but they kind of dismiss things after telling me some canned bs about other fish in the sea. and then theyâ€™ll stop replying because no one really gets whatâ€™s going on in my head

i cant even put into words the emotions im feeling about being so alone and surrounded by people. every day i wake up in pain. such immense pain especially when i have dreams where i feel normal. i wish i had never been born to disappoint my friends and drive the one person who truly cared about me to give up on me. im struggling to find any way to make this pain go away. 

i look to the future and every possible scenario, even the ones that people tell me in attempts to cheer me up, give me no hope at all. why continue living if the pain wonâ€™t disappear even in the ideal life? nothing will change and nothing has changed. itâ€™s actually gotten worse. i didnâ€™t think that there was worse but there always is. i wonder when the pain inside will outweigh the guilt id feel about hurting my mom when i kill myself. 

sorry for the wall of text. just donâ€™t know what to say anymore
