I wish people cared in the way I want them toI think people care and sometimes I know, but I can never feel it and itâ€™s the most isolating feeling ever. Intrusive thoughts will always be a barrier in my attempts to feel connected and wanted. The self hatred stemming from facets of my identity will stop me. Everyday I try to improve myself. Teachers at school feel cold. Students barely include me and I barely include myself. At the end of the school day, I break down and cry on the bus ride home. All the teachers and students cannot avoid the fact I am suicidal or at least depressed; past and current self harm scars are visible and Iâ€™m unable to hide because of their location. Most teachers know of my situation. Perhaps I feel lonely because in order to live I have to open myself up to everyone-Iâ€™m trans and out- and no one at the school matches that same intensity of vulnerability. At the same time, itâ€™s not like I donâ€™t talk to people. I try a lot and I do have a few friends, but they live out of state or not in my school area. Iâ€™m tired of not fitting in a conservative town.
