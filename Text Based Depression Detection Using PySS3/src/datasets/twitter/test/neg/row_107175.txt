Leap of faith into death...I've been through a lot for the past years... All I want to say is that don't kill yourself with dangerous methods, something's been going on I wasn't a crazy theorist when I went through shit but I gotta tell you there's been stuff going on on earth, something evil ....    
something that makes you go through s*** what I mean to say is things that make you sad and feel like shit was tailored by people wanting to live a better life (something to do with 'e')....    
All I want to say is they want you die and when you die really painfully they want to make you think you did it... And what's worse is that you after you've killed yourself you come back into life again to lead a probable s*** life and the same loop might continue...    
I've been thinking about methods leaving the world painlessly without coming back and it might have to do with constant unwilling will to live type of silence and it might break the codes we might have been implanted with which makes us feel like shit... Again it all has to do with limited resources or basically a f*** fest of people...
