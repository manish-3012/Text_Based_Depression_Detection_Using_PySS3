I'm done. This is it.I'm leaving Earth. I'm no longer afraid and I am not able to think of many things to live for. There are billions of humans in the world, what's losing one gonna do? 

I'm young. I'm stupid. Don't try to stop me. My friend might see this, so, hi Mackenzie. I'm sorry I broke the promise.

No. No longer will I suffer. I shall die by hanging because after extensive research, I think it's the best way to go that is accessible to me. So, yeah.

I have a few notes to write, and a noose to tie. You have 6 hours if you care to try and stop me. If you do, don't do it because you care. Nobody does. Not for me atleast.
