Breaking pointI deluded myself into thinking I was intelligent. I deluded myself into thinking people cared. I deluded myself into thinking I could cope with this. I can't. 

I need someone to talk to. For personal reasons, getting professional help isn't an option. It used to be "because there will be an immense amount of stigma from obtaining psychiatric in my future profession", but that isn't happening. I've been told repeatedly, and now I realize it's true: I'm not smart. I am not charming. I'm not likable. I'm not pretty. I'm not thin. I'm not fit. I'm not even mentally stable. 

I need to end this nightmare. I care about next to nothing else.
