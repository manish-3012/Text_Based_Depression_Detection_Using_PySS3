I just want to dieI have nothing. My family hates me. I donâ€™t have friends. I hate college. I hate my job. I donâ€™t enjoy anything.

Iâ€™ve been depressed and suicidal since I was 8 (Iâ€™m currently 21), and at this point it seems futile to keep living. I canâ€™t afford therapy and I donâ€™t have health insurance. When I spoke to the counselors at my university they told me I just need to get help. As if I can afford that. I can barely afford my living expenses.

Iâ€™ve tried to find a hobby, discover activities that I enjoy, exercise, draw, write, etc. but nothing makes me happy. I donâ€™t enjoy anything. I have no long term goals for the future because I have no interest in ANYTHING. The only thing I have going for me is school, and even that I find mentally and physically brutal.

I have nobody and I just want to die. I wish I could stop feeling like this. Is there anyone out there who can help me deal with these feelings?
