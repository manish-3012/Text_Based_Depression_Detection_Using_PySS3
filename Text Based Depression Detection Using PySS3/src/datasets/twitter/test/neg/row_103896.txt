Don't see a way out.I'm 21 years old. i grew up in an abusive household and now my parents expect me to care for them after I graduate. Even though they were horrible people, I still feel the need to care for them. They have dissociated from all the horrible things they did to me and now pretend to be the most loving parents. It's bullshit. I feel tied down to them. Even if I were to try to leave them, they would do everything in their power to find me. They immigrated to this country by themselves and have no one else in their lives. I'm also gay. They don't accept it (make a lot of side comments), but they won't disown me for it. I have body dysmorphia (weigh 103 pounds but feel 200) and believe myself to be physically deformed. The last relationship I had, I was left for someone else. All my friends are spread out across the country and I don't feel very close to them emotionally (skype and such but it doesn't feel the same). I feel extremely lonely. I can hardly remember any instances where I was truly happy in life. I'm graduating college top 10% of my class probably but will most likely not find a decent job. What's the point of continuing this. I I can't imagine things getting better. I think that no one will ever truly love me. There is nothing that I'm leaving behind if I kill myself.
