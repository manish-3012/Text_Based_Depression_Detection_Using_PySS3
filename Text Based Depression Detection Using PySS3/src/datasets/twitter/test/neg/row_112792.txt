27m, where to go from here?I've had depression, social anxiety, bdd and ocd since I was 17, and 10 years later the only things i've got a grip on is the ocd. My life is basically a long big fuck up interwoven with the occasional glympse on something working out, but soon ended by the inevitable setback. I didn't finish school when I was 18, wasted a couple of years in social isolation, managed to pull me through 3 years of evening school to get my A-grade equivalent, or whatever you do have in the US and only needed 3 hospitalizations and prolonged stays in a psychiatric clinic to do so. Now i'm supposed to finish my 5th semester in university, but really, it's my 7th real one if you count the ones during which I was hospitalized, and my depression is at an all time high again. I cannot force myself to do anything anymore. I've skipped most finals, I barely see anyone ever and I just find no joy in absolutely anything. My last and only relationship, if you wanna call it that was 6 years ago now, and it's increasingly hard to bear the lack of intimacy and emotional warmth. I'm surrounded by 21 year olds who manage to do university just fine, while also having a life besides, while I have nothing. I've bought a rope a week or two ago and tied a nice noose. Played around with it for a bit, but didn't get further than finding out that asphyxiation isn't a sexual thing for me. Yesterday I threw it away, but it's not hard to get a new one, right? Wish I could get a gun here. That would make impulsive actions a lot easier, and that's probably what I'd need...
