StuckI truly feel like the whole just talk campaign is bs. I tried to end it in April. I kinda wish I'd tried harder. The past 6 years have been horrible and all I'm really doing is waiting to die anyway. I'm sick. Like really sick with a genetic disorder and multiple autoimmune diseases. This causes me so much pain on a daily basis. I don't want to be here. My husband doesn't get it. He thinks I'm self absorbed. I'm also going blind. It's an inevitably of my condition. So soon my vision is going to go and I'll be alone in the dark crying in pain. I'm to much of a coward to just take the leap. I see my kids and man...they shouldn't watch me linger like this. I make everyone miserable. I've tried asking for help. Hello suicide attempt? No one called for an appointment. I guess they decided I was pointless to. Fuck. Just. Fuck. I'm so alone.
