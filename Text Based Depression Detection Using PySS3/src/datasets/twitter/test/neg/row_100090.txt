i cant deal with it anymoreI just want to end my suffering, ever since I've been on holiday I've been more suicidal than ever and I can't deal with myself anymore. I'm so lonely, I feel like nobody actually cares for me and my friends talk to me just because they're forced to. Only a few people ever text me, nobody willingly talks to me in school, I just don't feel like I have anybody and I can't deal with it anymore. I hate myself so much and I started cutting to numb the emotional pain and now I told my mom and shes the only person who I've told that can help but I still can't go a minute without thinking of how I'm gonna kill myself, what I'm gonna write on my note etc. I don't have anything going well for me in life. I'm less than 16 and I think I've lived through half of my life already. I'm probably gonna kill myself when my parents leave the house with my dads medicine.
