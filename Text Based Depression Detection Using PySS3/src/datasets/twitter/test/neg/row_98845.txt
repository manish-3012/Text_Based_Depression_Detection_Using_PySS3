Nobody cares until I'm about to do itAnd when I am about to do it they take me to the hospital which is social/mental deprivation and basically torture. There's no way for me to get help when I need it without being bussed to a fucking emergency room to be billed $1000. I'm nothing but a statistic and a piggy bank to break for money. I can't afford regular treatment anyways. I can't talk to my friend because he won't want to be my friend anymore if I keep talking about killing myself every time I see him. I wish I wasn't so alone. I don't know what will happen to my baby dog if I die. The world is cruel and nobody will care enough to take care of her if I die. That is the only reason I have to live, to find someone to take care of her when I'm gone. Of course nobody is going to care until I'm ready to do it and by then it will be too late. I'm not going to make the same mistake I made last time, I'm not going to tell anyone when I'm ready.
