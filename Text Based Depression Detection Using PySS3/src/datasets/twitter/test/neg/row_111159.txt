I thought about opening my throat an hour ago.Like, if we define "boredom" as "the lack of anything *meaningful* to do" then I am absolutely, positively bored. My life just lacks meaning. There isn't really anything meaningful enough to live for.

And so about an hour ago, I was home alone, and I thought about going up to my room and just killing myself. Is this what people mean why they say that they're "just a waste of space"? I feel that way. I feel uncomfortable in my own skin.

I don't know how to explain this to you without the usage of cliches. There's nothing to do with my life, I feel existentially bored. I just want to stop existing. I don't want to kill myself, but I really, really do.

I just don't feel anything. There's nothing to live for. I'm so sad.

Thanks for reading, I guess. I feel so lonely, but there's no one to talk about my loneliness to, because I'm alone.
