Wife is divorcing me and taking my kid. Itâ€™s because Iâ€™m a fucking loser recovering addict, I canâ€™t find work and every day is a battle. I donâ€™t know if I can even go on anymore.My first suicide attempt was at 8yo, I was just always unhappy and dealt with a lot of abuse and have major PTSD. Iâ€™ve gone through decades of counciling, have taken every anti depressant under the sun, but alas, I think this is the last straw. I just donâ€™t think i can take anymore abuse.
