Took blood thinners and a pack of blades and I stalledI bought 5 aspirin as it also acts as a blood thinner and 5 blades like a month ago to kill myself but as soon as I had everything ready I started stalling by giving myself excuses like I have to atleast see the season ending of parks and recreation or i have to atleast eat my fav ice-cream once more and i stalled some more till i have very bad day and i took all 5 aspirin at once and soaked my hand in hot water for 30 mins crying .

As soon my skin was butter soft from the water, i started cutting and i could soon see my veins and I started stalling again .

----------The point is if you are having suicidal thoughts seek for help in whatever way you want because you are just one bad day away from doing it!! .
