Im invisibleIm invisible. People stand close to me because Im more or less a non threat. No one gives me any personal space.

My hair is falling out.

Im more or less skin and bones.

No help, no support. 

No money. Just enough to eat a paltry diet of nothing. I could live slightly frugally, Not that it matters because Im squatting in an abandoned apartment with no electricity or hot water.

No real friends, incredibly difficult to form new relationships. Yes I can make friends, but the deep bonds I had were broken. Not just broken but torn and shattered to pieces. Not a single person helped me when I needed it. 

Look for work but not attractive enough. Havent worked in ages, a half finished Uni degree with no real qualifications and barely enough experience in my field.

This is ongoing. It started off bad and its become much, much worse.

Over the past two years Ive consumed a shitload of drugs and now theyve culminated in me having a non existent memory, a severe lack of concentration, and bad, fuckigfucking terrible effects that arent obvious. My articulation is getting worse, I cant remember basic words.

I go for days without eating because all I cant sfford food and the food I do get is shit.

IrrationaI, angry and frustrated all the time. Clothes stink because I cant wash them because no money.

Can occassionally take cold showers, but difficult.

Roam trains and trams most days. Purposeless and lost.

The problems keep stacking and they keep becoming more insurmountable. And they are. I solve one, two crop up in its place, and keep stacking on top of the mountain.

Stats keep saying my body will fail me. Even if I make it past 50, ill likely go senile and get taken advantage of.

I get frustrated, angry and I sometimes go into a rage, and I want to destroy shit. I want to fucking tear shit up and fucking kill and fuck people up. I flair up at nothing and I want to fucking tear peoples jaws off and watch the. bleed a fucki g slow death while I torture them.

I fester with resentment and bitterness everyday. I hate what others have, not because they have it, but because I could have had it. I was a bright, attractive individual and with just enough guidance I might have been in a different situation. 

Im a fucking husk of what I was and Ive only got myself to blame.

 Worse yet Im going to hell. Not because Ive done the wrong thing, but because I keep rejecting Christ. 

And there I will suffer endless agony and pain because I consistently turned away.

This is the way my life has been for a decade and I havent even BEGUN with how fucked its been. Theres a difference between viewing things through brown colored glasses and seeing shit and there's a difference between looking through clear glasses and seeing shit.

Im looking at it througb clear glasses and its shit.


This is a wasted life and all thats left is to be thrown onto the heap with the other worthless shit that exists.

Honestly this post isnt worth it anyways. This sub is filled with people with good intentions but no real way of helping.  Other than referring people to incredibly distant,  impersonal and unproductive suicide hotlines that do fuck all other than spew platitudes from a rehearsed and carefully monitored training program designed only to prevent the most presentable and solvable cases where direct intervention has an achievable outcome of getting people not to kill themselves, while the majority of cases go by the wayside, because having suicidal thoughts doesnt always equate to killing ones self.

Why even bother? Your resources would be better sepnt, be it time money or energy, working towarstowards preventing these problems.  Yet a closer examination reveals that these problems run so fucking deep with most caees the best you can offer will never be good enough. It takes more resources, and this is strictly non-monetary, than we have to even put a dent in a fraction of the worlds problems.

Try convincing someone theyre not worthless. Good, mission achieved. Now whos going to cradle and nurture that for the next year? Whos willing to put the time and energy into that, completely selflessly, all thethe while catering to each individuals nuances? its too much for one person to bear.

Why does this subreddit even exist?
