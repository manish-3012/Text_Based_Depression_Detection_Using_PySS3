I lost the only person that was there for me because I'm so depressed, and now I don't want to fight this anymoreI'm in college and my depression got worse the point I failed all my classes. The only reason I didn't kill myself was because one of my friends and I got a lot closer, I loved him. I still love him. But somehow his support didnt help, I still knew I needed to die because I had been avoiding all my responsibilities and everything is crumbling now. 

He left me because he said he didn't think we were good for each other, that I'm too messed up. He still wants to be friends but I dont know how I can talk to him again. He still wants to support me but I cant even look at him without wanting to hug him. I know that part of me, that part of my life is gone forever. 

And now I'm done. I've been "done" before, but I always got scared and never did it in the end. Classes have started, everything is a mess, I'm completely alone, I'm really done this time. Everyone always leaves me, I'll be doing them all a favor by just getting rid of myself. My will to live is completely gone, I couldn't even move at all yesturday, I stayed in bed in the same spot for hours.

The only thing stopping me now is the fear of what comes after death, I'm from a religious house so that fear of hell has been ingrained into me, but I'm not actually religious myself. So I don't know.

Another part, a tiny little part wants to still be alive, but that can't happen anymore too much has gone wrong. If I stay alive I'll be living hell on earth from all the consequences of my actions, so that tiny spark is fleeting quickly.

I just need the courage to do it, I need to stop thinking about what's coming next, because whatever it is I deserve it.
