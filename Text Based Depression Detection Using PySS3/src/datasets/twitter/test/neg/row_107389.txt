work / life in general feel so stupid and pointlessiâ€™m so, so tired. iâ€™m stuck waiting on a job that i may not even get and having to survive on a 10-hr a week job and doordash. my savings are empty. my roommates are giving me more and more anxiety each day and walk all over me for emotional support that i canâ€™t even give myself. my roommate gave me bedbugs. i canâ€™t move out because i canâ€™t afford to. i canâ€™t shake my stupid, stupid nicotine addiction. iâ€™m paying for adhd and depression testing that i can barely afford with insurance in the slight hope that i can get some kind of medication to help. iâ€™m practically failing a grad school program i donâ€™t even want to be in and canâ€™t get out of because iâ€™d have to pay my scholarship money back to the school. i just feel so, so stuck and every time i manage to make some money or do something right the money just disappears and something else goes wrong. i feel like such a burden on my roommates and my boyfriend. i want to die but i donâ€™t want to hurt my family and my boyfriend and leave my pets without a home. i just donâ€™t know how to keep going.
