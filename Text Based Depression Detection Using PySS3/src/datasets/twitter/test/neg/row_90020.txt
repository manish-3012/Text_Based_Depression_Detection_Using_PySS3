I've been lying to my therapist.Every time I go in, I fill in one of those depression/anxiety "how have you felt in the last two weeks?" questionnaires. It has symptoms of each illness listed and asks you to rate from 0-3 how often you've felt that particular way in the last two weeks. Zero is not at all, 3 is nearly every day. I answer them all truthfully... Except for the last question. "Do you feel that you would be better off dead, or have a desire to hurt yourself?". I answer 0 every time, and answer to the negative so quickly and sharply when asked that I would think I was lying if I heard it, but it's a 3. It's been a 3 for a very long time. 

I can't even be honest with the people trying to help me. Maybe I thought if I told enough people that I want to live I'd believe it myself. I don't know.
