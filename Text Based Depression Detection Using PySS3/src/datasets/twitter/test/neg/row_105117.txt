Being forced to take ineffective medication with extremely negative side effectsMy mother went to the doctor (**not psychiatrist**) and asked that I be prescribed to a stimulant for ADHD that she has decided that I have. No tests were performed nor questions asked. I forget the name of the drug but it doesn't matter. I have no choice but to take it, she watches me take it every morning and I am not allowed to eat until I do.

Before I was forced to go on this medication (for 2 years or so) I had struggled with depression. Recently (for 2 months or so) this has gotten much better. I've had a positive outlook on lots of things, I have been outgoing, I've been less of a struggle at home and I've developed a better relationship with... everyone.

Now that I'm on this medication, I cannot get more than 5 restless hours of sleep at night (insomnia was already a big problem) and can't wake up due to severe lethargy (which was also already a big problem). The medication does not help anything concentration-wise, it only makes everything worse.

I hate what it's doing to me. Since being on it I've fallen back into an old addiction, depression, self-harm, and thoughts of suicide. I've stopped talking to several people because I have nothing interesting to say. I can't do several hobbies, such as biking and rock climbing, because I no longer have any energy.

My mother is convinced that this medication will make it "easier to deal with annoying people" and "situations [I] don't like". It is a stimulant and is not meant to do either of those things. On top of that, she refuses to go to the doctor or a psychiatrist and find a medication that actually works. She complains about the cost and the time it would take.

I'll likely be dead, literally or just mentally/emotionally/spiritually in a few weeks if this doesn't stop. What can I do?
