A Cathartic and Anonymous NoteI've been dealing with issues my entire life, these last few months have expedited the inevitable in both my grief as well as the material accessibility to accomplish a means of taking my own life in a way which I feel is fitting of who and what I am, or perceive myself to be.

My country stands at a crossroads, either turmoil socially and politically culminating in the degradation of infrastructure and societal safety nets becoming the beginnings of the fall of an empire, or the coming months will be tense, stressful, tumultuous but ultimately the country will stabilize and life will continue with a semblance of normalcy. If the latter comes to pass, my usefulness in this world will cease. I am not an individual made for civilization, despite my ability to blend in and be a respectable and contributing member of society, abiding by laws and traditional decorum, I am in my heart a savage and a wild beast, born long out of time.

I have only a small handful of people whom I deeply care for, people who have similar concerns as mine regarding the future, but people who do not see me as someone who can be a part of their lives. This fact is the final proverbial nail in my coffin, especially considering that I had not known a home or felt sincere love until just a couple of years ago. I don't immediately plan to take my life, if the society I live in does have a collapse in the near future, I have the skills and tools to allow the aforementioned people to hopefully be safe, and trying to help create that safety for them, and so I wait until I am needed and am useful.

If I am not needed, which despite my concerns about the future, is the most likely outcome, I will pack up my vehicle, give away to whomever the belongings of which I have no need, and drive west until I find high mountains as far as possible from the civilized world. There, I'll set up a small camp and begin scouting the area. Once I manage to track down signs of a fully grown grizzly bear, I'll follow it and provoke it with only my hands and feet to defend myself. If anyone is unfamiliar with the grizzly bear, search it up, even the world's most skilled prizefighters wouldn't have a chance in hand to hand combat against such an animal.

I've fought my entire life, whether the environment or people or society itself, fighting has always been my nature. Because unless there is a need for me by those whom I love, I have no desire to continue fighting, I am tired, so tired. Despite my tiredness, I feel that it is proper that I die as I have lived.
