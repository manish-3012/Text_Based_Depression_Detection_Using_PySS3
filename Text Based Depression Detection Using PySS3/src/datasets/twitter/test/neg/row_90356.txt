I am a horrible person and I can't stand myself. I want to die do badlyI'm 19. never had a girlfriend, never travelled outside of South USA. I can't find a job, and even then I don't think I can handle getting up and going somewhere... My very existence causes my brain and chest to feel as though they are being stabbed. I have been diagnosed with mild autism, Schizophrenia, Depression, and Borderline Personality Disorder... I hate myself so much. I can't even feel sorry for myself. I can't bring myself to believe that I'm worth loving at all. I'm addicted to porn, which hurts so much. I can't stop, but when I do it I feel a crushing weight on my chest, like I've killed someone... I've done many terrible things, which I will not go into detail about...I just want to be free. I'm afraid of life, and I know that it's just going to get worse. I have no friends, nobody... I'm completely alone. I'm scared, I'm lonely. I just want someone to hold me... I want to die to badly. But I know that there is likely a special place in hell for me.
