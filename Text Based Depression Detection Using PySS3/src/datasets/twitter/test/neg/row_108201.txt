I am ready to go.I am trapped, and I do not know how long I can linger on. Earlier today I ordered some meds and some other substance that will arrive in few days, and I have started writing my letters to my closest ones.

I have been haunted by my past, and I do not know if i can deal with my memories anymore. I have been living in a constant fear these years. In the same time I dont even know if there will be a future for me.

I am gay, and I am an asylum seeker due to my sexual orientation. Due to the immigration crisis in 2015, immigration in europe basically has been turning table, they basically reject and deport everyone except the one from syria. Being back to my home country is not an option, unless i want to be jailed, going to conversion therapy or being exorcist, or being mobbed by the locals. To be honest, I prefer to die in dignity than being sent back there.

I dont know if this life is worth fighting for, I do not know if i want to be alive if I ended up in jail or being mobbed by the locals. While most people having a huge dream, my only dream is to finally find a place that i can call home, and if they did not allow me to live in peace, i dont really mind to rest in peace.

Now tell me, is there any reason why I should stay alive?
