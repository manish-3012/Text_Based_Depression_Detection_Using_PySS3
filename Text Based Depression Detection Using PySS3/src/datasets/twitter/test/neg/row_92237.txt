I don't think I'll make it past this summerI'm 15M and I just can't keep going on. I'm home alone all the time, I have no friends that want to see me. I feel so alone and isolated. I hate it here, there is so much tension in my family and I've been pushed, punched, called a retard, a dumbass, gotten daily insults by my father, had to endure my parents fighting and my dad screaming at me and everyone else. Everything I used to do to stop me from feeling suicidal stopped working. I just want this to end.
