spent my entire life serving and appeasing the nurotypicals. Finally freeing myself.To be Taken at face value, to be respected and seen as what I am, to succeed in an environment designed for me, to have friends, to talk my way out of mistakes and be treated with dignity. 

I feel sub human, like Iâ€™m not even the same species as them, they are like gods and I am nothing, they get jobs and school and money and friends and family and theyâ€™re allowed to complain the whole time via sarcasm and passive aggression. 

To be mean to one another for no reason but somehow have it be mutually understood that the meanness is infact secret kindness.

Sometimes it feels like the more kind and honest and Formal I am, the more shit I get. â€œKeep an eye on himâ€ â€œhe gives me the creepsâ€ â€œtone it down a littleâ€ 

I hate everyone. I feel so bitter and angry, I need support but there is no help. The regional center doesnâ€™t care about me now that Iâ€™m an adult, Iâ€™ve called them over 40 times over the past three weeks, I call multiple times a day, and they always say theyâ€™ll get back to me but donâ€™t. 

No therapists in the county for adults with Autism, my old one, that I saw since I was nine  cant see me since I turned 18. 

When I was young there was so much help and now there is nothing, lost my last job after two days because I couldnâ€™t put the lids on containers. 

I am worthless 

I finally see why the average age of death for us is closer to 45, we kill ourselves after society decides that we arnt cute enough to deserve support anymore.
