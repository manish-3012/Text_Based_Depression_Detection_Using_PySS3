Happy birthday to meHave been in pretty severe depression over the past few months and have been surpressing it greatly, acting as if nothing is wrong on the outside. Yesterday, the 18th, was my birthday. While all of my friends went out drinking yesterday (St Paddys Day) and tonight (because of a University dance I didn't go to), I was awkwardly standing around as my family conversed with eachother at my Uncle's house. I then went home and watched TV with my Mom. Am I a complete loser and have no way of returning from my completely inferior ways? I've been with a girl for a year and three months, as well as two girls before her which both lasted six months, and I'm still a virgin. And tonight, after this dance, my goober of a roommate has a girl in our dorm room. Am I even socially able to continue on in my life? What more do I even have to push me to continue living on? If this is how I am now, my future will never become brighter. I don't drink, I don't drive cause I don't even have a license, and I hardly ever do anything with my miserable life. Worst of all I'm only 19 so I have to face so many more years of my life in this terrible position. I don't even have the courage to speak out or do something to myself to ease the pain.
