AloneI am alone and i hate it.  I use to enjoy being alone playing video games and never leaving my room. I met a girl online and we spent the last 12+ years together and it ended horribly a day before my birthday. July 23rd 2016.

I spent a month in jail and in mental hospital after the breakup. I did not handle it well at all and still not.

I have not left the room i have here with my mom and sisters house. I have been in this room for the past months i have not been outside i leave room to eat dinner and take showers.

I have bills racking up, medical, creditcard debt that was both of ours but they are in my name. My car was totaled by police when i tried to run. 
I have bad teethe that i was working to get fixed before the breakup and now i know the pain i will be facing with no way of fixing it.

I feel like i am battling a fuse on the motivation to end it all , cause
i refuse to live a life in physical pain and emotional. So i know as soon as my teeth start hurting again ill end it finally.

I have no motivation to dig myself out of this hole i am in.

I have no friends, nobody to talk too, My family does not understand and only seem to care when its too late.

I hate being afraid to leave my house. That i stay up all night and sleep all day cause i know there is a gun range that is 2.7 miles away from my house i could walk to. And there hours when they are open i am Asleep.

I just do not want to be alone anymore.I want some one i will never be with again. I want my life back,  I want to wake up in her arms and this just be a sick long dream. The only person i spent the last 12 years of my life talking to i cant talk too

And i hate it.
