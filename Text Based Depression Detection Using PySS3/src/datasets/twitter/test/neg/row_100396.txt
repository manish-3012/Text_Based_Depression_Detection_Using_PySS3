Feeling emptyIt's like there is nothing left and I don't really want to do anything more than just being asleep permanently.

I have trouble saying things out loud and it feels like I'm trapped, with the words unable to leave my mouth,mostly because I can't stand the sound of my voice. 

I also feel physically stuck, maybe because of my weight issues that cause me to constantly be exhausted.

It's not even that I'm facing a huge problem,it's just that life is exhausting and it feels like I'm just fading away.

The friends I've made have moved on,which is great,I'm happy for them, but it feels like the end of the line for me.

I won't kill myself, cause I'm a coward, but damn do I sure want to die.

I don't even know why I'm writing this, I usually keep these to myself but writing here feels like shouting into a void, and maybe the void has some answers.
