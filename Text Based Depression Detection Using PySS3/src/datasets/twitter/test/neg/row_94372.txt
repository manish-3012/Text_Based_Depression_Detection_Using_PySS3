How do I find the willNobody cares and even if it may seem like it they are only reaching out when I'm at my wits end. I can fake being happy well but little things that happen everyday like being single and feeling incompetent in my field I chose destroy my emotional state. I have one semester left and idk why I chose engineering I've been declined many times on the job hunt and have required a lot of help throughout my degree. I'm in debt a lot of money due to school and slipping into alcoholism. Seems every relationship i form is shallow and I have to instigate everything from hanging out to maintaining contact. I don't really know what I wanna get out of this post but I just want to tell someone without being embarrassed by myself
