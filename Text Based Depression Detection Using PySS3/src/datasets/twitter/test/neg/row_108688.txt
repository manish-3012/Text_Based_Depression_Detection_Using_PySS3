Thanks, me.I was selfish and crossed a line.
Everything was looking okay until  now.
 if things look better or the pain goes away then I'll be fine.
I'm sorry I wasn't good enough or able to make something for myself or us.
I wasn't destined for great things and I guess this is just how it's supposed to be.

I love life, but I can't get it to love me back like you could and I'm sorry.
