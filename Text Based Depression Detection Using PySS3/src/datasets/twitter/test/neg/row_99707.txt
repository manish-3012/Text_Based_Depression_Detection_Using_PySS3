I made a huge mistake someone please helpSo I've always wanted to do something with a guy but I was always scared. I have a girlfriend who I love. Today I got a perfect opportunity to do it, and for some reason I did. I can't believe it; i feel sick to my stomach and I've never wanted to kill myself more in my entire life. I feel like a huge piece of shit. She trusts me completely and I feel absolutely terrible. What do I do? I don't know the guy and I will never see him again as long as I live, but I don't know what to do. I've always had mental health problems but I have been to stubborn to get help and now I'm so so lost. Someone please help me, even if it's just to say that I'm terrible.
