Absolutely nothing to live forMy entire day consists of waking up, being bored in school all day, and then sitting on my computer for 8 hours. I have no friends, no hobbies, and no ambition. I haven't even gotten a text message from anyone except my parents in months. I feel like I'm just existing, and not really living.

My life isn't leading up to anything. At this point, it feels like my only option is suicide. The only reason I'm not dead yet is because I don't have a method of killing myself.
