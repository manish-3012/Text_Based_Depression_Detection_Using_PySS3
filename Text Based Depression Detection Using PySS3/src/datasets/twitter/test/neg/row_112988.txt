I am in so much pain I just want to end it all.I just feel pain. My biggest dream of finally being accepted or truly being wanted by somebody is over. My parents dont want me... nobody really wants me. Life just wants me to be alone. The trauma of bullying and abuse haunts me to this day. It doesn't matter what fucking hobby or career dream or country I move to. Nothing fills the void in my heart. I don't want to see this morning. 

I just want to just stop breathing.
