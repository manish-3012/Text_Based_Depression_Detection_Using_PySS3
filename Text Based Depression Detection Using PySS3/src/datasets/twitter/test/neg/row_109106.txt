Celexa 40mg problemsHi. I'm battling major depression since beginning of the year and I've now landed myself on 40mg celexa per day.

Doc said if my mood is still lacking by November he will consider placing me on a mood stabiliser as well as celexa.

40mg so far so good... I don't feel depressed and dont get racing thoughts and impulses to kill myself at the moment.

But I am 100% unmotivated to do anything anymore. I avoid food as much as I can and only eat garbage that's easily made quickly. I don't play video games anymore. I no longer want to watch TV, or listen to music, I pretty much sit in my flat (apartment) and watch the trees move in the wind all day.

Will this lack of motivation to get up and do something other than going to work and sleeping pass? Or will I need those mood pills?
