Im confused.im from Asia.
I've recently applied for my majors in a university, i studied so hard to get into the univ. there are only three univ in my country which have the course.
my first attempt was last year. i made it to the waitlist.

meanwhile i studied hard and even made some headlines along the way.

this year
i got into the merit list, i was contacted and asked for a bribe of 7000$ ( it's normal here).
im broke i dont have it.
the other universities are even worse they dont publish merit list. there are huge recommendations done there.

i can barely make 200$ a month with my Current degree in my country.

And im passionate about the field. I've been working hard for it. but people like these 

make me quit myself. The merit lists are today.
 
I've tried my best to distract myself but its been hard.

My front body, chest and stomach feel so heavy. i can't breathe properly since yesterday.
help.
