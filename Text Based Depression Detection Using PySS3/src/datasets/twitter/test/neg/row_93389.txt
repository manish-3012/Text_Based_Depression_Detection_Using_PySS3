Practicing hanging myself.I've been really depressed lately and it's only getting worse. I feel very alone and pointless. Anyway lately I learned how to tie a noose. Over the last two days I've been looking for a good place to tie it up and I finally found a way to tie it over the door on the other sides doorknob. I don't really feel anything though, I'm not really afraid or upset, just.. I don't know, I just don't feel much.  Just felt like writing this down so thanks for reading.
