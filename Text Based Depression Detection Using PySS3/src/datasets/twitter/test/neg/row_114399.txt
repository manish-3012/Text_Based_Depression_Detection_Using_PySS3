Iâ€™m contemplating ending it all tonight for good.Honestly I donâ€™t know where to even start.

Iâ€™m going into my 5th year of college after having transferred majors and I will probably need a 6th year.

I canâ€™t hold down a job, if I do itâ€™s always a dead end job. I just started being a waiter and after messing 2/4 orders at one table today, the general manager cut me for the day after working only 2 hours, and Iâ€™ve been prioritizing this job over my other job (sweatshop) to try to make more money but working all of these small hours Iâ€™m making less and less and I have to pay my car bill soon and donâ€™t know how I will. All my managers besides a few at the waiting job are complete assholes to me because itâ€™s my first serving job and they have expectations for me that meet an experienced server. 

About 8 months ago my â€œbest friendâ€ and roommate was off of his medication for extreme bipolar disorder and tried to murder me in my sleep, leaving me with PTSD, paranoia, depression, and anxiety.

I barely have any friends, and the ones I do have either cut me out and/or have ruined relationships with even after Iâ€™ve tried to fix them (theyâ€™re keeping their distance). Iâ€™m home every night and only having social interaction at work is making me so socially awkward. Iâ€™m also depressed and have been having suicidal thoughts.

I come home today (Iâ€™m 22, still live with my parents) to my dad freaking out at me saying that he doesnâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me because something definitely is, all because I accidentally forgot a pen from work in my jeans and it exploded in the dryer. He kept saying heâ€™s sick of my shit and doesnâ€™t know what my f****** problem is. My parents constantly drag me down itâ€™s unreal. When I had therapy for my PTSD and depression my therapist suggested I bring them in and I did. She told them about depression and that I was suicidal. They were both upset and understanding but that only lasted a week or two.

In the past weeks Iâ€™ve tried to better myself- started consistently hitting the gym again, cleaned up my diet, got a haircut, deleted all social media, quit video games, and am trying to start music production. All things I thought would give me confidence and would help me move forward. I feel so behind and am so dragged down by everyone in my life. If I tell what few friends I have that Iâ€™m suicidal they will tell me the same whole shpeal about how thereâ€™s so much to live for but will ultimately see me in a different lens.

Iâ€™ve seen a therapist and nothing has worked. Iâ€™m just trying to figure out the easiest way to go out of the world at this point. I have no one. On the outside I seem like an attractive, healthy, young guy, but I feel so alone itâ€™s killing me.
