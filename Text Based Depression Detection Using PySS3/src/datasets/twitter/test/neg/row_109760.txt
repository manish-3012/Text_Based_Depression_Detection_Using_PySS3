Can you people help me?Hello! I created this account just to speak here, in hopes it may help coping with my suicidal thoughts. English is not my native language, so pls be patient.

I've been imagining myself dying for a couple years now, but recently it got worse. So much so, that i've gotten as far as to tie a noose and put it around my neck (I gave up after giving it some thought).

I've gradually developed a mild (sometimes cripplying) depresseion, and a very nihilist view of the world, throughout the years. Everything I do just feels so pointless, and as a result it's really hard to motivate myself to do anything.

I've been trying to deal with it. I started therapy not so long ago. It gave me a good insight on what the problem is, but nothing on how to solve it. It all (as usual) dates back to my childhood. I've hammered in my head a world view in which I am unwanted, and uninteresting. As a result, now more then ever, I can't maintain close relationships. All of my friends have drifted away, because I've isolated myself from them. I don't even know how to go talk with them again, or even if I should.

I just wanna get over this crap. It ain't fun.

Right now I think the maim reason i haven't done it yet, is because i really wanna play the new Super Mario Odissey.

You that are reading this, do you have any tips on what to do? Even if you don't just commenting something would be great ;^;

 I just want to stop living just for the sake of being alive.
