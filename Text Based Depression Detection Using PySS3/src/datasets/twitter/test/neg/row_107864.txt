Can't shake it off...I've bettered myself physically and emotionally. I've been clean for months with no inklings towards relapsing. I really do like my lifestyle (academia). I have friends and family who care about me and love me and I know and feel it. But I still can't shake off these thoughts that have plagued me since my darkest moments... I keep falling into it. I'm too tired, too much of a bum to exert any more effort into this. If my life, thoughts, conscious, subconscious are all based on my perception of sensory experiences, I should have no more shame if they're physically gone. And it'll be easy. I want Nothing- I can't handle being engulfed and suffocated by Mind anymore. I have no control over Mind, Mind has control over me. The least I can oh-so-selfishly do for myself is dissolve into Nothing so I won't have to know Mind anymore. I feel weak and impatient. I've primped myself up, wrote with a nice pen (proofread as well), got the good gin out, got a convincingly fatal weight of barbiturates in my palm. I'm ok with it but I'm not ok with being ok with it...
