Can't accept my appearanceThe following is a giant word wall, which may make it a little more difficult to read but I'm sorry, I just don't even feel like formatting this correctly.

&amp;#x200B;

 I am desperate. I can't get over my appearance. No matter what I try I just cannot. The dark cloud has been following me around for three years and won't leave me alone. I can't feel good about my appearance for even a single week. I cannot look at my face in the mirror without pointing out several features I despise and wish I was just born without. I don't feel hideous but I feel like I look bog-standard, mediocre and stale. I have been friend-zoned, ignored and rejected by every girl I've had genuine interest in. One pretended to feel the same way about me for several months. She led me on for a year.  just to end up taking one of my best friends to the high school prom. She fell in love with him. That in itself has been consuming me since it happened 10 months ago. Besides my appearance. I've been to the school counselor. She is very sweet and she makes me feel better. But it's always temporary. I feel like the type of guy that will be rejected by every single woman he is ever interested in, and will probably just have to settle for someone he doesn't even find slightly attractive. I have three sisters all of them are beautiful. I feel like I received lower quality versions of all their features. My lips look strange and they have a weird bump on the right side. My rows of teeth are an ugly, jagged, uneven circular shape while all of my sisters have square, perfectly symmetrical teeth &amp; faces. I'm tired of feeling this way. I am tired of feeling like I'm not enough. I have had several self harm incidents in past months. I've managed to go through 2020 without doing so but I am just not in a good place right now. Please help me. If you can. I'll appreciate anything.
