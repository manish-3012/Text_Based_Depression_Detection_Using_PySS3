I'd rather be dead than slowly watch myself wither away.It's not like there was much to wither in the first place. I was bullied in Elementary, Middle, and now High school. I'll never belong, I don't see me ever belonging to this world. My opinions differ from everyone, my beliefs, my thoughts. I'm an ugly being who is being tormented. I'll find a gun somehow, I couldn't do it with a knife. I'll write the note tomorrow when no one is paying attention. And hopefully I'll be forgotten and vanish into whatever void is in the afterlife.
