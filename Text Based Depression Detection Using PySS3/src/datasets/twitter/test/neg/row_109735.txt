The world breathes a sigh of relief when this failed loser diesI am a burden on everyone I know and the world as a whole. I add no value to society. I can't stop crying tonight just thinking about it, making me be even more pathetic.

I am a worthless loser, a leech. I should have been aborted. Logically I should terminate my failed experiment of a life and give everyone relief from my miserable existence.

I am sorry for wasting your time.
