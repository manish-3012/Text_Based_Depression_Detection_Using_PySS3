Why him?Heâ€™s soo bad for my mental health at least thatâ€™s what I think but who knows maybe Iâ€™m wrong about that too I really want to add him back and talk to him idk I ending things really stupidly but I mean I donâ€™t have anything new to say to him he knows I love him and he says he loved me too but heâ€™s in a relationship so idk anymore it just feels like he gives me tiny bits of hope just to string me along but heâ€™s just soo idk I just donâ€™t know anymore if I love him cause heâ€™s the only one who accept me and I just want validation or if thereâ€™s more to it than that i mean I canâ€™t even love myself so how am I supposed to love someone else I mean I hate what I look like I just go on social media and I see all those pretty people and I just think maybe just skip this meal I mean itâ€™s not that big a deal right I just idk anymore Iâ€™m so jealous of everyone else because I donâ€™t really have anything myself I really want to end it but I can never follow through I stood on the edge and looked down but I just couldnâ€™t follow through but why I donâ€™t have a reason to stay posting this isnâ€™t gonna do anything idk even know why Iâ€™m doing it maybe I want validation from random strangers maybe I just need a place to vent idk anymore it just feels like I donâ€™t have any answers and all I got are questions and itâ€™s just soo suffocating I just want to run away and drive all around the country not attached to anything or anyone so I canâ€™t get hurt again 

Sorry if itâ€™s a bit incoherent my thoughts are a bit sporadic rn
