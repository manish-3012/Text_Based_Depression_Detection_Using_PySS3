I am sad and I think killing myself would fix it.I can't handle anything anymore, three years ago I could almost graduate college and I might not even be able to keep my job. I got a new job six months ago and I am very good about it from what everyone tells me, but they have been constantly promising me promotions and then changing their minds, now they are changing me to something much more stressful and wouldn't let me say no.

My drinking and self injury has gone from 0 to 100 in the last few weeks due to this, I left work early to come home and drink because I couldn't handle this new job and I was so upset that I couldn't stay in the position I am (they wouldn't explain why, they did eventually relent to a two week trial period but I don't believe them as they wouldn't let me move back when I was promoted against my will the first time.)

I am almost 25, which was an age where I imagined I would have it in me to kill myself if things weren't okay, and I have no support system or anything. I really think I spend too much time hoping things will get better. But really I have nothing.

Right now I don't have a plan or anything but I strongly feel I should start one. I have no idea how I'm going to get through the next few hours, never mind the rest of my life
