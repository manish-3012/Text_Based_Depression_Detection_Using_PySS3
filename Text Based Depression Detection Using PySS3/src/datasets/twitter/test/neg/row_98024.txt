I think Iâ€™m just doneI was a shitty mom when my daughter was little. I was an Addict but Iâ€™m clean, I do have a slip here and there but I take good care of her.

My parents called CPS on me and due to me being on methadone they were able to see 5 years of clean tests, house full of food and a happy child. The issue my child does have is attendance at school. While living with my parents she missed 200 days so essentially a full academic year.

Recently my parents purchased a house with my brother and his wife in a town my mom always said she hated. Itâ€™s about 2 hours from here and the city where I live is stupid expensive, 800 000 for a small starter but they could have bought an hour away with us and then my daughter would have both of us. Thatâ€™s what she wants. 

I just hate her so much and why would she want to take my child. Sheâ€™s always favoured my brother and thatâ€™s fine but at this point my brother gets to see my child more than me? 

Iâ€™m fighting for her. I miss my dad,I hate my mom and my husband blames everything on me. I think I want to die
