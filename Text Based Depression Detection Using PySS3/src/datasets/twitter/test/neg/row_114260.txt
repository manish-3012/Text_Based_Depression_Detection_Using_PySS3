No one will listenFor a while now Iv been feeling really low, not just a little blue but lower then Iv ever felt before. 

Iâ€™m a mother of 3 and a wife, so try my best to hide it until Iâ€™m alone. Iv even tried telling my husband about how Iâ€™m feeling but he just thinks Iâ€™m being over dramatic and brushes it off. I spoke to my mum about it and she thinks itâ€™s just day to day like getting on top me and that I just need a brake. I told my friend and she thought I was just â€œ having one of them daysâ€. Me and my husband are arguing day and night, to which is only making me feel worse. When he sees that Iâ€™m falling apart he sees it as a way to â€œwinâ€ the argument. 

Iâ€™m trying really hard. I love my kids and Iâ€™d never want to hurt them but itâ€™s getting to the point where Iâ€™m cutting a sandwich and daydreaming of cutting my wrists. Iâ€™ll take a walk and think â€œ just do it! Just jump in front the next carâ€. I cry every night when everyone is asleep, just so I can get everything off my chest and wake up every morning counting the hours till I can get back in bed and just let go of being strong for the kids and sink into this black hole thatâ€™s been hovering me all day.  

Please someone tell me Iâ€™m not going insane, and this will get better. I donâ€™t know how much more of this I can take.
