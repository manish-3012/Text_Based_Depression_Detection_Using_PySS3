sorry..i posted positivity a while ago.
but my depression struck again.
iâ€™m tired of waking up only to pop a pill to â€œfeelâ€ better. iâ€™m tired of walking into class and having people call me a try-hard. iâ€™m tired of losing friends. i want to be like everyone else. happy. smart. funny. beautiful. worth it.
iâ€™ve made a plan.
april 28th, the day after i meet my favorite band (the only thing iâ€™m living for), iâ€™ll end it.
i wonâ€™t have to deal with the world.
third times the charm.
you can try to talk me out of it if you want but you most likely wonâ€™t get through.

i miss him.

i miss THEM.

i hope you guys have a great week.
