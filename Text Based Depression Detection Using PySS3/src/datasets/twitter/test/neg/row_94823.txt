Don't know what to title this but I need helpI have felt really hopeless since probably the 6th grade. Over the years, things have only gotten worse. I was a good kid in high school. I had a 3.5 GPA and was completely sober all four years. Despite how good my life was, I constantly felt lost. 

Since coming to college, I've begun to drown my sorrows with drugs and alcohol. I'm only in my first semester but I'm not doing well in school. I can guarantee that I will be on academic probation come the end of the semester. My parents are paying a lot of money for me to go to this school and finding out I'm on academic probation will devastate them. 

I feel like their disappointment is going to put me over the edge because my family members are the only people I've been able to maintain legitimate relationships with. I've ruined all my friendships with people by being overly sensitive. I've ruined every romantic relationship I've ever had within a month of them starting because of my lack of self confidence in everything. Overall, I feel as if I'm wasting my parent's hard earned money and when they realize it, I'm going to lose them too. 

Once I lose them, I feel like I have nothing to live for. I have suicidal thoughts almost everyday and suicide seems like the best way to go. I don't know what exactly I'm looking for here but I feel like I can't tell these things to anyone. I just wanted to get it it out and look for advice I guess.
