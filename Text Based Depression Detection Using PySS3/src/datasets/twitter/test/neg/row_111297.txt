My terrible situation, and how I plan to end itI want to die.

I'm a man in my early 30s.  I met a woman about three years ago and we became friends.  We live in different cities.  When she was in my town, we hooked up a couple times at her initiation.  It was nice but I didn't want to pursue anything further.  She went home.

Over the next year and a half, things were weird.  She kept asking me to hook up with her again.  I kept making excuses and telling her no.  She kept debating my reasons.  I liked her as a friend and tried to rebuff her as gently as possible.

She then told me she'd had a miscarriage as a result of our hook-up.  I believed her at first, but it didn't logically make sense.  She kept bringing it up.  "I had a nightmare about the miscarriage."  The conversation would get weird and she'd start texting stuff like "I love you even though you don't love me back" and "it kills me that you're so far away."

I started dating somebody new.  The woman got weird about it.  She kept interrupting dates we were on, asking me to phone her because she'd had a nightmare.  After I told her I'd speak to her the next day, she told me that my inability to speak to her had caused her to have a seizure.

It sounds like our friendship was all bad, but it wasn't.  I really cared for this woman.  I didn't realize that she was basically sexually harassing me.  I'd never been in a situation like this before.  It never occurred to me that she might be lying about the miscarriage and the seizures.

In advance of her next visit, she asked me again, as she had so many times before, "do you regret hooking up with me?"  I told her, for the first time, that I did.  I told her that I felt there was a disparity between her desire for me and mine for her.  I told her that I also felt guilty about the miscarriage.  She told me that the miscarriage was, actually, "not traumatizing at all".  She told me that "miscarriage and all, sex with you was a net positive."  I asked her if she was sussing out if there was future intimacy in the cards, and she said that's what she wanted.

When I saw her, it was great at first.  I really liked this woman and was happy to see her.  My current girlfriend and I are open and so I asked the woman if she wanted to fool around.  She said she did, so we did.  We did again the next day.  I didn't tell my girlfriend.  After the second hook-up (the fourth overall) I told her that I didn't want to do it any more.  I didn't tell her this, but I really wasn't attracted to her.  The woman got upset.

She kept asking me to cuddle, over and over, day after day.  She was visiting me, my "friend from out of town", but I stopped hanging out with her in one-on-one situations because of how intrusive I felt she was being.

The second-to-last day she was in town, she faked a seizure in front of me.  I realized she had been lying about them.  She was faking it for attention and to try and coerce me into providing her with physical comfort.  I got upset and cried in the bathroom about it.

The last day she was in town, she again asked me to sleep with her, and I said no.  She asked to cuddle me, and instead, I gave her a hug.  She started clutching at me and crying.  I tried to get out of her embrace and she kept grabbing at me.  She was now begging me to sleep with her.  I told her no and took her to a friend's house so I didn't have to be alone with her.  She left the next day.

She subsequently got really weird and hostile toward me.  She accused me of not giving her a "good enough" hug goodbye.  She accused me of not watching her Instagram story.  She accused my girlfriend and her social circle of not being accepting of her.  It was so weird and strange.

When I told the woman that I was uncomfortable with how intrusive her requests for intimacy were, she got mad.  She texted, "you need to understand, I had a miscarriage.  I wanted to hold you through the night to try and undo the trauma of the situation."  I started to feel really weird.  I went back and re-read our chat history and saw how often she was bringing up the miscarriage.  I re-read her description of it, and showed it to a friend who's a nurse.  My nurse friend told me "that's not a miscarriage.  She's manipulating you."

She started group chats with my girlfriend and her friends, one's I wasn't involved in.  I eventually told my girlfriend what was going on, and my girlfriend blocked her and told her friends to do the same.  I showed them our chat history.  They told me the woman seemed like a psychotic stalker.  They told me to cut her out.

I did so.  I first just tried ghosting the woman, but she kept texting me and calling me.  I didn't reply or answer.  Eventually she texted me and told me she was worried about me, and I told her to stop texting me, and our friendship was over.  She texted me back, "what did I do", and then, "fuck you".

The next day, she'd blocked me.  I started to notice that certain mutual friends were unfriending me on Facebook.  I started to feel weird about it.  I started to feel concerned that she was saying things about me.

I snooped her Twitter account and she was tweeting constantly about "abusers" and "predators" and it seemed like she was presenting herself as a victim of sexual assault.  I got really scared and spiralled out.  I tried to hang myself when my girlfriend was out of town.  I failed and the police were called.  They came and took me to the mental ward.

When I got out I started seeing a therapist.  I stopped posting on Twitter.  I kind of shut down.

One day, me and my friends went to the beach.  One of them took a photo of me and posted in on Instagram and tagged me in it.  The next day, the woman was subtweeting my friend.  She literally was searching my name on Instagram and subtweeting people who were posting photos of me.  The woman posted something like "it sucks when you pretend to be a good feminist and yet you continue to hang out with abusers."

I have another ex-girlfriend, the woman knew about her and knew we'd had an acrimonious breakup; I cheated on her and that ended the relationship.  The woman contacted her and it became clear they were talking about me.  The woman would post about how "abusers are gonna get what's coming to them" and my ex would be responding and liking her tweets.

Eventually, a colleague of the woman named me on Facebook and said I was a "rapist".  The woman herself e-mailed my boss and said that I'd sexually assaulted her.  My boss showed me the e-mail and I hired a lawyer.

We twice tried to get the woman to agree to mediated resolution, but she refused.  I could prove that I didn't sexually assault her, the fact that this woman was soliciting further intimacy was really very clear in our chat history.  It was very clear she was obsessed with me and just upset that I'd rejected her.

When the woman refused mediated resolution, we sued her.  I didn't like want any money or anything, I just told her I wanted her to agree to retract these false statements and apologize.  She agreed to do so.

The woman and I both work in the same industry in different cities.  I'd noticed by this time that pretty much everybody in her branch, people I'd known for years, most of them had unfriended and unfollowed me.  I hoped that the woman would tell them the truth.

She signed a document that retracted her false statements and I thought that would be the end of it.  Instead, a bunch of her friends started tweeting about how shitty it was that "survivors of sexual assault" would be the target of lawsuits.  My ex-girlfriend, in particular, posted some really nasty stuff.  I fell deep into a depression.

In the months since, I've felt increasingly isolated in my workplace.  I've heard that some people are whispering that the woman only signed the document because of legal pressure.  I feel completely isolated and alone.  Many work friends of mine just don't talk to me any more.

My depression has become insurmountable.  I've started taking medication at my doctor's suggestion.  I don't have the energy to work out and my current girlfriend has been hooking up with other men.  She's been so supportive through all of this, but I think my depression (and my small but significant weight gain since I stopped exercising) has been motivating her to want some release.

A few weeks ago, I lost my job.  My boss told me that my work had suffered and that it was clear that this situation had taken its toll on me.  My boss knows about everything, of course, and believes me.  But he very gently told me to take some time off.  There is no plan in place to hire me back.

I took out a loan and re-hired my lawyer.  I want to get my lawyer to motivate the woman to make some kind of statement acknowledging not just the falseness of the sexual assault allegation, but also admit that she initiated the relationship, pursued it after I didn't want it to continue.  (I don't have any hope that she'll admit that she was lying about miscarriages and seizures and stuff like that.)

My lawyer and her lawyer are speaking on Wednesday.  As the situation was "resolved", we don't really have any leverage to ask for anything more.  I'm hoping that they might listen to reason, but I don't think they will.

I am certain that if my lawyer doesn't get some kind of compromise, some kind of positive result, that I will kill myself.  I have a plan in place.  I know what I want to do.  I plan to drive to the place I grew up.  My parents have since moved away.  It is very far away from where I live now.  I will go out into the woods and sit there for a while.  Then I will slit my wrists.  I do not plan on telling anybody where I'm going.  I do not plan on leaving a note.

What is so hard about this is the following:

\- I was being sexually harassed by this woman

\- I really genuinely cared for her, I just didn't want to sleep with her

\- I feel like my entire identity has been remolded to be some kind of sexual aggressor

\- I have spoken to every woman I've ever slept with all the way back to high school and they've all told me they felt extremely safe with me

\- I have spent more than half my savings on legal fees

\- I don't have a job any more and I don't know what to do

\- I have gotten dumpy and depressed and my girlfriend feels like she's only staying with me because she doesn't want me to attempt again

\- I feel like there's no way out
