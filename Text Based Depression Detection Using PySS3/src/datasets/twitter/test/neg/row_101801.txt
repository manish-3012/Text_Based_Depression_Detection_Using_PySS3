Financial guilt is wearing me downMy family is too poor to celebrate Christmas this year and it's my fault. Student loans, moving expenses, medical bills - I'm basically one big, walking debt machine. I don't even know why I bother living when all I do is make everything worse. Even my mom is finally fed up with me, claims I'm the reason for HER depression. I spent today sitting at home with just my dad, the rest of my family splintered to the other side of a continent, and we both agreed to just pretend everything was fine. But it's not fine - I can't stop thinking 'life would be better for everyone around me if I was dead.' I feel haunted by the thought. I'm starting to genuinely think it's the truth...
