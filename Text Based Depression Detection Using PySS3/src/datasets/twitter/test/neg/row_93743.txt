I don't want another birthdayI don't want to have to experience anything anymore. I don't want to go to therapy and I feel guilty when I do, because I just want to die, and someone else could be using my appointment slot. I don't want to keep going anymore. I've failed to end my life on several occasions, I just want someone to shoot me.
