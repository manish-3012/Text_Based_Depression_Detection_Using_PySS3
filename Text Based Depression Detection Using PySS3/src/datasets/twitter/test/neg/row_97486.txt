I am a complete mess right now - 31m - all support lines are busy - would really like to talk to someone nowI'm in a really bad place right now.  I've posted yesterday with a brief overview of what has led me to be thinking like this.  I have been a complete wreck all day.  I feel like I have just snapped and no longer want to fix anything cause I would rather it just be over.  

I really just want someone to talk to right now.  Chatting online would be best.

Thanks
