Relationship on the verge of ending, I want to dieMy live in boyfriend of 4 years, is pushing me away, saying he wants a break. Weâ€™ve been together six years. I love him so much and the more we talk and the more I try to fix it the worse I make it, one day heâ€™s talking about moving out and the next heâ€™s holding me in bed, and the next he wants to have sex... then we start fighting about this break situation again... Then weâ€™re spending time together watching tv together, laughing.... I know I should just give him space but I canâ€™t go anywhere, neither can he... I made the mistake of making him my whole world... Heâ€™s said some hurtful things, then heâ€™s said Iâ€™m the best thing that ever happened to him... Iâ€™m so confused I canâ€™t take another broken heart... Iâ€™m divorced, in past Relationships Iâ€™ve been cheated on, verbally abused, raped, used for money (and no Iâ€™m not fat and ugly which is probably what people assume, I have a good job) I just canâ€™t handle any more pain... I feel like I made too many mistakes in this lifetime and itâ€™s too late for me to ever be happy again, or make it right. I know I could find someone else but I donâ€™t want to live without him, and I donâ€™t want to fall in love with someone else. I have nothing left to give in this world. Iâ€™ve thought about pills/alcohol, jumping in front of a car, over my balcony or using one of my boyfriends (legal) guns (heâ€™s a hobby target shooter). Iâ€™ve been praying to die every day. I guess a part of me also wants to punish him, it sound terrible but itâ€™s true.
