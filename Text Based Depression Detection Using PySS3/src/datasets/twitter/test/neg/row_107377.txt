oblivionyall ever live in the happy memories that still linger in your head to avoid the suicidal thoughts? I find myself in them too much and I'm starting to think if I'm really even living when the good memories are so long ago but still seem to be like yesterday. I feel like someday I'll relapse and I'll be so fed up that not even the great memories will help me. goodnight all, take care. 21.
