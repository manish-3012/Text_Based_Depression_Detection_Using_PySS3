Doctor made a mistakeI donâ€™t know what to do or post on here but Iâ€™ve had the same recurring thoughts over and over again for the past 10 months. I moved to a different city last month with friends to branch out from my loving parents and try to be more independent. 

I take one 300mg bupropion tablet each morning for depression and anxiety, and I take one 100mg tablet quetiapine at night to help me sleep. The psychiatrist who prescribed the meds for me was the one who put me on them when I was in the hospital early January. Since Iâ€™ve been lying my way through life I just kept lying to him and my parents that Iâ€™ve been doing better. Since I live away from my psychiatrist now he just put 3 refills on my meds for the next year. August 2018- August 2019. 

Each refill has 90 days worth of pills for some stupid reason even though I was hospitalized for suicidal idealization and lightly cutting my wrist. 

Things havenâ€™t gotten better, Iâ€™ve no show no called into work 2 straight days now, I stayed away from my apartment yesterday so I didnâ€™t have to see my friends. Once I knew they left for the night I went and grabbed my pills and a bottle of vodka. I was going to try to overdose last night but I didnâ€™t have the strength and I was too tired I just slept in my car in a parking lot. 

Thoughts still havenâ€™t gotten better this morning and Iâ€™m sitting here with about 6,000mg of quetiapine and about 18,000mg of bupropion and I feel like Iâ€™m just waiting until night so I can do it then so no one will look in my car and see me having a seizure or vomiting uncontrollably and be able to call the police to â€œsaveâ€ me and make me a brain dead vegetable if it doesnâ€™t work. If that much medication would even do anything Iâ€™m not smart enough to understand overdose information online.
