AdviceOne of my siblings is going though a really hard time right now.  He feels like killing himself and I don't know how to help.  I've been telling them about my experience with going to a hospital to get help but the hospital its self was really just a safe place while I moved forward and made a plan to do so.  My  feelings never really changed untill I grew a bit more.  But I deffiently still have the same thoughts often. It was only untill a program I did later that really "helped" me grow manly by me making a fool of myself and learning that yeah my life's pointless but so is everything so I might as well give it a go ups and downs included.  I did find though that it's all kinda triggering seeing him this way and talking about it.  Just an overall icky feeling is swelling up inside me.  I haven't really gotten better I've just changed.  I'm worried it'll be the same for them. 

Any advice or words of wisdom would be really nice at this point.
