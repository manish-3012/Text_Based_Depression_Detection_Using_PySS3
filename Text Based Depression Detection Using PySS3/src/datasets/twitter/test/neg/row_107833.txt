I am done living.I have been attending a methadone clinic for about a year now. I went there because I was addicted to heroin. I've always been depressed and self medicated for it, eventually it got to a point where I couldn't maintain my habit. So I really tried to get clean and deal with my depression too. For a year I've been working really hard, haven't had a single dirty UA, and have been starting to improve. While I was at the clinic I was paying for my methadone myself and also held a medical marijuana card. About a week ago I got insurance and since it covered the methadone, I thought why not use it. What they didn't tell me is I could not use Marijuana, medical or not, while my methadone was being paid for by my insurance. Because of this I've been silently accumulating UA's that are dirty (because of the THC, which had never been a problem). Today I went in to get my dose and was informed I had lost all of my levels. I get no more take homes, and I would be required to go to 4 one hour group meetings by the end of the month. There's only one week until the end of the month and only one group meeting a day, usually at weird hours, so I wouldn't be able to make every one... If I don't follow the rules they will lower my dose by 10% a day until I'm off and then they won't help me. This whole time I have tried my hardest to comply with everything they told me to do. I even adopted Christianity back into my life, and worked hard on managing my depression. I'm just so done, I feel broken... I want to cry... I just don't want to be alive anymore... If I can't sort this out I don't know what I would do... I already talked to everyone I can, but no one helps people like me (an addict with a felony...) I just give up. If it's done it's done...
