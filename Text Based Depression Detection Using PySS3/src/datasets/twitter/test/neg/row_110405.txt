I wanna dÃ®e // sexual assault trigger warningI went over to my best guy friends house and he has a roommate who I had a fling with for a short period of time. I wanted to drink but I was the only who got drunk and I was really sad and lonely and just wanted to be hug so I went into the roommates room (we had slept together twice by now) and I laid down with him and cuddle him for a bit. I started kissing on him and rapping my arms around his waist and then he immediately said â€œstop youâ€™re giving me r*pe flashbacksâ€ I fell off the bed and apologized while sobbing and running into the bathroom. I had a full blown panic attack and did some harm to myself because of how intoxicated I was I couldnâ€™t feel anything. Iâ€™ve never done something like this in my entire life and I hate myself for it. Iâ€™m disgusted and I canâ€™t even look at myself in the mirror without seeing â€œrap*stâ€ written over my forehead. We talked about it and I apologized and everything but Iâ€™ve honestly have been thinking about ending my life because of how stressed and depressed Iâ€™ve been lately and this was the tip of the iceberg.
