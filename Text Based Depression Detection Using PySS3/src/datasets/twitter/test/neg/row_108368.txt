I'm only alive for my donI tried and failed to commit suicide when I was sixteen.  I figured then that I could never be truly happy.  Even though I was right and have lived now until forty I'm glad I failed.  My life has been a journey.  Two kids later and so much has passed. I never have been happy but I've made people I care about happy . At this point my youngest son is fourteen and I must live until he is grown.  Life isn't fair.  You may never be happy, l know that I won't be but I refuse to destroy my children's lives. I know I have to live at least four more years. I only hope my sons never feel the way I do. If your death would hurt anyone you care about it's a bad idea.  I can't and won't judge you . Hey I truly tried myself but I would have missed a few almost happy days in my life.
