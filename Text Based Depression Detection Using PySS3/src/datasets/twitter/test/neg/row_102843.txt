Feel bad about feeling sadI'm not going to post anything else. I don't want to annoy you anymore with my sad story. It's not like I'm assuming that you feel anoyed. I'm sorry. My way of thinking it's just immature. I really haven't decided yet if I'm going to do it this Friday. But thank you everyone for reading this. I wish you the best.
