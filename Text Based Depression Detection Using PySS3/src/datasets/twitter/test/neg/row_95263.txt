I want to go out on a high noteAfter a whole year of my friends and family worrying about me harming myself i tried a few different anti-depressants. People think i'm doing better now, but the anti-depressants just make me calm and nice   to people. Now that they think i'm okey, and i had some Nice moments with everyone, I feel strongly that this is a good time to go. Its Just endless, i feel more alone now than before i started taking antidepressants. I dont feel An incentive to go on.       I dont want to tell people anymore, the whole thing is Just tiring. I want to leave  a simple note thanking everyone and apologizing. My doctor gave me two whole boxes of opiates to sleep(oxyzepan) that should do it with some wine. I cant explain, but i really look forward to just nothing.. i think people will understand eventually. Dont know why im even posting this.
