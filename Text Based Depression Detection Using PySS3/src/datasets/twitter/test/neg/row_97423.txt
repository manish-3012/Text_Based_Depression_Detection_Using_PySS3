Just wrote all my goodbye lettersI have messed up with the only person I love in the whole wide world. I lied to him and I chose another guy over him after we broke up. I had the chance to get back with him and I messed it up by chosing attention from another person. I should have just not because it is hurting me more then ever now. I can't live with what I have done to him. I regret every stupid thing I did. He was the only person that actually loved me and gave me everything I have ever wanted and I screwed up. He never wants anything with me if the future and he can't see himself ever trusting me again. I feel hopeless. I have lost everything. 

I know it is drastic and I shouldn't be putting so much into one person. But I honestly can't go on thinking about the hurt I caused. Not a second goes by and I can't forgive myself. I am a constant reminder for myself of the things I fucked up. 

I want to make sure that everything I want to say to family and friends is there when the time comes.
