Giving up on lifeToday i've decided that i am going to hang myself. heres some back story and why and some about me.

well to start i am a 18 year old lad from the uk suffering from bipolar. i have been in a relationship for over a year and 2 weeks ago she broke up with me. i was a nasty boyfriend because of my bipolar. i used to snap and never wanted to do anything with her. i am a horrible human being. we kept in contact, writing letters, texting all that but today. she blocked me. the first time in over a year i've felt alone and scared. i cant imagine life without her and not being able to talk to her. makes it even worse my birthday is on the 31st and i had arranged to spend it with her know im going to be alone. dotn think anything could change my mind. i have no dad and mum barley knows me. no job and my friends are all back stabbing fucks. well thats my situation.
