What the heck is wrong with me?I am so f***ing tired of this. I don't know what to think anymore. I have so much, so many great things around me. Why am I not happy? Why cant I feel something? I feel empty, anxious, my mind chaotic but my spirit-nothing except fear. I have a boyfriend-my first in 22 years, and I like him a lot he is the sweetest person and I really dont deserve his kindness, but I honestly dont see my appeal, and I HATE that I dont feel giddy about our relationship. I know I like him, but I don't FEEL it. Thats not saying much cause I dont feel much of anything, except fear and sometimes broody anger. I am trying though, trying to be a good girlfriend to him, a good friend to my friends, a good daughter for my parents, a good sister for my younger siblings, a good student and responsible person. I just wish I could figure out how I feel so I could make a decision on what I want in life. I feel like I am just going with the flow so I dont get behind in life or become suicidal again, relying on suicidal fantasies and SI to calm and comfort me. I am trying to do the best thing, but instead I feel like I am just building a straw house  that is gonna collapse under its own weight soon enough, hurting people in the process and making my own life an irreparable mess. But I cant shut these people out, I can't give up because of my f***ed-up head. I just dont know if I am making the right decisions here. I have no idea what to do. I dont want to ask for advice because I am afraid I will get the wrong advice again and make another bad decision like I did with school when I wanted to change my major but everyone said I shouldnt, that it was just my emotions getting the better of me. I now know I should have changed it. I feel stuck. I am sick and tired of feeling stuck. I want to feel good about life.
