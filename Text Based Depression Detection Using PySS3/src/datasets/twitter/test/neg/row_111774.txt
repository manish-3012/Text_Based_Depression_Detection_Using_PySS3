On the edgeIâ€™m a 19 year old male currently serving in the US Army. Not that Iâ€™m proud of that. Canâ€™t say I was forced into it, I was very severely pressured into it by most everyone close to me, but it was ultimately my choice. While I hate my job, my issues definitely predate the Army. Iâ€™ve only been in for a little over a year. This has already turned into a fucking mess, as you can probably tell my thoughts are pretty scattered at the moment. My life is better than it used to be, I have an amazing girlfriend, a stable source of income, overall everything is supposed to be good and I donâ€™t really have any excuse to be this sad, but Iâ€™m done. I think I might kill myself tonight. I know that no matter what I do I wonâ€™t feel better. I wasnâ€™t even happy at my high school or boot camp graduations. Nothing truly brings me what I need to see this as worth it, I know thatâ€™s selfish but I donâ€™t know if I really fucking care. I havenâ€™t told anyone how I feel, not even the people closest to me. This place will be the only one that knows. I donâ€™t want anyone to know how fucking weak I truly was
