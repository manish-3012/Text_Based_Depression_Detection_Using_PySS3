Contemplating againHello everyone. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m saying hello when Iâ€™m thinking about committing suicide right now lol. Anyways Iâ€™ve been alive for 22 years and have survived a few previous attempts. This year I have been on medication that as been helping me keep stable and think more reasonably, but for whatever reason tonight itâ€™s just not working. I suppose writing here, even if no one sees this, could help distract myself long enough for these urges of mine to pass. Perhaps this will help me think with more reason. I live with anxiety, depression, and ptsd. I have been managing with these mental illnesses for most of my life and sometimes I just become so tired I want to go to sleep forever. My fantasy tonight is taking a bunch of Xanax and alcohol, perhaps just drifting off and overdosing. Sometimes the struggle becomes so much that my mind goes to a super dark place where I have no control and Iâ€™m impulsive.  With everything going on in the world, I just donâ€™t see the point sometimes.  Iâ€™m just so tired the best option feels like dying .
