I just have no will to liveI need help.  I was molested by my father when I was 4-8.  This has made my life very difficult.   People think I'm happy but that's just a lie.   I always have an overwhelming urge to just die.  I'm educated and attractive by societies standards but I just can't seem to be happy.  I'm currently seeing someone that is so unloving that it makes things worse.   Lately I've been taking 8 muscle relaxers at a time.  I'm afraid that I'll keep increasing the dose.  What do I do?  I honestly don't know anymore.
