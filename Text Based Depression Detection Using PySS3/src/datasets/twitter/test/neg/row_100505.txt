I dont even really think about suicide anymore. My thoughts have just become a painful blur.I atrempted to strangle myself but I chickened out as I felt my neck tighten and desperately tried to loosen the knot. After that, the suicidal thoughts didn't plague my mind as often as it did before my attempt. Now I just feel some kind of dark blob lingering inside my head. Ive started to verbally respond to some thoughts that managed to get transcribed from this blob.

All I feel is a very deep void in my soul. Like a hole in my heart that's just slowly expanding and engulfing me. I cant focus on anything anymore and I just feel like putting my head down and closing my eyes. I find solace in how dark it is but I also feel pathetic at the fact that I'm feeling the way I am.
