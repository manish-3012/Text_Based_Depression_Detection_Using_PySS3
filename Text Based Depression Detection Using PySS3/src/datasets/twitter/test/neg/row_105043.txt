Why do I feel this way?Why do I have to be depressed all the time? 
I have been feeling this way for the last seven years. It never gets better.
I can't talk to anyone about this. I feel like they wouldn't believe I'm depressed, that I'm doing it for attention. I'm not. I really, truly wish I didn't feel this way. I feel like I would bother them with my depression. Surely they have better things to do than here me rant about how I hate my life? Even if I could get past that all, I have no one to talk to.
I have no friends. I have five/six "friends" . I talk to them sometimes. They don't really care about me. No one does. They always forget to invite me to birthdays/other shit. Yet they call themselves my "friends". I truly hate them sometimes, but they are the only people that ever talk to me. Wouldn't risk saying anything, don't want to be even more alone than now. Every time someone adds me to a group chat, they stop talking and I later find out they created a new one with the exact same people but without me. It feels so bad. They always talk about all the parties/bds they go and ocasionally ask me why I didn't go and I always say I wasn't invited. They say something like "Oh sorry I forgot to invite you" and I tell them I don't really care. But I do. I always do. It's horrible to feel invisible to people you care about. I keep hoping they'll change, but they never do. Anyways, tonight they have a birthday party (everyone that is going are my friends, including the birthday guy), but no one invited me. They even talked about the gifts they were taking in front of me. It just feels bad.
I once tried talking to someone about how I'm depressed and want to die. He just told me "Think of your friends and family, how would they feel" and "It'll get better".
It's all so fucking hard. I just want to end it all.
