I don't think life gets better, its all downhill from hereI've reached a point in my life where I experienced all the happiness I could, from here on out its going to be nothing more than pain, sadness, stress and disappointment. Nobody would care if I left them now, I've experienced life and I'm ready to just not exist anymore. I thought I would be able to make it through college but I don't think I can at this rate
