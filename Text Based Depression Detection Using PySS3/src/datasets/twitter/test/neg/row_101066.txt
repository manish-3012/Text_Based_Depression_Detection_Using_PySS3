Life is TerribleEvery day is another chore of trying to keep your head above water. I am so fucking tired. This life is so joyless and brings me so much pain. Itâ€™s not that I have to stay here just so I wonâ€™t inconvenience my family. There isnâ€™t much here for me, anyway. I just want to breakdown or cut myself most hours of the day. I have talked to a therapist. I really donâ€™t want to keep spending the money but I just canâ€™t decide to quit going. I am just so angry. I wasted this whole day. Every day I am in agony. I have so much school work and it just doesnâ€™t stop. Itâ€™s just me on the laptop working or me just on my phone. I have so much regret in this life. At this point, I donâ€™t matter and I wish there was way out of this pain.
