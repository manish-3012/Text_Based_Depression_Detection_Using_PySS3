i just need someone to understand meI've always held my feelings inside me. I've always tried to be what everyone else needed. A willing ear. A helpful hand. But I always put myself last.

I am the first to apologise because I value reconciliation far more than my pride. I pretend everything is fine so no one else has to worry. I pretend I don't lie awake thinking of ways to die that won't hurt my mother. But I can't so here I am. If it wasn't for her I would have killed myself ages ago. I know that the day my mother passes will be the day I take a knife to my wrists. 

I want to do as much good as I can while I'm here.  I want to help everyone else. Make someone smile. That's the only thing that gives me meaning. To be useful to someone else.  To have someone acknowledge my existence. 

Every time I am selfish, something horrible seems to happen. When I voice my pain. When everything becomes too much.  When I fall in love.

Nothing ever goes well for me when I want something for myself. I would rather someone else take on my happiness on my behalf. 

I think a lot about how to die. I think I want it to be an accident. Something out of nowhere that no one could have prevented.  Something that no one can blame it on. I hope it's in the fall. It's my favourite season.  

I'm tired.  But I don't want to take my own life because that would be selfish. 

I'm so, so tired.  I don't know how people looking in on me would ever suspect just how broken I am on the inside.  

I'm a parasite feeding off the goodwill of other people.  I make it my nourishment.  A worm. 

I'm not a real person with feelings. I'm empty of hopes and dreams. An empty vessel with nothing to fill it with.  Every day I walk around with my heart hollowed out as I wonder if I will finally get to rest.
