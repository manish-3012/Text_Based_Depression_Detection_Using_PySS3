There honestly is no point anymore.I'm very young, still in high school, but I'm basically a drop out at this point. I've given up on doing any work even though it's all online, and my teachers email me constantly to remind me of how I'm failing. All I've been able to think about for the past year is how to kill myself and when. I have pretty severe mental health issues, and I'm currently seeing a psychologist and will see a psychiatrist next Monday, but there isn't much they can do. I've lost whole chunks of memories due to extreme trauma and abuse, but lately I've been remembering bits and pieces. The more I remember, the less I want to be alive to be able to have the memories. I don't really have any friends, just people I should remember but really don't. I've lost more "friends" than I can keep track of. Ex-boyfriends, girlfriends, friends, all want me dead for some reason or another and have been very vocal about that. I barely leave the house, barely shower, barely eat, all I want to do is grab a rope and get it over with. Every time I try to, something gets in the way, and sometimes I think it might be a sign that I shouldn't, but the next day I'm back to wanting to do it again. I'm just at my wits end here.
