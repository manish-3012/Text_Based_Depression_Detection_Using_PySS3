Is it possible to be so afraid of change that you want to die?That seems to be the case with me. I have no car, no job, no license, and Iâ€™m not in school. Iâ€™m 20 fucking years old and I donâ€™t have any of these things. I just sit at home in my room either watching movies or derping around on the internet. I want an amazing, fulfilling life, but I canâ€™t seem to get over my fear of success and change. 


Thereâ€™s also a medical condition that I have, itâ€™s called an Osteoid Osteoma. Itâ€™s a benign bone tumor in my cervical spine. Because of the massive, chronic pain it causes me, I can't do a lot of things such as extensive exercise or anything that would require me to do any kind of extensive movement. I am currently taking 2-4 Aleve a day for it, that's the only thing that really works since my body has gotten used to other pain meds. Itâ€™s operable, and Iâ€™ve had physical therapy for it but the pain seems to be flaring up more and more despite me doing the therapy on my own. So Iâ€™ve decided to get the surgery done, but they have to go through the front of my throat, which may cause me to lose my voice, and I am a singer.


I see now that I have been gradually getting more and more depressed throughout the last few years, and have sought help through medication but stopped taking it since I made a spur of the moment decision to move with my friend almost a thousand miles away from home a few months ago. Iâ€™m back home now, things didnâ€™t work out with my living arrangements in that other state.


My heart was broken a month ago by the love of my life, the man who made me the happiest person and yet also the most depressed. We were on and off for the past year, and it was an LDR. He had a lot of problems, lots of emotional baggage with past breakups. But I fell for him so hard, guys. So fucking hard. I put everything I had into that relationship, as I usually do. I made him my world, and then he broke my heart three times in a row, within just a few months. And now he is happy, and a newly found Christian. I am happy for him, but it has just reinforced me into believing that there really isnâ€™t a need for me in this world anymore.


Iâ€™ve told my mom that itâ€™s a chore to get up in the morning, and that I feel like Iâ€™m fighting with myself to live. I also told her that I think Iâ€™m severely depressed. I either cry a lot during the day, or sometimes I just feel numb. She just basically brushed it off by saying, "don't worry, we'll get you a doctor visit and a fresh new set of meds." She didn't talk with me extensively about how I was feeling or anything. 


I just canâ€™t seem to take the steps I need to go on with my life. I am seriously stagnated. I am just wondering if there are others who have been paralyzed by fear before, and if they would be willing to share their experiences with getting over it.
