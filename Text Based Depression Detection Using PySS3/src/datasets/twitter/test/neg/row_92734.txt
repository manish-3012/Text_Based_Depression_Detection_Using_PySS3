I'm too miserable hereI'm a 25 year old female, can't go to college or work due to severe schizophrenia, symptoms worsened with stress. 

I used to be a cutter, and miss it strongly. Want to do it again. 

I was sexually abused for years as a kid. 

I'm just taking it all in and none of it means a damn thing. I just want to die.
