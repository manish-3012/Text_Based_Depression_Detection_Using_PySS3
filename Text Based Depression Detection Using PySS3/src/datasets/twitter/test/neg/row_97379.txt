I'm scared but want to dieI dont know what to do. Started deawing vent art and listening to music. Then suddenly I'm in a nervous breakdown with flashbacks. I dont know what to do. I feel like a burden. I dont trust suicide hotline after the last incidents. I feel like everyone hates me. Because i feel like i get eye rolls when i cry out for help or if i do any vent posts on any platform. 


I'm a crying mess right now so please excuse spelling, i can't see my phone well through tears. But part of me is debating going ham with self harm and just go fuck it. I keep waiting and waiting. Going through every day and going along with it all. But yet i feel miserable. Im afraid to live but I'm afraid of what could happen if i die. Not like my death would affect anyone anyhow. I'm pretty sure people just want me to get it over with so they can throw me away finally. 


I know how to die. But yet i dont know what to do. Ive attempted so much that ive destroyed my skin permanently. I feel alone here. Just crying and contemplating. Everything ive loved died and having to grieve half my life isn't exactly helping me here. 

People claim I'm their reason to live. Or that they love my company. But as soon as i need help, they spit in my face and treat me like shit. 

I had someone dear to me fake suicide then come back years later to tell me its a prank. That shit fucked me up. And i tell myself, if I'm gonna do it then i have to do it right. None of that bullshit SHE pulled on me. I could never. That's such abuse. 

I keep telling myself that this is pointless. That its just my brain being an ass. But yet....each day just feels worse then the last. And its eating me away. I tell myself to pull through for one last event. To make it good. But yet the virus is fucking everything up. So why even bother to keep pushing onwards when i could be doing it for nothing? 

Everyone brags how great their life is. How xyz happened or how amazing this other person is. Like wow thanks. I don't brag to you yet you treat me like utter garbage. I feel like people never let you have your problems. Like theirs always has to be worse. Like everyone has problems. Its valid. But don't fucking come at me telling me mine are stupid or whatever. That is toxic as shit. 


Sorry for rambling on. I just needed to vent a bit... I dont know what's going to happen. And I'm debating if I'm gonna do it or not.
