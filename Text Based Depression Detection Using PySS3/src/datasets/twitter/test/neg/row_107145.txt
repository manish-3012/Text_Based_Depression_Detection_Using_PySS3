i donâ€™t plan on finishing 9th grade.hi there. iâ€™m fourteen years old. i was homeschooled until 9th grade. my father is abusive, my mother is piss poor. both are very christian and conservative while i am bisexual. my brothers have found friends whilst i have not. they donâ€™t need me anymore. my previous friends left for college and have lost contact with me and then my ex best friend/girlfriend used me as a therapist and then killed herself. i have no talent, no matter how hard i try i suck at everything i do &amp; because i am so young if i ever try to tell anyone anything about my depression or anxiety it is instantly shot down. only one person is kind to me, she is a almost 23 year old girl who i appreciate but also know she is only doing it because iâ€™m always by myself while everyone else is talking to people. iâ€™ve been visualizing, planning and thinking about killing myself since i was about twelve. i tried to kill myself at 13, but failed. this time, iâ€™m going to go through with it. this is my final way of letting it all out and then leaving.

i truly hope none of you ever end up like the worthless piece of trash i am or end up like this again. i know thereâ€™s a lot of survivors on this subreddit. either way itâ€™s my time. so goodbye.
