hopeless, alonestill a teenager. female diagnosed with asd about 5 months ago, all makes sense now. i have no friends - not an exaggeration. not one of those people with no friends that says 'actually, i have like two or three'. nobody. all contacts on my phone are family. snapchat contacts are family or people i havent seen in 1+yr. currently in normal high school. sit alone outside the canteen, next to the bins, only place for me. sit alone in all classes bar one, have attempted to sit with others to be told 'fuck off'. the one i sit with people in is okay - they do not talk to me, but they do not tell me to go away. have participated in extracurriculars over the years - cheerleading, soccer, drama, book club, chess, etc, always tried friendships. called regularly, texted, only to have my number blocked, to be ghosted. my mother mocks me for my autism, my father cannot understand my stims or difficulties and doesnt stand up to my mother. i am fifteen. cannot even get a job, not at any fast food places or in retail or even in volunteering; they simply will not take me. have been applying for over a year and nothing. failing school, and have moved school twice due to issues with bullying (by both students and teachers). lost my virginity, highly regret it, lead to a miscarriage bc i have no way of getting to any doctors without my parents driving me (live rurally, 45+ mins from the nearest hospital, couldnt tell my parents. buses come once a week to take people to and from church). suffering clinical depression, anxiety and anorexia. ready to die. i cant do this anymore. my two doggs since childhood have even turned against me, biting and growling. getting overstimulated much more often, meltdowns occuring more often. therapist is booked out until march. no point.
