For the first time in my life I am considering death.I don't have the means to kill myself, but right now I feel like I could die.  I'm very miserable and I feel very lonely.  I feel worthless because I don't have a job or skills and because nobody wants to hire me.  I feel very bizarre posting here, because from whom I used to feel compassion from, I only feel annoyance and scorn.  I feel like a child, because I am underdeveloped, because I feel miserable, because I'm dumb and because I feel pressured to be ashamed.  I feel like whatever I do is wrong, and I don't have any money to pay rent and everything I say is offensive.  I need someone here, with me, who can hold my hand while I grow up, who can nurture my development and help me give back what I've taken.  If I can't do things on my own, I'm going to kill myself or force myself to stop being me.

I'm not sure what I hope to gain posting this, but I feel compelled to.  If you think you know who I am, if you, someone I know, are reading this, please only confront me tactfully, since I will be embarassed and I, as previously stated, am ashamed to feel this way.  You probably know I'll never have the willingness and means to kill myself.
