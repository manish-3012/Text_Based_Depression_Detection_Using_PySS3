DeadI wish there was a way to get the one person I love the most back. That's the only thing I want out of this world, nothing else. I never wanted to live, and have only felt torture, this entire time since she abandoned me. I wish there was a way to make this miracle happen. No one else fills the gap, and it doesn't matter how many other women I come across, it's like a gaping deep wound that has no way to heal. I desire to die every day, and quite frankly I'm sick of being told to find someone else. I simply don't care anymore. I can't care, I've felt completely dead for so long, and no one can or will help me, natural or supernatural, because they don't understand what it feels like to experience the most excruciating pain a person can feel, so you cannot relate to me. I can't believe I fell in love with someone, and only this one person, who never loved me or wanted to marry me at all. I just want to die all day long, and have utterly nothing I want to do since I can't be with her no matter how hard I try.
