Is this it?I feel like after I hit puberty my mental health has been a train wreck. And no matter what I try I can't seem to get better. I'm in college right now and the only thing I can think of is is this all there is to my life. Am I going to grow up like this and never enjoy it. I don't know why I was born and I wish I killed myself earlier. I don't see my life getting better, I see myself running myself ragged every single day. My life is f***** due to my mental illness, I've been to counseling and it hasn't helped. I'm lost, and I'm thinking of overdosing at one point this week. I just want it to end.
