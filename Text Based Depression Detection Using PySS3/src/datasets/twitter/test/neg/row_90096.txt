I'm planning to kill myselfI have what I need. I have plans. I have a tentative date. I figure if things become even more unbearable before then I can always do it early, and if for some reason I wanted to live by the time the date comes I just won't do it. 

I've already written one letter. It's an angry one, and writing it felt cathartic and good. I want to recipient to read it (in fact, I want everyone to read it), but I'm not interested in the response. I have plans to right a couple more, one detailing who I want my stuff and my dog to go to, and one an actual suicide note explaining why I'm doing it and that it's my own choice and no one could have prevented it. 

Sometimes I get anxious about the fact that I don't have all the letters written, and get into a mood of either "fuck it, I'll be dead anyway why should I care if I did everything properly" or "oh god I can't do it right now I don't have the wherewithal to finish what I want to finish before I go, what if I never feel ready and I just continue to suffer indefinitely?" I want to get rid of that anxiety by writing the letters, but I haven't had the energy and motivation to do them, as I'm sure I'll be really emotional and the whole thing sounds exhausting.

I don't know what I expect out of posting here, or what I'm looking for. Maybe I want validation? Maybe I want to argue my side? Maybe, I doubt it's strong but maybe I have some desire to be proven wrong, for someone to point out something I genuinely haven't considered that would make life bearable. I don't know. But there aren't many places you can discuss things like this, and I'd like to talk about it. 

For context, I am permanently disabled with multiple refractory conditions that make me unable to work, mostly home and bedbound, in constant pain and discomfort, and miserable and (obviously) suicidal. I want to die all the time. My most tolerable moments are when I only passively would like to die, instead of actively. I have exhausted treatment options for the worst of my conditions, and only gotten worse with time. I think suicide is a reasonable decision given my circumstances.
