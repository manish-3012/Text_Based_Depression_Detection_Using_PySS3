Will I go to hell?Obviously from the title you can assume that Iâ€™m a â€œChristcuckâ€ Iâ€™m proudly a Christian. But Iâ€™ll take advice from anyone. 

I just want to be with Jesus. I donâ€™t want to be hurting and I donâ€™t want him to see me like this. I donâ€™t let the people around me see how I am. Iâ€™ve tried. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I donâ€™t know im really tired I gotta get up early in the mornin. I reckon Iâ€™ll stay around Iâ€™m not on edge right now. I try to stay away from going online when Iâ€™m like that cause I say things I donâ€™t mean. I just donâ€™t want to go to hell because of my selfishness.
