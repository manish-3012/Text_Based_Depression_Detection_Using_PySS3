Suicidal since foreverAs some memories of my childhood emerge I recall feeling suicidal from as young as 6 years of age. I remember opening the bedroom window and looking down from the second floor fantasizing of my death.

I would even have dreams of jumping out to K.M.S., but I would survive the fall.

These thoughts were very frequent. There were many times where I would randomly start crying while having suicidal ideation and I would start writing my note to my family. This even occurred while we were on our way to a yard sale (my parents are packrats) and I sobbed in silence in the back seat. 


Why did this happen to me at such a young age? Is it normal for a child to feel this way? 

These thoughts have persisted and continue to live on in my head. As I grew older my mind would wonder to other methods of ending my misery. On my walks back home from school, main Aves, j walking and speeding cars plagued my mind consistently.

Who else can relate to this?
