I'm feeling the existential dread from this insane messed up worldI'm going day by day through the same motions, where nothing matters, everyone doesn't care about anyone but themselves. The sheer monotony of this daily routine wouldn't have driven me to killing myself but rather than the looming end times that several generations of people before have placed on my generation's lap to deal with (it's climate change), where whatever I do (I don't drive, don't eat meats beyond chicken, barely even fly (less than once every half decade)) it wouldn't matter because the issue has spiralled wildly out of control where only large effort on everyone's part might make a positive impact. 

I now vividly picture collapsed buildings, savagery over scraps, rotting or dried corpses lying about, either from disease, or the searing heat. Everyone I know might be dead or descend into savagery.

I don't want to live in this kind of world. Why couldn't we have been better? I don't want to go but I want to end it so badly.
