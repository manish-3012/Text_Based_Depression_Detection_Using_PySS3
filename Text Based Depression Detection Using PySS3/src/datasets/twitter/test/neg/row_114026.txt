From the moment I wake up, I research methodsFrom the moment I woke up, just spent hours on my phone researching methods. Iâ€™m completely silent on the outside but on the inside, screaming in desperation to find a method. Dreading work tomorrow/will likely be let go. I just want peace. My anxiety is too much for my small body to handle. 

Pills donâ€™t sound like theyâ€™re full proof and I can only get over the counter stuff, scared hanging will be too painful that I wonâ€™t follow through, have never owned a gun in my life and not sure how to obtain one, exit bags look incredibly complicated with all those tubes and supplies that have to fit perfectly, jumping is scary, donâ€™t qualify for assisted suicide. 

Desperately trying to figure it out.
There is nothing keeping me here. No dependents, no family or friends, tired of hopping from one job to another, afraid of running out of money. This isnâ€™t worth it. Iâ€™m just done. Please, if there is a god, hear my prayer and let me die in my sleep.
