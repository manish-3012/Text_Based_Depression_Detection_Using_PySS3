Whatâ€™s the point of being alive if youâ€™ve got one of the most horrible stigmatised personality disorders in psychiatry, and whatâ€™s the point of living when your reason for living is dead?My dad was my number one support, a huge factor in my recovery. When things would get bad and I would get suicidal, he would be the reason I wouldnâ€™t do anything. 


I cut ties with one of my best friends because my Borderline Personality Disorder was getting out of control and causing me a lot of suffering. Better for me and better for them. 

I see no hope or end to the suffering. When Iâ€™m not suffering with interpersonal BPD issues Iâ€™m suffering from grief. I want to give up and I see no way out, itâ€™s like swinging on the pendulum from hell.
