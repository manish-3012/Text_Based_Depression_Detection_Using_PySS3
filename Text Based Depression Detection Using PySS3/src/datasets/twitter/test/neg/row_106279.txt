I can never do anything rightI feel like ever decision I make is the wrong one. Everything I does upsets the people I care about and it just kills me. I must be the dumbest person on Earth because I donâ€™t understand what I did wrong until its too late. All I want to do is make people happy and smile and I canâ€™t even do that. Whatâ€™s the point anymore? I feel like Iâ€™d be doing everyone a favor by killing myself. I want to do it so bad, I just am so scared.
