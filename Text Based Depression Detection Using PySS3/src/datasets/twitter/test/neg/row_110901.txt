Iâ€™m so tired of being angryI have been tired of living since I was 18 to the point that I hate having to take care of myself. Bathing so I donâ€™t smell, eating so Iâ€™m not hungry, trying to eat better because Iâ€™m overweight and unhealthy, working out because I care about my appearance, wearing makeup because it makes me feel better about myself, trying to find things that make me feel better about myself all really piss me off and are such chores. I do not enjoy life enough to make doing these things worth while. Why should I have to work to feed myself, when I could just kill myself? My happiness is minuscule and incomparable to the anger and pain I feel daily and have for years now. I am exhausted.

I turn 25 in November. I wonâ€™t get into why I feel the way I do, because I donâ€™t believe the stories are relevant. Those things have already happened and I canâ€™t change the past. The past has shaped me into who I am.

Iâ€™ve decided if I still feel the way I do now and have since I was 18 years old by my birthday later this year, I will try again to terminate myself. 

I have a boyfriend who is very good to me. He deserves someone who can be with him and treat him the same, but unless I change before my birthday, I unfortunately donâ€™t want to be here anymore. 

If things donâ€™t get better and I decide to go through with the suicide, I will break up with my boyfriend before I do it. He knows somewhat the level of trauma I am dealing with and knows Iâ€™m very unwell. 

Should I tell him about this so if it happens heâ€™ll know it wasnâ€™t because I didnâ€™t want to be with him, but because of my plans?
