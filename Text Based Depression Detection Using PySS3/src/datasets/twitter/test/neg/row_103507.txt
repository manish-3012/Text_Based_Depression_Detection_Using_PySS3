SoonSoon it will all be finished. I can feel it inside me... I grow weary by the minute. I don't know when, I don't know how. All I know is that soon it will all be done.

So why post here? Well simply because I am searching for some reason to hold on. Searching for a reason to stay. I may know that death is on the horizon, but doesn't make me any less scared and guilty. I guess this is my "cry for help". 

Now I guess for you need to know a bit about me. Firstly this a throwaway account. My real account is /u/The_Emery_Affliction. But you can all call me Richie. I am an 18 year old male, I suffer from clinical depression and anxiety. I have suffered from both for 6 years. Suicide has been a fleeting thought up until about 2 months. I hit rock bottom, began self harming daily, in the shower of a morning and at night before bed. It has become a ritual for me. I have tried stopping, thrown away my blades etc. But I always freak out without it, I get the shakes... I start lashing out and end up just pulling out hair or punching a wall till I bleed. So I figured I may as well just do it. Infact I cut just before I posted and to just do it all until I fall asleep.

Now as I said I have hit rock bottom. I mean it, my tablets aren't even working anymore. I feel empty, devoid of feeling. Just a shell. 

The only things that are keeping me here are my girlfriend, my best friend, family and music. If it wasn't for all this, I would have been gone a long time ago. 

Thank you all for listening 

Richard

I would also prefer that noone messages me on my normal account. 

Forgot one thing... Here is my challenge to you. I feel like I am not good enough to live, prove to me that I am good enough... That i deserve to live... Cause i believe I don't... 

Also I may as well stop lying to myself... I do have suicidal intentions, I may be scared, but I have them.... They are almost constant, drowning almost every other thought. I feel at times like I am drowning... Well maybe I should drown? Take some pills, cut deep? Why not all those to make sure the jobs done right?
