I donâ€™t know what else to doIdk what Iâ€™m doing here on this page, but here i am, and i will tell all of you strangers my woes.
Iâ€™ve been depressed since the passing of my grandfather a couple of years ago, but i wasnâ€™t severely depressed until i let my depression takeover and kick me out of college cuz i wasnâ€™t going to class. Iâ€™d always played around with the thought of suicide in my head, but always thought it was too selfish, I couldnâ€™t put my grandmother through losing someone else. I pushed through until Covid hit and we had to quarantine, i was broke living off money that my grandma was giving me, who was struggling to provide as it was. I felt worthless, like i really was heading nowhere fast. I forgot to mention i was on probation for having half an adderal and a tab of acid in my wallet when my best friend and i got caught by police. I felt like a fucking loser. It was this moment i was at the lowest point Iâ€™ve ever been and i attempted to take my own life, i had thought if i swallowed a bottle of ibuprofen, i thought my body would be able to presented at a funeral and my grandma and friends could have closure, but then almost immediately as i had swallowed them i was rushing to the bathroom to throw them up. After that i cried in the bathroom, and i fell asleep on the bathroom floor. Since that day Iâ€™ve had this weight of regret and i guess thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m writing this just to get it out there somewhere. Iâ€™ve been feeling the same way again a lot lately.
