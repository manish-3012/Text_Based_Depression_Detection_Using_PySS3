i'm not sure who to talk to right nowI sort of got hit all at once with the realization that i treat people like shit and i've had the first panic attack i've had in like 2 years. i'm on meds for panic and the attack happened through them, which does not happen for me.

i feel like i thoroughly actively hurt the people around me. i don't know why i've changed. I thought about suicide tonight for the first time in a year. I won't do it but I thought about ways I could do it where my family would not find me. What holds me back is hurting my family. I know they love me but I don't know how to stop being such a piece of shit

I hate myself so fucking much. I'm so selfish.
