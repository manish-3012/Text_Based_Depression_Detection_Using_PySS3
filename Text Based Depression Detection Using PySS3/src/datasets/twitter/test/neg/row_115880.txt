i have OCD, i feel like never im not going to get betteri have anxiety everyday, i feel pain by thinking. Almost all the time my head is torturing me.  I started taking antidepressants recently (sertraline, a ssri).

 If this does not work, I am really considering killing myself, this disease ruined all my relationships and ruins me, it has ruined me for many years. I feel very weak for this world, it's full of people with the power to be, but i can't.

 I feel alone in my head with all of this.
