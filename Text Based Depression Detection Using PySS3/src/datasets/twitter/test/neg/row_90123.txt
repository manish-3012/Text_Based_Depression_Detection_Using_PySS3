So lonely lolEverything started when my mother decided to homeschool me in kindergarten because I was smart. My entire life I haven't had a single close friend, and only two regular friends (and the second one stopped talking to me 5 years ago). I never met my father, my extended family never gave a shit about us, and my brother left for college 6 years ago and never looked back. 

I had a chance to get out by doing well in highschool and going to college, but due to never learning how to study, never learning how to manage my time, never learning how to be responsible, I ended up failing tenth grade. I'm almost 18 and a half, and I'm graduating highschool this winter having learned next to nothing because the alternative school I'm going to only exists to get you a diploma and nothing else. I'm supposed to go to nursing school next year, but I have no idea if I'm even capable.

The only things stopping me from killing myself are the fear of an afterlife, pity for my mother, and my internet girlfriend (whose love for me I can't understand, because as far as I'm concerned she's way out of my league). Ive wasted my life, I've wasted my potential, and the only peace I see is death.
