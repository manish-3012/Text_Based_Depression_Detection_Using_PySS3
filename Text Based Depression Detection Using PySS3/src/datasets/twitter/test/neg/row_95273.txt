Iâ€™ve never felt this way beforeIâ€™ve been depressed before and it was partly caused by my very bad general anxiety. Recently it all started coming back and it was worse than before (I had meds for both that truely helped me. Part of what is causing this is not being able to see my friends(one of the few things that keeps me going. And then my parents have decided to treat me like shit for example I was playing on my Xbox (another thing that helps me be happy) and my parents decided it would be a good idea to make me stop playing (on the weekend btw) and make me do over 4 hours of housework on one of the few days I can try to be to myself. Iâ€™m honestly tired of this Shit I might as well leave donâ€™t care. Anymore
