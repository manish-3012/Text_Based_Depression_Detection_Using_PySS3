I want to end this lifeI donâ€™t want to die but I want this life to end. 

Everything I do I seem to fuck it up somehow. Iâ€™m not good at anything and the things Iâ€™m ok at Iâ€™m just that, ok. Not good or great. Just, â€œEh itâ€™s passableâ€. 

Iâ€™m flunked out of college. Iâ€™m about to lose my job, I just know it. Iâ€™ve lost the last two because they were so soul crushing I just couldnâ€™t bring myself to care enough to go to them. 

All my friends donâ€™t even bother to talk to me. I have to be the one to reach out and talk to them and make plans. Which 9/10 times fall through because something better came up for them to do instead.

I havenâ€™t had an actual conversation with my mother since Christmas. Only the occasional text that I send her. For years Iâ€™ve felt that she was the only human being who still cared yet I feel as if she has given up on me ever getting better. My father gave up years ago and only talks to me when he is forced to by my mother.

My brother started as a fuck up but turned his life around and has a wife, two kids, a house and a career. While Iâ€™m here, the one who was in honors classes and considered smart. I feel as if I had been climbing the stairs of success only to slip and fall backwards, tumbling down and landing at the very bottom with a broken back, unable to climb back up and doomed to waste away at the bottom of the staircase.

I donâ€™t want to die. But I want to a restart on life. 

Iâ€™m 26 and I plan on ditching my job, my friends, my family, and just take off driving across the country. I have two prescription bottles seroquel, both nearly full. That I plan to take as a last resort. I want to try and make it somewhere new first. Run away and kill this version of myself first before ending it all.

If nothing works maybe Iâ€™ll drive to a state park, get lost with a bottle of booze, and watch the sunset in the middle of nowhere while the pills and alcohol take me.
