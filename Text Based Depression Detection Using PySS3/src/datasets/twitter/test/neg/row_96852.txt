Each day is as bad or worse than the day before.I pray every night to die in my sleep. It's more like I'm begging to die. Lately I have been feeling angry after I wake up because I'm still here. I keep this hidden from my wife and co-workers. Makes for a long day. Seconds feel like hours. Hours feel like days. Why can't I build up the courage to kill myself. I have no family other than my wife and in laws. I guarantee they wouldn't be upset if I was gone. I'm 57 years old, that's long enough to be on this Earth. This has been going on for awhile, almost a year. I'm not hurting anyone or asking for any earthly possessions. I just want God to grant me this one thing. This is the first time I've shared this out loud. I'm hoping that if I put this in writing and out to the public, maybe God will bless me and answer my prayers. Hopefully tonight is the night!!!!!!!
