Friend is going to end up in bad situationLooking for thoughts and information.  Girl is using him to advance her life.  He knows the rest of the friends opinions on his relationship, but he has been a lonely guy and is blinded.  He has stated, to her and others, that if she hurts him he will kill himself.  I am concerned he may hurt others as well.

The reason it comes to this point is that they just got engaged, I give this situation another year or two. My thought at this point is to just say 'congrats, wish you all the best' but then comment on what he has previously said.  Then provide him with numbers of councilors to call before he does anything which cant be undone.

Is there another approach?  Could anyone provide contact information for professionals in the Kitchener-Waterloo region of Ontario Canada?
