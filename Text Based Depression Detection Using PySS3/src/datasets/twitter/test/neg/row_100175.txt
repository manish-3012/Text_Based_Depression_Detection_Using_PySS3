Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m done. I canâ€™t take it anymore.Yep, Iâ€™m the bad guy. Sorry I just wanted to find love. Sorry that Iâ€™m a nice person. Sorry Iâ€™m an introvert. I canâ€™t take it anymore. The loneliness, the sexual frustration, the neglect, and the self hatred. Iâ€™m done. I hate my life nothing is fair.
