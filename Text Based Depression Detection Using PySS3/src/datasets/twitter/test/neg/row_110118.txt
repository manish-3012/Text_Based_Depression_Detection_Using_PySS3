I am going to end my life soonwhat's the point of me being here anymore? I am a useless piece of garbage taking up space on earth that somebody else deserves. 

I am currently failing every subject at school and I don't complete my work anymore. Feel free to call me lazy, I'm used to being criticized all the time. 

The truth is, I am too depressed to even try anymore. I've given up on everything because I know I am going to pass away very soon. Part of me is scared to go through with it, but the other part of me is screaming that I need to end my life. 

I used to be afraid of death, but I'm not anymore. I like the thought of eternal sleep. I'm looking forward to it. No thoughts, no pain, nothing. Just pure darkness. 

The thing I am least looking forward to is the passing away progress. Will I feel pain? What will be my last thought? 

I've considered reaching out for help, but I am scared of what people might think. How will my parents react? What will they do? 

My 16th birthday is later this month. I should be getting my license and spending time with my family, but instead I'll be laying in a coffin. 

I know I am going to miss out on a lot, like potentially having my own family one day, or feeling better later. I can't wait that long. The pain is unbearable. I just want it to stop. 

I would feel better if I droppes out of school. I can't. My parents expect me to get top grades and become successful. that's just not for me. If I even say the word dropping out I get screamed at. That's my only other option. 

1. Suicide
2. Drop out of school

Sorry about my rant
