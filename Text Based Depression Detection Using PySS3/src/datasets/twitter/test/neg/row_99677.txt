Might try.Ever since I was a kid, I have the overwhelming feeling of the need to die. I was only 4 and i had the strong need to die. I was only a kid and death was the only escape I could think of. I'm in my early 20s. Almost mid. I have attempted hundreds or more probably. Living in a country where mental health care is still a joke. Surrounded by hypocrites. Barely even sustaining myself financially. I have failed in so many ways and I couldng even end it right. It's like the world is telling me to stay and suffer more. It's all my fault. Everything is all my fault. I have accepted that everything is myf ault. All the shit that is happening to me is my fault. I tried doing it last night but guess what, I fucking dropped the razor blade in the goddamn drain. I might try again soon. I doubt anyone would notice. I doubt anyone would care. I doubt anyone would look for me. Everyone keeps leaving. People kept telling me to stay. I stayed but the still leave. I stayed and I end up in a worse situation. I feel so alone. In a place/country that is bsolute shit in my opinion. I feel so alone. I tried. I really did try. I really did. Why does no one believ in me anymore. I honestly don't know anymore if I'm awake or not. Maybe I should try waking up. I'll wake up and it's going to be January 6 again. Back when I was safe. Back when I was in my beloved's arms. I feel so alone. I want to scream but I can't. I want to wake up now.




 Hey teddy, if by any chance you search up any of my handles and find this. I love you. I really really love you. With all my heart. Every day when I was with you. When you were mine and I was yours. I fell in love with you over and over again.
