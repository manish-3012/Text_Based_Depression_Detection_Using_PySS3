I'm tired of living....I donâ€™t know if I should keep on living anymore, I canâ€™t handle the constant pressure of self-guilt and still being depressed. Today I was suppose to attend community college but never ended up getting my schedule in the first place, not only that, my whole entire family thinks Iâ€™ll never amount to anything. I personally think theyâ€™re right, I was always useless to begin with, sometimes I wonder why I even exist in the first place. This might be my last personal update, I might do it tonightâ€¦I really donâ€™t have a reason to be alive anymore now that itâ€™s meaningless.

If I do end up doing it tonight, I just wanted to say thatâ€¦I apologize to my own family that Iâ€™m a complete failure, I didnâ€™t mean to waste a lot of your precious time. I apologize that I was ever born, I apologize that I was horrible at math, I apologize that I never did anything on time or got anything done, but most of all, I apologize for existing.

I know that nobody is gonna even bother to read this, Iâ€™m fine with that, I donâ€™t want be noticed anyway. I know that by the time I finish this final statement, theyâ€™ll either take away my belongings, or my whole stuff in general. Iâ€™m too afraid to continue my life, I donâ€™t want to feel anymore pain, I never really had any friends to begin with, my high school years fucking sucked, I knew that ever since I graduated my whole life was gonna go down hill from here. I thought that I was never going to live past 18, let alone 15, but the more I stay alive, the more I suffer.

My family isnâ€™t terrible, but, they pretty much donâ€™t have a fucking clue on how to handle someone with depression, before I leave, I just wanted to say that Iâ€™ll miss my siblings a lot, and my mother as well, as for my father, I will always hate you from the very end, Iâ€™ve tried to forgive you multiple times, but youâ€™re just too much of a fucking psychopath, I hope my mother divorces you really soon you manipulative cunt.

If you find my body, I want to be cremated and I want you to spread my ashes either in B.C., Canada, or someplace beautiful in Colorado. Donâ€™t forget to donate my organs first, when Iâ€™m gone, please donâ€™t tamper with my personal belongs, and yes that includes my artwork, diary, etc. , donâ€™t even throw them away, just leave them where theyâ€™re at, if you have to make an alteration with my room I understand, just put my stuff somewhere safe.
