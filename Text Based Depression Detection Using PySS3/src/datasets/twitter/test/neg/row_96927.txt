no matter what happens, it always comes backI'm 31. Positive progress is always inexplicable. Every time I think "maybe this is it, the time I can pull out of it." But it simply takes a random day where the universe keeps stacking on unlucky nonsense, and it feels like a stranger politely ousting cigarettes on my arm all day long. Then I have a breakdown. The depression lingers long after. 

Either this world or my brain is a fucking monster. It doesn't matter which. Every time the cycle restarts, I'm deeply contemplating suicide. Why can't I be free from this. Psychiatry is literal pseudoscience that does not help. Behavioral therapy only does so much. It comes down to my personal patience and if I can take this sick life forever. What a shit time to be alive, where science is still fucking retarded about the human brain. Great.
