I jus want sum help plsIm 17, n in my first year of uni. Recently, it hit me, im practically an adult now, and that thought really scares me to my coreâ€¦ All my friends are enjoying  growing up and theyve already left me, but im so different, I dread the thought of growing upâ€¦ All my friends want to appear older, more mature but i just want to be seen as a child forever, even though I know that's impossibleâ€¦I love it when people think i'm younger than my age. There's also all this pressure of choosing a career â€¦. My parents want me to do medicine but I'm not really sure that's what i want to doâ€¦in fact i'm not sure what I want to do with my life at all, my only idea is to be a lawyer, and im rly interested in it however idk if ill ever make it to law school and im so afraid to let my family down , theyve worked so hrd for me nd i feel like im really letting them down:( i just feel too young to be making such huge decisions that will affect the rest of my lifeâ€¦ When I look back on my life, i wish i could be a little kid again, like 12-13 would be great, that's when things were so fun and simpleâ€¦Sometimes I feel like the best part of my life is already over and that thought makes me feel all sad and depressed..All my friends feel like their lives are just beginning, now that they have more freedom and independence, I'm just too attached to my home and family and not ready to grow up yetâ€¦ This is kind of strange too because I'm usually quite mature for my age(sensible, responsible). things now r eve worse cuz of covid.... I was dying to finally make it to uni and make new friends but im sad to say that its been 2 whole months and I really have no friends or even seen anyone, i feel so lonely and cold, just maybe doing all this and goin thru life aint worth it no more... yk? So what do u think? Is all this normal? Any advice for me? please i need it.
