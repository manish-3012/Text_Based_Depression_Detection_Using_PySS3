I smoked way too much weed and now I feel like Iâ€™m going crazyI normally donâ€™t get High because it makes me feel really anxious, paranoid and uncomfortable. Iâ€™ve never liked it but I smoked today because Iâ€™ve been feeling god awful and I wanted something besides alcohol to numb myself. I regret smoking so much I feel ever worse than I did before :/
