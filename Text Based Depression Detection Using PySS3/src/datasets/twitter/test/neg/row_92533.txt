I wish I was dead because it's the only way I'll be free.Free from noise, free from pain, free from tiny people constantly climbing me, pulling on me, dragging me around, free from the endless onslaught of daily responsibilities and the demands of life. I'm so tired of life. I don't have the energy to do any of it or put up with any of it anymore. I just want to be done.
