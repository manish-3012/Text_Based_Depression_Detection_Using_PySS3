Life's a bitch. I can't take so many failures no more, and I feel like ending it all, to finally be at peace.To anyone reading this; Thanks. You are giving me your time and attention, and for me that means a lot. Also, sorry in advance! This will be a long post. But I need to get this out of my chest.

My name is Hebert Nascimento, I'm twenty years old, born and raised in Brazil. Now, Brazil is a... "Eat or get eaten" kind of place. Our crime rate is off the charts, as every nine minutes there is someone out there, dying of unnatural causes. Also, our economy is in a bad situation, as more than 18% of our total population is unemployed. That's more than 37,260.000 brazilians. And belive me, everything being as expensive as it is does NOT help.

Now, since childhood I knew that If I wanted some kind of chance out there in the real world, I would need some sort of edge, an advantage over the competition, so I learned english! And because my parents could not pay for english classes, all that I know I learned by myself, down to every last word. Did that help me? No, it didn't.

I've been looking for my first job since the end of highschool, back in 2015. Do you know how frustrating that is? Every damn day I used to wake up at 5:00 AM to deliver my resumes, every damn day! I lost count of how many times I almost fainted out there, in the middle of nowhere, under the scorching sun. Now? I can't even deliver my resumes anymore, as there is no money left to print them. 
Believe me, I tried everything that I could, even starting my own business. I've found and old bike while out there, broken and rusted, so I brough it home and after some time, fixed it. I also made a wodden kart, to go around with the bike. I planned to haul people stuff around, earning money this way. In my first day a crackhead came out of some bushes, slashing at me with a knife. He gave me a scar in the hand, took the bike, the kart and my pride.

Having no money is... terrible. You want to eat something and you can't, you want to buy yourself a nice shirt and you can't, you want to hang out with your friends and you can't. I have dreams too, you know! Dumb dreams who may sound stupid to people from first world countries, but they are my dreams, they are everything that I have left. I used to have more... I had a smartphone, a Samsung Galaxy Gram Prime Duos, it was a horrible device, but it was mine. Until some guy with a gun robbed it, even pointed the barrel of his heater at my forehead, for good measure. Now? I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Pocket Duos, who I can't do shit with.

It's all so fucked up, right? Needing money to survive, to help your family, but having no way to earn it. But that is not what truly defeated me... What crumbled my defenses was the death of my best friend, Bruno.

It happened so fast. We where outside his house, just talking, hanging out, ya know? Then I went inside to drink some water... That is when I heard it. Some angry voices and after that, the gunshot. The first thing I saw when I went outside again was his body on the ground, cold and bleeding. I didn't know that our bodies could get so cold, so fast. From what the police said after catching the guy, was that he shot Bruno because his wallet was empty. My friend died because he had no money.
We where like brothers. We wanted to leave this place so bad, move to a better country. We had dreams! He had dreams! Now? He will never see they come true, neither will I, because dreams cost money.

I don't know what to do, I can't take this anymore. I was always strong enough to push trough my depression, but now? I... I'm tired, tired, scared and broken. I'm thinking of ending it all to be honest. What is the point? I NEED help, without it, nothing is going to change. But let's be real here, nobody is going to help me. I should just stop being a bother for everyone.
