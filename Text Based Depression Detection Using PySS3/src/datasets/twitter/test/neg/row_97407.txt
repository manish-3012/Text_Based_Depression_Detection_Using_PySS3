"Her prognosis is guarded"I destroy all of my close relationships. 

What's the point? 

What's the fucking point?

Remember the reason I tried to kill myself?

Of course not. I haven't told anyone.

But it hasn't gone away.

It will never go away.

What kind of lonely, half-life is this? I can't live like this.

I can't face it. I can't talk about it. 

I would rather die. I almost died. I wish I had fallen asleep that day. I wish I had fought harder when they tried to shove that tube down my nose and allowed my heart rate to skyrocket until it stopped. 


I'm worried I'm going to lose my friends because I'm being such a miserable, crazy freak. I'm no fun to be around. 

What is the point? What is the point when I've suffered from this disorder for almost ten years? What is the point, when my prognosis is guarded?
