Still fucking suicidal and depressed even though it's my graduation todayI am honestly so done with life and everything. I have been depressed for 7 years and suicidal for 2 and nothing fucking changed, in fact it's just getting worse. Now don't tell me I have to change myself in order to be happy, or "just fake being happy, everyone is depressed, just get over your trauma people have it worse" because I did and nothing changed. I tried meeting new people, tried dozens of psychiatric drugs, meet many psychiatrists and therapists, did self care, yoga and I am still so fucking depressed. I tried killing myself a couple of times but I am a fucking failure in everything. I have been to inpatient two times for several months and it's just a colorful prison, a punishment for being different. The only thing I didn't try is drugs or alcohol but hell I am gonna go all in once I go to college. 
Well now I am just gonna start planning for my final act and I will make it perfect. I really regret not killing myself last summer. 

Don't talk me out of it, like I said nothing helps. And I literally mean nothing.

I will probably delete this later so yeah whatever.
