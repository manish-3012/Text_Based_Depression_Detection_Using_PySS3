Stood up to my best friend who started being abusive, he just gave up on our friendshipI never really had many friends and I always felt very lonely. However about half a year ago I reconnected with a guy I knew in high school and we became best friends immediately. We were each other's only reason for living. We shared things with each other we wouldn't share with anyone else, and helped when we had no one else to. I made sure to do everything I could when his abusive parents kicked him out or hit him, I made sure to calm him down when he had his anxiety attacks, I helped him end a relationship he didn't want to be in, I helped save his current relationship multiple times after his lying made his girlfriend furious. And in exchange he made me feel not alone and like I had someone who cared. But after he got his current girlfriend, he kept upsetting her and it made him very stressed. I noticed I started to become the outlet for his anger. He would say horrible things to me for no reason, but then calm down later and admit he was just angry about something else. I would forgive him immediately because I loved him, but then there was a major fight that went too far. When I confronted him about this, about how he would treat me so terribly then get even worse when I called him out on it, he just got even more angry. He would constantly threaten to just never speak to me again because he knew I had no other friends and would be desperate to appease him. I made the difficult decision to send him a message saying he can't do this to me and blocked him on everything, saying if he ever regretted it he could visit me in person to apologize. He found the one thing I forgot to block him on and made sure to have the last word, telling me it was his decision to not be friends and to never talk to him again. It's so hard realizing someone you basically shared a heart with could be this way, and even harder to lose them. I just hate how this had to end, and hope the person I love is in there somewhere.
