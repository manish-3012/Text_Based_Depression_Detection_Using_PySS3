Life is a waste of timeIt's gotten to the point where I don't see a future that does not involve me taking my own life. There is really no purpose in me being alive anymore. I don't care about anyone or enjoy anything at all. Everything just seems meaningless and a waste of time. Most days I just lay in bed until its time to eat. I wish I had something to make me get out of bed but there is literally nothing I have passion for or that interests me. I don't even see the point in putting effort into schoolwork when the end for me just seems so near and I will probably drop out for the second time. Many people view me as a failure, toxic, useless, or an easy target. But all these negative views people have about me really doesn't matter because I really do not care anymore. When you die its all over and it does not matter what people think of you or what you think of somebody else. There really is no point in this post either but I think I would rather put this here than have it stuck in my head for the rest of the day.
