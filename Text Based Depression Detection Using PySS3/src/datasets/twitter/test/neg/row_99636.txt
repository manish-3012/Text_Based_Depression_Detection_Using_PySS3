I'm so broken.I feel like my entire world is spiraling to an end. There are so many negative feats happening in my life right now and I just cannot keep my head together no matter how much I try to keep a positive outlook. A year ago today, I was so happy. I had everything that I ever wanted right in the palm of my hands and I felt successful. I felt great. Today, I am a failure. I do not feel like I can accomplish any of my dreams. I do not feel that any effort I spend on trying to keep moving forward is worth it. I went from having a job where I was making over $60,000 a year to working at a local diner because I lack any other choice. I went from living with a beautiful woman with a bright future to being pushed to the side and forgotten, as if I was just nothing. I feel like nothing. I feel empty. I hate being alone so I surround myself with people who only bring me down, even if they don't do it purposely. I feel like I could do such great things but I just can't. I won't. I've lost at this game of life.
