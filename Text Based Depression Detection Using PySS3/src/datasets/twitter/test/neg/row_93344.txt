Please tell me pills will be enough to go out withI really honestly just want to die peacefully. I lived a life of pain and at least in my last moment I dont wanna die with that same pain and frustration and loneliness. But I know theres no way I can make that happen.  


I have a few gs of antidepressants. I cant bear it anymore.  


Life always has been and always will be too painful and too lonely. I will never be loved, I'm certain about that, and I'll never be able to get away from the trauma and emotional depletion my family has caused me to this day. I'm done. I am fucking done with all this nonsensical pain that will never even amount to anything no matter how hard I keep on fighting. I've fought long and hard and I'm fucking done.
