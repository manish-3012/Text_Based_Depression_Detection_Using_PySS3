Attention-seeking.I went to the hospital a handful of days ago because I called CPS becuase of my family situation and now I'm actually feeling suicidal and just down. I don't wanna be hear. The idea of cutting is more seductive. I wish I could've gotten help while I was in the hospital but I was just feeling more on the "bubbly" (not necessarily excited) and I blew my opportunity. I just don't feel like I want to be here anymore. My partner was supportive in telling me to call but I don't know anymore.
