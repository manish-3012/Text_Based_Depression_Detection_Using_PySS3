I cant live with all this shit anymoreOk.I dont know how to Start all this but singe the end of 2017 my life has been just fucking shit.I really dont have anyone in my life that really seems to care.I have some friends but that are online or school friends (which isnt bad) but most of the people in my life just fucking exhaust me or make me angry.My parents are the fucking same.These fuckers will fo fucking nothing but telling me  that im a useless piece of shit and that im doing nothing.I have almost nothing that brings me joy and i have absolutely nothing to look forward.I am fucking alone singe i have lost contact to my best friend 3 three years ago.Everything just sucks and breaks me.I tried talking to a good friend (he doesnt suck) but he really didnt get the point.He just came up with the same lines that everybody says like "go find a  new Hobby" or "try to connect with older friends or find new ones" which just really doesnt work.I wake up every fucking morning and want to kill myself because i have to go to school,and all the other shit things in my shit life.I dont fucking see why i am even living at this point, because things wont get better. After school comes more school or a fucking shit job.No people that like me like always and more Stress with taxes,Jobs,money and all that shit.
I dont Think anybody would really care if i would kil myself.They all would just say that it is sad and that i should have reached out more to them and they all wouldt care anymore  2 or 3 months later.I just have fucking nothing and i have no one and i have no fucking reason to live anymore.
