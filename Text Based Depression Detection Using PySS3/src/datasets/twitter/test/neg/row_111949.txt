My life has turned to shitMy life has gone down hill..

As Iâ€™m laying in my apartment with my power shut off, looking to find my next fix with drugs I can get my hands on and selling items on offer up to have enough to put something in my belly Iâ€™ve gotten emotional and just need to vent. 

Two year ago my parents left the country, leaving me an apartment half way paid off. I had a job making decent money and have gotten promoted shortly after their leave twice in the span of a year; being employed there for six years I was finally happy making close to 60k after taxes. 

From a young age of eighteen I worked in the nightlife industry as a side gig; on and off which got me into the party lifestyle, Iâ€™d regularly work my day job for nine hours and two to three times a week Iâ€™d work at a club hosting or doing security till nearly 4 am. Thatâ€™s where my problem with drugs started. 

The picture I painted isnâ€™t too detailed but gives enough inside to now tell you the flip side. Since January Iâ€™ve havenâ€™t had a job, any money I had has gone towards keeping myself happy through stimulation. I had my car repossessed, only to purchase it back, sell it and use all the money on more drugs; during that time I was nearly ready to pull the trigger and end it all but I didnâ€™t. 

My friends have come and tried to aid, my parents have sent money and tried to help. Yet Iâ€™m lost feeling like Iâ€™m stuck in limbo...

... I just got a message on OfferUp to purchase my snowboard and it made me cry remembering what my life was like when I was actually alive. Iâ€™m not writing this expecting an answer to my issues or a pick me up, I just hope someone out there doesnâ€™t commit the same mistakes if you realize having issues similar to mine early on in life. Iâ€™m 27 about to turn 28 itâ€™s not too late for me but I wish Iâ€™d have a different outlook and self control earlier on.
