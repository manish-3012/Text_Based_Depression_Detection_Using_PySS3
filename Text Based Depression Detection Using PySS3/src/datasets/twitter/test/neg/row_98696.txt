I wish I wasn't here.I'm so stressed out. I can't get enough work done and everyone is embarrassed that I'm having such a hard time. No one cares that I've been crying myself to sleep for the past three years and no one cares that I always have blood on my sleeves and scars all over my body that weren't even my fault. The only escape is running away or killing myself and I'd much rather prefer killing myself if I hadn't failed the last 7 times. I'm a failure and a waste of space. I know my parents think it too. I can see it when they look at me. I just want to die.
