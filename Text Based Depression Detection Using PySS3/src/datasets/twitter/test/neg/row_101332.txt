My DilemmaI'm currently 14 years old, still attending school and lately I've been getting angrier and upset at my parents more and more each day. It doesn't help that my parents are of Asian ethnicity. I donâ€™t want to scare you too much, as Iâ€™m not considering suicide in the near future, and even then there aren't any painless methods available for me that I know of.

My entire life, my parents have been continually nagging me about doing well at school, whilst slowly taking away and restricting my forms of entertainment. For the past few months, they've blocked all gaming and entertainment sites/serves, and they have limited my internet access to 4 hours each day. I used to enjoy gaming with friends, and it was really the only thing that I would look forward to most days, but I eventually got used to it and I was able to bear with it, but recently they've started to annoy me even more, and that's when I decided that I may be emotionally depressed.

Recently, whenever I am at home, all they talk about is how other students at school are so much more successful than me and all the other fucking shit they spurt, and they've been continually talking about sending me to a boarding school, though I wish they would shut the fuck up. I wouldn't even mind going to a boarding school in my current situation. My school exams are next week, and theyâ€™ve constantly been on my case to study, even though I have barely any time or opportunities to do so, and even then I still have assignments due which Iâ€™ve been needing to work on Whenever I use the computer, they keep fucking checking up on me every few minutes as if every little thing I am doing is wrong, and there have been multiple days where they tell me to get off and I have nothing to do for the rest of the day. 
Last night I was forced to leave my house without notice, staying up until 10:40 PM outside the local library so I could finish typing up my Commerce assignment in the freezing cold. They were already angry enough at me for leaving when I had to study for exams, though itâ€™s even more fucking annoying that if I hadnâ€™t finished it, my life couldâ€™ve been in an even shittier position. Over the past 8 or so years, they've enrolled me in a tutoring program, which involved doing extra homework each day, and despite it being a nuisance, it actually wasn't all that bad. Two weeks ago; however, they had a discussion with the company my tutor works for resulting in the work I had to previously do doubling, and now they force me to finish my work for each day in front of them as soon as they get home, despite my desire to spend my limited hours of internet access on finishing my assignments.
I honestly just feel like they're just pointing out every single fucking pointless detail in my life and telling what I am doing wrong, what I should be doing with it, and continually comparing me to perfect students at school which they aspire me to be, but I just want them to leave me the fuck alone. I gave up on succeeding at school 3 years ago after they banned my internet access for a month for getting a detention at school. Whenever I try to do my work, they just get angry for me, always suspecting me to be doing something wrong no matter what the fuck I tell them, and they simply ignore me, only to get angrier at me for wasting my time.

My Mom has also kept shouting at me to get a job whenever I am in my very limited free time, telling me I waste my life on the weekends and that I donâ€™t appreciate her enough for feeding me. I personally donâ€™t have anything to fucking thank her for, and it doesnâ€™t help we have the most fucked up and retarded assignment at school due in two days where we are required to do a speech on how our family members have been a positive influence on my life. I have nothing positive to talk about them anymore, and I feel like not showing up, or saying I havenâ€™t done it, but that will only make my teacher pissed off at me and turn my parents into even more of a fucking nuisance, as they will receive a phone call from the school regarding a late submission.

I'm fucking sick of my life at the moment, and I have no idea what I can do. Itâ€™s incredibly windy and10 degrees Celsius outside right now, pitch black at night, but I feel like just going for a walk to try and escape from all the shit that is ruining my life right now. I donâ€™t want to hear your bright light at the end of the tunnel stories or never give up on hoping for a better life quotes, I just want to hear if it is possible to make my life any less shit at the moment, or if there are people in an even worse situation than me so I won't feel so bad.
