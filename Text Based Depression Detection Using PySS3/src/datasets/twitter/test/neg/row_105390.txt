Anyone feeling suicidal on a Friday night?I wish I can do it, but all these methods sound so painful and ineffective
I guess I'm too afraid to die, but Im not looking forward to living either
I dont even know why I'm posting this, I guess just feeling frustated of why things don't get better n just felt like I can't go on anymore
