My FiancÃ© cheated on me with my sister. I grew up in a very abusive household. Every day was a nightmare. My sister went to live with our Aunt and Uncle out of state while I was stuck with my parents. But I held in there, until highschool came around, and I met a guy who treated me like no on ever has. When he found out about my household, he offered to let me live with him and his family. I finally got out of that fucked up house, and I had someone who was taking care of me and showing me genuine love, it was the best feeling in the world. I tried helping out whenever I could, and I tried to be the best girlfriend I could possibly be, to pay him back. Eventually my sister got in contact with me, and planned on visiting for a couple weeks. But as she stayed with us, my boyfriend and her got unusually close, and it felt like he spent more time with her than me. Today I found a series of texts that are 100% concrete evidence that, they not only slept together, but also that he was going to leave me for her and kick me out. She seemed to have convinced him into think I was lying about everything, including my household. I have nowhere to go, except back to that hell hole. I feel betrayed and alone. I can't do this anymore.
