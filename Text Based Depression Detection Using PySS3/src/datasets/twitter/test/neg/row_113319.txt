So I cut myself last nightI don't know how to deal with this anymore, I've felt like a horrible mother for a very long time, I feel unworthy. I give everything I have to the people I love and I/it gets thrown away like trash. My Bf also broke up with me so that added to it bc I not only lost my bf but I lost my best friend. I have no real friends no one that I can go to and that is there unconditionally for me. I honestly believe my kid would be better off with my parents than with me. I feel trapped, have slept for the last 5 days and haven't eaten at all. I don't know how much longer I want to do this.
