Here's the thing - I'm mentally ill and I need to dieWhen I was a kid at school, corporal punishment was still a thing. I vividly remember getting hit on the knuckles with a thin, wooden stick - and had lines of red rashes as reminder for the rest of the day. But going through it all, it wasnt the hits that hurt that bad - they did, but the anticipation of the inevitable pain, that did me in.

I'm a bipolar person. I have days, weeks of happiness, mania, and then bouts of painful episodes of depression. I went three days without eating, and bread hurt my stomach on the fourth day. I remember that burning pain. Worse, I anticipate it. I live my "normal" moments in anticipation of the incoming hurt - the madness, the way I'm destroying my family, the people I love.


The reason I'm putting this to words is because I feel anothet episode of toxicity coming, and I fear it. There is no help for me. No medicines, no counselling, nothing can help from the fear of that incoming darkness. 

I really, really wish to die. A peaceful death. A normal death. Today. I dont know about tomorrow.
