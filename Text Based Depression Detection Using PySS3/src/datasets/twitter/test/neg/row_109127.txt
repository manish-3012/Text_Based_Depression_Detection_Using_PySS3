using a guni got abused by so many people. I was socially isolated for 3 years. i already wrote a lot on this subreddit and i met some nice people. but after a while those â€žniceâ€œ people were also abusing me i guess. Yesterday i asked a friend if i could borrow his hunting rifle. iâ€˜ll receive that rifle in a few hours. whats the best way to use it? Pulling the trigger while the rifle is on the throat or put a bullet straigt to the brain?
