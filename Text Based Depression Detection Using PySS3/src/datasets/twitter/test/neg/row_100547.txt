Looking for things for my friend who is depressed to doMy friend is only 12, he doesn't have access to video games or stuff like that.   His mind keeps wandering due to reasons and I need something for him to do that requires a lot of concentration to where his mind won't "wander" so he won't worry or be to depressed.     Suggestions?    He doesn't really like movies/tv shows unless thier like twilight zone
