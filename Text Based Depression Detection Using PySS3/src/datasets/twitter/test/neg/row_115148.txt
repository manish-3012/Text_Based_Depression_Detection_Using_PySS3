I just canâ€™t get myself to care anymore.Basically, I donâ€™t see a point in staying. Iâ€™m trying so hard to find a reason, but thereâ€™s none. I canâ€™t do it much longer. Itâ€™s no longer a matter of if I kill myself, but when. April is kind of a bad month for suicide. Maybe May. My friend is getting married in June, so maybe I hold off until after her wedding. I donâ€™t want to kill myself in the summer though because thatâ€™s when my grandma, grandpa, cousin, and uncle all died. So maybe I hold off until August. I donâ€™t really know. I just know I cannot do this much longer. I just want peace. I donâ€™t want to hurt anymore.
