I never thought Iâ€™d be thinking of ending things. Dealing with guilt for my loved ones.Hey there. Iâ€™m a F , 35 years old. If you had asked me ten years ago, I would have said it was impossible that Iâ€™d  consider suicide. Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression for the last five years of my life. Attempted therapy until I could no longer afford it. I live in a third world country. 

My husband has been very patient with my mood changes and depression. He takes care of many things around the house. He has cooked food for us almost everyday since the quarantine started. My family is on the other side of the continent. My husband has a way of dealing with feeling I donâ€™t fully understand . He is quite reserved with his worries. It makes me admire him in a way, but also feel a bit more toxic when I voice my negative thoughts. I feel very guilty about the harm it will do to him and my mother. I have no sense of purpose and basically I feel like I created hell in my self, since I dislike myself in a very deep way. I also live in constant pain. How can I make this with them suffering as little as possible?
