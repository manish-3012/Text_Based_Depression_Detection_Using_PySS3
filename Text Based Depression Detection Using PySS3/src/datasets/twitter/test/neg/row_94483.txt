I almost died yesterdayI almost did it yesterday. I skipped school and went into the woods with some alcohol and a rope and I planned to end my life. I tied the noose and I jumped from a tree. Miraculously my neck didnâ€™t break and and a homeless man came out of nowhere and cut me down. In that second that I was hanging from the tree all I could think about was how much of a mistake it was. I spent the rest of that day talking with the homeless man and learning about his experiences and I realized that life has its ups and downs but thatâ€™s what life is, you gotta live through the pain because itâ€™s all experiences, not good or bad experiences, just experiences. Thank you, Mike, if you are reading this.
