im a freak of naturemaybe im unloveable because i couldn't just be born a normal person. maybe im unloveable because, right from the start, i was born a complete freak. maybe im unloveable because i couldn't just pick a side, i had to be more feminine. maybe im unloveable because i decided to go with none, then decided i might like presenting masculine. maybe im unloveable because i have all these thoughts in my head that i just can't fucking get rid of. maybe im unloveable, period. maybe i'd be loved if i had the courage to finally tie the rope i bought to the rafters. maybe then it would be okay. maybe then i wouldn't feel this way anymore.
