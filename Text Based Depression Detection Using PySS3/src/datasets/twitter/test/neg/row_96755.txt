I just can't find the point in it anymoreThrowaway account for obvious reasons. I just don't see the point in anything anymore. I fail to find any purpose at all in the world. I just want to give up. I don't want to sound whiney but I want a reason to live. I'm invisible to everyone, people treat me like shit most of the time. I'm tired of being completely alone. I feel so isolate from the rest of the world. What should I do when I know nobody really cares?
