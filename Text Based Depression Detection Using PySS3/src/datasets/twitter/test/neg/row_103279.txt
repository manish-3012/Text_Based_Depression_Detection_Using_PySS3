Will someone please be my friend? A long term friend? F/20If any one you would like to be my friend, someone to talk to and possibly lend an ear. I'd be more than grateful. 

Ever since I left my first year of university, I haven't kept in contact with any of my friends and I really regret it. I had tried to reunite with them but I haven't recieved the best responses when I let them know I am suicidal.

I have a history of abandonment issues, two suicide attempts and have been a victim of sexual malpractice. Currently I'm a returning University student studying General courses. I spent two years after high school and lived as a NEET. I would have severe panic attacks and refuse to see my psychologists or take medication. 

Right now I am seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist for depression, anxiety and paranoia. There isn't much I can offer anyone, I'm really in the position to receive any sort of kindness with someone. It's really hard for me to reach out even towards the online community. I'm sorry if I haven't been specific with my issues, it's takes a bit for me to trust someone and share what's wrong. 

Oh god, I hope I'm not sounding desperate or a total loser or just wasting up space on this thread.
