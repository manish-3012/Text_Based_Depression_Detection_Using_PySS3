It SucksHonestly, I've have very little family (all distant), no friends after moving for work, and a significant other that would do better with someone more pure than me (wayyy different experience levels and she has a rough time with it sometimes).

Actually it sounds like I have a lot I guess, but I hate having to keep up with even 1 or 2 other people. I would rather everyone in my life die, or for me to go, whichever is easiest. I don't want to be responsible to anyone because I want to make bad decisions. I want to hurt the people that interact with me. I want to cheat on my gf. I want to drive my car into oncoming traffic so that it becomes a national news story. I want to steal money. I want to fucking blow up the world. 

That said, I've done none of these things. But my goodness, thinking about them and saying them aloud makes me feel amazing. I want pain on everyone around me. Or I want to die.
