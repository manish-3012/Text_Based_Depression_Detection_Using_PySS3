I don't even have the energy to kill myself.Ive barely left my room in five days. Can't answer calls from anyone. Boss, mother, friends. I've spoken to my partner a few times but her holiday in Europe allows me to keep it farely brief. I'm absolutely worn down from the cycle of building a foundation over the course of a year, only to completely tear it down and have to rebuild over and over and over. I swear I've gotten on track and then lost it all about 7 times now and I'm only 22. I'm not even that sad anymore, intense depression lasts less time than it used to, and I usually wake up feeling relatively level (neutered and lethargic). I'm just paralysed. And tired. I'm staring at another year of toil with a sense of resignment to my inevitable failure and I simply cannot bare the thought of it. 

I want to drive to Cape Reinga with some nice single malt, down the bottle and throw myself off, or hang myself from one of the Pohutukawa, I've finally got my notes done, tearfully with the aid of some strong alcohol. I don't want to kill myself, I still enjoy things and it would absolutely destroy about four or five people for a very very long time, but I cannot muster the strength to do what I need to do. I'm tired of being lost in the woods. I don't want to die, yet I need to break the cycle, and erasing it is the only way I can see it happening.  
But I don't even have the energy, I got 70% of my plans done today before I coiled up and fell asleep. 

There's a thin wall of self-preservation that I need to break in order to end it, but I don't have the strength to swing the hammer, and if I had I suppose it would be better used trying again. 

I don't want to try again. I wish my mind would let me kill myself.
