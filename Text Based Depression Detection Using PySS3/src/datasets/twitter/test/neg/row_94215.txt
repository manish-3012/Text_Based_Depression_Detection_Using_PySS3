Maybe tonight.I think I might do it tonight. I don't have anybody left and the pain is too much. I miss my friends and family so fucking much. I want them back but they'll never want me back. I can't do this anymore. I tried to just accept that I'll never be happy but I can't. I have to die. Nobody will ever want me. And yeah I could always try to meet more people and make new friends and family but everyone will leave me. Nobody will ever stay with me forever. Everyone leaves no matter what I do. So I guess if people will always leave me, maybe I should just leave this life.
