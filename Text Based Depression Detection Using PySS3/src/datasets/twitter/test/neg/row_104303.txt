I will probably do it in the next 2-3 years, chronic pain screws with me everydayHello, I am a 24 year old. I have kypho-scoliosis, cervical neuralgia and lower back problems. I don't see things improving in the future, even if any treatment comes, it will first need to be approved and only people who have money will be the first to get it. Today more than 40% of people who had a spinal fusion have worse pain and need more surgery later, this was from a recent research. So that would probably be another 20-30 years away.

I just won't let that happen, for me to suffer while even doing nothing. Some people try to find meaning or live for others, neither of those seems like a viable reason for me to live with this, I am not religious, not an atheist, but also don't belive in the classical God.

Peace to you all.
