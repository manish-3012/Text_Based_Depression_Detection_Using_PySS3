just not feeling life to much anymoreI am in my late teens and not really feeling like I care or want to live anymore. I have a okay family life and school is fucking stupid. I have "friends" but none that actually try and hang out. The only ones I actually like are over Xbox and even when I'm happily playing with them I still feel like a burden. I've attempted before and contemplated for quite a while now but just don't have the means to do it. I know it's selfish to my family if I go through with it but I don't really care, actually I care a little but it's mostly about how'd they'd find me which is why I haven't done it yet. I could obviously just head to the kitchen and bam but I'd rather not have them find me like that. I think I might leave a note and just leave and try and contact someone with a gun. honestly just on here because no one talks to me and I could really use someone to speak to about this...
