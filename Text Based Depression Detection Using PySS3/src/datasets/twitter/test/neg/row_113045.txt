I don't want to wake upI just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I hate myself and my life. I'm married to a man (11 years) that's gone 6 months out of the year, living his dream job. I'm at home taking care of everything and keeping the household running. I hate my life, I'm so lonely. I don't know what to do and I don't have the money/job to leave. Tonight, I cheated on my husband, making me hate myself even more. I just don't have the strength or willpower to go on. My son has always been my strength to go on. Now I don't know if that's [enough.](https://enough.Now) How do you keep going when you don't have the strength determination?
