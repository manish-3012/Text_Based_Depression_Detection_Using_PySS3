I'm so depressed, I want to end my life. I have suicidal thoughts that I can't get off it.My life is being un fair with me, i only talk to people online and I thought they care about me but they left me and they even are ignoring me now. I don't know why people are jerks, I always reply to them. I'm tired of being nice and kind. I feel like my life has no meaning anymore, I wish I had someone who could comfort me. I can't even eat, I cried yesterday in the bathroom. I'm not really feeling good, I wish one person cared and ask if I'm okay or don't get bored of me when i vent. I want to die, I don't care anyone, I want to talk and take things off chest but I don't have anyone who cares to listen.
