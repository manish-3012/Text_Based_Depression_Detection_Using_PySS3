My life is not inherently valuable. Stop pretending it is.What are we anyway? Just a bunch of somewhat advanced, hairless apes living on an unremarkable planet that orbits an unremarkable star. Nature churns out idiot after idiot to reproduce, serve the system and then die, forgotten. I am firmly of the conviction that we are born by chance, prolong our lives out of fear of the alternative and die for no reason at all. There is nothing after. Just the eternal void after we return to our natural state of nonexistence. 

We all just dance around for 80ish years, fucking, and numbing ourselves from daily life with distractions.

If I pulled the trigger right now and ended my life, nothing profound would happen. So letâ€™s stop pretending Iâ€™m not an insignificant speck that lives on an insignificant speck.
