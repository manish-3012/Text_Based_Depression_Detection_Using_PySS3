Not at risk of ending it but at the same time I just don't feel like living. My life is a mess.Lately I've had suicide thoughts. A lot. I've cried multiple times a day every day and just don't know what to do. I'm 15. I'll split my problems into different parts as that's the easiest for me.

Sexuality: I'm horribly confused about my sexuality. Some days I get turned on by women, some days by furry hentai, some days normal hentai and some days even animals. I think that part plays a big part of this bad time I'm having.  My parents always tell me that they will be happy when they become grandparents but how can I do that if I want to have sex with animals? I know this could just be puberty playing with my sexuality but the thought that it isn't and this is how it is meant to be is scary. Although people who are into bestiality (Animal sex) are strictly into that and not also women, which I am. That thought puts this problem at peace sometimes.

Where's dad?: My dad never sees me. Him and my mom broke up when I was 2 and when I turned 12 he got a daughter with his new girlfriend. We used to have so much fun together. Playing football, watching movies, playing games. Just being together and having a normal father son relationship almost daily. Now I see him once every 2 months. It hurts. It's almost as if the daughter is everything to him and I have just been let in the bin.

School: School grades are tough too. School in general is. I don't feel motivated to do anything since all I think about daily is if I'm into animals or when I will see my dad again. The last assignment I did was in february. My teacher is very helpful and will sometime let me just completely off because she knows I'm having a bad bad time. I originally wanted to become something great that required good school grades but now I just don't want to become anything.

Friends: I have maybe 1 or 2 friends. I used to have more but that just sort of changed out of the blue.  I'm still in the group chat where they type regularly but I'm never mentioned. They're just mean to me if I type anything.

Brother: My brother is a little more complicated situation. He has no friends, just like me, and worst of all is addicted to drugs. He smokes weed on a daily basis and has thought of going into meth instead. He and I don't share the same interests. Although we both game, he plays completely different stuff from me and is so different so it's hard to talk to him about anything.

I've tried reaching out to the lifeline known in all of Denmark (where I live) and they just gave me a short letter with no actual structure to it. I don't know what to do.

My life is Just a mess now. Playing mmos all day looking like a corpse. I wish I could just be permanent heterosexual from now on, that my dad and mom were together and my step sister never came to be, that I would be a top grade student, that I had friends, that my brother was healthy. But I've realised that life isn't that way.

Thanks for reading.
