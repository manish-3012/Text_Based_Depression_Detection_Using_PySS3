Told my psychologist â€œthe meaning of life was to dieâ€... she didnâ€™t know how to respond...My psychologist and me started talking about my suicidal thoughts and stuff at my appointment on Wednesday. Told her I really donâ€™t see a reason why I should live, the meaning of life is to die, we all die at some point. We grow up, go to school, graduate, find a job and then just work 5 times a week for the rest of our lives until we grow old, when we are old we are finally â€œfreeâ€ but donâ€™t have the energy to do anything, and then we die. There is really no point in living, Iâ€™m going to die some day, it doesnâ€™t matter if its tonight or later. After I told her all of this stuff and more she was just baffled, and she really didnâ€™t know what to say. I donâ€™t know if I just made her realize that what I said is the truth but I just like to think that thatâ€™s what happened
