It's a double standardThey're allowed to

...move away.

...switch friends.

...get married.

...be too busy.

...stop calling.

...exclude.

...forget.

...leave.

...dump.


Suicide is like

...moving away.

...switching friends.

...getting married.

...being too busy.

...stopping calling.

...excluding.

...forgetting.

...leaving.

...dumping.


Same results, but the bottom one is selfish and wrong, even if they leave first.
