Help with saying goodbyeIve made my decision already. Ive attempted it plenty of times. I want to say bye to one specific person without putting any pressure on her.  She knows about my tendencies and wont speak to me while im like this but ive already tried to kill myself plenty of times. In fact i dont know how im even alive at the moment, i shouldve been gone days ago. She no longer considers her self a friend of mine. All she tells me is "goodluck", "try hader", and "you dont deserve how im treating you". I still consider her a very important person in my life. Ive found a way to secretly say bye to my friends but her, i dont know how to come about. People who have lost special people to this sickness that has a hold of me, how did they say bye ?
