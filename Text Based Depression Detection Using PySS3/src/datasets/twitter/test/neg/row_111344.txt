DoubtI have this doubt since I first though about committing suicide. When I think about it and when I start making suicide notes or when I simply live all my life thinking about kill myself and even pointing a knife to my abdomen... All these things make me a suicide survivor? Or am I just a coward person making fan of someone out there who actually has killed himself?
