Trapped in existenceDoes anyone else feel trapped in existence, completely alone, afraid and directionless. I've talked to some people about it (not professionals) and mostly it seems like they dont want to deal with it, and I dont blame them. 

Suicide might be a possible exit, but my religious upbringing and cowardice have prevented me from leaving. I read a book recently that said you can postpone suffering, but you can't avoid it forever. So then I wonder is death the end of suffering or would i be punished afterwards for being a coward and choosing death. Anyway, it seems like a real possibility to me. Better the life and suffering you know and have endured so far than to try to escape and end up somewhere worse.

Thoughts?
