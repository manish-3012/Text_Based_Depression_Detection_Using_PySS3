Feel like im just living for other peopleI'm sick of everything right now, I'm financially screwed, can't get any more hours at work, keep failing to get a new job and I feel like no one cares. Everyone in my life keeps telling me to get more hours like I can just wave a wand, I don't even want to work more hours, I'd rather just kill myself but then I think of how upset my mum would be who is already going through her own life crisis. I'm sick of being here and I want to go, people keep saying "might be better than nothing" but right now I feel like nothing would be better than everything
