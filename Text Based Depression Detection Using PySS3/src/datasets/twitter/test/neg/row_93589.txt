I really can't do this for another 40-50yrs...I have everything going for me but I don't want any of it. I'm tired of living, so tired....I just want to rest and never wake up. The thought of living till I'm 70 causes knots in my stomach. I can't do it, I'm struggling to barely stay alive right now.
