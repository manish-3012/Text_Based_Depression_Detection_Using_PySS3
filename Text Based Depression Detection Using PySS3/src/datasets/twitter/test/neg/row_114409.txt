back here againall of the emotional stability in my life is always going to be temporary. the episodes i have are less like a roller coaster and more like a boomerang that comes back to knock you over the head. it was only inevitable that i'd post here again. and before anyone says anything like the last time i was here, i can't "yoga-away" my manic depression. pills and therapy have helped in many areas of my life, sure, and i'm lucky to have access to them, but they're not cure-alls. there's a reason that periods of stability are called "remission." not only that, but they can't change who i am as a person. and that person is useless and disgusting.

99% of the time, what "changes my mind" is my base human instinct to avoid pain. nothing remotely like, "i have people who love me and something to live for." i survived an attempt that wasn't well thought-out and the experience was immensely painful. it's a shame that all of the "painless" methods with higher success rates are so convoluted and expensive. i just want to quietly walk out the door and leave, so to speak. 

i looked at the suicide bereavement subreddit (because people tell you, "but everyone will be sad!1!!!1! ):") and felt absolutely nothing. emotionally numb. one of the posts even confirmed my belief that no one gives a shit until you're really gone. i barely have anyone in my life, but in the grand scheme of most of their lives, i'm insignificant. the exceptions are my parents. they refuse to see it, but i am a parasite to them. just graduating now, still living with them, unemployed, with about 120k in student loan debt with exorbitant interest rates. the only thing i have is a failing music "career" that no one gives a shit about despite the fact that it defines who i am and was the only thing i found solace in. admittedly, the reason i haven't found stable work yet, aside from covid, is not because of laziness, but debilitating social phobia. also, working or attending classes with a severe mood disorder, no matter how "high functioning" you are, is hell.

the other day, someone very close to me whom i've had feelings for just told me that they're starting a long-distance relationship with someone and was so excited that this other person "felt the same way." i had to lie through my teeth about how happy i am for them. and lie through my teeth so that they don't realize how jealous i am of how their career in the arts is taking off, compared to mine, which is a complete and utter joke, no matter how much effort i put into what i create. i try to shield them from my true feelings, but it doesn't change the fact that i am toxic and they are better off without me. they already have a big social life. i'll be easy to replace.

no one has ever "felt the same" about me. i've never even been on a casual date, never kissed, etc. this wasn't even the first time i had to lie to someone about how "happy i am" about their new relationship. i'm tired of the platitudes about soul mates who are supposedly out there waiting for you and thinking the same things. i've tried this and i've tried that. the truth is, some people are too disgusting and undesirable to ever find any kind of companionship. some people are just meant to die alone.

i'm already in my mid-20s. it's so pathetic. people on here will try to say otherwise, that it's never too late and that i'm "not *that* old," but let's face it, i am turning into one of those incel/ NEET types. no one likes those people. good fucking riddance.

**tl;dr:** you can't start over. you can change your habits and lifestyle on a superficial level, but you can't change who you are deep down inside. so if you hate everything about yourself, no matter how hard you've tried not to, and you're a toxic drain on others' lives, what else is there to do but erase yourself for good?
