5 June 2018: Not really doing muchI brought my dog out for a walk. I cherished every moment I have with my dog. When it is still alive, I want to be good to it, so that when it die, I will not be so upset, guilty and have regrets for not being good to my dog when it is still alive.

I exercised at home by doing push-ups. Since I am overweight, it is not easy for me to do the push-ups. It felt like I was bench pressing a barbell with 17.5 kg on either side. I then went out for a walk. I did not jog because I felt tired after doing the push-ups.
