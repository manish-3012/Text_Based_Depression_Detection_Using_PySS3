Long term planningLately Iâ€™ve thought about how some couples stay married until the kids are out of the home for various reasons. Iâ€™d like out of this life once my kids are older. 
I have PTSD and I am a damn good actor. My therapist/wife /etc know about the PTSD but Iâ€™ve yet to feel like I had someone who could I could talk to. My therapist was talking last week about how far Iâ€™ve come as I was thinking how easily she is deceived. Fake it till you make it I guess.
I love my wife, but it is pretty obvious that she is a free spirit who canâ€™t be bothered with any pains beyond her own. Sheâ€™s actually an amazing artist and art teacher... but also immensely selfish. I used to think someone would love me more than anything. Somehow Iâ€™m a solidly low priority to my SO.
Itâ€™s been so lonely. But I think if I can make it till my kids are out of the house I can be done with this whole living thing. My kids need me, my wife is so aloof and flighty and whatever. But if I can get them to 18 maybe I can be done. 
Iâ€™m sorry. 
I needed to say this out loud for some reason.
