It's been a while since I posted here. I thought I was getting better but no, it hasn't. Life is still as shit as it was and always will be.Last post was a bit of catharsis for me, I got a lot of pent up feelings out of me and I felt slightly positive for a little bit after, so hopefully this one has the same effect.

I'm lost. I'm in pain. I've literally been laid down with sickness after sickness for the past 3 weeks now and it's really starting to bring down my energy and positive attitude, not like there was much to begin with anyways but whatever.

On top of that 2 weeks ago my girlfriend's parents found out about the relationship, and she got solidly grounded. Technically we should be broken up but fuck that, we're still together. But that's not even the point. I haven't been able to talk to her for over 4 days now (she doesn't have her phone on her cause punishment) and it's driving me insane. I need her so badly and I know it's not her fault but I can't help but feel a bit of misplaced resentment. I'd give anything to say a single word to her but I can't reach her at all.

But I've got a new emotion bubbling up inside me- jealousy. Most of all I'm jealous of my two friends who are in the most solid relationship ever. They're so happy with each other and they get to spend time with each other and text each other stupid stuff and they're everything I wanted to be, and I used to be so happy for them because I knew they needed it but now everytime they talk about each other I'm just reminded of what a hopeless situation my own relationship has devolved into and I'm reminded of the fact that I should be this happy but I'm not.

I also feel so guilty knowing that they care so much about me and I give nothing back to them. I could literally ruin their good mood just by showing up with a sad face and now I'm so guilty about showing how I really feel because I don't want to be the thing that brings people down when they're supposed to be happy. 

On top of that I've got exam stress setting in and I should be studying but I'm too physically and mentally sick to properly prepare and now I've only got 13 days to go I'm so fucked it's not even funny.

I'm really starting to spiral back down into suicidal thoughts. I have a plan, I have easy access to the materials I need to execute my plan and if I sink any lower so help me I'll fucking do it. It's like I was never meant to feel happiness, that some higher power cursed me to live like Job but without the reward at the end. I don't feel worthy of feeling happiness and love anymore, I just want to escape and start over because I cannot fucking handle all these poisonous thoughts and feelings in my head
