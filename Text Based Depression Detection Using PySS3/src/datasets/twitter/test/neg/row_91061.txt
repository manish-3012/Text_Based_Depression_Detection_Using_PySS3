Need help finding treatment options.I've been dealing with suicidal ideation for many years now, off and on a few times a month. Recently, I've been thinking about suicide almost daily, and I don't want to act on those feelings. 

Some background:

I am 23 years old, live in california at home with my parents, and I currently attend city college. Parents think mental illness (including depression, anxiety) isn't real, so they don't know (nor do I ever want them finding out). I've hidden my feelings from them since I first started feeling suicidal at 15 years old. The only thing I've ever been formally diagnosed with is Asperger's Syndrome by a school psychologist when I was in grade school. Parents fought this, but eventually put me in special education. For years, I was told there was nothing wrong with me, and that the school system was just shitty. I believed it for a while to and pushed to get myself out of it by high school. I did well for a year, then started failing all my classes. Somehow finished high school and sat alone in my room for 3 years, occasionally going to job interviews and failing to get the job. I got completely stuck and gave up hope of ever getting a job, so I started to go to college. I'm still biding my time, waiting for things to get better.

So that's where I'm at now. I want to kill myself, I live in a household feeling like a gigantic shitty financial sponge on my parents, promising them that the years of community college will be worth it. I haven't left the house for any reason (other than to get to and from school) in months. The physical drain of what I'm experiencing is killing any desire for self improvement, and my social anxiety finishes off whatever hopes I have beyond that. I'm hoping that I can just talk to some psychologist, take some pills, and get back on the right track; something. What do I do?
