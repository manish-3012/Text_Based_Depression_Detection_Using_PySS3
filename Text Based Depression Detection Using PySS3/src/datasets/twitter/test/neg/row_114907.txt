StrugglingI posted something to a private account of mine and somehow my classmates found out. They kept trying to access the account and started messaging me anonymously when I wouldnâ€™t let them. I confronted a large group of them about it and they got very angry. I posted the message publicly to state my answer and they all got very mad and cussed me out and one of them told me to kill myself. Itâ€™s almost selfish that that one little thing has affected me so much in just a few minutes. Iâ€™m laying in bed sobbing trying to fight the terrifyingly overwhelming urge to fall back into my spiral of self harm. Iâ€™m almost 2 years clean. I donâ€™t want to do it but at the same time I really do. Thereâ€™s something in the back of my mind telling me I should kill myself, that theyâ€™re right. Itâ€™s terrifying. Itâ€™s been so long since I felt this way.
