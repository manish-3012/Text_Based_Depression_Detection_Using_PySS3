when is it too much?recently Iâ€™ve been struggling with the idea of hospitalization. I donâ€™t want to kill myself. I donâ€™t want to die. But I also feel so sense of worth or purpose. I have no reason to live. The hospital terrifies me. I donâ€™t want to be put in the psych ward for too long or be drugged up out of my mind but I want to stop feeling this way. When do I know I should go to the hospital? How many hours a day need to be taken over by thinking about suicide for it to be necessary for me to be hospitalized?
