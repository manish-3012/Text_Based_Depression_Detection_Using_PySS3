Unable to feel love, can't get a job, snap at all who do still care about me ... SO WHY NOT END IT? (lol)So fun fact - I'm chronically lonely yet whenever ANYONE expresses interest in me I clamp up and push them away before we get intimate! I just can't sleep with someone unless I genuinely care about them (or even love them if that exists!) and i'm SICK of it. Why is someone so emotionally stunted also so longing for a deep connection. 

The pandemic cut my college going times short, graduation not happening, and I lost out on the job I was getting and now can't get one cause my industry shrunk 98%! I'm stuck at home with the mom who abused me as a kid! And I keep lashing out at the few friends/family who still care about me. Why not just kill myself and get it all done with - is it even worth living if I have to go to bed alone every night and genuinely don't enjoy life. Like I get ppl are meant to have bad days, but goddamnit can I get one fucking good day a year that's all I want is one.
