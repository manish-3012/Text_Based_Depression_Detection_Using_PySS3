I'm OK now...I have deleted my last post.

Nothing more to see here folks. 

Have loose ends to tie up and some things to finalize...

I will be busy...so  busy.


Can y'all do me one last favor?

If I don't come back here by later on tonight, please shout out me? I KNOW that sounds so contradictory...just...got some stuff to do and thinking to do.

I know that sounds so needy...but I just...need someone to have my back.

No one here seems to want to do that for me. Gotta stand on my fucking own here at home as usual.

Thanks all...go on with your lives now and help the people here who are hurting, OK? Y'all are wonderful people and the OPs here can really benefit from your kindness.
