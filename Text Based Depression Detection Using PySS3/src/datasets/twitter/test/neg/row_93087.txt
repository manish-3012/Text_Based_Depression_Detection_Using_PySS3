The universe hates me.Basically title. The universe hates me because whenever I even get a TINY chance at happiness, something bad happens and I fall all the way back to square one again. People screw me over all the time by making plans with me and then being like "oh sorry I decided to do this instead". I can't really blame them though, I'm the one who made me this way and I'm unable to change apparently.

It's like I'm stuck on level 1 of a video game and I can't advance no matter what. I'm going to buy a shotgun and put an end to this never ending misery. It's not like anyone is going to miss me anyway, I'm just a burden so people will be glad that I'm gone. That's all, bye.
