Intrusive suicidal thoughtsI have ADHD, I cannot focus on anything, I think about suicide every day. Me giving my maximum is not as good as others' maximums. I have sought help. I've gotten help from a psychologist and been prescribed drugs. Now methylphenidate has too many side effects, I cannot continue my life without taking it, I cannot continue my life without it. I'm tired of seeking help, I feel like I am a cancer patient who is sick of chemo and just wants to die in peace.

I want to commit suicide but do not want to disappoint my friends and family doing so. Life is too tiring for me, I have been fighting for so many years and I am back in the same place. Nothing is the same anymore. I want to kill myself.

There is no need to reply to this post, as I am not looking for any specific help, I know this is all over the place, I just needed to type this out.
