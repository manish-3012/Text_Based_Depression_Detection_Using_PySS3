What if your life is great, just you yourself suck?So many people have reasons to be depressed, bad lifes, loss of loved ones, any thing. For me, my life is great. Like really good, I have every opportunity available, i got friends, family, all that shit. The only problem in my life am I. I'm a continuous fuck-up, every decision i make is wrong, wherever it is possible I make the worst mistakes. Every morning i wake up and hate myself for being how I am, how i look, how I think, what i did or didnt do. Every evening i pray that my life is given to someone else, someone deserving who can do stuff with it.

But since that wont happen, I'll do the next best thing; I'll just take myself out of my life. I dont even know why I post here, maybe some kind of goodbye to Reddit since it was a steady companion for a while. I know how I'll do it, just hope it doesnt hurt or that I vomit all the pills back up.
