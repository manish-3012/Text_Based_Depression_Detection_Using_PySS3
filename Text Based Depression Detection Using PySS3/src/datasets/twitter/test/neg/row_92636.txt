Congested and Done[GOING TO DELETE SOON ANYWAYS

This is all just writen as soon as it comes to my head as I'm so congested in my head that I can't think correctly. So it's going to be a mess and the format is going to be crap.]


I'm starting to feel the end is coming as it's been waiting on the side slowly showing itself every now and then...

I'm getting more angry at everything in life, along with just frustrated to why things are certain ways. I have resorted to cutting everyone out of my life including my entire family and friends (haven't had those since 4th grade, now 20) the only person I talk to is my girlfriend and that's about it. I just can't take other people at all, when my GF plays with her friends or talks to other people I just start to feel anger, pain, forgot, not cared about. I feel like I'm just falling in the background like I always have been my enter life. I don't like being connected to other people and it bothers me when she is connected to other people cause it feels like I am in a way... I'm not sure why I feel this way and I know there's many underline past problems that has happened to me to be this way but idk.



The only thing I ever really do care about in life is my GF and I always want to do everything with her, be with her 24/7. She makes me feel like I have a purpose in life. She takes away my depression and anger, which is why I don't think she understands how I much I really need her 24/7, because once she leaves then I start getting more dark and numb with wanting to actually kill myself... I don't trust myself without her... She makes feel like I have a goal to achieve that being getting to live with each other but lately she's expressed that she's too young and the relationship is too young also. Which really hurt me because that made me feel like I had purpose for that being working for us to be together but now that's kinda crushed and I now feel I don't have a purpose nor that I have a goal to work towards to. Right now I feel like she's more fixated on her friends rather then us. I know I'm not perfect nor easy to be with and I know it's not fair to her that I am the way that I am with constantly needing her and her attention just to make sure my dark side stays away... I know she wants to be with her friends sometimes and stuff but idk I'm really trying my best to change my mind... It's not easy to rewire you're brain when you mentally can't even fucking think correctly or even the fact I need her that badly. I just think she would be happier with someone that is more normal.  


I don't know how to change or be normal...


I know I'm strange in a way that literally I just want to focus on just one person for my entire life, 24/7 but idk how to change that as that's something I personally like but others don't. 

But I'm so frustrated and constantly filled with thoughts back and forth in my head that it affects my thought process, ability to think, achieve normal things in life or see clearly. I literally can't process things in my head, I feel so retarded at times because I can't correctly think at all. Constant fighting in my head with everything that happens to me and it just stays with me forever. I'm really starting to see the end of my life, I can't take upsetting the one person I actually care about and only limiting her in life... I just feel like a fucking dictator and I want to limit her or tell her no and it hurts me Everytime. I just wish she didn't want to do those things that upset me because there's no winning for me, either say and feel like a asshole for denying her what she wants to do or let her and feel upset because I miss her and need her. 

I don't know what to do anymore and I really just can't take much more of it. I've given up along time ago... My GF has been keeping held up by one hand but I think it's better if I just let go and die because life is better without me along with the people that don't have to deal with me.

With everything that I've said mainly about my GF because she's my everything, my only source of Hope and happinesses, I don't ever want to leave her nor lose her at all because if I did then I would instantly end up killing myself for sure without a second thought. 


There's so much more that needed to be written down but I can't sit here all night and touch on everything I'm feeling.

I just wish I could be something better.
