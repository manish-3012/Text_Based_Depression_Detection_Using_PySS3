I donâ€™t have any reasons to liveI posted on here a while ago so this is kind of an update. Things have only gotten worse. I had a few things to look forward to every day to keep moving forward and to find the positive in things, but those are mostly gone and every day it gets even worse. I canâ€™t even go an hour without having some sort of suicidal thoughts.
