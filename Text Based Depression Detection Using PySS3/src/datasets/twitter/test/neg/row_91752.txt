Does anyone have any advice for feeling inadequateI have a few disorders which can limit what I do. One of them makes me physically really weak and there aren't any very effective treatments for it. The other ones are neurological and don't have any therapies for people who have them the way I have them, I've been told by top experts there's basically nothing they can do, and I've actually ended up clinically traumatised from some therapies that went very wrong.

I can do basic stuff like walking, well I can do most stuff that most people can do, but my body is so weak and my brain gets exhausted  so easily  I can't do too much of it regularly and consistently. That fact that I can sometimes do stuff makes it harder in a way because people treat me like a liar and don't want to help when I say I can't do something on a given day just because they saw me do it before. 

I just see other people my age (22) including my family members managing to do so much. They're finishing university and getting good jobs  here I am struggling feeling like I'm falling apart from not doing much. A good chunk of my energy goes into running my small business but that will never earn me enough to live on because I don't have the energy needed to really succeed at something like that, and I don't know if I could really cope with a regular job because of how much fatigue I get, I'd have to take so many sick days to the point where I'd probably get fired and if I didn't, the dizziness, joints giving out, brain fog would really impair  the quality of my work to the point where I think I'd get get fired anyways. It's not like I can even try having a normal job because then I lose the help from the system I get which I need (I would lose the small amount of therapy I get for my physical issues, and would lose the payments I get which I would be unlikely to be able to get again (wouldn't be able to afford to live without). On top of that I could lose my public transport discounts and other discounts I rely on). The rest of my energy goes on trying to keep things as clean as I can and cooking meals. 

I feel like I'm falling apart. I used to be able to focus on how much I've improved since the days where I was near bedridden (when my physical disorder was untreated and I had some other temporary conditions which are mostly cured now), and I felt so good and like I had accomplished so much, now I'm really noticing how little I can do compared to an average human now that I'm trying to do all the stuff that a normal human does.  

I'm just never gonna realistically gonna be at the point where I can cope like other people can cope with day to day life, I doubt I'm ever gonna be at the point where I can be fully independent. I don't want to have a life where I'm just struggling the whole time and not even be able to afford a place to live, or if I do earn enough for a place not having any strength for keeping it properly clean, to cook meals, having the energy do anything fun or meaningful with my life. If I put all my energy into earning a place my place would become a mess and I just wouldn't eat much other than snack food because  essentially my body physically collapses from exhaustion  too easily 

My inadequacies  started becoming something I couldn't ignore where I started staying at my boyfriends most of the time. I was trying to do my bit to keep the place clean (it's small place so there isn't much cleaning to do compared to most places) but even just trying to do half is feeling like it's killing me on top of travelling there most days and trying to earn some money. If I can't handle a regular commute, a relatively  small amount of housework and a job which I'm spending less and less time on because of exhaustion am I really worth much to society, especially if I can't contribute much to his household expenses because the small amount of money I earn goes mostly goes on just the train travel to get there (I spend equivalent to 1/10th of the rent on the travel) and basics like toiletries, some food etc.  

The only times I've felt good are when I'm not doing near the min amount an adult human should be doing and basically just living in bed a good chunk of the time, but that's no life nor even necessarily an option for the long term, because I'm not as severely disabled as I used to be and could easily lose the money I get from the state  (whether or not they give  assistance people with invisible illness like mine is basically a lottery)
