So I've been anxious for eight months now. Every night I'm up till 4am. I wake up two to three times because of my nightmares. I suffer from states of fear. I tried to talk to my parents, they don't take me serious. I can't talk to my male friends, I just can't. I talked to a female classmate, she's my crush. She really helped me just by listening and taking me serious. She's the reason I didn't end my life eight months ago but I'm still suicidal. I don't want to talk about the reasons that cause my feelings. The last few days I felt better for the first time since december 2019. So I really feel like I love her but I don't think she does. She's more interested in older guys what makes my condition even worse. What makes me think that she doesn't love me back are her older male friends she's around with all the time. This makes my feelings and the whole situation worse again because she made me forget about my problems everytime we talked to each other but now I'm...I don't know...I can't describe it. I just want it to end...
