I want to kill myself so badly, but I'm a cowardI'm a mess and I can't do anything good. My parents always tell me that I'm dumb and I won't pass my exams and I won't ever get into med school..but I always had high grades. Right now I'm in hospital(for 5 days) because i caught a cold and I didn't want to take my medication, just to get sicker and sicker and hopefully die because my lungs won't resist forever.
I have my exams in 4 months and all that I can do is wasting my time thinking about how to kill myself without affecting my boyfriend or my family. 
I never had friends, I was lonely since I was a kid. I have lost all my motivation, I can't feel love or empathy and I feel horrible because I have to lie to my boyfriend everyday, telling him that I love him. 
I hate when people touch me, even accidentally. 
I don't know what do to because if my parents will hear my real feelings, they won't ever believe me or they won't help me. They're not bad.. They took care of me and all but I can't see them as my beloved ones. I Really don't know what to do. 
I am sleep deprived, sad, stressed out and all that I can think of is death. I just can't do it.. I continue to prove myself that I'm a worthless coward.
