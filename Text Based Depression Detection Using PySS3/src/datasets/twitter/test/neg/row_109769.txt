What even is life if I just work and pay bill's and suffer?Highly disabled,  cerebral palsy and a spinal injury,  lots of pain, no help. Tried meds, tried therapy, tried religion, tried mind over matter. Tried so much. Work 50 hours a week. No recovery time. Barely scraping buy on bills. Now I need more because of diabetes treatment?  I can't. All I do is work and spend money and not even be able to spend time with people I love or eat things I like. I can't figure it out and I want to be dead so at least it STOPS.
