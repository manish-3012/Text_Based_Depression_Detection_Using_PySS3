I'm never going to get it right.Let's face it folks. Life's a sad joke. I would ask what I have to live for but it's just the same bullshit and lies. The truth is I've destroyed everything good in my life and I'm too weak to fix anything that can even be fixed. I made a list of my reasons to live. God and family. Then I remember god doesn't exist and though it would hurt my family in the short run they would be better off without me. I'm a failure, a fuck up and worthless by design. It's not even worth trying anymore because it's all going to be the same result. Failure
