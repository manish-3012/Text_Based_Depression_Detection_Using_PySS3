Video game addiction has taken it allTo die, to vanish. it seems so logical, it would make so much sense if I'd just disappear. I went to the therapist last week, but I could only tell him that I wanted to kill myself in the past, but not anymore. He seemed satisfied. This. It seems to be the goal of my life. I don't want to burden anyone with my being, always tell them what they want to hear.
I know I'm ruining my life for myself, I play or watch video games pretty much all day, and when I don't the reality kicks in and grief strikes even harder. 
The only thing stopping me is my family, they couldn't possibly deal with it. I don't want them to suffer, but I still want to die.
