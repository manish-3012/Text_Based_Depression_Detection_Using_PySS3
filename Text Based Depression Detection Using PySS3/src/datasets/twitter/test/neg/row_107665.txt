Hi suicide watch, I really need some help with how to approach talking to my best friend who suddenly and unexpectedly has told me that he has been diagnosed with severe depression, and has implied that he wants to commit suicide.He has always seemed like a strong character, very selfless and he is known as a guy who looks out for people who are feeling down or are being picked on during the 5 years ive known him. We're both 21 now and in our final year of separate universities, and now suddenly out of the blue he has told me about his situation. During this phone call ten minutes ago where he told me about this he said that he felt very alone, that he has taken a month out of university because of his depression, and that 'every night i lie in bed and feel like my family and friends would be happier i i weren't here'. He's a proud man and I can tell that it's a big deal exposing this side of him to me and i dont want to make him shy away by being overly sentimental or by making him feel weak, but I don't know what i'd do without him and I want, in the most tactful way, to let him know that he is loved and that people care about him. Also I think there us a female rejection involved. I'd be so grateful for any advice!
