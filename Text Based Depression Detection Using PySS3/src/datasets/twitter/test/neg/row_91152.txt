I don't know what to sayThrowaway because my cousin sometimes checks my main account.

There's nothing inherently wrong with my life. I get good grades without really trying, I have a lot of friends, I'm good at talking to girls, I have a steady job. But there's this crushing weight every fucking day that never goes away. And the fact that there's nothing wrong only makes it worse. When I hear stories about people who have gone through addiction or abuse, it almost makes me wish I had a similar experience, because then I'd have a fucking reason. But all I can do is walk around everyday, not really giving a shit about anything and just wanting to end it all. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is out of fear of hell. I just don't know what to do. When I wake up earlier than anyone else or I get home late from work and no one is up, I cut myself. Cause at least then I fucking feel. I just don't know what to do or say. There's no fucking hope, all I really strive for at this point is to fucking die one way or another. I don't know what to do. There's nothing really wrong. I just hate everything about me. I don't eat, I cut, and at least part of those things is because I want to destroy myself, for lack of a better phrase. I hardly shower unless I know I'm going out. I stay in my bed more often then ever, only going out cause I know my parents would suspect something otherwise. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to say. I don't know where to go. I'm sorry for anyone who read this far, I don't know why I'm posting this, you don't deserve to have read this. I'm sorry.
