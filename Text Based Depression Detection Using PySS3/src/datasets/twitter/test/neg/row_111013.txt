I don't feel like living anymoreI'm 15 years old and I don't feel like living anymore. I have an auto-immune disease that I got 2 years ago which has ruined multiple dreams of mine. My mom has neglected me for the past 3 weeks. Whenever I'm with friends and family that I love my happiness is faked. I've been looking for solutions to cure myself for a few years now. Whenever I try to communicate what is going on with people such as therapists I can't explain it that well. In 2008 my best friend died 2 minutes away from the moment my birthday was official and every year I get reminded of him. I can communicate better online and I guess that comes from people I would describe as a better version of my family, but things happened and we slowly split apart. It wasn't from arguments just things happening to them. 

Overall I need help
