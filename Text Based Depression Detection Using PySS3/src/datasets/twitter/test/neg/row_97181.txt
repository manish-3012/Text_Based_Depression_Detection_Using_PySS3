I think Im going to try and get it together tomorrowIve been suicidal off and on for years. I go through cycles of intense crippling depression. My life goes to shit one aspect at a time, until Im left reeling. My job, my house, my joys, my relationships with those closest all become these incredible messes. Ive been doing better about recognizing when Im spiralling, but Ive been in an absolute tailspin for about 6 weeks. And everyday has become a darker thought than the last. A more serious look at both my flaws and ways to kill myself because of them.
Tomorrow I want to do my laundry. And clean my car and try not to think about killing myself.  But its hard because all I can think is even if I manage it will it even matter. I know depression exaggerates problems in such a way that they become a thousand tonne behemoth. But then then a little voice in my head whispers ' are you sure?' I dont have to but I want tomorrow to go well because I tried because I can do it. But for right now, tonight, I really just want to shoot myself in the head and be done with it.
