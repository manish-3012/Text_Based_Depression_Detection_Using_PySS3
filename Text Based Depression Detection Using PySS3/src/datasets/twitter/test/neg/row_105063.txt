Taking prescribed medicinesI have been told by the doctor to start taking medicines in order to control the anxiety and depression. 
However, this will be a tough treatment. I know that you have to be totally focused on it for at least six months, taking it every single day. Besides that, I love drinking alcohol and I know I'll have to stop it during the treatment. But this is not the point here, I just want you to know one of the reasons that is making me feel a little scared of starting the treatment.
Has someone ever gone through a treatment like that? How is it like? Did you feel better? Is it dangerous if you stop the treatment in the middle?
