I helped a friend not kill herself this week but now I want to kill myself. I'm sick of being everyone's rock but nobody is there for me.No one has ever done this for me. I'm sick of being everyone's rock. Now I need help and of course nobody is there for me.

I just feel really alone tonight. I'm 25 and just got my dream job-- but everything else immediately fell apart.

I lashed out at my mom after a small streak of not doing so because I broke my jaw and she keeps denying that it hurts that bad (dentist says it will never heal and i'll always have a slight lisp). I feel badly that when I'm suicidal I call her and I'm honest with her about my thoughts. She has told me that this has aged her a lot and hurts her heart. I don't lie to her about how I feel, and I am punished for it with guilt.

I have no friends. They all stopped talking to me because I grew a backbone and said I didn't like it when they tried to control whether or not I do drugs with them (I don't want to).

Everyone in my family that I love is dying. I have to keep being gay a secret from most people in my family. I am all alone 4000 miles from home. I have mixed feelings about my father. 

I just want to be nice. I just want people to be nice to me. I am convinced I am a bad person because sometimes I get angry. My (other) friend said I was a bad person for having depression and then I got suicidal. 

I hate this. I just want someone to care. Tomorrow I'll wake up and be all alone again. That's just how it is for me.
