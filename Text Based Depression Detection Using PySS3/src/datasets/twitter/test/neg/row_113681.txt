Weâ€™re all dead, arenâ€™t we?Iâ€™ve been reading some stuff on r/extinctionrebellion today Iâ€™m just so fucking wrecked right now I feel like shooting myself.

So many positive-feedback loops, so many different aspects of this all coming down on us at once and increasing in speed. Iâ€™m having a panic attack just thinking about this.

My hope for humanity right now is all but shattered, but I feel like it wonâ€™t take long to completely break me.

What should I do? Should I continue my life for no particular reason? Every passing year getting worse and worse?

Is there hope? Could someone please give me ANYTHING to work with here?

Iâ€™m only 21, still a virgin and havenâ€™t been to college due to depression, should I even get an education? It seems like thereâ€™s no reason for it at the moment.

How can I live like this? What can I do besides bite the barrel of a 12 gauge?
