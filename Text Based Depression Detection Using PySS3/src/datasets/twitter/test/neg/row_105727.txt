Iâ€™ve wanted to die every single day for the past 6 months at least. Been depressed for years.I think about taking a bunch of pills or laying on the train tracks by my house or sometimes I even visualize myself bashing my head in a door repeatedly when I just wish I was dead. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore
