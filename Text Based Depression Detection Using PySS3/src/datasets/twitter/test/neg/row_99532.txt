I'm tired.I'm tired. I'm so tired. I'm tired of me, I'm tired of life, I'm tired of having to breathe. I'm tired of feeling pain, whatever that pain may be; emotional, physical, mental... I'm tired. I don't want to deal with it anymore, and I really want to give up. I have a lot of ways I could do it, some convoluted and some simple, but I haven't yet because I just... can't bring myself to hurt others. I don't care about me. But I can't bring myself to die because of them. I know they'll know; friends at school will know because of some stupid news report, and those friends will tell my other friends that aren't around my area, and next thing you know everybody's changed.

I don't want to hurt anyone by ending my life, but I don't want to live anymore.
