I don't know what to doTruthfully I never thought I would come to reddit for some form of comfort but here I am. I've been struggling with some thoughts in my head that I'm not proud of. Nothing seems to get better, and every time I try to pull myself out of those thoughts I eventually just circle back to my original thought process. It feels like my life currently, has no reason to continue or has any positive outlook. Everything in my life has been chosen for me and even though I'm trying to change that, I just keep digging a deeper hole for myself. My parents won't accept me or my interests, my dad doesn't even believe mental illness/health is a real thing. Everything I've done for the past 18 years has been for the approval and gratification of others. The result of that being: I am currently 22 years old, with no interests or hobbies that I myself chose, pursuing a career in a degree field I hate, in hopes that I can appease my family who continue to look down on me. I only keep trying so maybe I won't continue to disappoint them. What can I do? My existence right now just feels like a dissapointment. I don't even feel like I have friends, the ones I thought I had have already left or have never really been there. I'm just tired and alone. I feel like I'm trying so hard for people who really don't care about me. I hate that. I hate that It just feels like everything is so close to just falling apart. I'm going to continuing hating myself indefinitely, it really doesn't seem like there is any good reason to stay. Apart from guilt maybe. My brother cares I know that, he might be the only person who has always been there for me. Even if that's the case what am I suppose to do? I don't want to continue to burden him, he has his own life to worry about. Even if I did do it I'm sure with time they would move on right? I don't know. I panicked and came on here to vent because the thought has been popping up more often than usual. I don't know if I'm scared because it's reoccurring, or because I've played through different scenarios of it in my head almost like a trail run or a mock simulation. I don't know. I feel like I can't fully explain what I've been feeling. The super condensed version would be that I hate myself and everything that has come to be of my life, and I don't see that out look getting better anytime soon.
