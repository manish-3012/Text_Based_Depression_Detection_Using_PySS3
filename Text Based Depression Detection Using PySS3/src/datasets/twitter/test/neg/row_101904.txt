I tried tonightHi all. I've been battling depression and suicidal thoughts for the majority of my life but haven't attempted in at least 15 years. 
8 days ago my wife broke up with me. Needless to say I'm devastated and after planning for a few days, I decided to end it. 

I knew hanging would hurt but i didn't realize how chicken I'd be. I must've spent about 20 minutes lowering myself down over and over. It's been 15 minutes since I gave up trying and it's so bizarre to think i'd be gone now. it'd all be over.

I'm not sure why I'm typing this here. I want to talk to her about it but I don't want to make her unhappy. Guess I just needed to say it somewhere.
