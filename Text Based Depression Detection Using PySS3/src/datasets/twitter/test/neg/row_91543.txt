if i canâ€™t control my own life then i might as well diemy life is ruined. my parents always plan everything for me. enrolled me to a law school, never gave a fuck about my dreams. confronted them and got myself beaten up and locked in my room. i got forced to get a boyfriend, honestly feel bad because heâ€™s just been used for money. i donâ€™t want to hurt the guy, he seems like a genuinely good person. my friends seem to enjoy my suffering, and they would report everything i do to my parents for fun

is it worth it to kill myself? i want my parents to suffer and that they wonâ€™t live off me anymore. i want to live by myself, but everytime i try i find myself clinging to my parents. i feel bad. i donâ€™t feel like myself anymore
