As if life wasn't shitty enough, I think I have diabetesAs a result of my crappy lifestyle during quarantine, I think I have developed diabetes.  

I have the hallmark thirst/urge to pee that doesn't go away.  I'm drinking like 3 liters of water a day and still always thirsty.  Always hungry and somehow not gaining weight.  Blurry vision.  I bought a glucose meter and it shows my level as 275.

Despite the misery of the neverending thirst, I have no plans to see a doctor.  It's messed up but the prospect of being able to die guilt free and naturally excites me.  I really hope this kills me.
