What does suicide by hanging feel like?I've read in a lot of places that it is painless, many hallucinate, hear music, see themselves dancing, etc. But many others say it is very, very painful, one of the worst ways to commit suicide. I'm just curious as to what you guys think, I'm looking for people who have tried, not just people making guesses.. Thanks (:
