LookingThe best of us
That needed trust
In both of us
The best of us
That needed love 
For both of us
The last of us
In both of us
The best of us
That never used
Abused
Rused
Or lies to 
In both of us
The best of us
In these last times
That seemed fine 
In our minds
The last time
In both of us
The best of us
That use love for goosebumps
Good humps and wiggles
Friends that whistle
To missions
Of these 
In both of us
The best of us
When is the next time 
I'll see you
The Both of us
That gain trust
She and He 
All the love 
In both of us
The best of us
Soon to see
The last of eternity
And hurried me to burry me sooner
Too selfish 
Too brutal
Finish him 
In both of us
The best of us
Where are you
My geek that swoons
And dives
To the ride of my life 
Ride of my life
This girl 
Right here..
This love
In both of us
The best of us
Tears
More tears
To heavy
Floods
To ready
Fires
Not deadly..
Spit venom.. 
in both of us
The best of us 
Left scars on every one
Every son and daughter
One another
Till moon beam and sun rays
Are pleasant 
And the essence
Of our faces erases
These wack thoughts 
Of a black thot
Two thoughts not enough to settle
And two minds
That muttle in the middle 
Of intelligence
I've never laughed harder in my life
This my wife
Even if she's not my wife
I just got one life 
To live with kids 
And within
Finds friends that were never lost 
And the the cost is less heavy
Cause these deadly remedies
Steady me to end me
Well less of this same cat
I love that 
Over and over 
Older and older
Till covers resemble dirt
And the earth has the birth
To fill the worth of these sky 
Where I pray
So I can say that these days just rage with or without
The doubt of us 
Every being broke
I spoke with the smoke
For jokes that seemed ready 
Deadly
Well we finish them
In both of us 
The best of us
