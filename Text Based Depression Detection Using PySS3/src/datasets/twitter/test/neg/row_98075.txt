I feel like no one understands me?I developed OCD which is an anxiety disorder. Or i got it from my mom i mean. I just mean i developed it cuz of my family not being very social. I feel like its gotten so bad over the years, i just feel so awkward if i brought a gf home to meet my parents or something like that.    
 

I hope you guys know what i mean, basically anxiety is and has been ruining my life since i was born basically. But it got worse in the 8th grade to now 11th grade. Im tired of feeling anxious or awkward or thinking about anxious events that i want to experience and enjoy in this lifetime, and i feel like my family doesn't understand what i mean. So yeah im just tired of it. I dont even want to live with my family anymore (im 17 and male) i feel i have nothing in common with them. So what should i do? How do i overcome anxiety so i can enjoy life? And what about dieing, isnt it kind of sad if im enjoying life then one day its all over? Thanks. Also im struggling with negative/intrusive thoughts due to OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) its an anxiety disorder thats mental. P.S. One more thing that really bothers me, i feel like if my older sister (whos 21) if she had friends and wasnt shy and was outgoing i feel like i wouldnt have anxiety since she too would be out and about. Instead shes a goody good and obey's my parents and yeah, i just wish she would rebel for once in her life. I just feel like if she was more outgoing I WOULD be too. I know its lame blaming others for my problems, but im just down man, anxiety sucks!
