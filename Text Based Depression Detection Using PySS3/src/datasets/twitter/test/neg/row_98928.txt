Donâ€™t remember the last time I woke up not wanting to dieEvery single morning my thoughts are filled with possible ways I could die today. I think of getting the courage to finally hang myself but then the thought of hurting my family is just too much. So I lay in bed here and just cry, knowing how shitty I am as a person. Iâ€™m losing all sense of purpose being here. My hobbies that Iâ€™ve been doing for the past couple of weeks have stopped bringing me joy. Motivation is at itâ€™s lowest and it only makes me feel even more shitty, realizing Iâ€™m wasting my time. I canâ€™t stand other people being frustrated over superficial things online even though itâ€™s the only way to keep updated on my friendsâ€™ lives... But Iâ€™d rather just be left alone

Iâ€™m losing my mind and all this pressure on me to get up and do something with my life is making me breakdown. Iâ€™m tired of having to talk to people, when itâ€™s the last thing I want to do, and act like nothing is wrong. Please just let me die in a peaceful way. Sometimes I wish an accident would happen so I wouldnâ€™t feel responsible for my own death. 

This pain &amp; sadness is eating me up inside but thereâ€™s an image I have to keep up and itâ€™s killing me...
