It's really hard to type, because my head has been having a hard time for a while and is currently hurting badly. I don't know if I really want to talk about anything that's bothering me and I certainly don't feel capable of typing it -- I don't know what I'm looking to get from this either,I don't have anyone I can talk to on the phone or in person that I'd be comfortable doing so with (and there isn't anyone I know personally that's still around for me I have to, would have to be a hotline).

I'm very unhappy, little motivation to eat or do things I'm excited to, and I feel like the only person who has mutually cared about me in a significant way, doesn't care at all anymore and just wants me in the past (or to forget I happened). I can't talk to them, they expressed desire to cut contact a while ago and I know they won't reply (through, yes, I know this is looked down upon, but, experience).
