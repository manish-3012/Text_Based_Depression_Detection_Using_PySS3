How I slowly kill myselfI have suicidal thoughts, which appear once in a while. This started 8 years ago and over the last year they came to me more often, especially when being stressed. Now I have them daily.

Since all ways of suicide avaiable to me are too unsafe in regards of finishing the job, I started punching myself in the head, for example when getting angry at myself. I passed out already, have headaches regulary and its only a matter of time when I will get bleedings. When I get this far, I have a good reason for assisted suicide. Or maybe my heart will just stop beating.

There is now way this can be stopped anymore
