I think about it sometimesI don't know if this is being suicidal but sometimes I think about it. Once I found myself fantasizing about jumping out the window. What noise it would make when my skull cracks on the pavement. Where I would land. How it would feel. Another time I thought about what would happen if I walked to the train station near my house and jumped in front of the tracks and let the train end it all. The screams of the people at the station. Whether or not someone might try to  pull me away from the edge. One time I thought about what it would be like if I pulled my blanket over my head and allowed myself to suffocate. It may look like an  accident that way. Then I layed there for a while with the blanket covering my face. I knew it wouldn't kill me. I don't know what I was thinking honestly. I try to think about how my friends and family would react but I just can't get myself to empathize. I can't quite comprehend how they may feel or how they could react. I am so embarrassed to talk about this to people I know. They would think I'm crazy and say I need help. I can't get help, I can't afford it and I don't even have time right now to see anyone.
