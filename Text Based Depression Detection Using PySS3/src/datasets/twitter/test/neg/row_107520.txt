The time has come I am afraid.Im only 18 but the first time i tried to kill myself was when I was 14

I was "fine" until april of 2018, only suicidal thoughts every now and then but no attempts.

In april my dad found out about everything I've done drugs, alcohol, and sex wise.

A couple days later I walked two miles with 30 pounds of weights to the closest big bridge. I was at the edge of the bridge with my hands and feet tied. I got a text and felt like i had to reply. It was my dad asking where I was and i got off the railing. As soon as I got home, i was reasonably asked if i was at a party.

Obviously my no didnt mean anything. I've cheated on multiple girls and even though im smart i dont care enough to study or work hard anymore

I think this weekend I will jump off that bridge. the suicidal thoughts have been with me everynight and day for the past 4 months, Im a shitty person and I dont see the purpose of trying to get through everyday

I love my friends and I know my family loves me but I dont think any of that matters. nothing matters when were dead so why should i keep suffering while others can live normal lives carefree of suicidal thoughts.

My suicidal thoughts seem well thought out and theyre not because of one single event. I just dont know why I should even stay alive

sorry if anything i said doesnt make sense or flow well, im just sharing my thoughts
