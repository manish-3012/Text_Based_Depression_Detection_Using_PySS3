Nobody Wants MeI just started college not too long ago hoping for a fresh start, but I can tell that isnâ€™t going to happen. Iâ€™m trying my best to make some new friends, but everyone I try to talk to loses interest because Iâ€™m as bland as can be and I have nothing going for me. My wit is lacking and my looks are barely average, so why would anyone waste a single thought on me. I feel so alone, but I have a friend who was so close to me in high school that there is no way I could feel alone, right? I had feelings for her and for a awhile I knew she had feelings for me, so maybe I can hold onto that, right? Wrong. She is gradually creating more and more space between us until we cease contact. She used to respond to my texts in minutes, now Iâ€™ll be lucky to hear from her after two hours. I feel so alone, but I have old friends that loved me, right? I canâ€™t get responses from them either. Iâ€™m so tired of living a life where I am stupid enough to believe that I am loved and wanted. I thought I had such big plans for the future, but what is the point of planning for a life that I know will be as miserable and lonely as now? Whatâ€™s the point? The only thing keeping me from putting a bullet in my head is my huge fear of death, but I feel so horrible on the inside that even death seems attractive enough if that means my pain will go away. I just want to be happy and naive, much like when I was a smaller child, but I know this is unlikely. I canâ€™t see myself finishing out this semester, I really donâ€™t. Iâ€™ve felt this way for a long time, but since I truly have lost all of the support I thought I had then I can really see the state of my life. I want to die, Iâ€™m so tired of living in my own cold, isolated shell. I canâ€™t enjoy anything because of my loneliness, either. The color of flowers is dull, the taste of food is bland, and the things that I thought made me happy are worthless. I havenâ€™t been truly joyful in a long time, so I need to die. Everyone would be better off if I were dead anyway.
