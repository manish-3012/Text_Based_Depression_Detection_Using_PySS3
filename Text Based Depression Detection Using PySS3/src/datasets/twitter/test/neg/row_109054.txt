iâ€™m so selfishi want to die so badly, i think about it every day. 
but then i think â€œpeople will miss me but eventually forget about me and itâ€™s like i never even existedâ€. isnâ€™t that so fucked up, iâ€™m so narcissistic and needing everyone to like me thatâ€™s the only thing keeping me from offing myself.
