Feels like the end of the line. I see no option but death.Will to live it almost totally eliminated. The truth is that, if it weren't for knowing how it would devastate my family, I would have killed myself several years ago. 

Although the motivation to die stems from a few things, such as the inability to feel pleasure or reward, and the absolute amount of burden it places on those around me, the stress of my death on my family has simply always overpowered those reasons. 

I'm not so sure anymore. The options have only pointed to one way for a long time, but now that one way has a big glaring neon narrow pointing towards it (suicide).

I feel like it's coming time to rip the bandaid clean off. There will be immense acute pain for my family initially, and this absolutely tortures me, but dragging it out over years with a lower but steady level of burden is now certainly seems like the worse option. Not mention, nearly every minute of every day I'll spend suffering.
