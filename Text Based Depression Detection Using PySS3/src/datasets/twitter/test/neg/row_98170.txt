Over itMy first reddit post was on this sub. I needed direction and perspective at a time in my life where everything felt like it was falling apart. I came back around, into a dream job and career and a wonderful relationship...and I now feel no escape. I hate my dream job. I feel despondency with the world that hasn't gotten better in the past few years, even despite momentary respite. The only reason I haven't done it yet is a fear of hurting the ones I love the most and hope that things could get better. Our society doesn't allow clean escapes from the drudgery of the world, yet it cannot help but drop that drudgery on us all of the time. A triggering comment from a supervisor or partner. Unfulfilled promises from oneself and those around them. A day-in, day-out rigor that doesn't change anything. I don't want this anymore. My dream job is now a nightmare of personal torment, rejection, inability to reality test if things actually suck or if I should be grateful because at least it's not as bad as other people's jobs. I'm over living this way. I can't find another outlet. My girlfriend won't support me getting a food industry job, and thinks that it's condescending to be not grateful for the advantages I carry with me. But the advantages feel like impotence, barriers against becoming the adult I should have been a long time ago, one that can handle workplace rejection, difficult tasks and conversations. And the only way I can be confident involves succombing to ego. I haven't figured out another way, my impulsiveness has been too strong to overcome. 7 years of therapy hasn't helped enough. I think it's time. I'd love to leave it all behind and book a one way flight to some desert town, take psychedelics and see if I either find some new perspective or die under the hot arid desert sun. Sounds peaceful, and beautiful.
