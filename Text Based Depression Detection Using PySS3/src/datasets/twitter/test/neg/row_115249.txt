It is not worth it to live anymoreThere is a tall building I'm planning to jump, it is just I'm not even worth in this society and I'm too stupid in college getting good grades and I'm just worthless at everything. I'm just an autistic manchild and nobody even cares about me... I spend most of my life playing video games and watching anime for escaping reality. I think it is not worth to live anymore....
