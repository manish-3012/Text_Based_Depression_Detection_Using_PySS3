The 298th â€œattemptâ€ went like the previous 297. The 112th letter went like the first 111Iâ€™ve written this... so many times, I donâ€™t know if this one will be the one anyone actually reads or not. To the reader of this: first, let me say sorry that it was you who had the unfortunate pleasure of having to discover my body. Secondly, let me say thank you for reading this. Many people have read iterations of bits and pieces of this, few have ever been told the entire picture.

I donâ€™t think life is for me. Iâ€™m weak in the mind- despite years of carrying on through mental and verbal abuse, Iâ€™m broken, physically and mentally. This is all beginning to sound a little too melodramatic, so Iâ€™ll write out the whyâ€™s before I delve into the theatrics of how i feel:

Iâ€™m bipolar, and the medications donâ€™t work for me. Iâ€™ve tried a few, and sure I could keep trying and find one to work, but i donâ€™t think anyone understands how bad this disease truly is. At any moment I can go on a  drug bender and need no sleep and then the next day wake up an emotional mess hardly able to get out of bed and sleeping 14+ hour days. Bipolar isnâ€™t just difficult to deal with, it makes life impossible to deal with. 

I canâ€™t hold down jobs except for a few months at a time. When I work, I work too much, too hard, too often. Once I worked for six months straight basically only sleeping three hours a night in order to do my three jobs, as well as a summer class. When that hypomanic phase ended, i found myself unemployed for a year, struggling in school, and just all around a mess- hardly showering, distraught over my past and my future, and grappling with the reality of being bipolar. Iâ€™d  always known something was wrong, now there was a name for one of my mental enemies.

And what an enemy it is. Iâ€™ve talked about the work aspect, but the confidence, the person that I am changed as well. I went from a flirtatious, attractive, gym-addicted guy to a meek, unkempt, slob parasite of a human in a matter of weeks. And would yo-yo between the two, both in energy, cleanliness, and appearance. Itâ€™s a depressing way to be- to constantly shuffle between being almost what youâ€™ve always wanted and full of more life than should possible and then being so downtrodden and distraught that every passing car looks like a vehicle for your expiration. And bipolar is just the start of it.

Combining bipolar and anything else sounds hard, imagine combining it with a gender-identity issue. I truly struggle to accept that Iâ€™m cisgender, because i truly believe in my heart of hearts I was born in the wrong body, that I should have been born female. I hate everything about me, I feel like Iâ€™ve lived a lie and deceived everyone Iâ€™ve ever been around because of this hidden secret. I often get asked, â€œhow do you know?â€ Well, imagine having your first conscious memory being to beg your sister to make you into a real girl at age 3. Imaging looking up â€œgirl trapped in boys bodyâ€ at 8 or 9. Imagine crying every day once puberty started. Imaging trying on your sisters clothes in every chance you got, getting her to take pictures of you in her prom dresses, being a cheerleader for Halloween, wearing girls underwear to school whenever your sports were in off-season, wishing to be a girl at every birthday wish from ages three to 12, and then disliking birthdays as a result of the wish never happening.

Now, take that knowledge, and transpose it onto a star football player at one school, a good and up and coming football player on an 11-0 team coached by a true southern bigot, raised in a family of southern baptists headed by a man that threatened to kill you if you were gay and tried to kill your sister for having a child out of wedlock, a baseball player trying to survive among really good talents, and all of this occurring in the heart of the Bible Belt. Imagine this kid- this closet transgender athlete- faced with a choice: be who you are and suffer, hide who you are and be a face in the crowd or maybe even someone. The choice was easy.

Until it wasnâ€™t. See, you can excuse me giving up my hopes in order to survive. I thought there was no one else like me, no jock-nerd, football playing, video game loving closet transgender woman. Until Caitlyn Jenner. Caitlyn Jenner shattered every illusion I ever used to explain why i wasnâ€™t transgender. You see, it wasnâ€™t really that I had given up hope on transitioning. I still dreamed about it, still fantasized about it (in an unhealthy outlet). But, I convinced myself I wasnâ€™t transgender because I played football. I wasnâ€™t transgender because I liked girls. I wasnâ€™t transgender because I really enjoyed the athletics being a boy provided me to play without reprisal. I wasnâ€™t transgender because i was obsessed with working out and perfecting my body to be a better athlete. But, here she was, a former male Olympic gold medalist, star athlete, announcing that he was in fact a she, that she was transgender. And itâ€™s shattered my illusion, the reality I had clung to. 

And that grew to a hope, in a way. A hope that I could be like her, she did it so publicly and with such a spotlight that i thought maybe i could handle the spotlight of small hometowns. That couldnâ€™t be further from the truth. I gauged everyoneâ€™s reactions to her coming out, from my family to my friends to former coaches to friends of friends and the general temperature of the area. Well, it wasnâ€™t good. The hope flickered. It was summer of 2015, I was in summer school trying to right the course, but it was doomed. I realized in that moment, the acceptance that I was transgender as well as the realization that the only way to be who I was was to abandon all people from my former life, including my loving mother and abusive father, that i would never. Iâ€™m a mommaâ€™s girl, boy, whatever works at this point, I could never abandon her. Iâ€™m also incredibly alone, devoid of the support system I would need for that. So i threw myself into a litany of drugs outside of my usual cannabis: dxm, Xanax, codeine, cocaine, hydros, Percocets. Your typical; I donâ€™t wanna remember or be around much longer.

And Iâ€™ve had some people ask me, why donâ€™t you work and save to move? Iâ€™ll point you back to bipolar. Why donâ€™t you transition here? Well... funny thing about trying to deny youâ€™re trans. It slips, a lot, over the course of your life, whether through actions or words. Enough people know here that bullied me that I could never. Enough people bullied me anyways (**redacted**) that I would never feel safe or comfortable. Enough of my family wants me dead if I did (dad), that I could never. 

Itâ€™s.. not that I didnâ€™t try. I did. I fought for a decade longer than i should have. When those pictures of me, dolled up, sent in confidence to a girl I liked made the rounds at school and eventually had her mom snickering at her birthday party at me in the corner, i should have taken my life right then and there. I didnâ€™t. I had some crazy ability to compartmentalize, to basically put it in a box and pretend it didnâ€™t happen. But, independence at college as well as Caitlyn Jenner broke down those walls. Iâ€™ve tried, desperately, to rebuild the walls that had my brain divided into a neat little organized filing cabinet for the last three years. Unfortunately, Iâ€™ve failed every time.

And even then, I pressed on. I tried to not build the wall and transition. What happened? Well, quite frankly, i was happy for a time. I knew this was what i wanted. My bipolar symptoms and desire to die every day I woke up subsided. But, something nagged at me. I started too late to pass. I wouldnâ€™t be independent and would have to stop. I wouldnâ€™t find love or happiness. I wouldnâ€™t be what i wanted to be because of mistakes in my past. I failed. 

People say suicide is cowardly. Theyâ€™ve never been suicidal. Theyâ€™ve never had a noose around their neck for hours on end trying to muster the courage to jump off the ledge. Theyâ€™ve never researched the most surefire way to kill themself. Theyâ€™ve never gone on a coke bender in the hopes their heart would stop. Theyâ€™re the cowards for refusing to engage with suicidal people. Only one man has ever said that about suicide to me, my father. While I donâ€™t necessarily blame him for my death, heâ€™s culpable. He doesnâ€™t understand how his words hurt back then. He was raised in a different time, true, but transgender people existed from the dawn of time, and part of being a parent is learning to raise kids in THIS time, not sticking to some quasi-religious moral code with no basis in biology or science (yes, biology backs people like me, not what you think huh). He was the coward for refusing to change, not me.

People say suicide is selfish. Aye, it might be: but isnâ€™t it also selfish to demand that people so bent on dying fight on just to spare you a few days of tears and (at most) a few months of hurt? Isnâ€™t it also selfish to demand that people who have been so hurt their entire life continue to be hurt just to spare you guilt about what you could have done better or differently? If the guilt is what bothers you most, maybe you should live every day and interact with every person like you could be the last person they talk to before taking their own life? It may change the world for the better.

Suicide is selfish. But Iâ€™ve selflessly stopped every time before. If I muster the courage to do it on the 298th time and 112th iteration of a suicide letter, canâ€™t you give me credit for being selfless 297 times? I tried. I fought. I tried so fucking hard and I fought with everything in me. But itâ€™s 4:37 in the morning, Iâ€™ve had minimal human contact for a week, Iâ€™m coked out, Iâ€™m depressed, Iâ€™m transgender, Iâ€™m hurt, and i just want to go. What is so bad about that?

Funerals are for the living, not the dead, and I realize that. But instead of wasting more of your money on someone that disappointed you, cremate me, put some of my ashes in a tiny little thing that goes on my dogs collar, and spread the rest at **redacted** . They both gave me life and drove me to my death.

To my family: Iâ€™m so sorry. You deserved a better son, brother, uncle than me. To my friends: though few and far between I hope I wasnâ€™t as big of an ass as I thought I was, I hope more often than not i gave you love. To **redacted**:... buddy, i know you donâ€™t understand words and i know youâ€™re probably depressed at the moment. Youâ€™re sleeping beside me as i write this and Iâ€™ve kissed your cute forehead six times tonight. You were my best friend, and I know you deserved a better friend than me. I donâ€™t know how I got so lucky with such a sweet, loyal, playful dog. To whoever is reading this: please pick him up and love him for me. Heâ€™s my biggest regret in leaving behind, because heâ€™s gonna be hit the hardest. You should see his smile when I come back after a few minutes, itâ€™s one of the purest things in the world, and I hope he smiles like that again.


Goodbye, everyone, I love you all, even those named as bad actors in my narrative. We all have our own truths to tell, just remember my ask: interact with everyone in the world like you are the last person they will ever talk to, and the world might become a place that i would have felt comfortable staying in a little while longer
