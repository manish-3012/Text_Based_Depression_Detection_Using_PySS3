Suicidal friend and suicidal meI need to get this off my chest 
I love my friend, i really do, she's such an important person but i wish she'd fucking shut up. Im so tired, she's attempted too many times and i was ALWAYS on the other side of the screen there for her and trying to talk her out of it, im genuinly traumatized from this, sometimes i wish i never met her because the anxiety of knowing your words could either help or do nothing fucking sucks. I have other friend with depression and mentil illness but the difference is, they don't speak up nearly as much, It's waaaay more healthy and they actually acknowledge im trying to help.  With her it's like she always tell me how her mental state is, every month there's gotta be that " im depressed" text. I get she has problems but so do i, i literally got triggered by her talking about her suicidal thoughts that i ATTEMPTED. She doesn't know that was the reason ofc. Im tired i can't focus on my own life and i HAVE to, she's 19 and has a job and already lives on her own, i still have so many tests and so much bull shit i have to do to graduate highschool and get a shot at a decent life. My mental health is never stable and when it is she comes in with her problems and issues, i should not have to deal with this, she's so pessimistic and nothing i say works, she puts herself in reletionship where she depends on them to feel good so when it doesn't work out she falls apart and attempts, its a cycle i know pretty well. Like dude im suicidal too and hearing " i wanna die" said "jokingly " is not okay. I can't deal with this, fucking deal with your problems and get help. Which is available in her country.  I don't fucking even have a hotline.  Im tired, i wish she could get her shit together already without depending on people.
Im suicidal now after a month or so of stable health, i don't want this just because she doesn't recognise other people can't handle her problems. Fucking cry me a river
