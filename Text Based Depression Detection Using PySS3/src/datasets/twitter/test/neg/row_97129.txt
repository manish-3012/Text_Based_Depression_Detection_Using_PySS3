just lost all my friendsi have a history of speaking too soon, but all of this feels much more certain than anything else iâ€™ve talked about, and regardless itâ€™s making me feel so incredibly empty. i got in a fight with one of my friends because of a disagreement over something thatâ€™s important to me, and i flew off the handle and became completely enraged and in a momentary impulse decided it would be a good idea to use those feelings to destroy all my interpersonal relationships. i realized what i was doing at the time but i couldnâ€™t stop myself. all i could do was try my best to portray how upset i was through tears while i screamed at myself in vain to stop. everyone in my friends circle, which iâ€™ve been in since itâ€™s formation in middle school, agreed that iâ€™m toxic and arrogant and that they shouldnâ€™t be friends with me. they were my only tether to interaction, i have literally no one now. not a single fucking person. none of us were really close but they were at least people i could interact with. but now theyâ€™re gone, and with no one else even interested in speaking to me and paired with the fact that i have completely shit grades and no family connection i feel like pretty much just a burden. i really want to die now more than i ever have in the past. iâ€™ve been depressed before but it was always causeless but this time i have a reason and itâ€™s so much worse. i just want to go away
