I feel I'm completely worthless, and that I subconsciously feel I am ready to die.I'm sorry if I'm wasting you wonderful people's time, I usually feel like I do a lot. I feel I can't do anything right. I'm addicted the the computer, I want to program and act like I do when I'm horrible at it, etc. Recently I went in a dark room. The Darkness seemed to never end. I could just sit in there and lament and think. Then I saw a red, glowing dot (not hallucinating, it was coming from an appliance in the room). I knew it was me. I thought about putting my hand over the light to cover it up. Just thinking of it literally made me reel over and fall to the floor. I got sickening feelings of thinking about it a couple more times. I felt sicks when in the anticipation of covering it up. When I finally did it, I didn't feel anything bad. No sickening feeling, nothing. I felt silence, acceptance, coming to terms with myself, peace, etc. I think this represents that I am ready to die, but am hesitant about failing my parents, and myself, who both hoped that I would do something with my life, and invested so much time in me. This is how I think I feel about myself. Am I ready to die?
