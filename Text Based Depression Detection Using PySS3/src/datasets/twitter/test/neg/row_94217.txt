This is it...I'm using a throwaway account for this by the way

I'm going to get straight to the point, basically everything is just too stressful and I feel just too empty. Anyways I'm going to kill myself. No, I'm not going to call the stupid hotline and no I'm not doing it for attention. I'm doing it because it's the only way to stop feeling like this. I've already decided that I'm going to do it. If for some reason any of you are worried, don't be. You all had nothing to do with it I just don't have anywhere else to put this. I already wrote my note and everything. I did the last things that I wanted: the only things that make me happy. Thank you for listening to all of this when you didn't have to.âœŒï¸
