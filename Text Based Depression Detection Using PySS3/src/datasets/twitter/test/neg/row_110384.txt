My boyfriend said he hates me because I said I wanted to kill myselfI cried so hard. He said he wasnâ€™t going to apologize. Not that I asked him to. I asked him through tears â€œwhy would you say thatâ€ and he said â€œwhy would YOU say you wanted to kill yourself. Iâ€™m not saying sorry either, because I meant it.â€ And that broke me. Iâ€™m mentally troubled. My meds arenâ€™t working yet since I just got them. Iâ€™m schizoaffective, depressed, anxious, bipolar, and have PTSD. So if itâ€™s not apparent, Iâ€™m a very troubled person. Iâ€™m not currently getting any *good* therapy because.. well.. itâ€™s complicated and Iâ€™ll spare you the details. Just know itâ€™s.. really complicated and it isnâ€™t as easy as â€œgo get a new therapist!â€ Life isnâ€™t always that easy, unfortunately. Right now Iâ€™m focusing on meds. Since my bipolar and depression are the main things harming me. And my boyfriend. And everyone I ever speak to. Iâ€™m a wreck of a human being. I ran upstairs to go find my mothers gun but I couldnâ€™t find it. I sat down and cried for about 20 minutes. Then I stabbed myself in the stomach with a knife. But Iâ€™m too weak (mentally and physically) to stab myself any deeper than something very minor. I tried doing it again in the same spot but it only went a little bit deeper. I broke down again at how weak I am and sat down on the kitchen floor in tears. Iâ€™m planning on taking every pill in the house. I know thatâ€™s more so going to cause internal damage or.. brain damage. But I donâ€™t care. If thereâ€™s a chance I will die or be unconscious for a long period of time, imitating death.. then Iâ€™ll go through with it. My boyfriend said if I did it heâ€™d hate me. But he already said he hated me. So what exactly am I going to lose? Him hating me *more*? So be it. Not like Iâ€™ll be here to know he hates me and will never forgive me.

Please donâ€™t think heâ€™s uncaring by what he said. He only said it because he *does* care and I was getting out of hand. Though I donâ€™t agree with him saying it, Iâ€™m trying to find reasoning behind his hurtful words in one of the worst times of my life. I hate me too. And Iâ€™m already done swallowing 10 of my mood stabilizers. Itâ€™s all I had in the bottle. Iâ€™ll do the antidepressants a little later. Iâ€™m dizzy. Not because of the pills or anything, but because of my bad day. I guess Iâ€™m here why everyone else is here too.. I want hope. Right now I feel nothing but despair. I just need someone comforting to talk to. I donâ€™t have that.
