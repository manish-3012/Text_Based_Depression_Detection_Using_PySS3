I don't think I'll make it over the summerSemi-regular poster here. I'm worn out by being constantly miserable. Can't do my work, test tommorow, fuck it. I deserve to die. One of my only friends is a girl I like who has a boyfriend. I'm a lesser person to her than he is. I'm not worth jack shit to anyone, I'm an unfunny joke to even the few friends I have. I'm going to be having a long empty summer where I don't talk to anyone my age for 3 months. The only reason I've made it this far is lack of tools and my friends back home.
