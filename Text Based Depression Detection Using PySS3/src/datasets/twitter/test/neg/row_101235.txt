Everyday just makes me want to die.I have a good amount of friends, I have a boyfriend and I have an ongoing job, but I still feel like there's a gaping hole in me.  I feel like my boyfriend doesn't care anymore/is tired of me and more suspicious of me when it comes to his social media.  I just feel like I'm losing everything one by one because I can't get out of this rut.  I used to be everyone's pillar of support but then it's funny when I'm the one that needs it and I can't get it anywhere.  

It's just sad, because I'm sitting here with nearing deadlines and bloody fingers because I can't stop picking at my nailbeds due to anxiety.  I stay up ungodly hours because I can't sleep and I just cry the frustration out.  Everyday I feel like I'm just existing and not living.  I've thought of ending my life loads of times but the thought of hurting the people I love if I did that makes me stay my hand.

But I want release.  I don't want to live everyday so stressfully anymore.  I can't even look at myself in the mirror.  I look through my old photographs and I see this shining, bubbly girl and she feels like a different person.  I don't know what to do anymore except to just let go of everything and start again on my own. 

Please help.
