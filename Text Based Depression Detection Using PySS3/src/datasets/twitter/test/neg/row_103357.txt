I tired to kill myself and didn't do it.I wanted to die, I gave up. I attempted to kill myself but wasn't brave enough, I came very close to it but decided to just live. Days did get better at one point but today I feel as depressed as that day. I won't try to commit suicide again but it definitely sucks to have this feeling.
