Thinking about suicideSo i have been thinking a lot about suicide after one particular moment. I found out recently what could be the cause of this but im not sure. I am thinking about 2 maybe 3 methods and i don know wich one to choose. 1. Jumping from the 9th floor. 2 hanging. 3 going to a gun range and quickly shooting myself. I have been a pain for all my life. I have had my parents fight because of me. I have had my mom cry many times. I went to a therapist and that didnt help and now im stuck on wich method to choose.
