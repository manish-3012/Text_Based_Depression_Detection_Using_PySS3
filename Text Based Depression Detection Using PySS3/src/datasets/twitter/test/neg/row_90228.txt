Nothing helps, and I feel so alone.I've been struggling with what I'd assume is depression for years, and it's been especially bad for the last few months. It doesn't feel like it's ever going to go away. I constantly consider just ending it all, because I feel awful, and it doesn't feel like things will ever get better.

Today has been especially bad. I woke up this morning and felt the most stressed I have in a while, it's so overwhelming that it almost feelings like there's some kind of physical force pushing down on me. I feel sick to my stomach, and like just breaking down into tears.

I should probably include a bit of backstory too, sorry.
I'm fifteen, I've spent my entire life living miles from the nearest town. I've always been a bit nervous around people, possibly because I didn't have any interaction with other kids my age when I was young? Well, this lead to me having trouble making friends in elementary school, and I eventually left due to anxiety. I spent the next 3 years doing absolutely nothing due to a lack of motivation, and now I'm a freshman in highschool, and I find myself falling farther and farther behind.

Even at home I can't get away from stress, I hate it here. My mom is ALWAYS letting members of her family stay over, eat our food, and use our plumbing. I haven't even been able to use the television in the living room for months. 

Not only that, but my mom is a total hoarder, there's tons of boxes of junk stacked up to the ceiling in tons of rooms. Even the parts of our house that're a bit more well kept are disgusting. The carpet is ripped up in several rooms, because my mom wanted to put down wooden floors, but I doubt it'll ever happen, and my cats keep doing their business on the rugs, because they don't like the fact that my mom's letting her family move into our living room. I don't either. Even when I went to school, I was too embarrassed about the shape my house was in to have any friends over, so I ended up leaving them behind.

There's also my parent's inevitable divorce looming over my head, and there's nothing I can do to get away from that.

Due to all of this, the only friends I have are online ones, and it feels like I'm just a burden on all of them. It seems like they always have something worse to deal with, I'm just some crybaby who wants to kill herself for no good reason. Not only does venting not help, it just feels like it's pushing everyone away from me. Nobody can offer any advice that helps, but they've actually complained about people turning down all their advice before, so I'm afraid to even respond with an "I've already tried that, and it didn't help." or anything similar.

They're all really nice people, but it just feels like I'm a bother, and that they'd be better off without me. Besides, they always have another friend who's more important. I'm just a side friend to talk to when they're bored.

I've been considering therapy, but I don't know if my family can afford it, and I've heard from multiple people that it doesn't really help, or that the meds make a lot of people feel worse, so I don't know where to turn really. I won't even be able to get into a normal doctor until August, when the next school term starts, and I've barely been able to work on school at all, so if I can't get in until then, I don't know if I'll even be able to graduate to 10th grade..

I wish I had someone who could make me happy when I feel awful. A friend who'd watch movies with me, take me out shopping, etc. to get away from the stress, but I don't, and if I told my parents that I'm suicidal, I'm sure they'd just make it worse.

I just can't find a reason to keep living like this. I feel like complete shit. There's literally nothing I enjoy, and the stress just keeps piling up more and more. My friends and pets don't even need me. I lost my brother to suicide, and everyone's completely over it now. The only thing holding me back form doing it is that I don't want all my friends to leave me behind. They'll all forget about me, my boyfriend will end up with someone else, and I'll be alone forever.

I'm in so much emotional pain right now that I can't stand it, I'd rather experience any physical agony over this. I feel so alone, it doesn't feel like anyone cares.

Edit: The reason I haven't been working on school is mostly this overwhelming feeling of "I'm going to kill myself anyways, so what's the point?" The longer I go without working on school, the worse the stress becomes, though. I hear people talking about how it's just a matter of 'not putting in the effort', but even if I do try to work on school, sometimes there's such a overwhelming amount of stress that I can't even think. The only thing that really helps at all is talking to my friends, and I'm pretty sure they're all tired of me rely on them so much too, so. I feel really guilty, about that, I just feel like a clingy asshole.

The last things I found fun were hanging out with friends, singing, drawing, watching something, or getting a chance to leave the house, but now none of those are enjoyable either. Playing video games is boring now too. They all just feel like a waste of time.

My friends always seem to have something more important than me to deal with, and my mom puts the rest of the family above the happiness of my dad and I. I don't want to be selfish, but frankly, I'm tired of it. Why can't I just come first for once?
