AloneWhat do I do? I literally have nothing and no one.  My best friend divorced me after 20yrs, traded in for a younger version.  I have no friends.  I have no immediate family.  I am injured.  I have no money.  I have no home.  I have no job.  I have no transportation.  I want to end my suffering but I'm also afraid I will be as inconsequential in death as I am in life.  I'll be forced to move to a shelter soon and know I can't mentally survive the realization of failure that put me there.  I have nothing to look forward to and, for a person like me that ALWAYS had the answers, I've realized I have none.  I lived my life giving to others, and know the well is dry.  I gave of myself to everyone I've known firmly believing in paying things forward.  What a crock of shit.  Sacrifice for nothing.  I haven't eaten in days.  My teeth are falling out.  My hair is falling out.  I can't sleep.  I'm a prisoner of my own mind while awake.  LIterally have nowhere to go or a way to get there, no one to see, no one to help, nothing to trade or sell.  I want to kill myself.  I literally think about it every single minute of the day.
