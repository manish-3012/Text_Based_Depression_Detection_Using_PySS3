I just want to stop hurtingI donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m hoping to gain by posting here.  I just know every day feels like Iâ€™m dying a little more.

2 years ago I had a great job and an amazing girlfriend of 5 years.  We had a perfect life planned.  My company shut down in January of last year, and my girlfriend was diagnosed with cancer over this summer and moved states to receive treatment from one of her family members who is an expert in the field.  

Iâ€™m paycheck to paycheck now and sending her every little bit I can to help.  Itâ€™s not enough though.

I have decent sized life insurance policies that sheâ€™s the beneficiary of.  Iâ€™m miserable on a day to day basis, and I think she needs financial support more than emotional support from me at this point so I think Iâ€™d be doing her a favor.  

Especially as Iâ€™ve had my own personal issues with my family pop up the last few weeks I feel like I havenâ€™t been able to provide emotional support either.  

I wake up hurting, I go through my day hurting, and I go to sleep hurting and I just want it to stop and canâ€™t think of another way to accomplish that
