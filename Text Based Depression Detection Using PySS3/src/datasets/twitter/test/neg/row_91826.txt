I almost attempted suicide the 3rd time tonight.Coming to vent here. Iâ€™ve come to a point mentally where everything seems so surreal and Iâ€™ve lost my sense of reality/sanity.
So many people are going through a difficult time it seems. Itâ€™s hard to find words, I wish I could take everyoneâ€™s pain away, Iâ€™m sending all the love your way.  
Now, I just need to vent like everybody else. I almost attempted suicide again. And I still might in the next few hours or days. Iâ€™ve been through enough to see that this life or god, or whatever it is, it wonâ€™t stop the unbearable pain until Iâ€™m not breathing anymore. Iâ€™m not meant to be here and Iâ€™m punished for that. I have to do something about it, to end this now. I was never deserving to be here in the first place. For my loved ones, theyâ€™ll understand when Iâ€™m gone. Loss is never easy to cope with and the last goodbyes will never be enough, but I can no longer stay here for other people. As much as I love them more than anything. I canâ€™t, itâ€™s tormenting me. I long for the peace and happiness and unconditional love I never had or will ever have on earth. I wish I got to experience that during my time on here but I was never meant to. Iâ€™m wired to not survive ever since I was born, thats how it should be. Thereâ€™s so much to write more, but I cannot possibly express in words what Iâ€™m going through or the pain Iâ€™m in.
Anyway, I wish everyone the happiness and peace they deserve. I wish I could take your pain away and sacrifice myself with mine. I always had so much love to give to this world and I wish I had changed at least someoneâ€™s life and made a difference here. But, even if Iâ€™m gone soon that wonâ€™t stop my soul. Just not here on this earth. 
Stay strong, my friends. Youâ€™re loved and cared for.
