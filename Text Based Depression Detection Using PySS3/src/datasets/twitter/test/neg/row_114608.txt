FUCK EVERYONE &amp; EVERYTHING. BUT I'M SORRY.Wasn't always been this way. I was cheerful before lived a good life and happiness and joy. Now I lay in bed dreaming of the day I would like to kill myself. It's so morbid that killing myself actually helps me sleep. I don't think I can fix my life anymore ðŸ˜­ and I fucking hate myself. I just want to RNG die. I drove up Mt. Ubhunum the other day and had the urge to drive off a cliff. I fucking get anxiety ordering fast food. Fuck depression can't live my life anymore sh*t. Anti-depressants do shit. Nothing. Thanks for the memories. Either I wander this Earth for another 25+ years or fucking die. Endless cycled loop I cannot escape. I lived a good life I guess. But I already died a million times before I wake up. Nothing brings me happiness anymore.
