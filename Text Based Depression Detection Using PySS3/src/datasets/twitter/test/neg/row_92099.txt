my life is fine. but since forever I've thought about suicide every day.I'm a really attractive guy with a girlfriend and a family and I have gotten accepted into a good school and everything. My life is fine. I'm not sure why, but every day I get really sad and I just want to stop my life. I'm not sure why. I know I need help but I'm going to wait until I turn 18 so my parents don't find out. I get really really sad and I've never told anyone. Every day I get more sad. I have no problems with anyone too. I just really don't want to live. I'm not sure why. I really just want to put an end to my life. I feel like I deserve to die, I feel like my life is worthless and I shouldn't be here. Also I don't do drugs. Why do I think about suicide every day?
