Why am I alive?I donâ€™t know. Like I seriously donâ€™t know. I could easily die by jumping under a train but I tried to hang my self instead and stoped after a few minutes because I didnâ€™t do the right tie.

I really just donâ€™t know. I think it was some last piece of willing to live or that I didnâ€™t wanted that my family find me like that. 

I am still going to commit suicide next week and this time I will really do it and be 200% sure that it will work but I donâ€™t know why I am not dead yet.
Thatâ€™s just sad. I donâ€™t know why I am alive. I donâ€™t know who I am anymore. I donâ€™t care if I die tonight. I wish I ll never have to go to school again and to feel this way again and even to have to wake up an other day. I donâ€™t know what stoped me. I just donâ€™t know anything.
Maybe my life is really just worthless and nobody will ever know who I was. Maybe thatâ€™s for the best. It will be for the best.

I should have looked how to make a good tie. I just hate my self so much. I canâ€™t take it and Iâ€™ve never been able to so why? My friend is dead, I want to die since I am 7, my other friend also wants to die, I hate myself and my life and my school, my mum, grandma, grandpa tried to kill themself and all my family has mental problems and yet I am one of the lucky one because I live in a nice country with a healthy family with friends and even a girlfriend. So why? Just why?
Why am I not dead and why I feel like that? Whatâ€™s the point? Whatâ€™s the point because I will hurt my loved ones whatever I do. If I kms it will hurt them but less than if I continue to live.
I am just such a shit. I donâ€™t want to stay on earth an other minute. I want to see my dead friend, I want her to slap me then hug me and say that itâ€™s over now and that I wonâ€™t suffer anymore.

Why am I alive when so many good people die and I canâ€™t make the right tie, take enough paracetamol or cut deeper? I donâ€™t want to live. I hate life.

When I was born I should have died as well. Why did I survived? For what? Why did I tried to make things work a bit longer when I knew that it was done for me?
I have tried, so many times. I have been to a mental hospital, I take my medication, I try to talk with my family, I have a psychiatrist and I tried so hard. All that for nothing. 
Itâ€™s just getting worst.

Nobody will read that itâ€™s just too long but thatâ€™s ok because I donâ€™t matter. 
I canâ€™t matter when I need help to live like a human being. I am worst than hitler because he cared about something at least and I donâ€™t care about anything now because Iâ€™m willing to hurt my loved ones for my self. 

I just hate my self and I canâ€™t say how much. I hate my self because I will never be good enough, that I will always hurt others and that I always give up on my dreams. 

I tried to accept myself but I just canâ€™t and no mom it isnâ€™t just a phase. Itâ€™s been going on since more than 8 years now. Every day. Every hour. 

See how shitty I am. My mom is great and want to help and I just said something bad. I am just a privileged whit girl. Just a shitty teenager that complains about her life even if it isnâ€™t terrible. 
I tried to killed my self five times but I didnâ€™t went at the end three times. I probably donâ€™t even deserve death and peace. I shouldnâ€™t have existed. I never wanted to exist. I just want to be calm. Just once be calm. Not happy, just looking at the sky will I drink a beer and then blink and never open my eyes again. Thatâ€™s would be great. 
But I will jump under a train instead. Wonâ€™t take long. Be dead in one week. Perhaps that I will see my friend again. 

I just donâ€™t know anymore.
