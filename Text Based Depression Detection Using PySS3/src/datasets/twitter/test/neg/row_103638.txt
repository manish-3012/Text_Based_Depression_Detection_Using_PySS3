I want nothing short of deathSee I'm a nobody. I'll never work.
I'll be sad often. That's it. That's it.
Becoming, fucking becoming, could I just fuck it right in the ass? Damn. Saddens me a lot. This whole becoming shit. Ruins my day and keeps me awake at night. I'm a nobody. I should game all day and night.
Pass time. Be a drunk. Then one night, lonely and sad, scared and bitter, just fucking kill myself. That's my story. The story of Mr. Nobody.
