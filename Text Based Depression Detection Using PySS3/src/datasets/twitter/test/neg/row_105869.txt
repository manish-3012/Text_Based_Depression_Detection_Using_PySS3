Can't OD for the life of me.Alcohol. Ambien. Xanax. Trazadone. Adderall. Hahaha nothing fucking works you just always puke it up! Hanging doesn't either. The cycle just keeps on going.

Angry. Lonely. Tired. 11 hours and the teams new build still isn't done. No one loves me. I am going to die as soon as my body will fucking let me. 

Fuck my job. Fuck my education. Fuck my broken home. Fuck my love life. Fuck my life. 

Let's try these pills again.

(Still love you reddit)
