Not in a good placeI just got caught plagiarizing in my paper and I donâ€™t know what is going to happen. I have no clue what I want to major in or do with my life. Now I have none of this. I might get expelled, Iâ€™m not sure what is going to happen. I thought college would be a new beginning for me where I would meet good people and succeed. Now I may not have any of this. I honestly just feel as though ending it would be better than continuing my life of pain and anxiety
