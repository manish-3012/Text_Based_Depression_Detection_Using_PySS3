Getting worseEvery night I go to bed hoping never to wake up. I pray for the ceiling to cave in on me, for the ground to give way, for a murderer to break in and kill me... Whatever the fantasy, it has always been limited by a passiveness on my part. But lately, I have been thinking more about ways I might do it myself. I don't know that I'd ever go through with it; I can't bear the thought of my parents grieving for me. But even so, the thoughts keep recurring.

I think I am at a higher risk over the next few days.

I don't know. I feel guilty posting this because I probably won't do anything to myself, and because I might be drawing attention away from someone more likely to actually go through with it. So sorry if the latter is true. Feel free to delete or report this posting.

Going to bed now, wishing I never wake up.
