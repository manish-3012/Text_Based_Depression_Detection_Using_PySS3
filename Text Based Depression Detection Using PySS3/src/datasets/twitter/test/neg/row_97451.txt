M25 Really don't see why I should keep going.I have been planning on killing myself for 6 years.

Up until September 2018 the main reason I didn't kill myself was because my autistic partner needed someone to look after them and make sure they were ok. That partner cheated on me last September and we broke up. At this point I exist but I don't know why. Life has been a low level form of suffering for as long as I can remember with more significant pain and occasional rest bite. I see no reason to keep going and yet for some stupid and painful reason I do, I wish I could just finish everything but I don't have the drive to even finish myself off and so I live in a constant state of wishing I could just get it over and done with. For some stupid reason I keep trying to organise things as if I will continue to be here even though I hope I won't be.

As time goes on the world around me just seems to fall apart around me. Politically my country (UK) has shit itself and refuses to go back on its massive mistake. This means that the suffering I feel now will just get worse as myself and everyone around me just get poorer and more desperate.

I know that this place cannot suggest ways or means of doing the deed but can anyone help me know where I can find out how to at least get my affairs in order so that I am less of a burden when I am finally able to kill myself?
