I am done with being a damn screw up.Basically, the title says it all.

Today I have had one of the worst days in my life. 

Tonight, I have already started cutting myself, and don't plan to stop soon.

I am just a good for nothing, looked over, piece of shit. I am tired of being screwed over on EVERYTHING.

No, It's not gonna get better so don't try and say that.

It's only going down hill but, one problem, there's no more down.

Today I was sitting at a park and I just wanted to drive my truck in the lake I was looking at. I was feeling that bad and still am.

The cause of these feelings is basically an array of being alone, getting a chance at anything and failing, family problems, and shut out of everything.


I am done with this life. I want to be gone, but I don't have the will to do it myself.
