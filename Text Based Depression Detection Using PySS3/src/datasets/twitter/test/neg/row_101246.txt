I lack empathy, so I could use some guidance on what a note should sayHey guys,

I'm going to kill myself. I am pretty isolated, so a huge amount of the people I care about will never have to know about it. One thing I plan to put in my note is a request not to tell anyone who wouldn't naturally find out actually.

However, my family will know. There's no way around it, that's just how shit works. The authorities notify your family.

Now, although I can't properly show empathy, I do understand that this will hurt them, and I want that to be as minimal as possible.

I feel like the most important thing to express is that it's not their fault, either through action or inaction. It's not. I don't want them blaming themselves or each other. 

I don't know what else to say though. Do I tell them how much I love them, or will that hurt more? I don't really want a funeral, but should I let them do it anyway, for them? Will it help?

As you can see, I am kind of an idiot when it comes to this shit. Any advice would be appreciated.
