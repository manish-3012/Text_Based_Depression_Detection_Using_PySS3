I'm intensely emotionally bored.It's just a dumb textbook case of depression and suicidal ideation and blah blah blah, but in a way I don't care. I know that at some point in the future I'll feel better and be grateful I didn't kill myself, but I also know that I'll fall back into this emotional dump-space again. It's not feeling this way that gets to me I think, it's just the absolute boredom I have at the moment with my emotional cycle. My life feels so boring and *pointless*. 

I've tried to change things up and I've been going to the gym, I've been eating better. I lost 10 pounds in the last few months, but it doesn't make me feel better. I don't think I'll care if I'm fit. It won't help me connect with my surroundings any better. I'm like a cocoon of apathy. 

I think I'm slowly losing my mind. It's harder and harder every day to feel any connection to *anything.* And the dumbest part is *I am trying so hard*. I started reading again, something I love, and I've read 1000 pages last month. I try to watch less TV, I try to go out more. I've pulled myself out of my physical isolation, but my emotional and mental isolation has only gotten stronger. 

I think I probably will kill myself eventually. I can't imagine just going through this cycle for forever, and I can't possibly think of what else I could do to change up my situation. 

Honestly, the only reason why I haven't killed myself yet is because I don't want to hurt the people I love. And sometimes I don't even really care about that anymore. 

I don't think I really want to talk about it. Talking never helps and I always feel like a shitty person when others struggle to help me.
