Worthless, Jobless MillennialMy whole life has been 1 big struggle to get to a "normal" place. 


I was very poor growing up and no one could come to our house because it was a disaster.


I made good grades and went to community college on a scholarship. The transition to university went badly, partly because I was working 30 hrs/wk to pay bills and wasn't allowed to take any of the hard classes in community college (they wouldn't transfer). 


At university, I transferred majors and dropped out of college twice. Somehow I made it out relatively unscathed. Just lower self-esteem and a couple years older than everyone else.


I got accepted into one of the best private graduate schools in the US. I had no way to afford the crazy bill, but, somehow, over the last 3 years I have been able to get debt free by working in grad school. It was ridiculously stressful and I drank a ton of alcohol and gained 10-20lbs.


Now I am old, more overweight than I should be, penniless, and can't find a job. It's the last mile, but I can't find a single job...


There are test like IQ tests to get a job in my field, and I discovered that I can't pass them. I was almost free from this financial hell, and I can't pass the last step.


Now I am just a loser. Everything that I did in the last 10 years was completely wasted and worthless. 


If I can't find a job soon, I want to quit.
