This vacation has been a nightmare...I am sleeping in one of the tallest skyscrapers in the urban center and I always visit the highest floor...

I am always attracted to standing on top of the guard rail and looking hundreds of feet below... Just nearly wanting to jump to my death. 

Then there's the commuter trains... When my family wasn't looking, I quickly laid down with my neck across the rail... just imagining what it would feel like with the train coming down...

All I can imagine is dying in this city and I find myself addicted to playing with death...

How do I stop this? How do I fix this attraction? I am on meds and they do nothing...
