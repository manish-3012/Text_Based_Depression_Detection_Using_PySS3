I've been like this for a long time and I want to ask for helpI really need advice and help. I want to kill myself and it's just about all I can think about now. It wasn't always like this. When I was 16 it started to get bad. I fought constant depression and anxiety silently because I felt like if I told someone they would just think I wanted the meds or I was just trying to get attention plus I have gone my whole life feeling like the things I say are just annoying people, I feel like I am a canker everyone's existence and that people are better off without me.


As it's progressed I went from contemplating suicide once every few weeks to thinking about it everyday. I just feel like I am ruining everybody's life, including my own, if I don't. I cry for seemingly no reason because I don't want to tell people that I'm thinking about suicide. The thought of ending my life doesn't make me happy but life doesn't make me happy either. I don't even have a lot to be upset about; I have a good home life, I have a boyfriend that loves me, I got accepted into the college of my dreams but none of that seems to matter and it makes me feel worse.



I get really upset for what seems like nothing and I can't help it. The smallest piece of stress will cause me to jump straight into a suicidal mindset. I think about killing myself when I'm at school, at home, at work, in the car... Everywhere. I have written note after note trying to build the courage to just end it but I can't. So all I'm asking is that someone can give me some advice on how to tell my mom (I still live at home) because I don't want to hurt her but I also want to stop hurting myself by not getting help. I've been scared to tell her for too long and I need some help.
