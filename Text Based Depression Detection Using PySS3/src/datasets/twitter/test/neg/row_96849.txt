everyone would be better off without mei feel like a burden. my parents have openly said that I tear the family apart. you dont forget the words that confirm your worst thoughts, and my thoughts are that my family would be happier and better off without me. I have severe anxiety to the point where it affects my physical health drastically and that cycles with depression. 

I'm not planning on committing suicide, but for years I have always daydreamed about being killed. I pray someone will kill me one day so I can die without having to commit suicide. these thoughts have increased since I lost the person who was essentially my second father a month ago. I want to be with him. he was one of the only people I felt unconditional and constant love from.

I dont know why im posting this. maybe in hoping someone can relate. or maybe I just want it off my chest
