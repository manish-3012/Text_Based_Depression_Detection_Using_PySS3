1/17I was supposed to do it today. I said I wouldn't if things were "better." I don't know what defines better anymore. I don't think things are better. I think I'm just faking it. I didn't do it and I'm in a horrible mood. Every ounce of me is screaming and enraged that I'm still here. I don't know what to do. I've tried to elevate my mood. I can't. I don't want to be here.
