I want to give up on everythingFuck college, fuck work, fuck talking to people. I want to give up on everything. I want to fail all of my classes. I never wanted to do any of this shit in the first place anyways. I just knew I was the type of person who was meant to kill themselves because I just canâ€™t stand being alive. I hate all of the small and big aspects of life. Itâ€™s all just bullshit chores that I never asked for. Fucking done with this garbage world. Thereâ€™s only one person that Iâ€™m fighting for, without them I would have killed myself already. I love this person so much but having to live in this painful world is seriously taking its toll. I just wish I could live with this person in peace forever away from all of the bullshit.
