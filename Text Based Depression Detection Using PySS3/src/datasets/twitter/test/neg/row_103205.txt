i'm flunking out of my ivy league schooli'm a junior at my dream university...failed a class last fall because I was too depressed to get out of bed, now probably going to fail another class because I just couldn't get myself to do the work. i emailed my prof just before thanksgiving, he said I could make up the work, but I never emailed him back and now I don't know what would happen if I emailed him since the semester is over...if I do fail it, I have to take a year off of school, and I would have to tell my parents everything and lose my successful athletic career. i think they would put me in inpatient treatment for a very long time and I cant handle that...I've had suicidal thoughts for years, but this is the first time I actually think I might do it. my future is ruined. ill never get a good job with two f's on my transcript. i don't want to do it today or tomorrow but I feel like my time is running out...please someone help me figure a way out of this
