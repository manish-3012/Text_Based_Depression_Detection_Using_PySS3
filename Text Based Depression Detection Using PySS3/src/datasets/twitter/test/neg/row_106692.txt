Nothing is fun anymoreIâ€™ve just spent the past 5 days at a huge, incredibly fun amusement park. I screamed and laughed my ass off, and was excited to go on all the big rides and act like a four-year-old for a little while. It felt amazing to have that little rush of adrenaline spike through my chest as I was tossed from side to side like a rag doll, hung upside down, and spun in circles. I have arrived back today, and it has not been but about six hours and already everything is coming back. I think, â€œok, I went on all the rides. I had fun. Now what?â€ And I donâ€™t know now what. Is this what life is? Just a series of tiny, fun moments that get my hopes up only to be shoved back down again? Because honestly I fucking hate it. I hated going on all those rides because now everything is just worse. Now Iâ€™m so tired, and and have so much work to do, and I have no one to even help me or talk to. All I fucking want to do is die. Iâ€™m tired of drowning only to be pulled up for half a breath of air. It would be less painful to just be held under and never feel anything but death. Then I would have no choice but to do something desperate. Honestly, I hope I get worse. I hope I get so bad I canâ€™t even lift my phone. So desperate Iâ€™ll have no choice but to stab myself, or drown myself. Iâ€™m only alive because I donâ€™t have access to things like guns or pills or bridges. So fuck you fun. Fuck you happiness. Just let me be miserable in peace. Just let me die already.
