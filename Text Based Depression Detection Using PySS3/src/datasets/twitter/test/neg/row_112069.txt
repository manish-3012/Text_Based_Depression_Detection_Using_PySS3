Lost purpose, no feeling, no reason to live.My dad died, likely of complications due to end-stage lung cancer, very suddenly in his sleep a little over five months ago.  I'd made a silent agreement with myself years ago to be done living as soon as he was.  I watched his life fall apart professionally, emotionally, and physically.  Nearly everyone he cared about abandoned him and duped him in his most desperate times.  Divorce, layoff, betrayal--the works.  He was my best and only real friend, and now that I have no one to cook for, clean for, help support, and care for, there's really nothing left for me to do.  I quit my job yesterday, I threw away most of my stuff, and since I don't have a will or living trust, I wrote and mailed a check for my remaining liquid assets to my closest relative.  The rest of the details are small stuff.  Why shouldn't I close the book?
