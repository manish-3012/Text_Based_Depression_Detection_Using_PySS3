Everything is aganist meMy name is Ahmet i am 24 and i am Turkish person. Firstly i want to say i had an awful past (i mentioned it in reddit before but i dont want to bring it again ) I believe i had the worst childhood so it affected me a lot.

Now sometimes (actually 2-3 times a week ) i still feel awful and useless. I had no skill or purpose for living .Before saying find a dream for yourself i want to say that i had a dream just recently but it got destroyed by government economic failures ( i wanted to go university outside my country ) now even if i work 50 hour a day for 10 year i wouldnt even able to pay tutition fee for a semester on outside.

How do you deal when you feel everything is aganist you ? Everything was aganist me for 15 year and its still continues.

Also i sometimes got angry just because how stupid can persons be . As an example ;I feel so bad because my friend left me or My GF left me i want to die. Topics likes this makes me so much angry that i got headache from it. I wish my only troubles were something like this. I would prefer my gf lefting me rather than living 10 years alone. I hate to see people who dont know how people suffers from much more bigger things rather than stupid relations
