I wrote a suicide note todayI wrote my first suicide note. It was, well, depressing.

I've been thinking about it lately. I currently have no job, am broke and don't qualify for unemployment, living at home with my mum (who I hate and in a state that I've hated since we moved her when I was 5), my college degree is useless, I can't even get a job at Starbucks, and to top it all off, the person who I thought was like my best friend of nearly 7 years (he is my ex-boyfriend) just unfriended me on everything and is ignoring me without so much as a goodbye or an explanation. I have no idea how to make friends (I really only have maybe 2 now and both are back in my college town) or get into a relationship. On top of all that, I'm ugly. 

I'm just always sad. I feel this pain in my chest, it's tight and makes me want to claw my heart out. I just want to start over. Go back to the beginning or start fresh. I just want to stop feeling miserable all the time.
