Love... Resent...I love my kids more than anything.  For years they have been the single thing keeping me from killing myself.  I feel horrible admitting it, but a small piece of me resents them for keeping me from doing the one thing I've wanted to do for as long as I can remember.  Kill myself.  And it breaks my heart acknowledging that.
