Suicidal ideation.Is this the right subreddit for this? I'm not sure. I am not even sure if I want to read the other posts right now. I'm only reaching out because its difficult for my friends to understand. It's difficult for me to understand. And so it's even difficult for my doctor to understand.

I am currently not on medication. And have not been for a couple of years. Even when I was on medication the random thoughts never stopped. Things were just more peaceful in my mind then. Now it is not very peaceful.
