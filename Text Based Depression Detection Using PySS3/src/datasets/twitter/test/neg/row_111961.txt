i want outi have depression and social anxiety, and possibly adhd. i'm doing horribly in school and my parents are extremely controlling, and are abusive to the point that i definitely have stockholm syndrome for them. i want to kill myself, and i don't care if it hurts anyone. the teachers likely don't care, i don't have any friends, and my parents would just see it as a burden being lifted. but committing suicide seems like a cowardly way to go out, and my parents would hate me even more after i die, so i want to make it look like i died in my sleep. i don't have any pills or medicine so i can't overdose, and i don't have access to anything else that may poison me. the only thing i really have to live for is waiting for my favorite mangas to finish, but thats stupid, and i don't think i have enough strength to keep waiting for the chapters to keep releasing, i just want to do it already
