I hate that I canâ€™t kill myselfI just want to disappear. I donâ€™t want to die, I want to stop existing. Dying involves violently ending your life. And leaping into the void of death, not knowing what exactly will happen. I just want to stop existing and to be forgotten.

Iâ€™m stuck and I hate it so much.
