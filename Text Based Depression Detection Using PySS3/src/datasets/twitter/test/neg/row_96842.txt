Today is my birthday and Iâ€™m very very sadAll I can think about is how trapped I am, how little privacy I have and how little I can do about it right now. I failed school, I became a stoner who drives for Uber and I live with my mom, and just honestly have become the biggest loser ever. Sounds like a 30 something male? Well guess what Iâ€™m a 26F. 

My cat will be fine with my best friend, other than that my death would be a temporary discomfort to some but an ultimate comfort to all.

Maybe I could donate organs like seven pounds.
