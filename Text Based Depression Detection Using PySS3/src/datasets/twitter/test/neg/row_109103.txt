Please help or not, it's your choice.My problems would probably seem minor compared to all the people's problems, regardless I'm a selfish person and I still need help. I'm not good at anything; my grades were always average (A-B), I don't have any special talents. So why should an insignificant insect like me continue to exist?

In addition, I've always been ignored by several people and I have no friends or family member who would care about me so my death wouldn't be a burden for anyone. But I still don't want to die, I guess. I'm still grasping for hope in this life, but if there's no hope then please say it.

I know this all sound really childish and stupid so sorry if I've wasted any of your valuable time.
