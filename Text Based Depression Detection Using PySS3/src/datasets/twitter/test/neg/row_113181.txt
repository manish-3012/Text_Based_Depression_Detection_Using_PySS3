I have no hope left for myself and I want my death to have some kind of meaning so I'm going to publicly commit suicide as a means to draw attention to the plight of the disabled and mentally ill, where and what way would be the best to commit suicide in public to get attention for a cause?I'd also be interested in meeting up with others who would like to commit mass suicide to hopefully draw more attention or to at least have others there so we don't have to die alone.
