hit's unfortunate that the only way to get this jealousy and these dreams that wont happen in an instant like i want them to to go away is to die

i don't have a future. the earth is dying, i could die at any time, and in my religion it really is the end. i find it cruel that i was born with these burning desires, yet i or everyone else will die before i can ever reach them. 

im jealous of those people who were born right at the right time in the right country with the right connections and the right talent while i sit here and cry about it. anyone else would laugh at me, but i don't know how to make it go away. i miss last year when i was free from this. why wont it go away
