Help me survive on this "toxic" world filled with top of the natural selection human beingsI can't stand big toxic top of the natural selection groups. I can't follow celebrities online that much, I can't partake in e-world, big streamers gaming worlds are just social media freaks flaunting their bodies and making everything feel so good and big (even tho it's fake). Hollywood, fake boobs, rich people, toxic people all forms of people being able to live their life and handle toxic groups I just can't. I can't partake in anything real because  I as a inferior fatherless freak of a human being can't stand it, survive there so I have to avoid it. I can't partake in community due to my inferiority so I have to avoid all of it and just the accidental view of something dominant as cool, good looking people who are capable of accessing this world makes me wanna crawl under my bead. And everytime I am missing something from my life something that can only be accessed by partaking in this world or similar "toxic" world I will have suicidal thoughts so bad that if I see therapist I will get hospitalized.

As a kid - in orphanages adults there used to help me cope since they saw me as the person I truly was. They wanted to help me avoid these situations, offer me as little information as possible. Keep me in the dark. Help me by forming connection with me through sensitivity and sympathy. 

My last therapist told me to commit suicide. I obviously was triggered by this and ended up acting reckless so they had to detain me and hospitalize me for 4 days.

The way my gene pool has survived from the start was basically coping through religion and being really attractive. I am like super model. 6,4 feet and really really cute for a boy. That's part of why I never learned to do anything, be anything or adapt into life. People give you things automatically and spoil you when you are attractive. I have always deep down know that I can't survive - deep down I knew that I would never be enough. So I declined the automatic script I received everywhere. Where the big boobs but nice girl. Really nice girl not party freak would kinda like automatically with her confidence would choose me and then be with me. I couldn't be in that situation since I knew I would never be enough, I  avoided it. I avoided it since I knew that if I did that I would receive glimpse of the "toxic" real world, even if she was really nice. I have also feared that I receive same end as my mother who when I was 3 was beaten to death by other girls in a locker room when she was 24. And yes I do live in western society - it started out as bullying, and when she was dropped to floor one of the kicks accidentally crushed something vital in her neck and even tho the bullies called 911 immediately it was already done deal, she passed away.


My father on the other hand was 6,4 feet aswell (according to my grandma) knew that he was not capable of guiding child into the world but my fathers parents are very traditional, extreme right wing type people. Who believe life's goal is to have children and be married. So my father couldn't do the sensible thing and just leave, abandon me. But he also couldn't help me since he knew only reason he was born is because traditional values and being inferior human to stronger more capable beings. He hanged himself when my mother was 6 months pregnant.


Throughout my life I have yet to receive the bullying, the toxicity that my parents received due to me avoiding EVERYTHING in life. I have only been hit by sock with batteries one time in my life but other than that I have yet to receive anything real. Yet to receive anything my mother received during her short life. But is this really worth living? Is it really worth breathing if you don't live your life? Is it really worth to listen to your survival instinct if the only thing it leads you to is very unhappy, very boring very life that has nothing in it. What is the point of breathing if you can't live?


My goal is to try and make it in this world. Access into something real. Access into something real. I don't care if life handed me very good easy script with big boobs that other people are jealous of - I just wanna see if I can have sex with even ugly girl just as long as she is "cool", "toxic" and really fucking unbearable as dominant individual. It hurts so much, receiving so much shit. It hurts. But if I don't access anything from that world I always will feel like shit, I always have to avoid most threatening situations which for me are what other people call easy daily things.


I have given myself ultimatum - if I don't get into popular, top of the natural selection "toxic" group where I manage belong and make waves without being stabbed, bullied or anything like that by the end of 2010 July I will follow up on that therapists advice. 


Is there any tips? Any tips where I should start? I have been studying Hawk from Cobra Kai a lot and I definitely need to do something like that. If I dress like vanilla, behave like vanilla and don't smoke or do cocaine I will never be able to accepted into the cool world. I just need to find a way to access this world.

Lately I have been theorized that life's meaning is coping. Everyone has their own insecurities and maybe life's goal is to avoid things that make us feel like this and just do what the script tells us what to do. But whenever I am around big boobs girl who is nice I just don't feel anything. I will always feel inferior if I don't access this pure world even tho deep down I know that maybe these cool toxic people have their own insecurities at other parts of their lives that they have to avoid. I mean look at education system, basic 1st tier one. The goal is not to teach you complicated things, the goal is to introduce you to things - find out what you enjoy where your "talents" are and because the way life works you are more likely to enjoy doing things you are naturally gifted at. That's just guiding you through life. So I deep down know that I should be with that big boobs girl that is nice and sympathetic. But I just can't. I will always feel inferior, I will always feel bad. And it's very very very hard to avoid ALL the things "toxic" since everything is toxic. Supermarket, teen groups, drinking. I have to be able to access this world otherwise I won't be able to live. Maybe if I find access to this world, just once I can put it behind me and then accept myself as inferior human being that and be the person I am. But if I don't access it I just have hard time getting out of bed. I just can't do it.
