I want to commit suicide due to psychological abuse by parents and friends, am 15, grew up too fastI have been psychologically abused since the day i was born, parents put me down, kids made fun of me relentlessly becuase i was unnaturally small while the rest of my family would exclude because i was introverted. Now we have moved to a new country and its getting worse, mom and dad fight everyday and blame it on me, i know its not my fault but i feel like shit anyway so i have informed my best friend that i will be commiting suicide in one week and i dont really know how this subreddit works but i thought id post to inform people and to let out my frustration. Might seem petty but i honestly see no reason to live, maybe someone can help me.
