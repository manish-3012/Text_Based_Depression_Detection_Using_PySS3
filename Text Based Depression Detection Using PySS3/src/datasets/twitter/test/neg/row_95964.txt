Not belonging.This will get removed bc...

But I donâ€™t belong on this sub.  I came here after failing to get help over the last 30 years.  I was very actively involved in a huge variety of therapeutic pursuits.  For 30 years.

I have felt only brief periods of relief, but most of my life is such that I wish to not exist.  My mother always told me I WILL suffer more (in hell) if I kill myself .  Combined w intense fear of physical pain, I have been unable to achieve relief from decades of unrelenting suffering.

I keep looking for any type of understanding.  When Iâ€™m truthful here, I get censored (mostly around the right to end ones suffering IF it has lasted for decades, and IF one has tried every available treatment).

Each downvote and comment disagreeing with me causes me WAY too much pain.  

 But I keep returning bc I am DESPERATE for some human connection.  eventually I will realize that I will not find connection here, and I will go away.  Again.  Without support, understanding or help,

In the meantime, i need to pre-medicate with a sedative in order to read comments to my posts.   This is bc I am soooo emotionally broken/weak, that disagreement here and/or unwanted suggestions cause me a massive amount of pain.
YES - this is a sign of a major problem - that Iâ€™ve been unable to get help for - and I came to Reddit, as a last hope 

For the person who feels inclined to suggest I stop making such inciting posts - well, again , I am out of control and desperately need help.  Iâ€™ve been hospitalized a bunch and it never helps.

My insurance doesnâ€™t let me access proper therapy.

For those suggesting I try to make friends -  my misery makes other people miserable.  Iâ€™ve had many friends but they are all gone.
