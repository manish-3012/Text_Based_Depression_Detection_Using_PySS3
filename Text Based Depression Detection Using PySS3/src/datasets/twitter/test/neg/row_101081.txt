Killing Myself over Parent's FinancesI overheard my parents fighting today and heard that it is incredibly hard to support both my younger sister and me to go to university. I am currently thinking about killing myself and lying about my death in order to keep my parents from doing anything like giving me a funeral and saving that money for my sister. I have contemplated a bit in the past and attempted before, but I am now thinking about doing it in order to help them, not myself. The big question for me, is, "Should I kill myself to give my sister a better future?" Perhaps a single child would have been easier from the start, is my though process at the moment.
