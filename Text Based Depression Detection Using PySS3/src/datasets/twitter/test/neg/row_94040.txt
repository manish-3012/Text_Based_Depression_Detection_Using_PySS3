fuck people who ghost other people.fuck people who ghost other people. itâ€™s one thing to respond negatively to someone; itâ€™s quite another to simply not respond at all. I know from personal experience that you can never tell whoâ€™s teetering on the precipice, and if my mere acknowledgement of someone elseâ€™s problem is enough to keep them around for one more dayâ€”one more day in which they just might gain a little perspective, and find renewed strength/energy/motivation/drive to carry onwardâ€”then I think thatâ€™s a damn good thing. or at least, not a terrible thing, which is the alternative. even the most innocuous-looking outreach could be a cry for helpâ€”you could be the only human theyâ€™ve contacted all week. donâ€™t delude yourself into thinking everyone is for the most part living life just like you are, and that everyone should be able to take bullshit in stride because everyone gets it in manageable quantities. most every person whoâ€™s ever committed suicide likely had some insignificant-in-the-grand-scheme-of-things final straw, and my conscience dictates that I definitely donâ€™t want to be anyoneâ€™s final straw, so I put my best foot forward.

you could make the argument that itâ€™s completely outside your control, and anybody could do anything for any reason and thereâ€™s no way to plan for it. you could be following road law to a T and some idiot behind you is spazzing out behind the wheel and decides this is the day heâ€™s driving off that bridge. but I think some things have clear answers, and I think ghosting is one of those things. feel free to disagree
