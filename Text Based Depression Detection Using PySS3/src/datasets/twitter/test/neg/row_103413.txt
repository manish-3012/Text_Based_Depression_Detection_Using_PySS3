Ah shit here we go againEvery time I think I'm getting better something bad happens and fucks me up again.

I'm tired. This is too much.

I don't want to live in this world. People are cruel and they scare me. Nobody gives a fuck. Honestly I wish I didn't give a fuck either. 

I can't talk with anybody because:
0. They don't care.
1. They're tired of being my 'therapist'. 
2. They are dealing with their own problems.
3. They are in process of healing and I don't want to bother them and drag them down in this shit again.

I don't have enough energy to keep living by myself. 

I really wish I could give my life to someone who wants to be alive. 

And I also wish I'd never been born at all.

I'm lost.
