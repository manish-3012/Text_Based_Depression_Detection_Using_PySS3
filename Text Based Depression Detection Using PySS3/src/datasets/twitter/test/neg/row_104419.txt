Need someone to talk to...Hello everyone. Long time lurker and reader, first time poster. I have approached a suicide hotline just to talk, but didn't find it terribly beneficial. So here I am...

Right now I feel alright, but when my mind takes a dive I find myself thinking terrible thoughts and my body is drained of all energy. It has been happening more frequently as of late and is impairing my way of life. A bit about myself: graduated from college december of 2008 and moved back home just outside Detroit. Living in the Metro Detroit area proved difficult as I bounced around a few short term jobs with no sights of something more stable. I moved to DC and worked several jobs before landing a job in a hotel. I don't know what happened or why it happened, but my anxiety began to sky rocket around this time. I worked nights at the hotel and found myself to be terribly miserable and wanted to get out of customer service altogether. To cut the story short I jumped out of DC to pursue an opportunity in Austin as I thought I could do better there. Unfortunately the job was not given to me and I decided not to stay in Austin without a job secured. I am staying with an uncle in California for the moment but I have been hiding my feeling of despair, hopelessness and failure from him. I am applying to jobs in the Bay area but I have really exhausted myself by the search. 

At one point I was participating at a local improv theater and attempting to improve my writing. Gradually my mood changed and I found it increasingly difficult to get involved or even pick up a pen. I need to get back up but i continue to slip and am afraid where this may eventually end. 

Just wanted to talk it out. I want to be happy. I want to get back to pursuing my dreams. My mind says I am not capable of doing these things.
