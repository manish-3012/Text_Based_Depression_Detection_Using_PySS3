I feel that my death would benefit people more than it would hinder them**Lets look at the pros:**

I'm dead

They won't have to deal with me

I'm out of their minds forever

I won't have another chance to mess something up again

I won't have another chance to hurt people

My parents won't have to pay so much for therapy and meds

They'll only have one child (the one that isn't defective)

I can finally have some peace for once

Maybe she won't hate me as much anymore

I'm not going to be able to have more relationships with other people even if I am alive so what's the point

I can choose how I go out (yay personalization)

If there is a hell, I deserve it anyway

**Okay, now lets look at the cons:**

Mom might cry

No more chicken nuggets

........

Yeah, that's about all I can come up with
