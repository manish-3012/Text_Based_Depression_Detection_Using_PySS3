I'm doneMy mom talked to me tonight about how I've changed and I'm not what she wanted....she compared me to my brothers. But you know what shes not wrong, I have changed, im not the happy girl I once was, the one who wanted to hang out with my mom all the time, who was soical and loved myself. Now I'm an antisocial, depressed sack of nothing. I'm hurting my mom and all I want to do rn is end my life so I wont hurt anyone anymore...so my mom and everyone else wont have to deal with the disappointment I am. My mom started crying and the last thing she said was 'if i died I don't think you would miss me' that absolutely broke me...I love my mom, yeah our relationship rn isint the best but I still love her and would be so much more broken if she died. I can't do this anymore. Thie has put me over the edge and I cant handle it, I know suicide isn't the answer, I know it's wrong, I know that she loves me and that I might be hurting her and everyone else who loves me, I know this would be selfish of me but it seems like the only thing that would solve everything. Idk maybe I'm just not thinking straight and I need to just breath but then what? That's not gonna fix me and make me better, something else is bound to put me over the edge again anyways
