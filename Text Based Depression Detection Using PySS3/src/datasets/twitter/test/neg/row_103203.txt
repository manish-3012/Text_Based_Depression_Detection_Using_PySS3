stilli cna't even find a therapist who sticks around to help me even though i was ready i just tried to tell them i couldn't do it - talk about trauma - witout them being okay with contact between otherwise the trauma would be too real and then they withdrew that OF COURSE THEY TOOK IT AWAY when they never fully gave it anyway which was always part of the problem but i can't try this againnnnnnnnnnnn i can't try to get help again if it just makes me want to die because the trauma's too alive bcause they don't understand why it is even though it's about that need to be in contact even if it's 'not a good time' all the time and about not being at risk of losing something for just being honest. i just need it. I just do otherwise i panic and fall apart like now and then i can't function and my whole fucking life is at risk so why should i do anything but just die already when trying to ask for help kills me too because just like my abusers they want me to be invisble too then all there is to do is give up
