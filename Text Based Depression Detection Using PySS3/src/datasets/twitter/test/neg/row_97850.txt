I can't face another dayApologies for my ramblings, my brain isn't very clear at the moment. 

I'm a survivor of severe anorexia, I suffer from anxiety, depression, bouts of self harm, OCD and depression. 

A month ago, I got close to one of my guy friends, and he pretty much cheated on his girlfriend with me. I feel so guilty for it, but at the same time, if I could go back I would do it all over again. Now, he ignores me. 
I have bad trust issues. My last relationship ended so badly, I told myself never to get attached to anyone, unless I was 100% sure they werent going to break my heart. But I've got attached to this guy. It was meant to be a bit of fun, and now he won't speak to me anymore. 

I'm having severe anxiety attacks several times a day, self harming for being so stupid to develop feelings for this fuckboy. It sounds so stupid, but I can't get him out of my head. I feel like a teenager with a crush, but with this anxiety, its multiplied by 1000. 

For the past nine months, my anxiety has played up every two weeks, some times to the point where I can't go outside and can't psychically walk. 
I feel like I can't go on, living in fear that I'm going to take a panic attack at any moment. its exhausting. 

I had an appointment with my psychiatric nurse two days ago, but she wasn't there. I feel so hopeless. I see no future for myself at all. 

Will this get any better or am I just better ending this misery now?
