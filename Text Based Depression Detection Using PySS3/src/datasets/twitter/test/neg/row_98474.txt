I have been depressed for 8 yearsI am 17 year girl with a hearing impairment. Everyone says that I am an amazing person with an amazing personality. Every time I hear them say that to me, I just nod and say thanks. not nly do I not believe that, but they do not really know the life that I had. Being abandoned out in the cold at age 6, sexually abused by your own dad, sexually abused in 4 of the 7 foster homes, your own father holding you gunpoint, settling a knife to your throat while being duct taped to your brother, being kicked across the room when i was just a baby, having to go to 14 different schools, and so many other countless things. But here I am, with scars all over my arms, and my heart hanging on by a single string. I have been going to therapy for 8 years. But since my past has been so traumatizing, I am dealing withh severe depression and anxiety. I just had a major head surgery, not only did I wake up with my adoptive dad crying, but I found out that there was a deadly infection growing, and could not proceed with the surgery. I am trying so hard to stay positive, not let the depression take over again. I've had depression for 8 years, and still struggling with it today. I am not proud of it, but this is who I am. A side of me that no one knows about.
