Why live a life of sadness?I just got fired from my job, and it allowed me to reflect on myself for a bit. I don't really have a reason to live. No romantic interest, no real friends, no skills or talents, and now no job. My life is going to be nothing but sadness and mediocrity. So why live it out? Why not just stop now before I have to experience all that? I'll die at the end anyway.
