I'm scaredmy life has never been this bad, i have very few friends now, and making friends is near impossible. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, but i don't know how I'll do it. If I even can. I often lay in bed and think about my life, and what was the point where it started going downhill, I don't know what to do, and I've spoken to one of my friends about it, but played it off as a mental breakdown cause I felt scared after speaking about it, and I'm scared of getting help.
