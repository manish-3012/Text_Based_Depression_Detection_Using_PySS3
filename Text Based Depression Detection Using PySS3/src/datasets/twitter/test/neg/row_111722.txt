So, fun stuff.Seriously, if anyone can give me a reason not to do it that's worthwhile I'll consider it.

My wife is pumping breast milk about ten feet away while crying. Not because of the videos of our newborn daughter she's watching (it stimulates increased supply), but most likely because of me, and how I didn't do what I didn't know I had to do.

I have been diagnosed with aspergers, and on top of that I'm a military dude. I am the antithesis of sociable, likable or relatable. I don't know how I conned my way into lasting relationships but at this point I kind of regret it. 

I know you'll probably think, "..But your daughter!", and while you may be right, the pain of a fatherless childhood would ache from time to time, I think she'd be better off. 

Simply, the money involved is worth more than whatever bullshit I can spout from my mouth. I can tell you how they'd be more secure, how I wouldn't have to feel guilty about myself therefore creating a depressed, dark life for them but really it's money. 

That's what they need and want and I am four slices, one bullet or one aquatic toaster away from getting it to them.

And who would give a shit? Wife would be sad for the family at the wake but behind closed doors start deducting our debt from the payout to see what car she could get.

It's all pointless.
