Can someone just tell me they donâ€™t want me to die?Whenever I talk about suicide, my parents tell me to just do it already, and itâ€™s really taking a toll on me. 

Even though itâ€™s not true because you donâ€™t know me, can you just indulge me and lie to a stranger on the internet and help?

Wow, this feels so much more sad and desperate than I expected it to...I just kind of feel like hearing (or reading) that I shouldnâ€™t will help, I donâ€™t know anymore...
