Old notesThis is just something to get off my chest I suppose. 
I remember writing various suicide notes to various people in my life at different parts of my life. Its always been a looming thought in my head ever since high school, even graduating from uni a few years ago these thoughts have stuck. and always I'd write notes at different stages of my life out of preparation. Its not that I want to I just feel like this is just another way death takes people, just like car crashes, accidental overdoses,  heart attacks, natural death, I've starting seeing suicide as a inevitable way to die unexpectedly.

Really i want to enjoy life a bit more before i let it take me and when it does i want people to know i loved them to not be sad but remember that even i tried my hardest til that point to laugh and make people laugh and be there for others, to try my hardest to be kind, until i was suicides next victim.
