I can't do thisI'm so overwhelmed I can't think straight. I'm so fucking useless and my future has gone to shit. All I want is someone to hold onto, to give me a hug and tell me that they appreciate me. Nobody loves me though. All my friends scoot away from me when I sit by them, and when I'm crying out for help they laugh and mock me for giving up my tough shell. All I want is a friend. Just one hug, or one "good job" would be enough, but I can't get that. Instead I'm met with chants about how stupid and lazy I am. At this point I am sure that I am going nowhere useful in my life. I could do it tonight. They keep guns downstairs and the lock is broken.
