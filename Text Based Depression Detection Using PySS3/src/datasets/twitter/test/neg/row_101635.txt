I need helpYesterday was the anniversary of my best friend killing himself. 

Two weeks ago I spent hours and hours talking to my friend about his suicidal thoughts, despite it triggering my own issues. 

Iâ€™m completely overwhelmed with life. 

I am a first responder with ptsd. 
I have a back injury. 
My house is being sold. 
And my wife revealed to me this week she regrets getting married and has feelings for another man. 
I kicked her out last night. 

I donâ€™t know if I can take it much longer
