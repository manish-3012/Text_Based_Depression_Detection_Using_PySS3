Why do I feel this way?I slit my wrists and just watch the skin pull apart from itself like pulling dough. But I don't feel like stopping. I don't want to. So why am I posting here? I don't know maybe I want a miracle, even though I don't believe in them. I must have some inherent need to stay alive, and I resent that. I don't know what to do, I don't know anything anymore. I'm so uncertain of everything. Maybe I'm mad, maybe I'm not. I can't tell, never could decide what I want to be at any given time.
