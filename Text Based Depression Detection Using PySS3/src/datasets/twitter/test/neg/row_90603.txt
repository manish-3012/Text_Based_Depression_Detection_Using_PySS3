I have about a 14 hour window to deside what I'm going to doI have 3 friends, one is my ex, one I have known for years but she seems to only like me in a romantical sense and isn't talking to me now that she's dating, and one that is genuinely a very good person and a friend but rarely looks at her phone and is moving abroad this summer. I live alone with my cat. Yesterday, my ex told me she is blocking me for atleast a month so I can "think about my actions". I haven't had attempts for about 6 months, but yesterday and today have been really tough after that. The 2 other friends arent answering and family is no help (Aka: say Im looking for attention). I don't want to leave my cat alone because she wouldnt have anyone to feed her for most likely weeks since I dont get visitors. Tomorrow, in about 14 hours some workers are coming over to do some renovations on my apartment, so I could make sure my cat isnt left alone.
