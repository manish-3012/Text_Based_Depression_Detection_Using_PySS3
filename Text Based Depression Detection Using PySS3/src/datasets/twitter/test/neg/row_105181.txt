Looking for someone to talk to, about anything.The last year of my life has been a downward spiral that has left me at the bottom. Thinking about nothing but just offing myself and being done with it, and no one has any idea. Any of my close friends I've pushed away completely, deleted facebook and instagram and everything else that makes me socially active. Girlfriend of 4 years cheated on me 4 months ago, but I was depressed before that happened and that didn't help. Lost my job. 24 and have more debt than anyone I know. No car. No license. Shit job with shit pay, trying to make a dent in my mountain of debt that plagues me. Nothing makes me remotely happy anymore. There's a lot more, but I don't want to rabble on too much so no one reads any of this. Just looking for someone to bullshit with about anything.
