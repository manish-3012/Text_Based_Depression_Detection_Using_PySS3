Finding it hardSome background: I've dealt with depression and anxiety for most of my life and have been hospitalized for both before. I'm still young (22) and attempted suicide by slitting my wrists a few months back. I failed (obviously) but haven't told anyone about it. 

The idea of death is the only thing keeping me happy right now and I'm finding it really hard to keep myself alive. I want to do something, anything, to disrupt the daily trudge of depression and anxiety. I was thinking of going to the beach for a bit, saying bye to everyone, and driving my car off the side of an embankment at the end of this week. Even if I survive, I'd at least be doing something. 

Help?
