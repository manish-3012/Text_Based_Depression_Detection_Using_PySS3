Iâ€™m about to drop out and quit my jobI already have one degree so at least Iâ€™ll have more than just a high school level education, but for now I just want to work full time instead of having to balance both. I have a test tomorrow and I havenâ€™t studied at all. These upper level math and science courses just go way over my head. I guess I really am dumb. But whatever, maybe Iâ€™ll find my calling someday. Maybe I can become a writer or something (not). Iâ€™ll probably go back to finishing up a bachelorâ€™s degree some other time, but I canâ€™t do it right now.

It sucks because Iâ€™m either going to have to admit myself to a loony bin or go to therapy so I can avoid having to pay the balance from the withdraws. Theyâ€™ll excuse it if I can just prove Iâ€™m mentally ill and shit, I wonâ€™t have to pay a single cent. I just canâ€™t do it anymore.
