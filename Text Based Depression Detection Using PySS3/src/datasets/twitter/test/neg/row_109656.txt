hellohello i am from the philippines and new to reddit. i like to talk about what i feel so i came here to see how others were doing. i dont know what community reddit has and i dont know if this will genuinely help me but whatever.

i just wanted to talk about your opinion on social media as a whole, because every single dipshit is seeking attention on social media and is seeking to be wanted, yes i get that, but in order to become accepted they have to shit on others to achieve it.

i live in the philippines where cyberbullying is really big and i want to admit now that yes, i am a loner, but i wasnt back then. to cut to the chase, i was unfriended by a lot of my 'close' friends on facebook because people in my school hated me. they removed me so that their social status would go up because yes, i am a loser. my family is torn apart by problems and i am always in my room alone especially since were in lockdown and i only go outside if i want to eat. my academics are failing because i have a hard time learning, i am a fat lonely ugly ass mf right now with no friends except for my 2 neighbors. i want to change my life and improve but i see no will to do it.

what made me talk about this today is that my dog died yesterday night and i have had news that i am going to be dropped out from school. i already knew i was graduating without any friends but to be dropping out is something else.
