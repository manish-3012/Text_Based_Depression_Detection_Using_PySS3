Canâ€™t stop telling people I want to dieI know it makes people uncomfortable, but I canâ€™t stop. I recently had someone lecture me on how awful it is and how upset it makes them, and I feel so horrible for making a friend feel like that. I can feel people drifting away from me and I know itâ€™s at least partly due to that, but I just canâ€™t stop. I canâ€™t stop joking about it, mentioning it, just wanting to die. I know Iâ€™m going to make everyone hate me more than they already do by doing this, but Iâ€™m addicted :/
