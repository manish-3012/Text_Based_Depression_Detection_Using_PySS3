someone please talk to memy girlfriend broke up with me because iâ€™m too much. my best friend just told me sheâ€™s done with me because she canâ€™t keep supporting someone whoâ€™s so sad all the time. my own mother told me that she doesnâ€™t want to talk to me anymore. i just want support &amp; peace. and iâ€™m struggling to find a way to get there without just ending it.
