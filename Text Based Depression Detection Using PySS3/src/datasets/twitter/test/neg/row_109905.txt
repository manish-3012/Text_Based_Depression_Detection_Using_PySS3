I am tired of lifeI am fed up with my daily life. What's the point anymore? I don't have any ambition or goals. I hate to go to school. I don't wanna go their to study Btw I m 17 yrs. I neither have the desire nor courage to continue living. It will be great if I drop dead any moment. Eventually everyone will die so it doesn't matter if I die 2 or 3 decade earlier. Only watching Anime is keeping me alive. I really feel like a piece of shit. 

Now to the main topic, I want to know about the best way to commit suicide without any chance of survival cuz if I survive it would be extremely pathetic.
I would like to ask of you not to try convincing me, I have made my mind. I have lived enough. Just tell me what's the best way to kill my self. I would appreciate if you all suggest of painless methods but as long as I am guaranteed to die I don't mind if I had to suffer.

I might have thought to live if only I have nice people like you all.

Thank you all.
