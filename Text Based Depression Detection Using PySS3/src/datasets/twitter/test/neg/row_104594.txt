my mind only obsesses over dyinglike the title says, i have become completely consumed with dying. i have been fighting suicidal thoughts from a young age and for a while i felt like i had a bit of hope, but now, all i think about is actually killing myself. i want to do it so badly. i have a plan and i have already started taking the steps in order to get the plan going. 

iâ€™m so depressed, iâ€™m about to be laid off, my marriage is in pieces, iâ€™m not in love anymore, i am nervous/afraid/angry/miserable. i donâ€™t have enough money for therapy or to be out on my own, but enough to pay a couple bills and to afford basic necessities. i have a severe eating disorder and i abuse pills. i feel like such a failure. i feel like my life is going no where and i canâ€™t even imagine making it to my next birthday. 

everything feels like a fog, like a very disconnected fog. i feel so distanced from everyone, but in a way that iâ€™m having an out of body experience and looking in. 

i obsess with how my heaven would be like. i daydream about it every day. i write about it every day in very extensive detail. i chase after that utopian dream and i become even more sad that itâ€™s not my reality. 

i really am thinking about ending it all soon. like i said, iâ€™ve already taken some steps. i just want to live in my dream world.
