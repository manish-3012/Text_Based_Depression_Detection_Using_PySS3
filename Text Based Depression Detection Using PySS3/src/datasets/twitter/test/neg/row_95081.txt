I guess I should just dieSo Iâ€™ve been feeling a bit better for the last week. I didnâ€™t cry at all and didnâ€™t self harm or even think about ending my life. But then I had a bunch of dreams about traumatic past experiences and now Iâ€™m back in this mood again and I feel like I canâ€™t even express myself clearly because people around me think Iâ€™ve gotten â€˜betterâ€™ but I guess this is a sign that itâ€™s never actually going to go away and everything that happened this week was a distraction. I just need to go kill myself now
