Starting to feel like the only reason I stay alive is to not upset others, but itâ€™s so exhaustingI think about suicide, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d do it because Iâ€™m pretty close with my family and I know theyâ€™d be absolutely devastated. But maaaannnn, Iâ€™d love to get terminally ill and then die. Everything is too much. Too much drama, to many commitments, too many expectations, too many beautiful highs followed by heart-crushing lows. This ride is too much for me. Iâ€™m too weak...  Iâ€™d like to get off now, and hope the next life is more blessed than this one.
