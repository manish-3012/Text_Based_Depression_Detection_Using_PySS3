I didn't know I was pregnant until it was too late.Hello. I've been here before, in a much darker place, but not really willing to die. Now that I'm actually planning on killing myself, and the world seems ironically so much cheerier than it was then.  


I was a virgin until college. When I lost it, we tried to be as safe as possible, but it seems like I wasn't careful enough. I didn't catch the symptoms until it was too late. I have an ultrasound soon, which will be the determining factor on whether or not I have to kill myself. I've written out my will and my final words, and while I haven't entirely given up as a teeny glimmer of hope, I know in my heart that I'll be pulling the trigger in a week or so.  


I've been extremely fortunate in my life. I always felt like it was undeserved, and that I would fuck it up somehow. It's weirdly cathartic to be right. I scraped by into college somehow, with a massive scholarship I don't feel like I deserved. If I have this kid, my college will revoke all of that, and all careers possible for me disappear.  


I love this world. I wanted to make it a better place, to show people how much they deserve happiness and love in their lives. I suppose that's what taking responsibility for your actions is, isn't it? I didn't want to leech off my family by being a disappointment. It's better to end it quickly for me, even if for the first time in my life, I actually felt in control of everything, and like everything held promise.  


I love my family, I love my friends. I hope death is empty. I know they will miss me, but I miss them too. I'll miss them so, so much.  


If anyone has any practical advice, you can put it in the comments if you want. That's okay. But I've accepted the situation I'm in, considered all possibilities. I just wanted to tell someone, because my family isn't going to know the real reason why I killed myself.
