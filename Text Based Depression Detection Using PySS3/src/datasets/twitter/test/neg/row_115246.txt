I feel suicidal about everythingEspecially in today's political climate.  I am angry and depressed that our government wants to shrink and privatize our national parks, jobs are getting harder to find and pay less money, college is super expensive and I can't even concentrate on my hobbies anymore.  I feel like life is nothing but struggle, except for the very rich.  It just seems like everyone wants to dominate nature and each other and no one is content.  I really want a job to help me feel more worthwhile and like I am contributing to society.  But it just seems like everyone likes machines better then people anyway.
