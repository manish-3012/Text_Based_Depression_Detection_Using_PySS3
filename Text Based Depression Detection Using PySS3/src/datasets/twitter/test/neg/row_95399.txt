I'm not sure what to doHey Guys, I hope that you can help me work out some of these feelings I've been having. I recently graduated from a top-10 college where I was the happiest I've ever been. I had plenty of friends, the most amazing girlfriend, and was legitimately enjoying life.

Now I'm attending a medium-caliber law school and I deep down I'm miserable. My girlfriend left me to "try new things," my friends from college are spread out all across the country, and I am surrounded by idiots. I have a few friends at law school but no one I can really connect with, and certainly no one I can have any kind of serious conversation with.

I'm not really certain when exactly I started to feel this way but for the past few weeks I've seriously considered at least a dozen different ways to kill myself. I'm not sure if I actually want to go through with it (I would break my parents' hearts) but the fact that even when I'm at the bar my thoughts are about my ending my life as opposed to the conversations happening around me.

I've tried working out, drugs, alcohol, talking to people, even traveling around to go see my college friends but nothing seems to help me shake these feelings. I feel like the next few years, if not more, of my life are destined to be predominantly miserable and I'm looking for an escape.

So here's where I'm hoping you'll come in. I really don't want to start taking any medication but I was hoping that you guys would be able to give me something, anything, that can help me turn myself around. 

Thanks in advance for your help
