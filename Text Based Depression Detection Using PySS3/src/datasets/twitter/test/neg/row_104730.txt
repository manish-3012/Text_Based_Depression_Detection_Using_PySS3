Most people are terrible, selfish, ego driven. Reddit has the worst of the worst and people live to invalidate you.You cannot even express your pain here without being attacked, blamed, insulted, downvoted and otherwise made worse so someone else feels big, better, smarter, stronger. IRL people are mostly like this and a long life has proven it to me...here its more concentrated and horrible people are legion. These people and the damage they caused are why I tried to kill myself, and why it will happen again. Every single time I have bared my soul under any account or format it's been largely people being terrible. The few good souls or occasionally ignored or minimally shitty posts are not common. People ruined my life...and people will kill me.
