out of breathi only have 2 days left until I get my paycheck and buy a gun but just sitting with myself right now hurts so fucking bad. it's so far away. if I don't stop crying soon I think I'm going to die from dehydration or something before we even get to tuesday lol. 

i've been seeing an amazing therapist for like a year and a half now and all i can think about is how much of her time and energy I've wasted with my flip-flopping over whether I want to get better, and then I wind up doing this anyway. I hope this doesn't retract from the appreciation I've tried to express, because I did and still am really grateful for being given a chance. this guilt is so gut wrenching I almost want to write her an apology but I know that wouldn't change anything.

 it has been taking everything in me to not go drive into a tree or something right now but I think I'm just going to keep taking trazodone until I wake up and there's money in my bank account lol. whatever. thanks for reading
