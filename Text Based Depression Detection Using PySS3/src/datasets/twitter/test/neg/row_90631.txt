Want to die most days.  Most others want me to die, also.So, here's a post to a place where people tend to try and stop others from thinking about suicide as their option.  What do you do then, if someone brings up something that everyone considers so evil, that you think that person should die?  I'm pretty sure I have this problem.  You see, I'm attracted to little girls.  I've never harmed one in my life, but it's almost all I think about, unless I can manage to distract myself for a few moments by doing something else.  There's no one to talk to about it, because anyone who would understand wouldn't want to talk about it, because they already feel the same way.  No idea if this message can be traced or not, but hard to care when you haven't done anything, and it's just something you think about, all the time, every day, day after day.  And you know at least half the world wants you dead about as much as you want to die yourself.  I know it's something I'm never going to be able to have or experience as well, which makes it worse for the way I feel about it.

So what does anyone have to say or do for a monster that wants to die, besides handing them a gun to help them along?
