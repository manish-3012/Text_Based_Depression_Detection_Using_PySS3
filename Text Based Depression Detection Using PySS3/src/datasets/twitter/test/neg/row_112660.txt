I'm sorrySo I don't know if I belong here or if I'm just over reacting 

This is a throw away account as I can't let it get back to me or anyone I know 

You need to know

1.I'm transgender (mtf) I have been on hormones for nearly a year

2.I have a boyfriend we've been together for about 4 months

3.I have a massive amount of dysphoria down there between my legs anal sex if fine and I love it but stay away from that bit

4. I have told my boyfriend no.3 multiple times I told him when we first met

5. This started 3 weeks ago

Ok we were in bed together and well he wanted to have some "fun" I was asleep he woke me up by grabbing down there and started to move his hand doing things that a guy would probably like

I woke up pretty fast but I had no energy to do anything (I'd just finished my work week and he woke me up after only about 2 hours of sleep) other then weakly try and move his hand

This goes on for probably half an hour before he stops at that point I curled into a ball and started crying

He tried to hug me and was saying he didn't care I had that part and he was just trying to make me feel good

We stop having sex I tell him it's my meds as I thought that's what it was

Fast forward to yesterday I was talking to a co worker I don't even know how we got onto this topic but I told her 

She got really angry at him and told me that was rape or at the very least sexual assault 

I get home and can't stop thinking about it now she's said that

 I don't know what to do
