Self destructionIs it just me or am I losing my mind? I've been here before that whenever I feel depress, I want to further just destroy myself just so I could finally have the strength to just end it. I don't know, the longer I live, the more I just spiral down. I've already thought of some way to be sure that I'd really end it all. It feels like I just wanna go even further down so that it just ends. I am aware of a thing called self fulfilling prophecy, but it feels like I want to use it against myself. I'm sorry, maybe I just needed to get this out of mind here.
