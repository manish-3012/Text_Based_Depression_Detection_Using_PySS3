I just want to cry out a bitA couple of things before I start:

* My native language isn't english so if something doesn't really make sense thats why.
* This is my first post on this subreddit and I don't have a lot experience when it comes to writing a post.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I don't think live is forth living. You always have the same boring day. Nothing good and new ever happens and somehow that should make you happy.
2. My parents bought me a 2100â‚¬ gaming computer near the end of February this year. About 3-4 weeks after that my depression started and I wasn't feeling or motivated to do anything since that. Even things I loved to do. And now I fell bad because I didn't use my gaming pc as I should.
3. I fell like may not be depressed because my parents are REALY nice, we have no financial worries and own big really nice house and a forrest.
4. I went from normal life to suicidal in 4 months and I'm only 13 years old
5. I don't want to tell my parents not because they don't care but I fear they would overreact.
6. I want to kill myself so badly but I don't have a way to do so:

* Hanging or cutting myself: too painful
* poisoning myself with meds: we barely have any
* shooting myself: my parents don't have a gun
* lying on the rails and waiting till a train comes: there are no pieces of the track on which you would not see me nearby.
* Jumping of a building: There aren't any tall buildings nearby

7. Even if there was a way I probably don't have the guts to do it
