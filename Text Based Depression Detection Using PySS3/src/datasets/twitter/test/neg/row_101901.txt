I think Iâ€™ll be dead by the end of the yearI feel so worthless and used. Everythingâ€™s been going wrong and no one in my life really understands and just tells me to man the fuck up or they give me some shitty speech saying itâ€™ll get better. Iâ€™ve been told that so many fucking times for years and literally it only gets worse. Iâ€™m such a fuck up and Iâ€™m so stressed with all the shit in my life going on that I really think Iâ€™ll have to end myself by the end of the year. Iâ€™m gonna feel real shitty on thanksgiving because I think thatâ€™s the last time Iâ€™ll spend actual time with my family but oh well, thatâ€™s on them.
