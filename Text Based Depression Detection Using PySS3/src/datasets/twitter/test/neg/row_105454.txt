I don't want my kids to remember me as a depressed loser, but I don't know how much more I can take... I'm exhausted..Long story short my wife hasn't loved me for years, left me, I have 3 kids, 3 diff women, soon-to-be 2 divorces.

We've been separated for months but were supposedly working on things when I found her OKCupid account amongst a bunch of other shady shit and ended it. Immediately she started dating and in a hurt state I snitched on her friend for cheating. This was weeks ago...

After begging her for weeks and working my ass off at my job and with the kids I got her to agree to give me one last chance thinking she already knew about the snitching. Apparently she didn't and literally the first date we've had in weeks was great but ruined by her friend messaging her about what I said (apparently she intercepted the message).

Her friend and I talked all night and are good buddies now. She totally understands what happened and why it happened, but wife is pissed. My *last* chance to prove myself to her was topped off with this bomb that had laid dormant for weeks.

Now I'm on babysitting duty while my wife runs off to some fucking hippie concert with her lesbian buddy (who gives her "massages" - wife has lesbian past/tendencies too) and her handsome neighbor (who she drinks with every night) whose Facebook wall is litered with the dead bodies of sluts he's one-night-stood for years begging him for attention.

She said I can go but doesn't want to drive with me and is going to sleep in the lesbian's tent. That is, I can fuck myself and do whatever I want because she doesn't care.

She thinks I'm stupid and oblivious to everything and just trust that everything is going to be okay. I'm not. I don't... I'm just powerless. I love her and have loved her for years while she's done shady shit like this...

I've been in psych wards several times in the past, once for a suicide attempt (bottle of depakote, friends called ambulance when I started having seizures) and have a long history of depression.

It seems like everyone I've ever loved has cheated on me and I don't know how to be happy on my own.

I can only ignore being walked all over for so long before depression starts creeping in, and it's been... creeping in. It's here again and I'm scared...

It's really hard to work to pay all the bills, raise 3 kids at least half the time, and watch the person you love dance around your heart while fulfilling their desire to be free.

I would've never put up with this much shit if I didn't have so much baggage. I would've been brave and told her she's being a fucking monster and moved on... I think she senses my weakness and capitalizes on it like some sadist. Why can't she just fucking love me?

I'm terrified once the depression fully hits I'm going to turn into a shitty father who just stares at the wall like I usually do when the depression fully hits. I've been a great father - especially lately - and I really want the kids to remember me as that. I don't want them to remember me as some psychopath that just stared at walls for months before ending it..

At this point I've been trying to keep these thoughts out of my mind, but they're pretty constant now and it seems like a better and better idea almost every day. If I ever get hopeful about anything, it's immediately taken. No matter how hard I try. No matter how long I try. Everything. Everything is just taken...
