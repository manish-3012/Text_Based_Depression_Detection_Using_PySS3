I just wrote a list of reasons of why I should kill myself.I stopped myself after getting past 20.

I'm in high school. inb4 "just an edgy kid", because I'm 16. I've battled with depression and social anxiety all my life. I have no talents, no career prospects, no hope, no friends... I'm ready to give in and just do it.

If I can be given one good reason not to off myself here, tonight, then I won't.
