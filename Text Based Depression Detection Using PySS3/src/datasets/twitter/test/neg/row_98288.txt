What pills shouldn't I take?I know the title sounds wrong but let me explain. I am always in pain, one way or another, so I always take over the counter medicine and I take a lot together (yes I know you shouldn't but I do it anyway) and I know that I may accidently take some medicine together that might be bad for me, and I'm already struggling so I'd probably let it happen. I'm trying to recover, but I know myself too good, so what shouldn't I take just to be safe?
