Back to my old waysI never cut  myself, because I always thought that it would just scare everyone, so what I did was trained for muay thai as usual except without my arm wraps and any protective gear so I could get attention from people even though they didn't really know the truth of why I got my limbs bruised up badly and my knuckles swelling up.
"It was all training," I told em and it was enough.
That was then and now I just smoke in a quiet place, but it isn't enough anymore.
