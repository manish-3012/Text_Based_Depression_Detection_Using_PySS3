Getting help (what do I even do?)So, throughout high school I saw a few therapists, was on medication for a bit, and generally maintained a schedule sort of treatment for my depression and anxiety. Around senior year, I got super busy and was feeling pretty okay so I weened off of therapy. 

Now, I'm done with my first semester of college and I feel like a complete Trainwreck and have no clue what to do really. I see a counselor at my university, but there is a 16 session per year limit and I think I need more stable options, plus maybe another shot at medication. I really would prefer not talking to my parents about this for various reasons, so how would you guys recommend I go about finding treatment on my own. I don't have a job but I do have health insurance through my parents. I'm very confused about the "adult" world of medical expense, so any advice or help is welcome. I just really, really need help.
