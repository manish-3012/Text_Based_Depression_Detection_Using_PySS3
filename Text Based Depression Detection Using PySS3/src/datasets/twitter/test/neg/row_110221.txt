One reason why I shouldn't kill myselfDon't tell me that I am needed or loved or anyone would fucking miss me. I have no friends, no one has liked my my whole entire life. I'm overweight I have bad acne I can't keep a job at  23 barely graduated high school 2 years later than I was suppose to cause I'm fucking stupid. I hate my family I hate my living situation I hate myself. No matter how many times I try to better myself to look better or to fit in it just backfires and ruins my fucking life. People just fucking lie To me and use me. I hear "oh you're pretty shut up" all the time but don't you say that to people just to be genuinely nice? My boyfriend hates me we can't ever work out, I need someone to just tell me how to fucking end my life. I'm honestly done. Ive beeen wanting to kill my self for so long now, I just don't know how to successfully do it. I willl do whatever it takes just make sure I don't wake up.
