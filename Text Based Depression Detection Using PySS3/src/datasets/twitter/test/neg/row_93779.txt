How do you tell your loved ones you donâ€™t want to live anymoreIâ€™ve been down this road. 5 years ago when I was almost 17 I attempted to end my life and I failed. Iâ€™ve been living with depression since and nearly attempted 2 more times since. Iâ€™m not even sure what to do anymore but idk if I can keep doing this. I know that I should tell my family but how? Iâ€™m scared to hurt them again.
