I just want to die without it affecting anyone. Can you prepare loved ones for that eventuality?I have a plan, but I donâ€™t want my parents being shocked/surprised/sad when they find me. I just want then to accept itâ€™s best for me and find peace with that. Their lives would genuinely be better without me. How do I convince them of that?
