On the edgeI think about it alot. My relationship is always up and down. I have few goals in life, and I feel directionless. I drink alcohol on occasion, even though it's usually no help. I'm often on the edge of doing it. Is living even worth it? I'm not sure whether to feel sad or angry. Deciding whether to follow through or not is always so difficult, and it tears me up inside.
