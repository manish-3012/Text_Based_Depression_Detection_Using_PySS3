I'm out of excuses.I'm a college junior studying economics, and have been struggling with depression since I was in 10th grade. I've been debating on whether or not to post here for a while.

I think about killing myself on a daily basis...I can't walk through the city without seeing all of the opportunities to do it. The only thing that's been holding me back are my student loans. Any other issue or reason I've been able to solve on my own or has worked itself out. My mom wouldn't have a way to really pay them back...but today I figured out how I could get around that issue. I don't even know why, but I was studying for a calc midterm in the library and it just came to me.

I could honestly cry right now, I just feel...so relieved. I don't even really know why, but I had to tell someone, anyone. It's surreal- unlike anything I've been feeling for a long time now.
