i fucking hate youi was healing and working on getting better and you came and ruined it. every single one of you. i regret ever feeling sorry for you because this shows that you don't have any emotion for anyone else but yourself. what a pathetic selfish piece of shit you guys all are. i want to kill myself. i can't even work at my job anymore. i can't pick up the phone without wanting to cry i can't hide it anymore. i'm not happy, i'm not sad and i am not angry i'm empty. i'm so fucking empty that i don't know who i am anymore, my soul is gone it's left my body. the only thing i can do is cry to feel anything anymore. i give up. you ruined my life because yours sucks and you won't do anything about it but instead you just immerse yourself in your own self pity and manipulate others to feel sorry for you. you get enjoyment from ruining other people's lives, while i'm done with mine.
