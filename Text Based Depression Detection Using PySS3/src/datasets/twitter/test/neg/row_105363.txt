Thoughts won't stop and feel like my life is going to shitI am overly stressed about everything in my right now, I'm not looking to kill myself but the thoughts and ways of looking to kill myself won't stop. I just need someone to listen because I'm too scared of admitting this to my friends and family. My life is going to shit, and sometimes I feel like I'm overreacting. I may not graduate high school because my community service hours keep getting rejected and I don't have enough to graduate, that might cause me not to be able to go to prom with my friends, and it makes me feel like shit because I keep comparing myself to my friends. They are smart, in all AP classes, going to good colleges after school. Then there's me, mediocre and no plans for my life. I don't even have a fucking license because my dumb ass can't learn to drive and keeping a job is a nightmare because I fuck up everything and get fired as a result from it. I feel worthless because of all this and now i'm stuck and depressed. I already suffer from anxiety and panic attacks so it amplifies all my problems 10x more.
