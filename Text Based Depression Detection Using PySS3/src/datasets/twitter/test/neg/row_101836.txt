It just hit me that I can kill myself. I've been burned out for a long time now. I really am not interested in anything anymore. I don't like people, eating, tv, reading. I really hate being alive. I've been extremely depressed now since the late 90's. 

Today is the first day I've felt happy in years. I can't even remember the last time I was happy. It just hit me that since I don't have any family that I could just kill myself and nobody will care. I felt like there was no way of advancing to a different place but now I know I can. 

I've never felt this happy. There's a way out.
