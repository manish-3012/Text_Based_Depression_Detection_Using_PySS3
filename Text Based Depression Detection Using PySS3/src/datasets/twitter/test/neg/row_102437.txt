Effects on family and friends of suicideRight now, I've made up my mind to go. I don't have a problem with it. Death doesn't scare me in the slightest. I've accepted it, and I have a date, a plan, and two backup plans in mind. 

The only thing that's making me question my decision is what kind of impact this might have on my family. My mom told me it'd be selfish of me to take my own life, but isn't that hypocritical in that she wants to keep me around for her own "selfish" reasons? I know that my friends don't give a damn: out of the six I've confided in, all six have faded away. It sounds like a naive question ("well, duh, they'd be devastated!"), but I'm interested in any personal insight anyone might have to offer.
