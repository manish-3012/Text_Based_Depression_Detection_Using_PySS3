In a very dark place and wildly lonelyIm a 20 year old male and in one of the darkest places I have ever been.  I have no friends, no one to hang out with or call or play video games with. Virtually all I do, other than work, is sit in my room and listen to sad music.  I am depressed and do not find amusement in things that I used to.  I have had girls at work show interest in me and talk to me, but I feel like I always drive them away with my incredibly bland and monotone responses-- even though I am interested, I guess I am just not socialized.

I live with my parents and 2 siblings.  My siblings are no more than just housemates, I never talk to or interact with them-- they have completely different interests and I feel weird and awkward initiating stuff with them because we have never hung out or shared interests or got along well at all quite frankly.  I am not even on speaking terms with my mother.  She is so self-centered and the least empathetic person I have met.  I was supposed to go on vacation next week.  I have a diagnosed condition called paruresis, it is basically extreme bathroom shyness. I need to stop at more private, less busy bathrooms on roadtrips.  She asked my not to go-- because my accommodations would cause her stress and inconvenience. She has never understood this issue-- which has drastically affected my life and opportunities, and is the root of my depression and probably the reason I have no friends.  Because I always stay in.  She constantly dismisses my diagnosed phobia/condition.  "Oh thats still an issue?"  "Just relax and pee, I dont understand why its so hard". It infuriates me even typing it. 

Anyways, I get off work every afternoon and go to my room, listen to the same sad, emo and depressing songs while I just think and suffer.  I sometimes have vivid visualizations of how I could just put myself out of my misery and loneliness.  Sometimes they get gruesome and violent and involve others.
