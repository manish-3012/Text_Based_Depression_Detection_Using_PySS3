Maybe that should've been my last day.I drank, and I drank, and then I wake up in the ER to my family telling me about how close I was to death. Although I didn't really think about it before, nothing has been the same since, people don't treat me the same. Nor does it seem that my family wants me around because I am a burden. Gl with everything in the future, I wish to all reading this the best!
