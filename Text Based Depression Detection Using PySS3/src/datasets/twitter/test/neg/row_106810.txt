how do i make a blade sharperi made this throw away account out of desperation you could say. ive been struggling with suicidal thoughts since my pre teen years and attempted 2 or 3 times thru my adolescence (my memory is fuzzy and ive struggled with a lot of fucked up symptons probably due trauma and whatnot plus i think i repressed a lot of traumatic memories so my memory is even worse). and ive been planning on attempting again for a while now. very few things keep me away from attempting, one of these things being self harm. i know its not healthy but my blade is dull (its a pencil sharperner blade, ive been looking into buying an actual razor blade but pandemic and quarentine came around) and i really really dont have any other option here. therapy is out of the question given my current situation and confinding in friends is also not an option. so if you have any advice onto how to sharpen a pencil sharpener blade thatd be nice. since its one of the few things that keep me "in line" if that makes sense.

(sidenote: no i cant buy another pencil sharpener. i started cutting at a young age and attempted suicide also at a young age so my family strictly forbids me getting my hands on anything that i might possibly harm myself with. that doesnt mean that theyre great or caring btw but i wont get into my life story in this post. anyways yeah just give me advice on how to make it sharp again)

(also i apologize for the name of my account i came up with that on a whim since i figured that a keysmash for a name would probably get me banned or something of that nature)
