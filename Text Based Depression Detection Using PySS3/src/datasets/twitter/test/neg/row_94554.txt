Anxious about the futureTo be brief, I'm too anxious and depressed to work. I think I'll always be too anxious and depressed to work. My parents are willing to support me, but what happens after they pass on? No one wants to date someone as useless as me so it just feels like it'll come to the point where I'll eventually have no one to take care of me and then I'll only have one choice: suicide.

I could use some help here. Please respond with any words of kindness or wisdom that you might have to help me think of this in a different light, or something.
