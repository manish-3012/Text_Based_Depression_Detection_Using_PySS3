Lost all of my friendsHad a few childhood friends, then moved to another location. Did not fit in there, but I had an online friend I would Skype with everyday. We really loved each other. Unfortunately we grew apart and I haven't spoken to him in more than a year.

When I was making some new friends in that location, we moved again. I had, once again, some trouble fitting in but relatively quick had a group at school I would hang out with. This group of friends disintegrated when we graduated high school. I remained in contact with two of them. One was my best friend, the other was a good one. I fell in love with my best friend, and when I told it the friendship was over. I lost the other friend too because I got depressed and turned down invites because it seemed weird without my best friend.

At work, there is a culture to not get personal. Same thing applies to university where I go now. I quit sports few years ago because it was being kind of a chore and just needed a break from it. Maybe I shouldn't have done that.

All of this has alienated me. I feel like people instantly know I'm a loser, I deserve to get tossed in the trash can. More of all, I want to do fun things, I want to not be socially awkward because I'm so out of touch with people. More of all, everything I do now is disguised by the fact that I don't have a social nest or network that I can rely on at all times. It just feels wrong, everything I do now feels wrong.

I keep thinking to just commit suicide. It can't be fixed and I don't want to live life like this. I'm alone on Nye and I think I'm going to do it then.
