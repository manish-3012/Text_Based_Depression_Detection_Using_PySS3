I'm looking forward to ending itI'm so sick of life, it's pointless. I realized no matter how hard I work I will never become anything. I will have to work my ass off just to stay withing the mediocre life I was born into. I will never be rich, I will never be a good person, I am a pointless life on this vastly over populated planet. I would be doing a favor to the world by killing myself.

I know how I'm going to do it, I want to jump. I want to go to the tallest building in my city, get into one of the offices on the top floor, bust the glass out, and just jump. I look forward to that free fall where I will lose all fear, all self hate, all feeling. Right before I hit that pavement. It will be the most blissful feeling I can imagine, just having all my pain go away.
