The more I read about climate change the more pointless it all seems.Honestly, I used to not be one for even considering suicide. But every time I read about climate change, I walk away feeling more and more hopeless. Tonight, after reading how the oceans ecosystem could collapse in a decade or two, suicide just seems so much preferable than whatever hellscape climate change will bring. 

I donâ€™t understand how people read all of this stuff and donâ€™t walk away from it feeling like going out on your own terms might be preferable.
