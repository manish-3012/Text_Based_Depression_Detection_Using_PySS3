Lost my job, never going to find another one so what's the pointResigned from my job today, they gave me the option of either resigning or going and working 200 miles away living in a hotel all week (alternatively I would get sacked). I hated the travel really, it stressed me out too much and I frequently thought about jumping in front of a train or something while waiting for it or whatever else just to avoid having to go to work and having to keep doing the travel.

I'm 20 at the moment, I had the job for 2 and a half years and got a double diploma in IT competency or something while doing it but well, I'm out now, I'm fucked. My mom is an employer and she tells me that if she ever saw a CV (resume) with no current work on it then it would go straight in the bin. She's been telling me how I will never find a job now and I have disappointed the whole family, I already know I'm the main problem in the family anyway, she told me that a while ago.

I needed to quit because the job was killing me anyway, didn't expect such discouragement. At least I know now that she was right all those years that I'm a failure and an utter disappointment and embarrassment to the family. I've felt suicidal a lot in the last couple of years and attempted it a couple of times and it's kind of calming, like I don't have to worry about how much I've ruined my mom's life by resigning because I'll be dead maybe.
