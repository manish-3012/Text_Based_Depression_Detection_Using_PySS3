I cant get a win in fortnite and it makes me so sadPlease help me, i cannot get a win in fortnite, for the past year ive been in constant pain and suffering, mostly by my peers, who are better than me.

I've tried everything, watching Ninja, myth and ofcrouse pewdiepie. Im crying as i type this. you may think this is a joke, but ive cut my arms, tried to break many of my 206 bones. Ive also spent aprox. 5000 euros on just v-bux, to compensate for how bad i am.

Ive hit rock bottom, someone please help me.
