Lost the love of my life, have literally never cared less about myself than I do in this moment.My boyfriend of 5 years and I have â€œmutuallyâ€ called it quits. I have never felt so just numb and empty as I do right now. It was the â€œright thing to doâ€ and Iâ€™m sure wasting away until I lose all body fat, my muscles atrophy, and I ultimately die will also be the best thing to do. I have never felt like less of a human being. I have never felt of less importance or worthiness of life. Iâ€™m never letting myself feel like this again.
