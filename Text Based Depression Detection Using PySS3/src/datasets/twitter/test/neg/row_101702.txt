Nothing makes me happy, i have no future and people are whoresIm 17 about to be a senior. For the past 4 months all my friends got Gfs and thats all they have been doing since, hanging out with their gf's i can never hangout with or even talk to them. I cant complain about it to them and after a while i decided i should get a gf, but every girl i get together with they always want me to smoke weed with them or only care about sex after dating for 1.5week. (im a virgin and tottaly wouldnt mind keeping it til marrage). In school i have a 2.0 and im gonna have to take 7classes my senior year, im pissed off at myself and so are my parents. Everyday ive been restless and stayed up til 4-5 just laying in my bed and waking up at 6 its impossible for me to get back on schedule. Litteraly the only thing that makes me happy in this world is James Blunt, Oh Wonder, leauge of legends and this friend i have a huge crush on but shes always dating someone im too afriad to ask her cause pf my speach impediment. Im not really conplimating suicide i just dont see a reason for me to live
