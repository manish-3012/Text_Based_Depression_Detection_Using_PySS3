I'm afraid this is the endFor years I've on/off more-or-less considered killing myself. Last night I kind of broke and legitimately thought through the details of what I'd do and what the outcome would be. I woke up thinking the same thing, and I've been crying every time I think about it all day. I think about the things I won't experience, I think about those closest to me, and I think of how best to say goodbye. I don't want to alarm anyone I'm close to, though they're the only ones I could talk to, but I'm afraid of what comes next. I keep putting more and more thought into it and I'm afraid I'm waiting to act. What do I do? I'm lost.
