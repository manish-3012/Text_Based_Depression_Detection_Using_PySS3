It was my first girlfriends birthday yesterday and her party is tonightAnd all I can think about is all the people she's going to make out with and it just makes me feel really bleak. She dumped me because our relationship was affected by my stress and depression and she didn't want to be responsible if something bad happened to me. But without her I've got no happiness in life. I have just been plonking along for the past 4 months and even though I'm not attracted to her anymore , thoughts of her still hurt me. And two weeks ago she kissed one of my really good friends. I haven't been able to look at other girls romantically since Josephine... While she's off having fun I'm going to be tying a hangman's knot. Wish me luck. I'm a whiny pathetic bitch.
