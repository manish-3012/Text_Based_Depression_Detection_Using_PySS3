I am an idiotI think I am such an idiot that I could very well be Darwin Awards nominee. 
Couple of years ago I arrived in Canada with the intention to study in university and get a degree,  but the new environment, homesickness, depression, cultural differences, â€œlong desired freedomâ€ and countless other reasons, that in hindsight are just smart sounding excuses, created changes in those plans. 

During the first year in uni I got into drugs, alcohol and parties. Nothing serious drugs and alcohol wise but by the end of the year it was certain that I am not gonna make it to a second year and would have to leave Canada and go back home. I didnâ€™t want that. Like a complete idiot I simply said to my parents that everything is fine and I am still studying. 

For more than 2 years I kept saying this lie but in reality I lived in Canada without visa, without degree, without any desire to change things. I lived alone in rented apartment reading novels, watching films basically being unproductive, antisocial waste. I simply didnâ€™t think of consequences and didnâ€™t care how it all would end up. Even right now I  do not care much about what will happen to me but imagining my mom makes me feel immense guilt for the things Iâ€™ve done.

Less than a year ago I started translating novels from my native language into English just for fun and ended up earning a bit from it, so at last something started going on in my life. I started cleaning up my habits, until recently I was reminded that my passport will soon expire. 
So here I am not knowing what to do. To be honest my options are quite limited. Come clean and get deported. Create another convoluted and disgusting lie about how I got my passport renewed and live without a passport as an illegal immigrant. Go full Hollywood style and get a fake passport. I even seriously contemplated suicide as a solution. 

On one hand I truly donâ€™t want face the consequences of my own actions. On the other hand something finally started to make sense in my life. I am sure that if I had a chance to go back in time all this wouldnâ€™t have happened. I wouldnâ€™t have to lie to my parents living life of a disgusting parasite and hurting them, living without direction and any desire. I regret last 5 years of my life.
If I go back to my hometown, I would probably face jail time. Draft dodging and all that.

To be honest writing everything down right now made me realize that I donâ€™t want to go back home and face my parents. Any option right now seems whole lot more appealing than logical and right thing to do, even eating a bullet. I know its a cowards way out but...
