I Really want to kill myself but Hell AwaitsLittle background on my Iâ€™m 42 year old male. I was adopted when i was six months. Iâ€™ve struggled with life from the beginning. I went to predominantly caucasian private school in CT. Iâ€™m black unfortunately and have been ostracized by both size understandably so. My father was in a coma 6 years and died in 1999. My mother died last year. I have no siblings, wife, kids ect. Iâ€™m going to be homeless Monday. I honestly want to kill myself but I was raised Christian so I believe Iâ€™m probably burn for eternity, so it kind of scares me. Iâ€™m literally the worst thing you can be a black dude who acts white that is unattractive and worthless. Would you kill yourself if you were me at this point?
