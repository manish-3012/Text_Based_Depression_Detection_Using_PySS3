I want to feel the warmth.Like many of you, life is unbearable for me.  My dog, cat, mom, dad, gma, keep me alive.  Hate myself so much, hurt so much just want to die.  Bc I hate myself I would never do anything to hurt anyone I love.  Thus, I live in agony.  I read about experiences were people die for a short time and come back.  They all describe similiar things.  Like a warmth and a flow of frequencies pulsating through your body.  I want to feel the warmth.  I dont want to be here.  I am alive because those people and animals need me.  I wonder if they felt what I felt, they would be happy for me and encourage me to do it.  Idk.
