Done once the Holidays are overJust got done seeing my therapist, I'm not making any progress with her. She wants me to exercise - I can't. She wants me to look for a job - I can't. She wants me to go out and volunteer - I can't. This world is too fast paced for some useless schmuck like me. Going into stores makes me anxious, driving makes me anxious, crowds make me anxious, talking to strangers makes me anxious. How the hell am I supposed to function in this world?! The prescribed meds they give me don't fucking work - I constantly have suicidal thoughts and I can't escape this negative feedback loop. I'm a useless 26-year old with no passions, no hobbies and no hope. I'm completely dependent on my parents and I don't have the necessary life skills and coping skills to make it in this world on my own. I was isolated from the world for far too long. My smile will never come back... my laughter will never return. I have nothing left to give.

TLDR - Fuck it, I'm done after the holidays.
