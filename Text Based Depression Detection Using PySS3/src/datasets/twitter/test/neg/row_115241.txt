I give upIt doesn't matter how good things get, I'm a final year university student about to graduate with stellar grades in a great course and have landed some super amazing graduate job when I finish.  Still cutting myself, still hate myself, still plan on killing myself. 

It's mostly because I feel extremely lonely and can't seem to fix it, more on that later.

To remove any doubt that I'm serious in case any of that came across badly, on February 14th, I intend to kill myself with a rope and while listening to a particular song. 

I don't enjoy anything anymore, nothing. All the films I used to love, the music I enjoyed, my favourite food, alcohol or a nice coffee. None of it makes me happy anymore, I'm just numb all the time. Therapy and meds only made it worse.

It's all because of how extremely lonely I am. I get an enormous amount of pressure from my parents (who are fucking awful human beings if I'm honest) to find a girlfriend. I keep disappointing them and keep facing the consequences (my educational or career success isn't enough since I'm missing that thing that'd make me perfect enough for them). 

Before I start drowning in unsolicited dating advice, yes I've tried everything you're about to suggest to me. I tried adopting countless personas now,  meeting girls in god knows how many ways, societies, dating apps, mutual friends. Everything.

I'm a defective human being. While I succeeded in some areas, I failed in some more crucial ones.

Sorry everyone for being so fucking annoying, it's okay if you hate me.

I hope my removal from the gene pool does us all justice enough to give someone the future I couldn't enjoy,
