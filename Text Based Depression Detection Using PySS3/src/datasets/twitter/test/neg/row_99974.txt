Why I'm Going to Kill MyselfI'm an abomination. My body is covered with scars and stretch marks from years of not just neglect, but active malignance. My cesspool genetics left me with nothing exemplary, just this stocky frame where everythingâ€™s underdeveloped and nothing works right. Iâ€™m quite literally a Neanderthal, and Iâ€™m naturally repulsive.

Thereâ€™s a parasite in my psyche that simultaneously outwardly hates, but restricts action. Whenever I was subject to any adversity or physical aggressiveness my arms would go limp. My arms would lose their ability and foundation and Iâ€™d be left just to take whatever abuse it was. I physically couldnâ€™t fight back. My body prohibited itself. My conscious self canâ€™t trust my body to perform. I canâ€™t trust myself.

The only qualities worth noting arenâ€™t physical, and, no matter how commendable, they all stem from my broken and misguided inhibition.

I hate myself for what I am, what I can't change. It supersedes my train of thought and every decision I make.
