I wish I never met himHe took everything from me:
-my first kiss 
-my virginity 
-my ability to feel safe and comfortable at work 
-my ability to go into the city (just the thought of being in the city gives me an anxiety attack)
-the $2.5k from my tax return I spent paying off all our meals together that were all on my credit cards because I couldnâ€™t afford it 
-I canâ€™t watch tv anymore
-I canâ€™t listen to most music
-my love of food
-my ability to trust people 
-my desire to ever try to be in a relationship with someone 
-my interest in ever being sexually active ever again
-my ability to basically do anything but cry when Iâ€™m by myself
-my will to live

I feel like a coward for not being able to tell people what he did. I wish I never met him. Heâ€™s a monster.
