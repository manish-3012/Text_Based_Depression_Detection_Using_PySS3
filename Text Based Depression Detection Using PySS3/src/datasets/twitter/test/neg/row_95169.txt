I left my house last night, stayed at a shitty motel, and now I'm back in my room, wanting to die.I'm pretty much considered a failure. My family is hard on me, judgmental, and can't do anything but criticize. My mom has a thyroid condition: she's also bipolar and depressed. Last night, I was getting bitched at unfairly and not being able to hold my tongue out for any longer, I bit back and that ended up with my hysterically crying and storming out my house. My mom saw me packing my shit, called my dad and watched me as I left. My dad called, trying to get me to not leave but I told him I didn't care. He desperately called my older sister, who told him 'I'm not going to try and stop her,' as my mom followed my down the stairs, yelling and screaming, telling me how happy she was to see my go and she literally opened the door for me. I got into my boyfriend's car and just hysterically cried. The only reason I had for not killing myself was because of the people around me: my dad loves me, works so hard for us just so we can get by, and he has to put up with so much shit. I can tell he doesn't love my mom: he's just with her because without him, she'd be some batshit woman with no where to go/nothing to do. He cannot stand my older sister, who he calls selfish, which is true as she really couldn't give a damn about anyone else as her life is the hardest life out of ANYONE in the world. I have two younger sisters that are brilliant and going places and I hate to leave them, but I couldn't do it anymore. 

My boyfriend and I stopped at the ATM. He kept asking what was wrong, but the story was way too long. I withdrew $200, not knowing how much I needed for the night. I was going to get a motel and not come back home that night. My boyfriend and I ended up at a shitty motel that cost $80 for one night and 9 hours: it was disgusting. He stayed with me because I literally was hysterically crying and a complete mess. I only fell asleep when I became exhausted: as he slept, I stayed up, crying and thinking about thoughts of suicide. There was a lake right outside and I fantasized about drowning myself in it. I really wanted to die, but I held back because I knew my boyfriend would be devastated and so would my father. He convinced me to come back home, literally saying things such as, "I work 14 hours a day, barely getting any sleep at all each night and I'm not sleeping until you come home. Why do you want to make my life even more stressful? You're better than them: don't stoop down to their life and try to make my miserable." I felt so guilty, and I just couldn't do it but I want to. Things are becoming too much: I feel so sad and lonely all the time. I don't have money for school, and I'm already in debt at 18. 

TL;DR: I was told to leave the house and by leaving the house, I wouldn't burden my family anymore so I did. But when I actually do, my dad guilts me into coming back and my whole family is ruined because everyone is mad and blaming each other so I'm literally damned if I do, damned if I don't. There really is no outlet.
