What's stopping you?Disappointing your family. Your cat. Valerie. The gruesome imagery of them discovering the aftermath.

Some distant hope that everything changes should you promise yourself a few more days, a few more weeks, a few more months.

Tell yourself that you're skid marks, black rain; the remnants of a wreckage and the fallout of the same damn war, a fallout of psychological destruction. You say you can't quit early because you've got pains to sell, statistics to disprove, and blood makes you a bit too squeamish. But truth be told, you've been thinking about this for the better part of a decade.

What's stopping you?   

It's this fragment of a sliver that all of media tells you about: comfortable living, comfortable spouse, comfortable routine.  You think you're gonna get it, give or take another year.

Maybe that year just ran out. Eight times over. (Who's counting?)

I'm not sure what's stopping me anymore.
