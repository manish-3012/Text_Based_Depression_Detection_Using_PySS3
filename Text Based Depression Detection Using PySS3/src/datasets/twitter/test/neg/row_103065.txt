Every morning when i wake up i am so fucking depressed and furious. I want to leave this existence every single day, but my fucking family and friends are practically keeping me hostage hereTitle says it all, im a male in my mid 20s now and honestly im pretty fucking tired of everything and everyone. Everyday is the same bullshit cycle, im just a lonely fat sack of shit at this point. I cant even look my friends or family in the eye anymore, i feel like either crying or punching someone. My dad even told me he hates talking to me because of how negative and bitter i am. I dont want to find a career, or go back to college, or any kind of american bullshit, I just want to do cocaine and drink and smoke weed everyday until my system fails on me and i die. But i have a loving family, the thought of leaving my sister to grow old without me and my niece not ever knowing who i am or was hurts deep. My parents are old, my granny is still alive, i cant do this to them, i know my death will only destroy them. Its like im a fucking hostage on this miserable rock in this miserable universe, and everyday my sanity slips away. So basically im praying for sweet death to reach me, maybe even catch the COVID and at least i wouldnt have to kill myself and take a natural death. I dont know anymore, i guess time will tell.
