I'm finally an adult and I think I'm doneI can't remember the last time I was happy, I've always felt miserable. And I don't see it ever changing. I have a genuinely shitty personality that most would find off-putting. I loathe myself and quickly get tired of people I talk to. I'm passive aggressive, hypocritical, petty. I managed to live 18 years without developing a personality. Instead I always put on masks just to blend in. I'm not funny, intelligent or attractive. I'm garbage both inside and out. I've always been like this. I feel sorry for people who have to deal with me

Every month it keeps getting worse. I've always hated myself but it's gotten so bad that I have daily suicidical thoughts because I don't want to live with myself. I desperately wish I could wake up as someone else

I don't believe that someone like me has a chance. I'm tired of hearing meaningless platitudes from people who don't know what it's like. I don't believe in self help shit. I don't know, it all feels like cope. No matter what I do or where I go I'll always stay myself. Dying is a lot easier
