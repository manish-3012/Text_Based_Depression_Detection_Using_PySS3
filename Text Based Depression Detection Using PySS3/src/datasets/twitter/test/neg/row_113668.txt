The police cameMy therapist asked the police to perform a welfare check on me at my home because I was suicidal last week and on top of that forgot my most recent online therapy appointment. (My memory is one thing I struggle with hugely, brain fog.)
They showed up at my house that I share with my mum. She had no idea what t was about, really. Still doesn't as I just kind of gave her a half truth about missing therapy which resulted in the check.

Anyway, what I can't get past is the feeling of guilt for this happening. I was convinced last week that I wouldn't be sitting here right now, so I opened up to my therapist in a questionnaire I get issued every week to monitor my moods. My boyfriend and brother were also present at the time so I pretty much told my boyfriend how I'd felt and I'm scared because he didn't know I was actually suicidal.
Now I'm on some vulnerable person list and I feel like a total failure. 

Has this ever happened to you?
Did I do something awful?
