LostI am here because I am feeling lost. I have been severely ill for the last year and don't think I will ever have my life back. It has been a serious burden on every relationship I have. I feel like my existence consists of physical suffering, burdening the ones I love, and isolation. It doesn't feel worth it. I feel like everyone would gain if I was gone.
