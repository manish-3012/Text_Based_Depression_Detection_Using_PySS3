Iâ€™ll keep posting here, I guessI canâ€™t even complain on some of the mom subreddits without getting downvoted as soon as I say that I get help from my husband and family members. I donâ€™t even know what I expected from posting there.  
So, because my husband is doing his job as a dad and because I live close enough to my parents that they can sometimes watch the kids, that doesnâ€™t give me the right to complain about being a shitty mom?  
Iâ€™m going to keep complaining about my life on here from now on. At least I feel and know Iâ€™m not the only one at the end of my rope.
