I honest to God don't understand why I'm obsessed with suicide. I'm not depressed. I'm not upset. I live a peaceful stable life. Yeah by my logic I'm convinced that suicide is the most reasonable thing to do for myself. I just want to get it over with quickly.

I want control. I want peace. 

I want to reach the finish line. I guess I'm bored.

But I'm so soo obsessed with dying

And I'm so okay right now. It's weird.

Typically people want to die when life is treating them terribly but when life is treating me okay right now...

I dont know
