Everything is ready I'm gonna do itI'll die in my old room

I'm 20 years old and its 2020. I wanted to die on my birthday, may 21 2020. But I cant last longer anymore.

I'll be homeless soon since my dad threatened to kick me out today because I'm a problem to him which he doesnt want to fix and that it's too much for him to handle.

My mom left me when I was a kid, my family deserted me, my friends stopped talking to me, my brother hates me so much and my dad wants to leave me too now. 

So

Since I'm a problem, a number, a worthless person

I'm doing myself a favor 

Since nobody wants to help me not even God or Jesus christ 

So be it
