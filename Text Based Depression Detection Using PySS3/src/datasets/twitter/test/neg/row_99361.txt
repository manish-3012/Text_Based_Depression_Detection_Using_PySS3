I Don't Know How Much Longer I Can Go OnThe short of it:  


Around 11-12, my mom pulled me out of school. She then took away my cellphone because it was "too expensive" (bare in mind it was about $15-20/mo tracphone). Not long after, she and my younger sister both got smart phones. I kept asking where mine was, but she either just ignored me or told me it would be too expensive.  


Taking away my phone caused me to lose almost all of my friends, all but two. Even then, one of those barely talked to me anymore anyways. My only connection to them was Xbox Live, which she eventually cancelled because "it was too expensive." She was spending over $100 each month on my sister's phone bill alone at the time she cancelled my $10 a month Xbox live.  


When I was 16-17, my older sister passed away. My cousins were back in the area and started doing stuff, so I started doing stuff with them. I finally was given a cellphone. My younger sister and I both were getting out driver's license. She got hers before me and was given the only working car we had. I stopped going after mine because I knew I'd never have it to drive. My mom then promised me the older car she had that was broken down once she fixed it.  


Two years into waiting for the car to be fixed, I come home one day and my sister's driving out of the house in what was supposed to be my broken down car. Turns out she totaled the car she was given, so my mom gave her my car. (Which she now tries to say she just let her use it, even though she specifically said she gave it to her and refused to take it off of her.) They said I didn't get \*my\* car because I "didn't do anything", even though the reason I didn't do anything was because I couldn't get around to do anything, which I told them.  


over the past 10ish years I've begged my mom just to be fair. Over and over, but instead she spoiled my sister rotten and left me in the dust. On top of the $100+/mo phone bill, she replaced my sister's smartphone several times after she broke it throwing hissy fits, she gave her the two cars, she spent $400+ at a time on her for school dances, she gave her $20+ almost every weekend to do things with her friends, she spent tons of money on her hobbies, everything.  


At most I was given $10-20 a few times she was given some.  


I had to miss out entirely on being a teenager. Not only was I forced to miss out on a quality education (I'd say in most subjects I'm probably about 6th-7th grade), but I was forced to miss out on doing \*anything\*. The time I should have been able to spend making friends and socializing, going to parties, concerts, football games, etc, I was forced to spend sitting alone. For 10 years. My social skills are almost nonexistent, and most of the time I'm around people I just stand there because I don't know what to do. I couldn't work because I had no way to get to work. Where we live isn't close enough to walk/bike, I don't know anyone who'd be able to give me rides and the public transport pretty much is nonexistent here. My sister was given my car so "she could get to work", but the majority of the time she was driving my car she was unemployed. I'm 21 and I've never had a girlfriend or done anything with a girl, and I don't have any friends. Given the fact I can't socialize at all, I doubt I'll ever be able to get any friends, or a girlfriend.  


I just can't find a reason to go on. Even if I were to miraculously catch up to where I should be without taking a long period of time and putting myself even further back, there's no getting back all the stuff I was forced to miss out on. There's very few people my age in my town now. It pretty much just jumps from 17 to 30, with very little in between. Most left to go to college and get better lives, while I was stuck here not being able to do anything. Not to mention things that I just don't get back period, like actually being able to go to school dances. Even if I could find people to hang out with, odds are they'd be busy all day. I'll never truly be able to make up for all the time I was forced to miss out on.  


Why even go on? I don't enjoy life. Medication hasn't really helped, and I doubt therapy will either. The only thing I could see fixing this is somehow getting all the time I missed back, but that will never happen.  


I genuinely just don't want to be alive anymore. My entire life's just going to be me being miserable and trying desperately to make up for all the time I was forced to loss and fail at it, so why go on at all? That's to say if I can even get myself back on my feet, considering I'm 21 and have barely any education and no work experience.  


What's worse yet is I've been begging my mother to start making up so I can actually get on my feet for the past two years, and telling her that I'd probably end up killing myself if she didn't, but she continued to just ignore me. I've gone over everything she did and she gave me a half-hearted "I'm sorry." Now if I bring any of it up she sits there and lies to me about what happened, trying to make it look like she didn't actually do the things she did.  


I legitimately can't find a single reason to go on.
