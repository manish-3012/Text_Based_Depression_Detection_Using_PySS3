I'm 39....I wake up every morning wishing one of two things that lightsabers were real. and I could just slice off the fat from my body and secondly, they'll never be real and I'll never lose weight and feel comfortable so why the fuck do I exist.
Try as much as I might, the thought of my kids doesn't help, it just makes me not want to make them suffer,  to have to push me in a wheel chair or help bathe me or just dump me in a home. Knowing that no woman is or was ever attracted to me makes it tougher to keep on. There are nights when I just wanna drive off into the lake or crash over the precipice of the highway. My meds make me super drowsy and I drive for a living since stopped taking them, I dont think they really helped and the therapist I was supposed to meet they never let me reschedule, even after I told them I was sick.
