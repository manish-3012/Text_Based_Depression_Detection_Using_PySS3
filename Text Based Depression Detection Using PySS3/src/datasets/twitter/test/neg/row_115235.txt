Iâ€™ve lost almost everything and I canâ€™t seem to care about whatâ€™s left.I mean I *care* about things logically. I want my family to be okay. I want my boyfriend to be happy. I want my snake to live a long, happy life. 

None of it *means* anything to me though. I canâ€™t seem to connect to anything. I donâ€™t enjoy anything. I go through the motions because Iâ€™m supposed to. I have a plan and a date. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m looking for. Iâ€™ve tried the lines and therapy. Iâ€™m chronically ill and most meds donâ€™t work for me. I guess Iâ€™m just tired of this life and Iâ€™m ready for the next one.
