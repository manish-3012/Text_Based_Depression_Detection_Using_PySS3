I feel like Iâ€™m faking itIâ€™ve been on an uptrend for the last year due to anti-depressants but this last month or so has been absolute hell. I am well aquatinted with the pit of despair but it is hitting me extremely hard this time. I donâ€™t want to continue. Iâ€™ve isolated myself, Iâ€™m angry and sad and I just cannot relate to others in a meaningful way. Iâ€™d call the hotline but that never fails to make me worse. I am just stuck, I have nowhere to go.
