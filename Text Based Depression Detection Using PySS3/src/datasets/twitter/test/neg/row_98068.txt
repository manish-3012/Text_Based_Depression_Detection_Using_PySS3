Shelter in place is making me feel stuck and hopelessIt was ok in the beginning but now I feel like a prisoner in my own home. I was already struggling to get my life in order and now I have to delay that. I dont want to get into details but  everyday that goes by is another day I have to delay my future and I don't know how much I can handle it. 

We can say just hang in there we're all struggling but I don't know how much longer I can live by that motto i have an extra added issue weighing on me besides quarantine. I just want a way out and I've never thought about death more than ever. My problems and quarantine aren't going away anytime soon.
