Cymbalta is making the thoughts really intenseMy brain feels like it is on fire. I just got started on Cymbalta a few days ago and things were going okay until. Tonight, I keep imagining myself dying by my own hand or passive aggressively. Nothing stops it or relieves it. I keep trying to imagine doing something I enjoy, but I can't focus for very long. I am super tired but I can never sleep through the night. I am still not eating on a regular basis. This depression feels like someone is dragging me along the ground with a rope.
