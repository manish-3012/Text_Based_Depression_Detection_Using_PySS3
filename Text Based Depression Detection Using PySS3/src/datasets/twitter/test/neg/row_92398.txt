I feel like I am only staying alive for my close familyI don't know what else to do. I'm taking all the healthy steps. I've been through a lot of therapy, and am looking forward to taking more. I am going to a psychiatrist and taking medication. I do my work and try to be extra productive by doing some reading every day.

But it's just not happening. I feel so lonely. In an attempt to not burden my friends with my mental problems, I've devolved to just not talking to them as much, because whenever we do, it usually turns into a conversation about how I'm doing, and I'm not doing great.

I do feel like there is nothing else that's left for me. But my parents (and some friends) will be incredibly upset and completely broken if I committed suicide. Apart from that, the only things holding me back are a fear of pain, and the potential existence of Hell. These things make me feel trapped.

What can I do to at least feel better? Even if my conditions aren't getting better anytime soon.
