I don't know what to doI have a good friend who lives in Canada, I live in Germany. He's been talking about how nobody likes him, that nobody accepts him and that he feels pointless for a long time. All the time I tried to tell him that there ARE people who care for him, that he DOES matter, etc. I managed to get him talk to his parents about his issues and to seek professional help. The talk with his parents really made him feel better for a while but it seems that after his first meeting with the mental health service everything is just worse. He came back and started talking about killing himself, that he's on the edge of suicide and that he doesn't understand what's wrong with him, why all the people he trusts seem to treat him like shit. I have no idea what to do or say. I tried calming him down but that did not help. I cant fly to Canada to hug him, so I'm stuck with text messages. All I want is to help him,I want him to feel better but I have no idea how.
