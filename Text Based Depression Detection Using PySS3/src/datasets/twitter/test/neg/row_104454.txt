I wish I was deadI m 33 f going through a heartbreak from ex fiance dumped like trash blocked ghosted abused in every way and it's been 4 months now since that all . On su days I go in deep sea of depressed feelings . I want to kill myself to get rid of this pain honestly..i live with terrible family i do a demanding job and feel lost in every way. It's like I m living this life to feed others n goin insane inside. Nobody really likes me tbh . I m such an unhappy soul and I want to die cz living like this is such bs. Why can't I die . Why is it a bad stigmatized thing to do. Nobody understands wat m goin through.
