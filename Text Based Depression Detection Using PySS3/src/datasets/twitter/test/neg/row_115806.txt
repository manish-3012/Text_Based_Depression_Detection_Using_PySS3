I'm sick of thisMy life for the past 5 years has been cyclin between really fucking depressed and feeling kinda okay. And my "kinda okay" is really just "i don't wake up every single morning wishing i were dead." 

I've tried to kill myself twice and I wish it worked. I relapsed on oxy and cutting recently and it's just another reason for me to fucking hate myself. 

I care deeply about my fiancÃ© but part of me thinks i'm falling out of love with him. It's terrifying because he's my only friend and the only person who gives a shit about me.  I don't want to keep living
