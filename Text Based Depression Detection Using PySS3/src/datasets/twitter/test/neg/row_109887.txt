My life has no meaningi have decided to suicide, i'm a college dropout, living with my mother, i don't have a job and i don't want to, no friends, and my life is just watching videos on a daily basis, i have tried psychologists, psychiatrists, even "alternative" medicine, i can't do anything. 

People should embrace their happy days, for some people they won't comeback. Thank you
