It's all I have.I have made bad choices. In combanation with those bad choices I have had some bad luck as well. I am now, homeless, no car, no job. 30 years old and not one dollar to my name. I cant get better. I no longer want to do this. To those who are struggling fight as hard as you can, to those who lost the struggle I am truly sorry. Those who love the ones who go, just know your love helped but they wanted this. Love you all.
