What is wrong with me?Why am i like this? Why do i constantly think of killing myself? Why do i cause my family members pain by telling them how i feel inside? How do i make it all stop? I don't know what to do anymore. I am tired of driving people away with my negativity and hurting the people who care about me. Anytime I tell someone how I feel they get angry at me and cry. They call me a negative asshole and tell my that my life is not that bad. I tell them about my suicide attempts and they one up me with their own experiences. They tell me that my suicide attempts are just "emo shit" and that they know what real depression is like. I am just so tired of all of this. I want it all to end. Sorry if i am posting this on the wrong sub or if it does not make sense. This is my first post on reddit and I just needed to vent i guess.
