I am thinking more and more of ending it.Quick background : i am 34, immigrant in UK. I have been living here for over 6 years and work wise i can't complain. I ended up here because i could not find any work in my own country i thought that was the reason my moral level was that low. 
Personal life i can admit i have never been in a serious relationship. I am currently seeing somebody from work, but once i started seeing her ( she is 26), people started telling me how many guys she slept with and when. I really like her and she makes my depression go away but she also has a kid. While i do understand the kid will always be first i also see why she needs to take this easy. 
In regards to my mental health i think this idea of killing myself has been in back of my head for over 10 years now. 
Recently i have joined a gym, i was fat my hole life i said this may be the time. I have been going on and off for the last 3 weeks, but each day after the gym i just think more and more it is not worth it and i need to finish it.  
I have tried to find a quality that can define me, but i can't. All i find are my defects and reasons why i failed so much in life. 
The entire time i feel a pressure in the back of my head and only one thought. End it. 

I made a plan and gave my self 1 year of trying anything, to find a reason to live. The time is running out and i still haven't found anything. 

The main depressing thing is i just have this idea that when i will go ahead they won't  even find me. Nobody even cares. It will be weeks before the smell gives it away. 

I just want it done.
