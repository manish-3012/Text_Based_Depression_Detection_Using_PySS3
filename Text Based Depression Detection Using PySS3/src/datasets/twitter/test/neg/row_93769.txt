I didn't handle it well. If my girlfriend decides to take her own life, it's gonna be my fault.My girlfriend is having an episode and is feeling suicidal. Last night she opened up to me about taking her own life. She says there is a gun store near her place and she can afford it. I guess I reacted badly without thinking twice. I said I love her so much and my greatest fear is losing the ones I love to death. I also told her "Please don't leave me." This morning she told me that she's just a problem and she doesn't want to be my problem anymore.

Against my will, she made me go to work. She was so aggressive about it even though I wanted to stay with her. Now, she's alone at her place. And I can't stop thinking about her.

I wish I could turn back time and change my responses to her. I think I triggered her more. This is all my fault. I would hate myself forever if something bad happens to her.

What should I do? I don't want to lose her.
