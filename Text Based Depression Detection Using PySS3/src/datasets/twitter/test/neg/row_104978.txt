Does anyone have a way of simulating dying so I can know what it feels like?I've been to list pros and cons of living, for a while, and it's been looking pretty negative so far. So then, I thought,  what should I do? Well, I realized that if I were to die for a while, I would be able to list pros and cons of dying.

So what I'm going to need is some non-intrusive way of simulating relatively painful suicide without actually dying (maybe simulating the process for some time).

That way I'll see what it's like and I'll be able to draw a positive/negative comparison between the two.

Now, since dying is generally horrible, I should then be able to empirically realize how erroneous it is to crave it, and therefore will help with my healing.

So, does anyone know a way to simulate dying?
