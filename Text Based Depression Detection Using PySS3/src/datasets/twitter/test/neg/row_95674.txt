Looking for a storyIdk if anyone will know what Iâ€™m talking about, but a few years ago I was at a really low point and was just about ready to kill myself. I was googling tips for how to do it painlessly/not messy/whatever else, and I found this website with a whole story as if a narrator was speaking to the reader. He was saying stuff about how you can kill your self after you read the story, but you have to get through it. I read the whole thing, it went on and on about being on a beach with a beautiful girl and ordering drinks. Basically just all these amazing things in life that you should stick around for. By the time I got to the end I was calmed down. That story saved my life, and I wish I could find it again for when I have episodes. So if anyone knows what Iâ€™m talking about please let me know.
