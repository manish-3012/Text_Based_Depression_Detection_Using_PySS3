Am I Depressed if I have thoughts of killing myselfI don't think I'm depressed. I go out with my friends all the time, im in college, workout and like to party and trip out with the bois. However when I'm by myself I just wonder if it wouldn't just be easier to go jump off a bridge(always wanted to feel the feeling of flight) and find out what happens. Idk it just seems easier than the pressures of acing every class, finding a girl, finding the perfect job and living out the rest of my life. Jumping off a bridge just seems easier than letting everyone I know down, than not being able to live up to everyone's expectations. These thoughts usually pass but I get them quite a bit. I just have these thoughts all the time and it would just be so easy to just free myself from everything in one moment and be free. Just jumping would make everything so much easier
