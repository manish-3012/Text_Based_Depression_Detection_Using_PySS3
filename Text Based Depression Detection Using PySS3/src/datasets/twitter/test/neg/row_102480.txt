Trust issues, and some other problems too.I'm 15 and I go to high school, I have plenty of friends and parents that kind on the surface care about me. I've never planned telling my parents about my depression(I was never diagnosed by a professional because then I'd need to tell my parents, but as far as I can tell, and from what we learnt in our  psychology class it seems like depression.) and suicidal ideation as in our community mental illnesses and mentally ill people are treated as jokes and they are never taken seriously, and mental illnesses are almost always used as insults. but so is homosexuality but I didn't have a problem talking about it to my friends and they were surprisingly accepting and they might as well be the reason I am the person I am today.

 But I just can't get the words out when I want to talk about my depression, they are as educated as I am about the topic and they'd probably be understanding and supportive, yet I feel like I can't trust them and/or even if I can that they would think of me differently and pity me. I know that they wont but I've always had trust issues growing up and learned not to trust people, and to always keep my feelings to myself. A couple of weeks ago while we were walking to a coffee shop I was talking with one of my friends about the lack of emotional and mental support and materials in our country(TRNC) and she seemed totally aware of the situation and even talked about ways we and adults could raise awareness on the topic.

But I think it all comes down to one sentence one of my friends said when I snuck in the possibility of one of us being depressed in our group, she said "you can't be depressed, I know who you are and you just don't **seem** depressed, **you're always happy**" which lead to a multi month long depression episode along with some other triggering factors.

I got over that, but I think it is one of the reasons I can't get out the words to tell them about the fact that I think about suicide every day.

either way if I tell them or not, I still don't know how to talk about it to my parents who are definitely more close minded, and less accepting(My mum offered to take me to the doctor when I came out to her 3 years ago, and asked what was wrong with me for **wanting** to ruin my life, and create bullying and insult material for people.)

So if you've read all that, thank you. If you have any advice it'd be greatly appreciated.
