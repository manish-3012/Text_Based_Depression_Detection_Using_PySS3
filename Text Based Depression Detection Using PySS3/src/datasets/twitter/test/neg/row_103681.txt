Scared of mental hospital if it doesn't workI've been thinking about suicide a lot lately, and even more recently... and I have considered talking to my therapist about it (at least hypothetically), but I'm very scared of if she takes me seriously and I get sent to a psych ward...
I am about 90% sure that I want to go through with this. But I think a psych ward would be hell, especially because I'm autistic and it'd fuck up my routine and be sensory overload and everything. I feel like dead would be better than that, plus a psych ward isn't going to fix what's making me suicidal anyway.
