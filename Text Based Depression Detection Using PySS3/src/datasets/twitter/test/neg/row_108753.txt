The war of the insides (2019)Currently battling myself, part of me feels like my life is already over, that there's no reason to keep moving forward, that I will die alone and probably be miserable forever no matter what I do. Another naive part of me wants to keep living for some reason, no matter how horrible things are, I don't know who I should listen to.
