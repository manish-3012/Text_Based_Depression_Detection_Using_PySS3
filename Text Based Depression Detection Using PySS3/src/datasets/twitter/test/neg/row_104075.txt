After an accident, I feel like a burden to everyoneSo this post may be a long one, so bear with me. As a little backstory, I am 22 and engaged to the woman of my dreams. I am the oldest of 3 children. I have had bouts of depression throughout my life.

So in October of this year, my fiancee and I visited her family down south. While at her father's house (her parents are divorced) he offered to let me drive his ATV down a rural road adjacent to his house. Being born and raised in the Midwest, I was no stranger to ATVs and had driven them often at my uncles farm. I took off down the road, hit about 35 MPH and the front right wheel of the ATV slipped off the side of the road and last thing I remember thinking was hoping my fiancee could forgive me, as honestly I thought I was dead. My life flashed before my eyes and everything.

I woke up with blood all over my clothes. The ATV had flipped over, and thankfully not onto me. I yelled for help and felt my forehead, which was the source of the blood. I think I passed out a couple more times and came to with fiancee's father's truck pulling up next to me, my fiancee and him pulling me up and into his truck. The rest is a daze, I remember looking in the mirror at my forehead and throwing up from disgust at my injuries. I do remember getting sewn up at the hospital and getting put in a CT machine. I was diagnosed with a concussion as well.

A few days later we came back home and I have been on medical leave at my work since then. My job is pretty physical and won't allow me to come back until I can fulfill my duties without many alterations. I have daily migraines and blurred vision intermittently. I also have crushing anxiety and flashbacks to the wreck regularly. I also have nightmares regularly, usually about the wreck. As such my fiancee has been having an unnecessarily stressful life, being the main breadwinner. I feel so guilty that she has to do this.

Come Christmas time, I visit my family for dinner and what not. While there, I talked to my sister in depth about my parent's marital problems. She is still in high school so still lives with my mom and dad. Long story short on that, my dad had a Facebook for a while until my mom found out he was emotionally cheating on him with a woman from another country. Things have been strained for a year or so. Holidays with my family have been kinda tense since then.

Anyways, my sister divulged a bit of information I had never heard before. Supposedly, my parents were unhappy and already seperated when they found out my mother was pregnant with me. I was the reason my mom and dad had stayed together, and also the reason my brother and sister were born. I feel guilty as I feel I am the root cause of my family's unhappiness. My siblings also have dealt with depression most of their life, and I feel like their existance is my fault. Upon leaving the dinner, my aunt remarks to me that I need to man up and get back to work, and that my fiancee shouldn't have to carry the burden of me on her shoulders. My family, except my brother, have never really been supportive much.

My fiancee did not quite know the extent of what I have been through until last night. We were cuddling watching "The Ballad of Buster Scruggs" and the vignette with the quadruple amputee came on. I won't spoil it much, but I felt a lot like him. Not disabled, physically, I am very fortunate of that. But I just felt helpless to the depression and stress and concussion and trauma. I felt helpless to what life has been doing to me lately. I have felt I am on a roller coaster, helpless and strapped in. I started crying and my fiancee asked why. I told her that I have been feeling like a burden, I told her what my aunt said, and that I feel like my family's unhappiness is all my fault. She held me and reaffirmed that I wasn't a burden to her and that she loves me and that she'll help me find some resources to deal with my trauma.

Honestly, though, I don't know if I can go on much longer. I honestly find myself hoping that I don't wake up in the morning, so everyone I depend on is no longer burdened by my existence. I have never felt this low and often try to put on a smile for my fiancee, even though I don't feel like smiling myself. She is honestly the only reason I haven't killed myself, but I find myself at times wishing she would leave me so I wouldn't have a reason to live anymore.
