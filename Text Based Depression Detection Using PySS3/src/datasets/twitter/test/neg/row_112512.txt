Been thinking a lot latelyHere goes ..
Iâ€™m being bullied at work , have been for the past two years . I hate my job and just realized life probably wonâ€™t get any better for me . Iâ€™m looking for someone to take care of my dog now , so he can at least live out the rest of his life taken care of. Iâ€™m lonely, only person that loves me is my mom and sheâ€™s rapidly going  down hill with her health. I have a friend who is a walking case of depression herself who refuses to see that she is not normal. I know I have so much potential to be great . But I truly give up and just want to finally be at peace .
