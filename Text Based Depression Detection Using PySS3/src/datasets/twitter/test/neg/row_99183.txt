When I fail 10th gradeWhen I fail 10th grade, im doing it. No question. I have until friday to get all my assignments done. Which is impossibe. It take me hours to get through the smallest things. I have finals after which I have no motivation to study for. The summer break will not be a relief. I will probably be forced into summer school. I was waiting for summer all year. Now my hopes of relief have been crushed. Bye.
