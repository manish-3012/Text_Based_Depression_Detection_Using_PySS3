LifeGirlfriend broke up with me a week and a half before our 2 year anniversary, we live together and Iâ€™ve given up my financial stability in the time we were together and now need to move out but canâ€™t afford the down payment on an apartment; 2 years of payments and the car dealership informs me they are going to repossess my car because they have no record I paid $300 of my total down payment and need to pay it and the interest off; my uncle has been diagnosed with cancer, my mother has a growth and quadrupled white blood cell count that they are leaning towards cancer with and wonâ€™t know for another week; my boss at work has no actual management experience and threatens all of our jobs if we try to stand up to her and make her do her job right; without a car I risk losing my job anyways... Iâ€™m nearing 30 years old, I have constantly struggled with stability and have dug my way out of homelessness twice; all my aspirations are down the drain because I canâ€™t be stable long enough to pursue them; I donâ€™t ever get to see my family because of work; my biological father engrained into me what a worthless waste of space I am growing up and has held me captive in the past, put his hands on my throat and pinned me down and screamed in my face when I told him I wanted to move out a few years ago; I have only 2 or 3 friends who are all dealing with stuff in their own life; I have nowhere to go; Iâ€™ll never amount to anything I want to be; and my ex still wears the promise ring I gave her in spite of her insistence that she lost her feelings for me. So you tell me... in an infinitely vicious cycle, whatâ€™s the point? My family would mourn for a little bit, but the rest of the world wouldnâ€™t even know I was gone.
