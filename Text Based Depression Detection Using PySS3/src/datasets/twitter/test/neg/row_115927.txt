So many things wrong in my lifeThere are so many wrong things going on in my life that I know I just canâ€™t do this anymore. 
But I want to let it all out before I kill myself. 
First is that one of my friends called me trash and said I should just kill myself and that he hopes that everyone I know will stab me in the back. 
The only thing I did was talk to his mother about his drug issues because I was getting really scared for him. 
Second, Iâ€™m in a weird gender issue. I donâ€™t exactly know if Iâ€™m male or female or somewhere in the middle, but I chose a male name but everyone keeps calling me my birth name (which I donâ€™t like because it triggers a lot of bad memories for me from a few years ago). When people call me my birth name I get instant flashbacks of my parents hitting me, but people donâ€™t care. 
People want me to get hurt. 
There are a ton more but I canâ€™t find the will to write more. 
Iâ€™m done with this life.
