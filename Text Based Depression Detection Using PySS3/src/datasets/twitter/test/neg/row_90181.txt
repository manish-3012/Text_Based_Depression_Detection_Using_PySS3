StuckI want to be able to talk to someone about killing myself with more than that in mind. I don't have a recovery goal. I have no desire to get better so I don't get time of day to talk about that properly or as openly as I'd like. I actively want to kill myself again. So what? I won't do it but I won't get better. I won't go either way so no one can help me and I can't move. Can't do this anymore. I always say that. It never means anything. I can't get better. I don't want to. But I'm scared of never getting better.
