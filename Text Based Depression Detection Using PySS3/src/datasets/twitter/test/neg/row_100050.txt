AloneMy best friend - my only friend - tried to kill herself last week. She survived cause she send a goodbye letter to me and other friends, and we managed to send someone to her house.
She did it with the pills she knows I use.
She did it one day after I had bought them for my own.
I'm in an awful place and I have no one to talk to, since she's recovering from her own attempt.
It's 3pm here where I live, and I'm already drunk. I had enough pills to knock me out but not to die. I'm hoping I sleep before I take anymore.
I don't even have anyone to say goodbye to.
