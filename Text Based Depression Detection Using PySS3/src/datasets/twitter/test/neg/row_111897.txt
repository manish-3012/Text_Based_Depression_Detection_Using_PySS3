My attitude and my depressionSo pretty much for my entire life I've had a horrible attitude about life and my depression doesnt help much at all it seems to make everyone want to walk away from me and that just makes things worse. I dont know aht to do all I think about is suicide and death all the time I'm always thinking of different ways to kill myself. I have tried to change my attitude tword life it's hard. Any suggestions?
