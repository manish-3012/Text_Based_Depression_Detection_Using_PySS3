I feel like I would be doing my kids (both infants) a service by just ceasing to exist.I can put on a show 90% of the time and play the normal happy character. But at home, especially at night, I can't keep it up. My wife doesn't get mental health at all. 

I honestly feel like I'm going to fuck my kids up in the future by being this way. They don't deserve to have a father like this.
