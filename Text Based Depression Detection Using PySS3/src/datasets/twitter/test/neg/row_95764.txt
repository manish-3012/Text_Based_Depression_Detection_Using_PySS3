If anyone is out there, I could use some support.I am 22 and just graduated with a degree in neuroscience and psychology. I have a loving and providing family. I have a girlfriend who loves me and would do anything for me. I was part of a fraternity and have 20+ guys that I consider brothers. Everyone seems to think things are going well for me.
I've been on medication since about 10. It started with anxiety. Then depression. Then I was diagnosed as bipolar. My current issue is insomnia. I began taking ambien to help me actually get to bed before the sun came up. But once I discovered the other affects if you don't sleep, it became a problem. I looked forward to "going to sleep" every day. Just because I knew I was going to get that ambien high. Over the span of 2 years I have had a regular prescription for it, along with samples of weaker sleeping pills. My father is also a doctor, so there is plenty of medication around the house. A month ago, I had a procedure done where I was given vicoden. I took one from the bottle and it had no effect. So I was given an additional bottle of percocet. I took the percocet for pain for the next week or so. And then I began to abuse them. I was mixing them with anything I could get my hands on. Valium, Xanax, Codeine, Ambien, lunesta, muscle relaxers... It was bad. Several nights I ended up stumbling into my parents room at 4 in the morning screaming about something, and yet all they did was put me to bed and keep quiet. It had only become apparent I had a problem when my girlfriend would tell me the verbal abuse I give her when I take them. I finally came clean to my family and we are seeing a therapist this week. My doctor has been giving me enougb so that I dont go through withdrawal. But all of the feelings of guilt and embarrassment are still there. I don't feel like I will ever get better. I've tried to stop on my own. Several times in the past few months. But I can't do it alone. My family has already seen one member go through rehab. I would never want them to have to deal with it again. At the current moment, my only reasons to keep living are to keep those I love happy. But with every passing day, I think it would be easier to live their lives without my burden.
