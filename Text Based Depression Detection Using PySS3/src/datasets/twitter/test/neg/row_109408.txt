What is your reason to live?Day after day I find life tiring. I don't understand how and why people keep living. The only reason I'm still here and will be tomorrow is because I feel like I have to out live my parents... I'm starting to wonder why I should even wait. Around my family and friends I'm that 'happy go lucky' person while on the inside I'm slowly dying. Is there really a way of feeling truly happy?

I'm wondering why does everyone around me seem so happy and why/how do they enjoy life so much?
Sorry if this is in the wrong place to put this... and thank you for reading.

Edit: Thank you all for replying.
