been here before and here I returnI see everyone around me, but I feel alone.  I see the smile cross their face and the laughter ensue yet I feel nothing.  I dont even play along but when people ask whats wrong I have no good answer.  I just dont feel right, I feel alone, I feel weak, I wish I had something to fight for.  Yet here I sit, wishing for something I dont have.  So why sit and wait, when there is any easy road to take which will make it better, forever
