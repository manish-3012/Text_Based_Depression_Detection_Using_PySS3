Completely devoid of hope. I don't even really know what I'm looking to get from posting this, but I have no one else to talk to so I guess I'll just dive in:
My life is cyclical. Everything always comes back around the place I started from. And the place I started from is a place of hopelessness, isolation, confusion and depression. And I never have anyone to blame but myself. 
I always insist on dousing everything I love in gasoline, tossing a match and standing as close as I dare, half terrified of the flames and half hoping they'll engulf me. I know I'm being melodramatic, but if you can't be dramatic on /r/SW, where can you? 
I have exactly one good thing going in my life and I can feel it slipping away from me. I just don't know what to do anymore. 
I'm so tired of being miserable. I'm so tired of feeling insecure and scared of losing the things I love. I feel like I haven't relaxed in years because I'm always so nervous that I'll lose what good things I have. 
I have wonderful friends who I'm sure would be a great help to me at this time, but I don't feel like I'm worthy of their time anymore. I feel like anyone I could feasibly call and cry to would just be annoyed to have to deal with me and would only put up to me out of obligation. I just feel so lonely and worthless and helpless and useless, etc. etc.
I don't know what to do anymore.
I'm so lost and scared and hurt. I feel wounded and defenseless. 
I don't feel like living as myself anymore. 
I don't feel like being a part of my life anymore.
I don't feel like being a part of this world anymore and I really just don't know what else to do.
