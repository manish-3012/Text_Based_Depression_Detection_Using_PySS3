Tired of livingI have been feeling tired both physically and mentally for couple years now. I'm currently studying at university and it's going to point that there is no reason to continue it as i barely pass any courses. I don't have energy to do anything more than just sit on pc or at couch watching tv.

I have been having suicidal thoughts for long time and only reason i'm still here is that i dont know where to get drugs and overdose.

Life feels like endless uphill without anything making in worthwhile and i want to go to sleep and never wake up. Weirdest part is that i dont have any problems with alcohol or such but just the depression. Also it just feels impossible to say anyone that i'm trying to decide between becoming unemployed loser or committing suicide
