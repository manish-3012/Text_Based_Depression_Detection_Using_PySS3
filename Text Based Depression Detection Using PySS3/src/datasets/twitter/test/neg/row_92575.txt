Money (or the lack there of) makes me want to dieLife sucks a lot. Iâ€™m pretty sure all of my problems stem from a horrible lack of money. I will be living paycheck to paycheck for the unforeseeable future. I was working on my masters degree (Iâ€™m a teacher) but whatâ€™s the point? I need a good, long nap.
