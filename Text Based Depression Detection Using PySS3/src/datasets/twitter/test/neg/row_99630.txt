I don't know anymore. This is a long story so uh, have fun if you read it.

Get ready for this mess of a story since my memory is all jumbled. 

I don't know anymore, but then again who does? We're born to die, eating up the earth as we go. And yet we claim to love it. We don't love the Earth, we love surviving after all it's human nature. People have kids just to leave them, or abuse them. Why? Who knows. Maybe they thought having a kid would make them a better person then changed their mind halfway down the road. Or maybe it was an accident that spanned 9 months. That's where I come in. Mom had me hoping I could turn her life around and get her off drugs. 3 years after I was born she decided to get back on them and she left. My bio dad left before I was even born so there is that. And so I was left with my grandparents woo. Except they weren't expecting to raise a kid in their late 60's so I was left alone more often than not. They were great people, but busy. My grandmother worked all the time, my grandpa had M.S. and worked from home. I was a scared kid, scared of everything and anything. The dark, a new person, you name it. Maybe because both my parents left me at a young age. Then surprise, my mom is back when I was 5. She wants to be my mom again. Make up your damn mind. She takes me to a rehab which doesnt work. she takes me to druggie's friends houses. And even abusive boyfriends houses. Thanks. I was a timid kid at school, no one really talked to me and neither did I. I was isolated on every front. I found myself always sad in Elementary school. I latched onto my mom because she was the only biological parent I had, though she would always be high or taking me somewhere a kid shouldn't be. Sometimes she would miss birthday parties, and sometimes she would leave after telling me she was going to the bathroom. I gained trust issues. When dads and donuts day rolled around, I always found myself asking if I had a dad, how was I even born without a dad. I didn't realize he had left too. 

Later on down the road my mom is back yet again with this new dude named John and his daughter Cadence who was 5. They move into my grandma and grandpa's house and are soon proclaimed "family" My step dad and step sister. We move into a small condo a couple blocks away from my grandparents and this is when the real hell starts. My mom is off of drugs now, but a heavy drinker. So is my step dad. Parties would occur at least once or twice a week with a bunch of drunk adults who'd scream or even try and hurt me and all I could do was lock myself in my room while some banged on my door. My step sister suffered the same fate. Except I didn't want to be her brother, I was raised an only child my whole life and now I'm expected to be a brother with some kid I don't even know. I wasn't having it, we constantly got into fights and I'd push her and always be blamed. This is when I started to hate life for the bulls*** it is. At school I had no friends, I was too scared to talk to any one and I hated every second of it. There was no where I wanted to be, as it all lead to suffering. So I turned to video games. Hours upon hours of distraction from real life, my only solace. If they didn't exist, I probably would've already killed myself. My grandparents and I didn't talk as much after I moved, I don't know what happened to our relationship. But the summer before 8th grade something terrible happened. I was sitting on my computer and I heard the news from my uncle that my grandpa had died. The closest male role model in my life had died. I start crying and run to my grandparents house past all the neighbors and my family and see my grandpa's dead body on the bathroom floor. Just lying there, unable to get up because of his M.S. holding a phone probably trying to call for help before he died.
 I felt numb. The world was already so sh**, but it always find a way to get worse. We have his funeral and I can't bring myself to cry again I just buried the emotions. He was gone, the man who took me on adventures as a kid even though he couldn't walk, like skiing and riding horses. The man who helped raise me. Dead on the ground. This happened when i was 13. My grandma at this same time developed a severe case of Alzheimer probably from all the grief and stress. And she wasn't the same either, always asking what happened to her husband, and always being told he went on a trip. Or that he passed away, which she would weep to every time. I couldn't handle losing my grandpa, and seeing my grandma deteriorate was crushing. My grandma needed someone to watch her and since no one would I decided that I would. I told my mom and she didn't really seem to care always being drunk. My step dad didn't care either, as he was literally never not drunk. He had it so bad if he didn't drink he would shake and hurt. So I moved in to my grandmas, taking care of her at nights to make sure she would go to sleep and not run away. ME an 8th grader taking care of someone with Alzheimer while full time attending school while having no friends and no parents to give a f*** either. Life was great. This is when I'd put 100% of my free time into video games.  Then i'd help get my grandma to sleep when I wasn't helping her I'd go back to video games. I hated life, every f****** second. The sad thing is, I decided I'd rather live there than with my mom and step dad always drunk and angry and abusive. I'd rather take care of my dying grandma. School was also absolute hell. People would make fun of me for being so weird. I couldn't stand it. Why is life so unfair. Eventually a caretaker was hired to take care of my grandma full time when she couldn't even use the bathroom on her own. But instead of moving back with my mom and step dad and step sister I stayed with my grandma. And even though there was a caretaker around, I was still a big part of helping calm down my grandma since she knew me. Once i get past 8th grade enters 9th. I make two friends, who are okay I guess but could give less of a shit about my life. My grandma is moved into a senior living place by my mom and I have no choice but to move back into my mom's house when my step dads pancreas explodes from too much drinking. He did survive and was treated at the hospital but couldn't drink again. My mom stopped too. But by then the damage was done. They are better people now, but I don't think I'll ever be able to trust them. My grandma passes away in 10th and I play the piano at her funeral. And now I'm in 11th grade again isolated with no friends, and my parents aren't really helping. I just want out of this life, its not worth it. Everyone I try to make friends with thinks I'm weird and clingy. I don't want to live knowing that is what life is. I haven't found the guts to kill myself yet though. I guess I just needed that off my chest. I doubt anyone will read this, and get this far but nonetheless I still wrote it.
