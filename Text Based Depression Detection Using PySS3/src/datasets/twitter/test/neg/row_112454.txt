I'm 21 and I've been suicidal since 13.I have no want or desire to live anymore. I used to believe that old "it'll get better" saying, but after nearly a decade of constant suicidal tendencies, I no longer believe it.
The only reason I'm still alive is so that I don't cause my mother more grief. She had an abusive mother, absolutely shitty sisters, and had to take care of her mentally retarded brother and her father with Alzheimers for years on end because her sisters wouldn't. Just what she needs now is for one of her kids to blow his brains out in the forest somewhere. 
How much longer do I have to deal with this just to make sure I don't hurt anybody? This is probably one of the darkest things I'll ever say, but I wish she would die soon (peacefully) so that I can finally end this fucking facade once and for all.
I just want to give up and die.
