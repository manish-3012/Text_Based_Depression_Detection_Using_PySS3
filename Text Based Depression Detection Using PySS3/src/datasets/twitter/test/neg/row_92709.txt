Feeling really lowHi I posted here a few days ago about my attempt. One of my exâ€™s from a couple of years ago has been stalking me and belittled me when I told them about my attempt and how close I came. I trusted them and thought theyâ€™d changed but they havenâ€™t theyâ€™re the same manipulative person. Iâ€™m feeling so down right now and just need to talk to someone about this. They didnâ€™t care at all about me telling them the details which are so personal to me. I just feel guilty for even being alive.
