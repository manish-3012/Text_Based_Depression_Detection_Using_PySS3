Iâ€™m going to kill myself either tomorrow or the day afterThis is probably my last post. I just canâ€™t take it anymore. I just wanted to let everyone know that I am not an attention seeker. This is no joke. I am seriously going to end my life. If you havenâ€™t seen my previous post, just know that I planned to die sometime this month. TLDR: I am a 25 year old man. I have no friends. I have no siblings. My parents have a lot of friends. I canâ€™t talk properly because of my speech problems. My dog died a few years ago. My grandmothers also died. Iâ€™m ugly. I have no girlfriend. Job interviews are impossible with my speech problems. I canâ€™t work for my dad forever. He wants me to do something else. I have no other options. My only option now is death. 

Unlike that situation, I have a suicide backup plan. I found hooks on the ceiling in the laundry room. All I have to do is get rope or my clothes and hang myself. I just need to jump to end it all. After making an app for my dad, there is no turning back. I would rather choose death than feel worthless for the rest of my life. Honestly, everyone would be better off without me. I just wanted to reach out to others before I pass away.

P.S My mom always feared I would die alone someday. Tomorrow, Iâ€™m going to die alone.
