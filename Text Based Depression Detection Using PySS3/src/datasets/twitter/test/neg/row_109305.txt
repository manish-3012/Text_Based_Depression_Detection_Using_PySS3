Why is suicide so frowned uponObviously a temp and im new to reddit so sorry if this is unclear:

I honestly dont understand why suicide is such a frowned upon and depressing subject in our society. I plan to die peacefully in about a week and i honestly just feel happy. I have achieved all i want and i feel satisfied with myself. I believe i have grown as a person, had some amazing experiences and met some amazing people. I just feel like I'm ready for an end. There is just no reason to continue, i feel complete with this world.  At the moment im doing as much as i can to support my loved ones in death, i understand that may feel grief for a while but im sure that time will heal. This might not be the right subreddit but i just dont really understand societies outlook on situations like my own.
