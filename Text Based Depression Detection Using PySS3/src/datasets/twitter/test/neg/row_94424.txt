I know how I am going to die; I have it planned out. I just don't have the guts to do it and that's the only reason I am still here.I know how and what I am going to do to end my life. I don't want to die; I'd much rather get better, but at the same time I wish I'd just get hit by a truck. It's easier for me, looks like an accident and I won't become a suicide statistic. But still, I know what I'll do. I'm too much of a wimp. I have no guts to actually go through with it. I'm too scared it's going to fail and that's the only reason I'm not going to do it.
Idk why I'm sharing this. There's more important people to read about. I guess I'm safe until I get the courage. A part of me wishes I won't ever get the courage, but a part of me does. I just felt like telling someone this.
