You ever just really want to die?Everything in my life is going really well, but the smallest thing seemed like it wasnâ€™t really going my way (until it did, actually), and now all I can think about is that I donâ€™t want to deal with this shit and just want to die, and I cut for the first time in forever just to watch the blood trickle down my arm, but Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll feel fine tomorrow.

Does this happen to anyone else? Just no capacity to deal with any degree of emotional adversity?
