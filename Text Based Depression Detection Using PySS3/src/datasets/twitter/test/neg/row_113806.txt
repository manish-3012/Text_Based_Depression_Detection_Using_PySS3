im so tired of being a horrible personi'm a horrible person. i have so much pent up resentment for people that i don't know what to do with all of it. its better i kill myself than go spew my toxicity anyway. i wish i had never met the person who abused me i wish it so badly. id be NORMAL. i'd be going to college and living my life. i might be in a relationship. i might be happy but no. instead im stuck in this infinite loop of being suspicious and secretly disgusted by an entire gender. i spent so much time trying to get into my abuser's head and figuring out why he did it to me. why he didn't stop when i cried. why he instead chose to hit me over the head so hard that i have long lasting brain damage. why he didnt stop when i screamed. i dont understand and im so humiliated that it even happened to me that the only time i can talk about it without having a full on flashback is when im drunk or so fucked up that i can't even see straight. the first time i talked about what happened was on reddit lol and the only person who commented was like r/ that happened. disheartening to say the least when i literally had to take a year off college because i would walk into another room and forget where i was or what year it fucking was.

why did this have to happen to me? why me? what did i do wrong? before this i was a good person. i made mistakes but i wasn't hateful. i didn't ever try to hurt people. now i'm just a giant vat of toxicity and hatred and fear and even after 2 years of therapy and emdr i still am not over it and i wish i was SO badly. i just dont want to be here any more. i dont want people to have to listen to me, i dont want more people to feel bad and suffer when i lash out and treat them like they ARE my abuser because they share a gender with him. i dont want to be scared of men i dont want to be bitter and cruel but here i am, basically turning into a mgtow but female version all because some idiot chud decided to fracture my skull. i hate my fucking life and it would be so much better if i just stopped hurting people
