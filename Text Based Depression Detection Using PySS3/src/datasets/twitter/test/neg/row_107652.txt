Why care?Everything is just pointless bullshit. Give me a reason to care about anything else, because right now the only thing I care about is getting out of this fucking worthless existence.

They always tell me theyâ€™ll care if I kill myself. Why lie to me? Iâ€™m 1 in over 7,000,000,000. Less than a percent of a percent of the worldâ€™s population. Iâ€˜m pointless, and no one should act like theyâ€™ll give a shit when I finally die.
