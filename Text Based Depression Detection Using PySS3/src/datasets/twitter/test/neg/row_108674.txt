I don't know what to do I need someoneThis is the worst time of my life. My girlfriend left me and I don't want anyone else ever and she isn't coming back and I fucked everything up and I fucked my life up. I have 2 or 3 people who care at all and that's my dad brother and one friend. Everyone leaves me everyone has my whole life and I haven't been happy ever as far as I can remember. This isn't fair I don't deserve this and it isn't fair that I have no say in if I continue this bullshit.
