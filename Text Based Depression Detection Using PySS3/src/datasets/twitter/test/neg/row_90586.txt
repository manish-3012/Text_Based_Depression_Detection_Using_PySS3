I think I understand why some suicidal people seem happier than usual before they kill themselves.I've tried to change myself, to stop being so depressed all the time.  To get out and make friends.  To be less lazy.  Occasionally I succeed, but it's always short-lived.  I feel like I'm on top of the world for a day or two, and then I come crashing back down to my shitty reality.

This crash is one of the hardest things to deal with.  It feels like life is reminding me that no matter what I do, I'll never be happy.  That I can't pull myself out of this hole.  So I'm probably about to end it for good, because I don't see any way out.
