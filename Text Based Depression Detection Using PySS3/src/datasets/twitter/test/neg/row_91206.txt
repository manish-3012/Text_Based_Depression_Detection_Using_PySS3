I keep having thoughts about killing myselfThis is a throwaway because my husband knows my regular username. I can't help just thinking about how easy it will be to kill myself. I want to do it but I can't bare to put my kids through that pain. Besides my kids and husband I truly believe no one else will miss me. 

I've tried it in the past and sadly I was unsuccessful.

I'm the sole provider for my family. I have a job that most people consider wonderful. I constantly fake being happy. It hurts to fake it but I have to. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. My life insurance doesn't cover suicide.  So I've been slowly building up a savings account with my "fun" money just in case. I have no friends anymore. I can tell Reddit because I'm anonymous here.  I'm tired of waiting to die. I've tried therapy in the past and it never helped.  I just want this to end.
