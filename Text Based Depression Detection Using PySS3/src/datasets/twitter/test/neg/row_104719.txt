This is why I don't talk to my parents about thingsI've always had a difficult time in school. It's not that I'm not doing the work or that I'm not studying, it's that I can't. I cannot pay attention to anyone when they're talking and I forget everything whithin less than a minute. I'm afraid to ask teachers about what they said because I don't like talking and I think they're are going to get mad at me for not listening. I get distracted by everything and I mean literally everything. I'm always fidgeting, like staying still is a myth. Fidgeting with everything in my hand leads to me using and losing 20 pencils and pens per week. I have no friends. While everyone at lunch is sitting at a crowded table, I'm sitting by myself, staring at a wall. I never talk at school except when necessary. I told my parents about although I was hesitant, since I thought they would make fun of me, but I later decided to talk to them because they were my parents and I didn't think they would actually do that. I was wrong. I told my mom and she kept saying that this was normal. It was normal to have social anxiety. She said God made me perfect so I don't need professional help. They actually started laughing. We went to the doctor today because of something else and I asked my mom to tell him about this problem but she refused and at the car ride home she actually got mad at me. I don't know what to do. I can't do better at school because I procrastinate uncontrollably. I've never not done a project before the day before it was due.
I hate Nintendo. Their games are the only reason I haven't commited suicide. I just want to die. If I can't ask my parents to get help for me about school, how can I expect then to help me with my depression?
