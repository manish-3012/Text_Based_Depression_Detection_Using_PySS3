Does anyone else wonder if people really know how depressed you are?I constantly imagine what people's reactions would be to knowing that I have suicidal depression and anxiety. Particularly the people most responsible for making me this way. I wonder if they would feel any remorse at all if I killed myself. 

I wonder if anyone would care if I killed myself. If people would suddenly start caring. 

I hate my life, and nearly everyone in it.

Help.
