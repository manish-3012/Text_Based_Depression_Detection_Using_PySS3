Life is only getting worse...Title says it. I don't feel my life getting better at all and it's been years now.

I'm alone in this world. 
Friends? Ha, They have no time for me. 
Family? Ha, they could care less about me.
Parents? Getting divorced and want me to be in the middle of it.
Money? Hell no. Got about $3 bucks in my wallet to last me 2 weeks.

I also just got demoted at my job which basically was a personal shot at me due to the fact that I work my ass off and what do I get? Demoted.

I cut myself quite often at night because I NEVER sleep anymore and when I do, I get maybe 2-3 hours. 

People tell me all the time that it'll get better or some dumb shit like that, I don't believe one word of it. My life's been like this for about 4 years now, and only getting worse.

I've tried counselling, medication, and just plain trying to be happy and it never works. Always backfires on me.

I just want to be ok for once....
