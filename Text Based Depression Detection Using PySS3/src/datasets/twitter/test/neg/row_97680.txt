.fuck the world
fuck my life
fuck love
fuck

I wish life could be different 
I hope life will be different
Only once I'm gone

I'm sick of being in constant pain
I'm done trying to fake it

I wish there was an easy way to do it
To end my suffering
To have the life I never had

I hate you
I love you
I miss you
I wish I could be with you
But it looks like I ruined that
Just like I ruin everything

I never belonged here
Not on this world
Not in this universe
Maybe somewhere else

Maybe I'm a king
Maybe I'm nothing

I hope you find what you're looking for
I haven't

Goodbye
