Just die...Don't you feel like you just wan't to stop living?

It's not like I wanna kill myself or something about that. It's more like just die, stop living anymore. 

Everyone is happy, and that's cool, your family is rigth, everything is fine. So you're just standing there, alive.

You don't feel anymore, you just wait for something to happen, and that moment doesen't come, so you don't know what to do. You think that if you leave now nobody's wonna notice, everyone has their life and there gonna feel happy either way you leave or not.

'cause that's the way i feel.

BTW. srry for the english
