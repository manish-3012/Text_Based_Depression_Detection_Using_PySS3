Iâ€™m the toxic oneWhy should I continue to live and try to improve myself when I am the toxic one? 

I have lied about too much, and was just told that even my greatest efforts will not be enough to fix anything and they arenâ€™t ever going to get back with me.

I mean I wouldnâ€™t forgive myself either, but how am I supposed to continue when I can never fix anything? How am I supposed to keep on living like this? I hate myself, all I do is cause pain to others. I donâ€™t want to live like this anymore.
