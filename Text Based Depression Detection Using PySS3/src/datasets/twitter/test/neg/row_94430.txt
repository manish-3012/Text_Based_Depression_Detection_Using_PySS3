Is this the only way to restart my life ?Is death the only way to restart it all again ? ... I am tired of myself .... I could not get everything right the past 5 years. My life is now a mess and I know it's not getting any better the next 50 years. It's all over for me now. I surrendered........ Yes, I am a freaking coward you can say, but I am just tired... I am useless... I don't know why but everything I did just lead to failures. Now everybody I know is laughing behind me, I know my death would be their happiness. I don't care... I just want to get away from this miserable pathetic life....................
