I wish someone could save me but thatâ€™s selfish : (I know, I shouldnâ€™t expect others to solve my issues but Iâ€™m ill, I need help really badly. Iâ€™m so close all the time to thinking about actually doing it, it hurts so much. I know I have to be strong and independent before I can start relationships with people but fuck it, I never show myself any self care so I need someone to help me haha. 

Honestly. I donâ€™t want to sound selfish but I canâ€™t do this alone, I canâ€™t be strong. I try my best but people run away from me like the plague. 

Why!
