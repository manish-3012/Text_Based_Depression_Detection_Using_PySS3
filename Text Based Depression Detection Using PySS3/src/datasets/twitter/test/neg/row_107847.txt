Thinking about suicide more than normalI've had bouts of depression before. I'm in a shitty relationship right now. It's not even a relationship. It's more like a guy I'm having sex with who is emotionally unavailable and not respectful of me. I ask him not to call me certain things. He says he'll try not to and then go and do it. I hit him yesterday in the chest as a warning when he said it again. I immediately felt awful. 

We both don't respect one another. I think about how fucking awful I am. He told me he doesn't love himself. I am hanging on by a thread in loving my own self. I hate myself so many times throughout the day. I think about how nice it would be to not live anymore to escape this rollercoaster. The feelings and moodswings are too overwhelming to bare most of the time.

I'm unsatisfied with this relationship and therefore my life right now. I want to get rid of the negative shit. I want the suicidal thoughts to stop. The impulse I would get to cut myself when I was a teenager are taking different forms now. I'm directing my anger outward at others and it's scaring me. I want to die, I don't want to hurt anyone else. 

I find it hard to forgive myself. Is life worth it when moments of happiness and feeling alive are so fleeting? What does it feel like to take down the barricades of ambivalence? The numbness is paralyzing me, I don't know how to make it end.
