I'm bad at everything except school OR A gentle reminder, nothing I do matters Part IIIWell, I got the job, despite all the red flags. And I had my first... "review" today. As expected. I am shitting the bed. After the kind of feedback I got "We're surprised.... (not in a good way)" "We think you're holding back." "You're taking too long on simple tasks." "Asking basic questions." "Do your own work next time." "Lack of attention to detail." 

The only place I ever experienced any kind of success was school. Even then, mediocre student. I tried going back to stay, professor was my goal, and that didn't work out either. 

I am utterly useless, if this next quarter doesn't meet expectations, then perhaps it's time. 

You may be thinking "Don't give up so soon!" Thinking I'm a year or two or three out of school. 

No. I'm 40. I've been doing this for 15 years, barely getting by, so I do know what I'm talking about here.
