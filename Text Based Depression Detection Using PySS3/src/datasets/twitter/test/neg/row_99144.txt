No reason to stay alive - ugly bitchI canâ€™t think of a single reason to stay alive.
My dad is dying of cancer. All my friends left me and Iâ€™m constantly alone at school and spend all my free time in my room when I donâ€™t have to watch my dad. I am falling behind in all my classes because of this. Every boy I have tried to get with has rejected me because Iâ€™m ugly and have a shit personality. I canâ€™t achieve my goals in life bc Iâ€™m ugly (check post history). I just want someone to care. I just want to die. I cannot interact with anyone anymore. They donâ€™t understand. I am feeling an unbearable amount of pain. I stopped sleeping and have been staying up for nights on end just scrolling through 4chan. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I hate trying to make people happy and having them shit on me. I hate having to be a therapist for my whole family and constantly on a mix of antidepressants. I am tired of these normies and how they want me to always smile and be happy when my life is shit. They literally hate me  and wonâ€™t talk to me if Iâ€™m not constantly smiles all the time. This life is a fucking joke. Im tired and I canâ€™t wait to sleep forever in bliss. I probably wonâ€™t even kill myself ill just cut again tonight whatever because I can never fuckint do it i never have the strength to just end it all. PS if you found my reddit account and you are from school trying to make fun of me Hahahahhaahhaha you got me hahahaha hahah go enjoy your fucking life go to a party go fuck yourself get the hell off my account you fucking normie POS
