I donâ€™t want the helpIâ€™ve just been released from being baker acted in the hospital for an attempt to OD. This is my second attempt and donâ€™t understand why I canâ€™t go. Next time I will just have to jump off a very tall building. I donâ€™t wanna be here. Nothing excites me anymore. I only like to drink, which makes my depression like ten times worse, or get high. Iâ€™m tired of people telling me that I need to go get help. I donâ€™t want the help!!! I feel like the therapist is just there to â€œfake careâ€ about me and I feel like Iâ€™m just paying somebody to listen to my problems. I guess thatâ€™s what it is but am I really that terrible and abnormal that I have to PAY someone for that?? I just wish I couldâ€™ve been born normal and not born with my mind and my thoughts! I canâ€™t look in the mirror most days and when I do, I donâ€™t even understand what Iâ€™m looking at. I just try to think back to the times when before I was so sad. Iâ€™ve been sexually abused in the past and it doesnâ€™t help. I just wanna go back to when I didnâ€™t know how cruel the world could be. I have an amazing boyfriend who was broken after my attempt and heâ€™s the only reason I have to live right now. I find myself looking for reasons for me to leave him so that I wonâ€™t feel guilty when I finally successfully can kill my self.
