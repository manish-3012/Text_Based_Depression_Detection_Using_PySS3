There is something really wrong with meSo, I'm really struggling at the moment with lots of things. This staying at home has really messed up by schoolwork. I'm back at school now, and I have found that my grades are beginning to fall. I'm getting worried that my final grades won't be good enough. I've heard many people tell me it's not the end of the world if I don't do as desired, but I feel like it is. Because I don't have any talents, skills, interests, passions or a decent personality to succeed in life. So, my grades are the only thing that I'm sort of good at and provides me my only chance of getting somewhere.

I have no idea what I want to do in the future. I finish school at the end of this year, and I still don't have a clue at all. Everyone else has an idea. But I'm just confused. I don't really have many friends either and I've cut out a lot of my family. So, life is lonely a lot of the time. I deal with devastating social anxiety, and it has held me back so many times and has even caused me to do such stupid things.

These last couple of days, I have done nothing besides school. Just mostly stayed in my room looking at my phone. I have no motivation for anything anymore. I used to like making videos and playing the keyboard. Now when I try, I just don't feel up to it. I don't even feel motivated to play video games or anything. That is how bad it is.

I have little hope for myself, and I have been dealing with suicidal thoughts for a couple of years though. I've set dates but never gone through with them in the end. I was supposed to have done it at the beginning of this year, but I was too scared as always. I'm stuck.
