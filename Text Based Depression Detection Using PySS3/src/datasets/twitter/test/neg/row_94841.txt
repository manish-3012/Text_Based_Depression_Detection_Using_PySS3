I need helpFor the past two weeks my girlfriend has been feeling extremely depressed, sad, frustrated and has contemplated ending it all on many occasions. 

She's diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses and has been in hospital multiple times for attempts at suicide before we met. 

I do everything i can im always there giving her support, but ultimately at times i feel like anything i try to do is pointless. 

Yesterday we had a big fight and i had a panic attack because we made plans the night before to see eachother and then she decided last minute that she didn't want to go out. Which fair enough she's not a morning person. 

But then a few hours later she was with her friends and all i could think was "does she not want to see me?" i felt unloved, broken, in pain and i had a giant panic attack over it. 

Ive never done self harm before but last night i dug cuts into my arm. I regret doing it but at the time i felt pushed to hurt myself. 

Later the same night she asked that she wanted a break from our relationship Her saying this broke me i needed her support more than ever but she's been pushing me away when i most need her making me feel worthless and unloved. 

For most of today all ive been doing is stay in bed crying thinking so many negative thoughts and yes as this sub reddit is titled ive had thoughts of ending it all. 

Someone please help me i want things to be good with us again im scared she'll do something horrible to herself again and im also scared that ill do something horrible to myself again.
