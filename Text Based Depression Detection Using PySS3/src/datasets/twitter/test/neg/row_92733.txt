I have nothing to live forMy names KC, 15, F

Thereâ€™s nothing for me to live for. My family wouldnâ€™t care if Iâ€™m not here anymore. Even my best friend said she doesnâ€™t care about my feelings. No one cares. I could end it all today and finally be free from the pain. I wouldnâ€™t have to worry about school, my weight, my insecurities, Iâ€™d finally be free.

I just feel so empty inside, like Iâ€™m not even alive Iâ€™m just here. Iâ€™m tired of trying Iâ€™m tired of crying I just want it all to be over. Everyday Iâ€™m here the pain gets worse, my heart gets heavier, the tears get stronger. I just want to be free. I just want to be happy. I just want to go away.
