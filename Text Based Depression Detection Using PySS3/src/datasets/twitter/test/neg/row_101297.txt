I ruined my reputation..I ruined my reputation because of my mistakes. I canâ€™t get these mistakes out of my head. I feel like I cannot live with myself anymore. I feel guilty because of it. Everything make sense to be done with life and give up. I wish there was a way to leave the world without hurting my family.
