KeysEveryone has some kind. Whether it be to a car, a house, what have you. Something so simple that is used on a daily basis.  Sometimes we lose them. No big deal. Most of us have a second set or can get a replacement.  Unfortunately I couldn't replace the car key without dropping $300.00 that I don't have right now.  That left me opening the Mariana Trench of pain and having to contact the ex wife.   Not at all ideal. But she had the other set still.  So I had to drive 5 hours round trip. Plenty of time to think. Plenty of time to feel that searing pain that has all disappeared into the empty Xanax bottles that line my bedroom floor.  They are in good company with the empty alcohol bottles.  Everyone needs friends ya know.   I get there and she still taunts my severe depression.  She still fails to see that the walls that were mine only existed to keep the broken pieces of me inside.  And I'm still the asshole for walking away when she told me to.  I fight tooth and nail to try to retain some semblance of a psuedo happiness.   Nope.  I'm still the abject failure.   Only wish I would have let that pile of rattlesnakes that I uncoverd yesterday bite me.  I wouldn't feel this blade on my skin again.  I wouldn't feel the flame of despair burn my tattered pieces.
