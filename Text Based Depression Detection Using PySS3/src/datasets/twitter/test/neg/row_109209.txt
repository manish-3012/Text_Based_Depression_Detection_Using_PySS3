I'm going to kill myself tomorrow evening. Should I write a note?My plan is very simple: go buy rope during the day, then when it's dark outside go to a nearby park and hang myself there. I even have the knot type and position figured out. One question remains though, should I write a suicide note? I have absolutely no idea what I'd write on one, any ideas would be appreciated.
