Thinking about doing it tomorrow.I have held a knife against my throat many times. Once I was hospitalized even. Now I know I can't do it with a knife. But I know that if i get drunk tomorrow, I will be able to make up for my cowardice with alcohol and jump in the metro.  


I already tried changing my life. Lost weight, got more in shape, gained hobbies and friends, stopped being antisocial, passed everything at uni and started taking it seriously... Sounds perfect right, I used to think that if I got that, I would be the happiest man alive... But it doesn't change a single thing. It's just as bad as it ever was... Doesn't improve in the slightest. Nothing really brings me joy. I just see all my failures one after the other.  


So yeah, I just thought I would put it out here, just to write it even. I don't expect anything else really. I just hope I'll carry this out tomorrow.
