Fucked up my high school career and entire life, not sure how to fix it. My thoughts are eating me alive.I apologize for the upcoming wall of text, but please hear me out. I'm at the end of my rope.

To start, I'm 16, my last day of high school was this past Tuesday. I'm two years ahead. I have 1 1/2 credits to finish online over summer, which I'm halfway done with, as opposed to taking 6 unnecessary classes that could damage my GPA next year.

I work a job 35hrs/wk and make about $900 a month. I currently have $400 to my name and my next paycheck is on the 27th.

My license is suspended due to truancy (didn't turn in absence notes, biggest mistake of my life. Got the letter 20 days before school ended saying my license would be suspended if I didn't serve 30 full days of school, didn't have time to do that and the state DMV isn't responding to us to have it fixed.)

My parents want me to quit my job because my hours are usually 5-11 weekdays or 12-10 on Sundays and despite this being an hour earlier than my curfew (12) before I got grounded two months ago, they say it's too late to be working. I'm lucky to even have a job. I have to beg them to let me work. 11pm is curfew (at least for work I think) for 16 year olds where I live and I think it's completely normal as my friends work the same hours, but maybe I'm wrong.

The reason I'm in trouble with my parents, and understandably so:

My ex boyfriend of a year and a half (18 y/o, met when I was 14 &amp; him 16) got upset at me and told my parents I had a party involving alcohol at a friend's for my 16th birthday party, meanwhile he was having sex with another girl which is why he was accusing me of so many things &amp; verbally abusing me. (Yes I left him, and no it doesn't bother me now - this was a little over a month ago. Who cares. We're young.) -- oh and so you know, it was an actual serious mature relationship that both of our parents agreed with. Not some holding hands and movies shit, we actually had a nice relationship until he lost his marbles. Anyways...

A while back, My parents signed a contract agreeing to emancipate me when I start college (August) if I was able to support myself financially (I would be by then as far as a place to live - emancipation rules where I live don't say I need a car or anything, just money to pay rent, bills, etc. and I could live with another adult instead of having my own place) but they found a bunch of old old old pictures from my party days (really old, I've gotten my shit together since then I swear, I'm completely sober now. It was nothing other than the usual teenage drinking and smoking and I regret it all immensely) and they now have pictures to deem me too irresponsible to be on my own in court.. There was a goof picture of my boobs with my friend in it (nothing sexy just a silly picture we'd taken before a shower. Fully clothed, shirt was just up. Things really do follow you around, huh?... It wasn't online, just on my camera roll. Stupid choice, I know). My stepdad had taken my cell phone and emailed this picture to himself. Which freaks me out even more because my bio. Dad raped me when I was young repeatedly and I don't feel comfortable with men at all now.. I told my mom but he said it was just to show my therapist. Is there really a need to SHOW her?! Just tell her! Don't humiliate me and show my private areas to everyone and their cats!

So basically I'm as grounded as possible, I'm not supposed to have a phone (I PAY MY OWN PHONE BILL TOO!) but my friend came to visit me at work and surprised me with an iPhone which I use on wifi to finish my online course and iMessage friends and whatnot. 

I'm at my wits end. I'm trying to show them I'm responsible and not that person anymore, but they're not believing it. I clean the house, I do what I'm expected to do. I do my own laundry, keep the house clean, do the dishes, etc. Things a typical mature teenager that respects themselves and their parents would do. 

I know I've made poor decisions, and no I don't WANT to move out, but I've always felt as though I'd be better supporting myself rather than being treated now like I'm 12. It's leading me into a very dark place that I spent years coaxing myself out of without much help, and I'm starting to get scared of myself. I know this sounds like a normal punishment, which it is, but I'm about to be in college, I work, I do what I'm expected to, yet I'm given no leeway.. I do a lot for my parents and they do a lot for me. They care about me very much and I don't want them to worry about whether I can make proper decisions. I know that I can, I just wish they'd treat me like the young lady I am and the woman I am becoming/going to become. :( 

I've started making a plan to run away out of state to my best friends' place, I know it's illegal but I'm starting to have suicidal thoughts from thinking I'm not good enough. Please help.

On a scarier note, my biological dad found out where I work and comes in every day trying to talk to me and stands at my register for half an hour until I acknowledge his existence and I'm scared he's going to get me fired. 

What do I do.. My mind is blank and I can't feel anything anymore, I just want my suffering to end. 2 years is temporary but it's not to me. I can't think rationally right now.
