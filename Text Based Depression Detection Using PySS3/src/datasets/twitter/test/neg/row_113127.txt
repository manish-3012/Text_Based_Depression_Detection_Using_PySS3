School makes me want to blow my fucking brains outIâ€™m a sophomore in high school with a 3.56 GPA (on the 4 scale) and iâ€™m in all pre ap/AP classes and my grades are going to shit and the work load is overwhelming and i donâ€™t learn anything anymore and i have lost all work ethic and all motivation to do anything. i literally canâ€™t work anymore. i just procrastinate indefinitely. if i get rejected from BU iâ€™m killing myself
