Why does suicide seem rational to me?While I do suffer from depression, I am getting treatment for it, and I am in no imminent danger from self-harm, nor do I have a plan for suicide. 

But I have been thinking about it quite a bit, and I believe that the more I think about it, the more suicide seems like a rational - rather than emotional - option. 

I believe I am at the peak of my potential as a human being. I am likely never to find a life-long mate.  I believe that my best days are behind me, and that I don't have the ability to accomplish much more for either my own selfish benefit or for society as a whole.  While friends and family would be hurt by my suicide (and indeed, this is the most compelling reason not to), I believe that if that was not a factor, I don't really have a whole lot of reason to keep on living. 

In short: throughout my adult life, each year has been worse than the one before it, economically, politically, emotionally, physically.  And while I have simple joys from time to time, I also have near-constant suffering.  My current day-to-day activities are hardly what I'd call "accomplishments."  I have written a book which no one would read, I feel that my career skills are obsolete, and that I lack the ability to go back for some sort of retraining. 

I believe that the societal problems will only get worse, and that we are headed for a violent breakdown, and to be honest, I'd rather not deal with that. 

Again - I have no real plan for suicide, and I wouldn't consider myself "at risk."  But the more I think about it, the more I consider not existing as superior to existing; it is not that I want to die, or that I want to cease to exist; but rather, I feel like I am a waste of resources.  We are given a limited time span in which to accomplish things, but I feel I cannot accomplish anything of value.  So, there's little point in delaying the inevitable.
