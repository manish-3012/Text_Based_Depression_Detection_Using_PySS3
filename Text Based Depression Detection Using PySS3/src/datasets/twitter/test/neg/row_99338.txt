Iâ€™m finally ready to dieFor weeks Iâ€™ve been feeling like stuff shouldnâ€™t have happened, nothing feels real because I should have died years ago. Life is meaningless and the world would be better off without me and no one would care anyway. I donâ€™t feel anything but sadness and numbness anymore so whatâ€™s the point.
