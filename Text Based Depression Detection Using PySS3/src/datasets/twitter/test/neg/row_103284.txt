social anxiety is killing me.My social anxiety is ruining life for me. I was suicidal a few months back and decided to give one last shot to â€˜putting myself out thereâ€™ so I could make friends &amp; connections, however, it proved impossible for me because I just care so much about others thoughts of me. I barely talk at all because I donâ€™t want people to judge what I have to say. In public I never make eye contact, and try to get in/out of places as fast as possible because Iâ€™m worried someone will be thinking I look like shit, or something. Itâ€™s so hard to exist. Some of the only places I can go (for fun) is concerts because I feel anonymous and unjudged in big crowds, so I spend a lot of time doing that but thatâ€™s like once every few months. Iâ€™m afraid to date because I know a lot of men prefer bubbly or outgoing girls, and that they will judge me for being shy when they meet me (this is why online dating never pans out for me, I am terrified of being judged in person). I am 28 and living like a hermit, no social life. I donâ€™t know what to do, and feel like giving up on everything. Iâ€™m sorry if I come across as whiney or something, but I have no one to speak to in my everyday life and just am lost.
