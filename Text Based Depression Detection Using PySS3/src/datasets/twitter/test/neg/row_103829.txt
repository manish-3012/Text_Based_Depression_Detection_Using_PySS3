Unfortunate diseaseAn unfortunate disease known as bipolar disorder has completely suffocated my life. I cannot seem to win the war against it and everything I know and love eventually leaves because of it. Usually I would be on a forum like this when I am depressed but tonight I am highly manic; considering suicide as a solution to the bipolar problem. I ask this- would it not be better to put those who love me through one intense pain now than many, many more painful experiences throughout the course of the rest of my possibly long lived life? Perhaps in this instance, suicide could be considered a sacrifice rather than an act of hopelessness, though I suppose it would be both come to think of it. If I had any hope of conquering this disease I wouldn't even consider the concept now, but something tells me this will only get worse as I get older. So I ask you all who may listen to this question from one who simply wants what is best; should I? If no, why shouldn't I?
