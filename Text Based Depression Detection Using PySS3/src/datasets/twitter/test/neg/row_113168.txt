Get a job, and see how things changeSometime during December/January of 2017/2018, I became suicidal. I dropped out of school, stopped showing up to work, cut off my friends, started hurting myself, and stopped taking care of myself. I didn't want to exist anymore. I wanted to sleep and never wake up. In April, I got a job to pay off my debt for dropping out of school. It's a security job so there's a lot of time where you're just sitting with your thoughts. Early on, I still felt like killing myself. I couldn't look people in the eye. I felt dirty. I felt lesser. I couldn't be left alone without feeling like I was gonna go crazy. I was still cutting myself at work when I was left alone. But after a couple months, I started to regain my confidence, I started talking to people more, getting closer with specific people, started having different conversations, started thinking about and planning for my future with the help of a few very friendly co-workers. Now, 4 months later, I am working overtime as much as I can to help my sister pay for her wedding. I've paid off the debt I owed to my school and I'm in the process of saving up for a car and a new phone. I'm in a much better place mentally. I still have those moments of self-loathing where I feel lesser, but I'm learning to deal with those moments better. This may not work for everyone the way the title suggests, but it might work for some, and I just want to help some people out.
