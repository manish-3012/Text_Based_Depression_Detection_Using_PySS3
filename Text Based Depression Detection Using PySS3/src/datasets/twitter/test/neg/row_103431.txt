im stucktw for attempts, hospital, dissociation, abuse, self harm

a friend of mine attempted suicide early december. as we were at uni at the time, another friend and i took him to a&amp;e and while this was happening i was autopilot enough that it didnâ€™t really bother me.

as soon as i got back though, i was a mess. i called my mum and let her know what had happened and my boyfriend was around to look after me, but itâ€™s gotten into my head.

we got back just before 6am i believe and i obviously missed my lectures that day due to being tired, but i remember being around in the afternoon for a house viewing and just dissociating out of stress outside one of the houses. my friend whoâ€™d also come to the hospital was there too so he understood why i was a bit messed up and heâ€™s helped me when dissociated before but uggggh! it was so annoying and i felt pretty rough for a long time afterwards. maybe a week or two.

iâ€™m diagnosed myself with depression and i started taking sertraline about a week and a half before my friend attempted. dissociation has been a regular problem for me anyway, i get near catatonic sometimes. iâ€™ve been abused and close to suicide before. i cut and all that jazz so it really hasnâ€™t been easy to process this shit at all. itâ€™s still in my head. i keep thinking about overdosing (thatâ€™s how i planned to commit before) and then slashing my arms up, but i donâ€™t really want to die.

my life is good. i love my friends and family and my boyfriend and i would hate to put them through that. my meds make me feel so much better. but itâ€™s stuck in my brain, and makes me feel awful. i think iâ€™m just fixated on it to be honest, but thinking about attempting in my flat bathroom and then getting a friend to call 999 keeps coming back. i hate it.

i know itâ€™s a cry for help and i need to talk it through with someone but i donâ€™t know where to start. itâ€™s really hard. i donâ€™t have a therapy assessment until january because the nhs doesnâ€™t have space for me until then, and even then itâ€™ll be cbt rather than counselling which is what i feel like i need.

all in all iâ€™m just so stuck and i donâ€™t know what to do. i donâ€™t know who to go to - iâ€™m scared of upsetting my friends with talk of suicide, because my boyfriend and a lot of my uni friends also struggle with their mental health, and my trauma makes me feel like a massive burden often, especially when talking about what i need, even more when itâ€™s related to mental health.

i guess i could go on but iâ€™ll round up. iâ€™m not sure whether iâ€™m just getting worse or stagnating or even traumatised from my friendâ€™s attempt. itâ€™s confusing. but it keeps coming around. not rly sure why iâ€™m posting but if anyone has advice iâ€™d appreciate it highly.

sorry itâ€™s long. thanks.
