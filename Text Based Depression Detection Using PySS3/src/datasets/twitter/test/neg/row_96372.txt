I can'tI can't seem to keep my feet planted firmly on the ground anymore. I am losing touch with my space and my reality. Or the reality. I don't know. This is honestly terrifying when I am able to get some sense of grounding like I have right now. I have never felt this before, maybe some spells of dissociation, but nothing like this for this long. Waves of times where I am so checked out that apparently I have no idea what I have been doing for the last however long I've been doing it? Feeling so numb that I don't even notice that I am feeling that way, or not feeling, whatever, and reacting to things badly making people upset and not even noticing that I've had zero reaction?

This is weird and I don't like it. I feel like I don't belong in the "real" world anymore, like I haven't even *been* in the "real" world for awhile now. Like I'm not human. What is wrong with me?
