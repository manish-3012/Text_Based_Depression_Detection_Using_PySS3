I need somethingI'm in the military. I have watch tomorrow. I'll be issued a gun. I've thought so many times how I could use it to end everything.
I don't want to, but I feel like I need to.

I have lots of friends and my family loves me, but I can't help it. I want to die so often. I feel like I have no place in society. I have been to the chaplain many times, and I've been locked up in a mental hospital before, so I know how these things work.

I just need that little thing to keep me going. I don't know what it is anymore. I've been drinking a lot  (like every night) so this might not be the most put together. I just need to know something. Anything little to get me through tomorrow.
