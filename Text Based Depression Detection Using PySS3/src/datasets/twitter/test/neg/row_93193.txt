unemployed and uselessI have become increasingly depressed over the past two months. A position I was told would last for at least a year only lasted four months and now I am in danger of losing my car and all of the things I put into storage. It just feels like it would be easier if I stopped existing because then it wouldn't matter what happened to my stuff and the feeling of being ugly and unwanted would go away. I've been applying to jobs non-stop since I was laid off and I rarely get interviews and never call-backs for work.  I feel like people are just being polite and that there really isn't a place for me in this world anymore. I'm a 30 something JD and I have nothing to show for anything except pain and rejection.
