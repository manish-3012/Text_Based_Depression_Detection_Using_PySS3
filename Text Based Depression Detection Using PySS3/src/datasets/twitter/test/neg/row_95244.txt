Just not sure what to do anymoreSo lately I have been feeling really really down and suicidal lately and I've also had urges to hurt myself. A little background on me: I'm in high school I've been depressed and suicidal for a few years now and I have a history of pill popping, cutting and burning myself and trying to kill myself. I have been hospitalized before and have been in a day treatment program as well. I also see a therapist and psychiatrist and I'm on Celexa for depression.  
 
  Lately I've just been really strung out because of school, friend and family problems. I'm not doing very well in school and I never really have. I get extra/special help in school but it doenst really make much of a difference. My friend group is also under a lot of strain because of conflicts between a few people. As for family, my parents' marriage is on the rocks right now and my brother has a lot of issues of his own. 
 
  I have a couple of very supportive friends but I don't know how to ask then for help. More and more I think about wanting to kill or hurt myself and its just so hard to control myself sometimes. I've been trying hard to not cut myself and I've been improving but I broke down a few days ago and did some cutting. I would very much like to be hospitalized again because its really helped before, but since its so close to the end of the school year, I can't risk missing class.

So thats my story. Any advice or support is welcome
