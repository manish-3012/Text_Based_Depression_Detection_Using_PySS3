I'm doneLast night I took 20 Tylenol to see how bad it will get I couldn't breathe and I passed out I wish I would've stayed asleep forever I'm thinking about taking 40 tonight. I made a plan to call 911 to clean up my body so my family does not see it I wish the best to everyone on this Reddit page and I hope none of you ever commit an act selfish as im gonna do.
