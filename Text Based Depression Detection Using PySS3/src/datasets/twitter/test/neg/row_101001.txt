Would you want your son to leave a suicide note?I think my parents know my suicide is coming. They've stopped asking me about my future plans, how my job hunting is going, etc. We don't speak much outside of logistics, things like "What do we need from the grocery store?" 

Should I leave a suicide note when I punch out next month? Would that make it worse?
