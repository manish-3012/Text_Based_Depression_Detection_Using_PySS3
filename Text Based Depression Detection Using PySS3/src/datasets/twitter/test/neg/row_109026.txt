I might be the worst son everSo I've been lonely my whole life, depressed for most of it, and suicidal for the last three years. I've come close to killing myself so many times, and I was about to do it again today. So I'm lying in bed with a knife at my throat and some music playing and my mum texts me. It's my dad's birthday at midnight and she knows that he wants to hear from me, I've been snowed under with school and haven't been able to call in a while.

I don't think I've ever felt like a bigger piece of shit... My dad is fucking great, he deserves so much better than a useless fuck like me. He doesn't deserve a shit kid whose idea of a birthday present is a suicide note. I managed to stop crying long enough to call him and he spends the entire call checking to see if I'm alright and if I'm making friends (no but I told him yes), if I'm eating right, if I've got money to have fun... He shouldn't have to put up with me being such a useless fuck, I think I finally kill myself in a few weeks so that he can at least enjoy his birthdays without having to remember my useless ass. Fucking hell, I wish I'd just die in a freak accident and then he wouldn't have to deal with this shit. My parents both deserve better than me.
