a peaceful deathI want a peaceful death something thatâ€™s not painful or messy I was contemplating whether or not to jump off a bridge just like the movie â€œa silent voiceâ€ time and time again I give myself deadlines for my death but I canâ€™t go through with it I donâ€™t want anybody to hurt from my decision but at the same time I want to leave I want to disappear most of family knows about my depression and friends but idk how much I can take anymore I thought about guns knives slowly killing myself with drugs poison all of it I feel alone but ik iâ€™m not ever since I was little I always thought this way I had divorced parents the drama was always the worst and included some abusive moments mentally and physically I always questioned my whole existence and which I find out I was an accident life always sucked and I was always depressed all the way till sophomore year I met this girl couple months pass and we become best friends then eventually she becomes my girlfriend and a year passes by and I was the happiest guy alive and then it goes downhill really fast found out she didnâ€™t want me anymore and she was pretending to be happy for a couple months now and I didnâ€™t how to respond to it I just wanted to end myself then and there all Ik is that I wanted to be happy with her but that wasnâ€™t possible eventually I started planning on how I should do it and at a point I couldnâ€™t handle living at my house anymore because ik it wouldâ€™ve happened and that would be the end I stopped myself from killing myself by going to my cousins house and staying there till I felt comfortable to go back home during this period I attempted and decided I donâ€™t deserve a birthday and just stopped celebrating it all together 2 months later I went home and still felt the same way but not enough to act on it fast forward to when this was posted I still feel like I need to die and I want to die but iâ€™ve also been scared about it and I think itâ€™s about time to give up honestly I wish I had friends to talk about this stuff but they already know the story thereâ€™s not much they can besides say itâ€™s going to be okay and time heals all but ik that itâ€™s not and when I do tell them this stuff they avoid me or run away at times I feel hopeless iâ€™m just tired of everything I feel like iâ€™m never going to be happy and eventually iâ€™ll be dead in the inside just numb a corpse I just wish someone cared for me like she did I wouldnâ€™t encourage to kill themselves but this is my decision and I just wanted some recommendations on how I could die peacefully ty
