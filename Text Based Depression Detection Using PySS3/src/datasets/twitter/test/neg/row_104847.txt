I'm apparently impossible to kill.I've cut open my arm pretty impressively in the past and nothing.

I took a months worth of Celexa and risperdone and nothing... except a good nap.

And I'm to much of a wimp to use a gun.

So.. what do? Drinking bleach sounds painful.

I'm thinking hard about making my escape this weekend so I can be sure my husband will be with our baby and have a chance to find a sitter before the work week starts up again.

I'm new here. I'm assuming this is just a gathering of attention whores and I suppose I'm now one of them?
