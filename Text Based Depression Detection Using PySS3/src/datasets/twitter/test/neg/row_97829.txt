Burnout, overworked. Light at the end of tunnel is vagueThought I come and post here as I have no one to talk to about my problems.

Just overworking myself hard, with full time work and night school. Fallen behind financially over the years, slowly but surely, it's getting better, but I should have acted before hand. 28 year old male, and i just think i can turn this around, it gets harder and harder.

Never been in a relationship, I don't want to get married because i don't fit in with large crowds. I feel like i'm going to be all alone, i want to help people with addiction and mental health, even the whole burnout phase gets to the social workers as well. 

I almost committed suicide 3 years ago because the girl i loved used me fell in love with someone else, she was a piece of shit to begin with. After that, I felt empty ever since. Took care of my own self. Now she broke with ex, went from garbage to even more bigger garbage. She looks like a junkie now, stress can also make someone age horribly to, her life crash from poor choices, going on the same path as her mom, her choice.

I never been out at social after because i just don't feel comfortable after that horrible heart break. Its not the only one. 

I can go through a panic and i just want to get out of that environment, i'm not good at dates or being social.

Rather take care of my financial burden long ways to go. I just work to improve on self esteem, personal growth. 

I built myself back up mentally, learned new things about myself, but still i feel empty. 

i just don't know what to do , besides keep going
