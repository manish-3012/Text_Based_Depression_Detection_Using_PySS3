two months ago, my best friend killed herselfit's fucking awful. it's fucking awful. i'm not over it. i think about her every god damn day. i can't stop thinking about her. i was the first one to realize something was wrong. someone else found her body. she told me that the only reason she was still here was because of me. i passed it off. i could have done something. i was the last person she tried to contact, but i didn't see her message. there was no note. i could have done something. it shoudl have been me. i wish it was me.
