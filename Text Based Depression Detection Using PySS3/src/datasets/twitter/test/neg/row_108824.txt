FiancÃ© of six years left me.It's been a few weeks and I have been getting along by keeping myself numb to everything. That started off as drinking wine from a box, and when that didn't cut it I moved on to cocaine. That didn't cut it for long either, so I have started snorting crystal meth. 
She just realized that she didn't love me anymore and couldn't commit to the relationship any longer. That was that. 
I'm considering killing myself today. I have plenty going for me in my life right now, but I feel completely lost, empty, broken. I have a promising career in social work ahead of me, and when she was at my side I felt like I could aspire to achieve anything. Now though, I hardly feel like I can take care of myself, let alone other people. I used to asses others for suicide intervention and talk them down to a safe place. Now I just feel like an enormous hypocrite, coming into work to support addicts and the mentally ill, while going home afterwards and snorting crystal meth till I don't feel anything. My life has lost all ambition and direction. I'm completely heartbroken. I wanted to marry her, and spend my entire life with her and have a family and a career. And all of that is just totally gone, completely outside of my power to change. 
I'm not really looking for an answer. I guess I just wanted to type these words out and make them real. I imagine myself going home from work today, filling up my bathtub and pouring out a Hollywood line of all the remaining coke and meth I've got, slitting my wrists and just letting life fade out of me. I can think of plenty of reasons not to do it, but the thought of closing my eyes really puts me at ease. I don't know.
