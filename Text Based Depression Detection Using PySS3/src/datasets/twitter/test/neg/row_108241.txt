I honestly feel like I've exerted every possible option/resource available to me in order to get better. I have no idea what else what I'm supposed to do with my shitty life.[long]I doubt anyone will read all of this but it feels better to type it all out anyway.

I honestly believe I've been depressed all my life and I have 'complex' PTSD &amp; anger management problems. I've been through so many therapist appointments,psychiatrist appointments, pill prescriptions, meetings with people, etc. Nothing works. I always though things would get better if I did/achieved X or Y. Nothing ever gets better. 

I'm always, I'm always in a mental state of dread. Even on my good days, I'm in a state of dread. Every single day I wake up with the thought of any day now something is going to set me off mentally and it's going to happen. I don't have any urgency. It's just like a voice, my own voice, in the back of my head. I seriously can't even describe it. I probably sound batshit crazy. But it's there, telling me "any day now". Worst part is I don't even have the balls to do it so no worries on that department.

I have no idea what else to do. Meds don't work, talking to my family is hard because most of them are just as mentally fucked up and somehow I'm the one that sets the example of being happy which makes it even harder because I wear a mask 24/7 365 so they don't worry about me. 
I can't even attempt to check into some sort of ward because I work a production based job and if I miss one day I'll be royally fucked. I can't quit my job because I have bills to pay, I can't even get another job because this job pays so well. I'd have to get at least 3 part-time jobs to cover for this job. 

My life consists of working 4 to 6 days a week, coming home, sleeping or browsing the internet till I have to go work. I can't even go to sleep some nights because the thoughts are so bad and keep me up. I hate this shit but work might be the only place that actually keeps my mind off this shit and that's fucking sad. I literally wish I could sleep in my work building and work around the clock 24-7. And like I said, that fucking sucks because I don't even like this job. The money is just too good.  

I have no hobbies, no friends, my family is 110% dysfunctional, I have no relationships with anyone. I haven't had a friend since middle school. I'm 23. I have some sort of PTSD from severe bullying when I was younger. I can't sit inside a public building without facing the entrance door so I can see who is entering the building and that no one can run up on me. I have an incredibly hard time trusting anyone because I'm afraid they will turn on me. If someone walks up behind me I am incredibly on standby because I'm afraid they are going to attack me. And a whole bunch of other embarrassing shit that makes me not be able a functioning normal human being. 


It just feels like depression, suicidal thoughts, anger management, and PTSD has stripped away every happy/positive emotion possible from me and all that's left is a husk of nothingness. I have no idea what else to do other than to just work myself to death with these shitty memories and thoughts. Sorry for the shitty formatting, been awake for 30 hours and can't sleep. I just don't know what else to do in my situation.
