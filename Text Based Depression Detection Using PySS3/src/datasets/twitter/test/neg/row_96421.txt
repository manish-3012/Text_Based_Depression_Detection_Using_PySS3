a helper needs some help!I frequent this subreddit a bit, try to help as much as possible, but now I need some help :(

I wouldn't say I have suicidal but its getting harder for me to coup with these feelings... all very negative.

Ive been working very had towards trying to get into a professional school, with lots of volunteering with at risk populations, street entrenched individuals, medical clinics, and educational institutions.  I studied hard all through university but always achieved like C or D marks... I mean I studied hard enough to say that I am satisfied with how hard I worked (normally 15 hours a day with 7 hours to sleep, and 2 hours of transportation and food).  Anyways, Ive been applying to these professional schools and today I got my 2nd rejection letter.  I don't know, Ive always been really good with reject but I think where I am in my life it just hit me hard.

I am now 27 and been out of school for 4 years and am still without a job.  I would fill all my time with volunteering and helping out as best I can within my community... but still I would get the odd contract here and there.. nothing to make the me independent.  I still live with my parents and I feel like such a failure.  I THINK I have a strong skillset professionally but I still cannot get a job.  Volunteering doesnt put food on the table and I continue to intern for different organizations.  I want to move out and try to be independent like all my other siblings, some even younger... but I feel like I am a retard or insanely stupid.  My resume is staked with experience (mostly volunteer), and Ive gone to councilors to help me make it better... they look at my resume and say "yep, its great!". 

Anyways, this feeling of negative self worth is really being internalized like crazy today after my rejection email... It just hurts... never getting a call back for a job hurts... I'm tired.. I just want to leave but I can pull myself away from the few things that bring joy to my life like volunteering and helping within my community... its just none of these things put food on my table or even give me the chance to make a living..

Sorry, I know SW has more people in need of help.... I just don't know where to turn to...
