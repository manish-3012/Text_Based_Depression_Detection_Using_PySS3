I have decided to kill myself in 1 year time and let go this miserable life and selfish bastards hereToday I was cryin again in the washroom how I hav failed miserably in my relationship I was dumped by my abusive ex bastard fiance and that has made me extremely depressed and the only thing I ever wanted was love from him but that was too much to ask for as he was a born bastard. I hope he burns in hell . Sayin that I dont feel good about anythn in life. I dont enjoy anythn. Life is a burden I feel jealous of eveyone who has a bf or a couple. I get triggered and start fights with my brother if he talks to his fiance. I have no emotional support tbh. I hav no friends . I am a loner. I think it's better to end this miserable life . Why should I live for what eveythn is temporary anyways . I am not financially stable. Life is just a responsibility with mental agony. I cant even start telling u how many hardships I I hav faced  in my life of 32 years. Even thinking about what I hav endured breaks me down. I honestly cant be strong anymore. Living in India sucks too. Anyways fuck this world just 1 more year and I am free to go.
