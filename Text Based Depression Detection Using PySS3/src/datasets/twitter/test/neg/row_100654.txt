It's too late and I can't escape anywayI'm transgender, living as deep South as you can get, 31, shitty part time minimum wage job that will fire me the moment I come out.

There's just no way to get away from this hell hole and its already too late. Why even live when you've wasted your youth in a disgusting body that makes you want to kill yourself every time you look in the mirror.

No one even believes me, because I don't present feminine because I think its a waste of time in this body and would just make me get abused far more than I already do in the South.

Its too late for me to ever be happy. I'll never afford it and I'm just so bitter. 

Whenever I see ignorant, red necks smile, I just want to kill them. These people have ruined my fucking life. I'm dangerously close to standing in front of a school bus and blowing my fucking brains out to scar their disgusting inbred fuck trophies for life. 

None of them deserve happiness. I've even grown to hate the people I originally identified with. Honestly, when I see women I just want to cut them. 

Everyone in the position to help me, the therapists and the like, none of them fucking care once they realize what's wrong me. They want me to die. And I want them to die. 

There's no help for people like me in this world and I keep getting more bitter and more violent as time passes. They stole the best years of my life.

Now the only support, albeit useless, I ever had is going, I'm killing myself in 10 minutes. 

Fuck you all. God damn the south and fuck this country.

I die in less than an hour. 

Edit good bye, I've settled everything that needs settling. I'm going to end it now. It'll never be worth it for me to live. The best years of my life were wasted, because bigots decided they should dictate what I'm allowed to do with body. Take solace in the fact that the only reason I didn't start a shootout is because there's no way I'd kill enough people to satisfy me. All of you should be purged.

Fuck this world.
