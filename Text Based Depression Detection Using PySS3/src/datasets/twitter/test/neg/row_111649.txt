No options left.28M. 3 years of mental illness. Depression, anxiety, gender dysphoria, dissociative disorder. Wasted the last 10 years of my life in a course/job i was never cut out for. Last 2 years Iâ€™ve been unemployed and unable to work. Iâ€™ve tried several different meds, seen 7 different medical professionals, from counsellors to psychiatrists to psychologists. They have all, correctly I think, added a new diagnosis to the pile. Treatment on any one issue is almost impossible, any progress made is limited by all the others. Iâ€™ve heard and read everything. Iâ€™ve taught myself large parts of psychology in an attempt to treat myself... all to no avail. 
Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m watching my body live my life without me. 
I donâ€™t want to die. 
I donâ€™t want to live.
