Sometimes I feel good and sometimes I'm considering suicideI don't know what's happening with me, but sometimes I am really happy and other times, mostly when I'm alone, I realize how pathetic I am and just want to die. I don't think that I can live much longer like this. What can I do except a therapy? Is suicide the only option ?
