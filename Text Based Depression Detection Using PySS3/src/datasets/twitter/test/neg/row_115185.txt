Finished here.I'm fat, I'm lazy, and I'm a liar. For once I'll be honest. 

Maybe I didn't have the best childhood but I was given every opportunity to succeed. I've failed every step of the way. Always found an excuse to give up. Truth is I'm just dumb and lazy. 

I was supposed to start a new career today and instead I just laid in bed. I tell myself I'm recovering from a bike accident last month..but it's been weeks. 

I have a therapist, but I'm not honest enough to him. I have no friends and a dog who needs a better life. 

I'm sorry I suck so much.
