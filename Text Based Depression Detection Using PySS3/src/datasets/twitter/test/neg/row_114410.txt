I'm afraid of myselfEverything I've ever done has been ruined by my ADHD, Anxiety and Depression. The only thing getting me through school is my intelligence, and my fear. I studied for the SAT's for a month straight for the hell of it, as a way of coping with the situation I'm in, and to give me an excuse to avoid talking and sleeping. I hate my life. When I was in seventh grade, my parents took custody of my cousin, whose parents were on drugs and weren't taking care of her. 2 years later she was in a hospital because she was depressed. Ive been living in fear, without treatment because I'm afraid that they'll send me off to some asylum like they did my cousin. I can't live with who I am. Nothing makes sense anymore. I need my peace. I have no motivation to do anything, and at this point my parents have placed so many responsibilities and mistakes on me that I've been actively thinking about killing myself. I'm not overworked, I'm capable of doing things, but I need everything happening in my head to stop. I cant stop thinking, and I can't stop hearing my parent's words in my head, the non-compassionate appeasement coming out of their mouths, their failure to listen, the criticism I'm given for simple mistakes. I'm 17, and I can't do it anymore. The problem lies with me, and it lies with them. I can't live in fear, and in regret. I'm finished. I haven't planned anything yet, but I have run out of options to hide behind. My "happy face" will dwindle at some point. I already feel like a defective human being. I'm done. I can't do this anymore. I can't think anymore. I need to turn my brain off.

Sorry for the long message. I'm not making a TL;DR.
