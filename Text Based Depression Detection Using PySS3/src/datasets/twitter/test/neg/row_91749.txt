I think I've tried to commit suicideSo you know how you can't last 3 minutes without air, 3 days without water, and 3 weeks without food. Well I tried to go three days without drinking and failed halfway through the second day. I don't know if this counts as a suicide attempt and it's not like I can ask anyone I know in real life. I honestly want to die, I don't want to make it past high school. I don't know what to do, I'm thinking of trying again, maybe I'll actually be able to do it. Sorry for wasting your time, bye.
