Something beautifulI was filming a video for my family to show at my funeral. It includes one of my favorite poems. During the editing process I noticed something amazing. In the poem there is a few lines about god. I was 100% sober recording this and remember perfectly that I said these lines in my normal voice. Well in the video my voice gets lower and more raspy and I can't really tell but it looks like I have a faint white aura. Mostly noticeable around my shoulders. Ive never been the religios type. In fact ive had a problem with religion ever since I was young. But after this I truly believe it was something letting me know its okay to end this suffering.
