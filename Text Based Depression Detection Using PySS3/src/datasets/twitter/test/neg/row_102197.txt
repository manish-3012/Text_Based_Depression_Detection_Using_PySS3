I feel like I couldn't deal causing so much sorrow and heart brokenness among my loved ones which has prevented me from ending it to this pointI don't know how long I will be able to watch my life going down the drain and how long it will take me for me depression to fully engulf me but my family is one of the only reasons why im still here. I wouldn't be comfortable with causing that much pain
