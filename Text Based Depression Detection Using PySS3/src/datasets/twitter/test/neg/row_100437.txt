Ranting, 18mThank you guys for being so kind and supportive, the community here is incredible. I'm seriously struggling with some mental health issues, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia yesterday and I don't know how to cope with knowing I'm insane. I feel like people like me should be weeded out of the world, and I've been seriously considering it. My parents are disappointed in my "weakness" as they put it, and I don't know how to tell my gf. She's basically the only reason I haven't done it yet. How do I move forward?
