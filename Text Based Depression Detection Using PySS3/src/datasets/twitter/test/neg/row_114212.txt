I'm too stupid to succeed in lifeCan't barely remember any of the math I learned in school. Not enough of it at least. Taking practice asvab tests are really bringing to light just how ill equipped I am for life these days. I don't know. So many lost pieces of knowledge I really don't know how to get back. So much of my time is just trying to find any job so I can get at least an iota of some sort of income coming in. It's hard feeling positive about things. It's really hard. I just don't know how much I can really accept of my life before I can't fool myself into being happy with it anymore. I mean things could be a lot worse and I'm already struggling to feel happy. I just wonder if my existence really is meant to consist mostly of hard work and suffering. I don't want to just die out of nowhere in the middle of this life. I don't know what I should do to make it really feel like all of the effort was really worth a damn. I wish that were an easier question to answer, but if I'm being honest I don't have an answer. I don't know what I should do to really know that I'm making the most out of what I have. I wonder if I'm even smart enough to do so. Why is it so hard to just appreciate the experience of being alive anymore?
