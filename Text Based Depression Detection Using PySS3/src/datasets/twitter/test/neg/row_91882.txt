When you realise you're in a lot more trouble than you thought you were, but you don't know if you have the energy to get back out of it.So I've been drifting along for a couple of years now. I tried, back then, to get my GP to refer me on for assessment, therapy, counselling, *anything*. He messed me around and dragged his heels because he wasn't confident with what to do with me and I... I lost heart.

See I was trying to lose weight to get some surgery done, some surgery that was going to change my life. It was going to be the thing that finally let me get on with living. But I couldn't lose the weight. I kept sabotaging myself, I couldn't let myself do it. I don't know why - I know that I do it, but I don't understand why, or how to stop.

Because I couldn't get the surgery, I had to give up theatre, and being a stage manager was the one thing that really made me feel like me. It made me feel alive, it was what I lived for. But I can't do it anymore on top of my day job, and I can't make enough doing it professionally to quit the day job. So I had to give it up.

And day by day, I gave everything else up too.

I just... lost myself. It's been almost 2 years, I can't go to the gym anymore, I can't even go into a large supermarket. I haven't bought new clothes other than to replace stuff that I need for work. I have a room full of craft materials and tools and musical instruments that just get dustier. I just work now. I work and I do laundry. I haven't cooked a proper meal since maybe October, haven't washed the dishes since November.

Laundry and the office job.

I know about the "just do one thing a day and take pride in it" thing. I know about the "recognise the good things you do and be pleased with them" stuff. I've gone through the 'mindfulness' exercises and I've thought about all the people that love me and the reasons I want to stick around.

I hadn't realised, but I'd slowly just given up on clawing back the things I used to have in my life. I don't remember when, but at some point I stopped even pretending that I had any plans anymore. I was going to get the surgery, and then give myself six months to get myself back together. And then I was going to look at going back to school, get qualified to do something that doesn't bore me into craziness. I was going to move out of this apartment into somewhere I *want* to live and I was going to take up running again.

I have at some point accepted that none of those things are ever going to happen. I don't want it to be that way, but that's the way it is.

I didn't realise until I crashed and had to call an emergency line a few weeks back that I was actually in a really bad way. I had an assessment over the phone, just the basics, and... you know when you have to actually answer all the questions back to back, black and white? Yeah, I realised that I'm not doing ok.

I've been telling myself that as long as I keep going, as long as I'm still working and ironing those shirts and getting to the office every day that I can't be **that** bad, right? Right? But I think I might be that bad. 

My world has grown smaller and smaller and greyer and greyer, and now all there is... is me. And my ironing board. And my office job, where I feel so bored that some days I really, really don't know how I keep from just screaming. What I have is me. My support network is me. My safety net is me. 

And I don't think I really want to do it anymore. And that's a problem. What I've realised is that I've lost the knack of wanting things, I don't remember how you go about wanting things. All I want anymore is the absence of things. I want to be less tired, I want to be less stressed out, I want to spend less time sitting up at nights, I want to stop all this noise in my head.

So I finally have a possibility of getting that psychiatric assessment. I'll know whether it's happening or not within the week. And if it isn't happening? I don't have the energy to start running around this track all over again. I don't have the power left in me to start all over again if they won't see me this time.

Because really I just want it all to be over. I'm a control freak, so it's not that I want someone to come and take this all away from me and make it all better. I don't want someone to come in and fix me, I couldn't allow that kind of thing. I want to be able to fix myself. I want to be able to pick myself up, dust myself off and start mending myself.

But I just... don't think I can do it. I just don't think I've got enough of *me* left to do it with. Even if I do finally get this assessment done, and they prescribe me something and I finally get this therapy I've been pursuing for so very long...

All of that stuff takes so much *energy*. I've done some therapy before and I know very well that it's incredibly hard work. And I **want** to work hard at it, I do. But I'm exhausted even thinking about it. What if this has all just taken too long? What if I just don't have enough fuel left to get off the ground after all this time?

I'm the only person I've got to rescue me. I have friends, wonderful friends, but I cannot ask things of them. I can't bring myself to ask for anything except from strangers. I just... can't do it. I can't bear it. I'm the only person I've got to rescue me and I no longer think that I can do it.

I've been through depressive episodes before, but I haven't experienced this kind of protracted longing for a death since my teens. I'm 35 years old. If I magically get well in the next 6 months it'll still take me 3 years to lose enough weight to get my surgery done. Another year on a waiting list. I'll be 40 before it's all done and dusted.

A decade alone. A decade lost. Wasted. Stuck in this shitty little apartment with the stacks of dishes that I ignore and this ringing silence. 40 is too late. 40 is too long.

I had this great plan for dying. I was planning to pack up all my shit as if I were going to move house. Then I was going to tell everyone I'd got a job in Canada. That's I'd met someone online and I was going to just do it and go. I'd pack up all my shit and put the stuff I wanted to leave to people labelled in storage, carefully cross-referenced in my will. Letters. Then I was going to move into a new place in a city I've never been to before, mail a key second-class to the police with a letter telling them what they'd find and set myself up in the bathtub. No caring neighbours to be broken-hearted. No friends left with appointments still hanging in their calendars. 

But I can't bring myself to pack. I can't bring myself to do *anything*.

I'm terrified that I'm going to get into therapy, run my battery completely flat and then end up just floating here, alone, unable to even work. Unable to put a key in the envelope. Stuck here unable to die in this dreadful, dreadful twilight photocopy of a life. I have no hope anymore. I don't even know if I want hope back. I just... want it to be over. Is that so bad? To just want to *stop*?

I don't know. I don't know if it matters anyway. I just needed to put this somewhere. Thank you.
