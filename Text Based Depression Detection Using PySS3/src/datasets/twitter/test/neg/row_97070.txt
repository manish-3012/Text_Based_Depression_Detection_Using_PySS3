I am so lowI thought things were actually starting to look up for me and then my girlfriend broke up with me

Itâ€™s my own fault for not putting enough effort into the relationship 

I donâ€™t deserve any of what little I have I feel like a black hole of a person that just sucks the joy out of everyone else

Iâ€™m so useless
I donâ€™t have the energy to move
