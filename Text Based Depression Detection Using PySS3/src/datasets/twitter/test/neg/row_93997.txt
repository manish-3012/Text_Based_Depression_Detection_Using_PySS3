This is my work and school schedule. It doesn't take into account how much studying I have to do. I try to do as much as I can at work, but we're busy and I don't have time lately. I work in a call center.  
.  
I can't do this anymore. I'm at "6.5" absences out of 7 allowed, even though I've only actually missed 3 days. We have an option to "flex" and be up to an hour late twice a month. I have done this every single time I've had to be late (only once by my own fault, the rest were unfortunate circumstances--traffic, car issues, family problems &lt;not my own&gt;). I was told these weren't entered into the system. The first time I apologized and said I was certain I entered it, but oh well. The second time I told administration I was 100% sure I entered it and have had the same issue before. I was told I was being argumentative. I am not eligible for promotions, raises, or incentive pay until mid-December.  
.  
We have an online chat that I man. In operator chat, we all chat amiably between chats. I have been told not to talk so much, although I've never seen anyone else given that warning. It came at a time that I thought we were all bonding and having fun, talking and joking about video games and etc. Any time phones get busy, I am the first one kicked off, even though I get the best quality assurance scores.  
.  
I pay for myself, my girlfriend, and sometimes my father. It's stressful. I hate living pay check to pay check, I've always been good about saving. But my girlfriend lost her job. She's kind of been looking for new ones--mostly she's relying on financial aid... hers &amp; mine. She was given an interview at my work, but failed the drug test even though we haven't smoked pot in 6 weeks. Every time I feel upset about our situation and tell her so, she gets upset. She feels guilty for quitting her job of 5 years (that she was bullied out of. I'm happier that she left, because it made her suicidal.) and feels suicidal if I bring up the stress. So I don't.  
.  
But there's nobody I can talk to. I don't have close friends. I don't want to guilt my father, who sacrificed so much for me my entire life and is struggling himself. My extended family are not close. They are religious, and I am a lesbian and an atheist. I try to ignore it and be polite around them, but they can't seem to ignore it. They want to preach to me. I ask them not to, but they "have to do it even though I don't want it, because they love me." I don't go to family events anymore. They wonder why.  
.  
I want to stop living. I don't want to hurt or die. I just don't want to exist. I sound like self-centered, crybaby, cunt and I don't want to. I don't want to annoy people more than I already do.
