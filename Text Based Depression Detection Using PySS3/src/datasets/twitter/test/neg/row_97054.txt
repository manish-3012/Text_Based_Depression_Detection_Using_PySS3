I often have suicidal thoughtsI think about killing myself often; not out of sadness but lack of interest. I don't have the want for money, success or being a productive member of society anymore; it feels like a prison. Everything that one is ment to enjoy, feels like a job to me.The thought of living another 50 years and continuing this cycle is the only thing that makes me sad. I never asked to be alive but I'm expected to want to live a long life? I feel as if,  with every day that goes by, the thought of death becomes more soothing.
