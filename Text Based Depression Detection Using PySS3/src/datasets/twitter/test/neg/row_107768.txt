The world is not fair periodAnxiety plus having GERD is hell, can't sleep, my body is my own personal hell.

I feel like whenever I start feeling happy and start planning my future like I be motivated so much that I don't want to kill myself. But then my body shows me how much of a pain it is to be human or something comes up in my family and I feel depressed or stressed. It's like every time I feel like my life is getting fix, a problem pops up and fucks it all up, is It God or God's? Well whoever or whatever is controlling my life can go fuck themselves. I might end it soon, that's the only happy thought I have right now
