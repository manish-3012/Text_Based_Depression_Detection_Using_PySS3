I just want to stop thisEvery day I wake up to do the same monotonous tasks over and over and over again. I can't be fucked enough to wake up on time for work, I can't be bothered enough to maintain anything, I can't be bothered enough to do anything apart from sitting here wishing I was dead. I feel as if there is no true point to my life. I have practically nothing to live for at this moment. I'm ending it all. I can't take it anymore.
