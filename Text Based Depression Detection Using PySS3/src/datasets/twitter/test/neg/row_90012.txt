Can't keep going through this.I've struggled with depression off and on since college ~20 years ago.  It always comes back.  I've got a supportive family and a stable job.  I exercise.  I have a psychiatrist and do talk therapy.  I've tried all sorts of meds and take the ones I am currently on religiously.  I have pets that depend on me and a few friends too.  I do the things I'm supposed to do.  It just always comes back.

It's back and I don't know why.  Objectively speaking, my life is pretty good.  I'm so ashamed that I can't keep it together, and I don't want to reach out to my friends and family *again.*  It feels so shitty to repeatedly put them through this.  

I'm sick of trying to get through this, knowing that if I do it will just come back.  Please help.
