a messagehey guys. im not suicidal but i am kind of depressed. and i just want to say, keep fighting the demons. scrolling through the subreddit page shown me peopleâ€™s struggles and especially anger against themselves and their lives. depression may punch you with numbness and that weird expressable feeling that wants you to commit suicide but please, its about time to end this plague and its also time to reach out for help. fate may declare that your life will be wretched but you are your life, you make path for it. please, i do not know yâ€™all but i care for yâ€™all. if you donâ€™t wanna reach out, then just kill your mind. stop the dark thoughts. you and your depression are separate entities. try to help your depression help both of you. but most importantly, reach out to other people especially to people that arenâ€™t depressed because studies say that it can help. please please i care for yâ€™all. 



stay alive_
