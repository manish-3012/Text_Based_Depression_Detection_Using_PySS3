I wrote letters for after Iâ€™m goneThe other day I wrote five letters to people that mattered to me. I had five more to write, one to each of my three children, my wife, and a final suicide note for any and all to read. 

Then something happened. 

The world got a little brighter because an ugly situation Iâ€™m involved in found a partial solution. 

God, I was so close. Teetering there on the edge of my own sanity. 

Iâ€™ve got a lot to live for, but that didnâ€™t change the fact that I wanted to die. 

Part of me still wants to kill myself but Iâ€™m working hard at shoveling positivity onto that part of me. Trying to bury that part deep and far away. 

Life does get better eventually even when you think it canâ€™t. Prove my statement right by simply living one day at a time.
