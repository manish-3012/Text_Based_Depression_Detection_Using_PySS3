I feel like the world is against me.Iâ€™m a sophomore in college. Itâ€™s a top 20 school and I was very happpy when I got in, but now I regret my decision. My school is very Greek life driven, almost 50 percent. Those that arenâ€™t in Greek life typically donâ€™t go out. I feel like Iâ€™m somewhere in the middle so thereâ€™s no where for me to go. Everyone that goes out is either on a sports team or a frat, so after 8 i few like I have no friends 

I tried to rush a frat where my friend was the rush chair. He guaranteed me a bid, but I didnâ€™t make it past round one.  Because I thought I was guaranteed it made the blow so much harder. 

Iâ€™ve applied to about five clubs every semester and I always get rejected. Only to find out that billy got in because heâ€™s friends with the president. 

Iâ€™m interested in film but thereâ€™s not film department. So Iâ€™m left to kind of learn by myself, but I just feel this intense â€œwhat am I doing hereâ€. I know itâ€™s stupid but I just want to drop out and start working on film sets. 

I just feel lonely and isolated and I canâ€™t do anything about it because I need to finish college and Iâ€™m past the transfer window.
