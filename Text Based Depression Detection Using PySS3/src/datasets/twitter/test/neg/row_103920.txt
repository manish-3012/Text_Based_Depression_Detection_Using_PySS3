Feeling so empty , life doesn't seem realI've tried to end my life recently , I told my mom about it and she was weirdly cheery about it. She told me that it happened because black magic and an evil eye that effected me when I was young.
She just minimised my suicide attempt like it's nothing... my life have been real trash, like some times I do believe what she said because it's unreal what can happen to me...
I'm miss feeling of happiness, I've been masking my feelings that now I'm so empty and I don't know what's going on with me..
Everyday I feel so hopeless ... but I need to fake everything cause life is not going to stop just for me...
