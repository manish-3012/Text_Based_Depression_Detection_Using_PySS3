Does humanity hate itself?Sometimes I feel as if people absolutely hated each other, with the possible exception of a very few ones that are in their closest "tribe". I think that because I'm always shocked by how others talk about people they know. 

That new friend: "I think he's kinda stupid actually, probably a spoiled rich kid." 

That woman they randomly met: "I met that nice girl. Found a way to make her have sex with me, hehe. What? Contact her again? No way" 

The new coworker: "God he's so arrogant! And he talks the whole time!"

The other new coworker: "She's too quiet! Why the fuck doesn't she talk???"

The moms they met a Kindergarten: "Wow, none of them knows how to raise their children. Their kids are so aggressive to my little angel."

Their wife: "Why is she calling me *again* now? She's really annoying"

Etc. Etc.

It feels as if any nuances of positivity, altruism and empathy were just a big, grotesque masquerade. Without that masquerade, most couldn't stand to be with another human being for more than 5 minutes without absolutely mangling each other.

I don't understand why, apparently, people are so full of unreflected hatred. I'm not a social person but I've always been trying to see the good in people, feel them, not use them. When someone seemed overly "fake nice" to me, I did get judgy, but still tried to get to their core and see their true self.   
It's always been an uphill battle with that kind of attitude. I'm even being ridiculed for wanting to help. 

Lately, I've noticed myself "masquerading" and it's terrible. Apparently it becomes necessary when you fully enter the workforce.  It's as if I'm in the process of killing myself, but without the part where my body dies.

In these moments I feel like I might follow through with that because I just don't see why I should care anymore. Why work 8+ hours a day to support a society that hates itself, and is deliberately modelled on an animalistic hunter-prey-scheme? Can we even do better than that?
