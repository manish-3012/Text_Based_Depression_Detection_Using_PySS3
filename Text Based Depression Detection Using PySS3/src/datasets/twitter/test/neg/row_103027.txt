Does it ever stop?I feel like I'm just constantly fighting to stay alive. For the past 10 years I've been on meds. I've done the therapy thing, I've had ECT. What other options are there? 
I'm just so tired of fighting. I don't remember ever being happy or even content. Maybe my time has come. Maybe, for some of us, there is no hope. I just wanted to vent for a second. Thanks for reading.
