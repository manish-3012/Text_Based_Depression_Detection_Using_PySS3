I give upThis January will be three years since my depression and suicidal feelings started. It will also be two years since I was stopped from taking my life by a police officer and from jumping off a bridge. Iâ€™ve had two useless therapists since then, neither knew anything about how to help me and would only see me once a month (I have kaiser) and werenâ€™t very helpful. Iâ€™m honestly tired of trying and cannot live another year like this. My life is also ruined anyway, I have massive student loans and failed at starting my career so I donâ€™t have much going for me. I donâ€™t feel any fear anymore when I think of suicide and I donâ€™t feel much joy for anything. Iâ€™m not even sure if I can make it another week or into the new year like this. Iâ€™m just done with everything.
