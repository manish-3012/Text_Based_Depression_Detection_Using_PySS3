I want to kill myself for a good cause?My dad is drunk and is yelling at me about all of his financial problems again.

I think if i was dead it would benefit him greatly.

I've been depressed for the longest time and suicidal thoughts are a daily thing for me, I can't seem to find that many negatives to actually ending my life.
