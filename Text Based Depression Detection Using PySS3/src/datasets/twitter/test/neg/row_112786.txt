Unhappy - Never felt so aloneThrowaway account

Husband is planning on making my life hell unless I divorce him. I canâ€™t just leave because the car brakes  went out and he makes a lot more money than I do. It would be easier just to not exist and before anyone says people will miss me. I have no friends or family to help. I do have classmates who may help but I donâ€™t want to bring drama in their lives. My mom is unable to help due to mental illness and financial instability. Because of her mental illness, she is the meanest person to be around.

I never felt so alone. I thought marriage would change him. He threatens he will find my parents and harm them. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m in my early twenties if that helps. Does anyone know any resources that could help? If not then, itâ€™s better if Iâ€™m just gone. I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to or trust which is why I am writing on here. 

I really donâ€™t want to die because I will get promoted within three months and I know I will one day be able to afford to take care of myself... I have been dreaming of leaving him once I go away for my internship but I donâ€™t want to wait 8 more months of living like this.Iâ€™ve been suicidal my whole life but I do value my life.

I made the mistake of not breaking things off after he cheated or hit me. I regret this whole marriage... I do have money on my Lyft gift card so I can Lyft somewhere safe and a suitcase to pack. If I do anything, I donâ€™t want it to be in the home where it would remind him everyday.
