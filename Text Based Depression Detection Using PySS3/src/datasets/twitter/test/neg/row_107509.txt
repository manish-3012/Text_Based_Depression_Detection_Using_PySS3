Very bi polar about suicide. Worries me. But trying to be open today, trying to solve something has helped. For how long? Completely disconnected from the pain that lead me to almost kill myselfWell after realizing the conundrum of sexual frustration. All the problems in life that Iâ€™ve made leading to this point. I thought I fell in love with this trans guy. And maybe I just donâ€™t know how to be open. Iâ€™m trying to. I realize or more so guess she thinks Iâ€™m something else. I want to love her but idk if Itâ€™s meant to be. She made me feel things Iâ€™ve never felt before. And that was taken realizing my incapable wall like nature. I feel like itâ€™s too hard for me to understand her. But we are taking a break for a week. Iâ€™m going to call her on Friday and see how that goes. Trying to love myself, trying to forgive myself so I can love and forgive others. Realizing my narcissistic tendencies. I will have to deal with the guilt of bad decision. I can not control. I pray to stay above this creeping depression, because 30 min earlier I was contemplating making my body parts go up inside an 18 wheeler. Kinda worries me how bad the extremes are. I think somethings wrong. Any one understand this? Is there anyway to stay above the creeping death
