Please help meIm a fucking shell with no emotions. All I feel is emptiness everyday. I have to fake every single facial expression. Nothing matters to me and I can't focus on anything or hold a conversation with anyone. I've pushed away all of my friends, even the ones that understand what I'm going through. Throughout the day all I think about is just ending everything. From the moment I wake up until the moment I pass out I'm constantly thinking about ending my life and being at peace, but I can't because then my mom won't have a reason to live and I can't do that to her. I try to be funny and make people laugh but that's all I have going for me, and even then it's all superficial. None of my friends understand how far down I am and even when I try to explain it they don't care. They just say "I know" and then ignore me for a fucking month. I don't know where I'm going with this. I know I won't actually do anything, not yet at least, but it's I feel the end creeping closer,  I can't keep living like this, it's not even living. No matter how many people I talk (when  I can actually find someone to talk to), to nothing ever changes. It's like I'm stuck in an infinite loop of false happiness. Even when I'm laughing I'm not happy. It's just to make people want to hangout with me. Nobody wants to hangout with a suicidal "emo" kid, even though I'm well past my teenage years. I'm sure it doesn't help that I need to be fucked up to feel anything. I really just don't know what to do. I'm honestly scared. Ive felt like this my entire life, literally since childhood and I don't see it going away soon. I remember being a child on the playground and wondering why everyone was so happy. I just need literally anything to make me care. I don't even know why I try to talk to anyone, I only scare them away with this shit. It's not fair, I could have been something awesome like a comedian but instead I just sit inside my head and think about the easiest way to die. I'm honestly at my wits end with this shit. I'm honestly scared I'm going to kill myself soon. I want to die so bad but I don't at the same time. I feel like it's really only a matter of time. Even if I don't end my life I'll just be an 80 year old clinically depressed old fart shitting myself and cutting myself. See, that was funny. I could have been a comedian. But instead I can't even keep a steady thought without my mind wandering to putting a gun in my mouth.
