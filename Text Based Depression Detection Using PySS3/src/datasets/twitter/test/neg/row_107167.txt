Do you feel trapped?Do you ever feel like you are never going to be able to enjoy life or accomplish your dreams because you are trapped in you mind and seeing all these people succeed makes you so sad knowing you could be in their spot but instead you are trapped and the only thing you can see in your future is suicide?


I often sit on the porch in the middle of the night thinking about all my mistakes, the opportunities i had but didn't took them, and it makes me sad because those times aren't coming back, and the only way out i can see is suicide, that somehow would fix stuff, i don't want to be like this, but yeah idk what to do...
