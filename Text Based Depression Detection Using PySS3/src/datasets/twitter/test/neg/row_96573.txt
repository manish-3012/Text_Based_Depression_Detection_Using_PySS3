Abusive People Pleaser, so what's the point in living?Having been called an abusive and toxic friend without further explanation by the very same people I had been trying so hard to overcome my anxiety for, had been excluded from said group like garbage and receiving hate  for having panic attacks when being crudely shown how Im not "one of the girls" anymore, who says my other friendships wont end like that? My future ones as well?
Im not a good person, I never believed so, but am I really that horrible? Is anxiety my "toxic behaviour" or is it myself?

Im so worried about fucking things ups again. I cant even go to certain places or even hear certain songs because Im thrown into a fit of panic because they remind me of my old friends. I really, really dont want to keep on living like that.

The world doesn't need more bad people, and if I really am one, wouldnt I be finally doing something good to everyone else by killing myself?.

Wouldn't I, at last, be a good friend?
