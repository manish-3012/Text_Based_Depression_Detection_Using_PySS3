its scarya lot of times im siting here thibking about ways to die and imagining myself dying

and then i imagine how life would be if I dont die
i really really dont wanna continue on, but at the same time suiciding sounds a little scary 

but i still want t so bad

and i find myself thinking of my sister and online friends, they would probably feel bad, but i dont feel any emotion towards that

like i genuinely dont feel any guilt or shame about it and i guess that's a little rude

i dont know what to do anymroe my opinion keeps changing
i cant get help, i have a bad mom (whole other story that i dont wanna type here) and all the mental stuff is scary i dont wanna deal woth it

i just wanna go away like really far i wish i could run away imbut i cant do anything i cant change my lfie at all i really rwally wanna

pls if ur reading this itd be cool if one of you left a comment because everyones all of myf riends keep ignoring me and also people on reddit are so it feels a bit bad sorry for acting desperate
