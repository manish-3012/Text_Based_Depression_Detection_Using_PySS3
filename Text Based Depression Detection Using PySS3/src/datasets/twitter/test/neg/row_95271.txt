I just want a father figureI'm female, 15, and have always been one of the "weird kids".

I have 4 younger siblings, two of which are boys. I don't believe I'm ugly or that I have a bad personality.

My entire life, my dad has hated me. I grew up with him hitting me and screaming at my mom, and then evolving into him throwing things once my mom decided she had a problem with it. She won't divorce him because he has a well paying job and she doesn't work.

My interests have never been very "feminine"; I developed a huge love for Star Wars in elementary school and then rock music and robotics in middle school. I thought this was cool, and that my dad would be proud to have a daughter like this, but he just made fun of me.

He grew up with abusive sisters, one being named Jennifer. When he gets mad at me he slips up and calls me by that name.

He has never told me he loves me, hugged me, or even taken me to places like the doctor or to the store. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I don't want to be ungrateful, because I know lots of people don't even have a dad. I just wish he liked me.

It's been really bothering me lately and I just don't know what to do. If the only two people that are supposed to love me don't, then why would anyone else?
