I don't know what to do, but suicide would save me from this hellMy fiancÃ© and I are stuck in poverty loop right now. We can barely afford to pay our rent, and are currently on a payment plan. We defaulted on our car payments because we're trying to keep a roof over our heads. We lost our car insurance for the same reason. Then this morning, after a planned power outage for maintenance  was resolved, our power was kept off. Neighbors all have electricity (I can see their WiFi networks) but ours never returned. 

I feel so lost. I know it's not all my fault that this is happening; work hasn't been providing the hours I need, and he's been working a minimum wage call center job since he lost his in May. But I still can't help but feel that if it wasn't for me, my fiancÃ© wouldn't be in this mess. If I was gone he could move back to Oregon with his family, find something stable, and live without these shackles.

I'm ready to go anyways. This world is a mess and it feels like there's no room for me in it anymore.
