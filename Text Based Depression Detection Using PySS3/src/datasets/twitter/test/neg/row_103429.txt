Too much pain. It was deserved however.I am breaking. I am breaking *again*. How can I be fucking BREAKING AGAIN?! I really hate myself - and I am having such intense feelings right now. My life is a train wreck that I keep trying to control but with no sucess. Each time I think I see the light at the end of the tunnel, it turns out to be nothing more than pure illusion taunting me with the idea of personal progress. Life is now a mobius strip and I am unable to escape its loop. I cannot ESCAPE!

I'll get into the nitty gritty because why the hell not - you need not sift through my post history unless you really want to see me being my ugly self.  The past two years has been nonstop drama and pain. As of late, my ex (who dumped me in October) finally drained me of all my money, of all my self respect. My ex won.

I am a student and survive off of dirt. My course load is so intense that I cannot hold a job.  I cannot physically cope with devoting countless hours to school and then another 20 to work. I just cannot, I tried and had another one of these. So tha last $500 my ex drained from me? That was to last till August. I have nothing to subsist on. Its looking more and more like I hve to fucking whore out my body again. I did it before and I swore i'd never do it again.

I guess I was just kidding myself.

I am transgender. The only fucking good choice I've ever made is to transition. If I was still living male... I doubt i'd be able to deal right now.  I would be gone.  Only great decision thus far.  But, I with that I bear the so many risks. I've been attacked 7 times, raped last November. And now its all coming to a point.

I am told I am an inspiration and a clear leader. I say I am a fucking WORTHLESS piece of garbage. How am I inspiring others? How am I? I am an activist on my campus, a president, a moderator. But I did this for survival, its nothing extrofinary at all. I honestly don't see how anyone could respect me - I am suicide waiting to happen. Might not to to night or this year, but trans people tend to be lost via murder or suicide. Upwards to a 50-75% suicde rate because of rejection and othering. I wonder, which will I be? At least one way I am in control. 

I am unble to pay my bills. I cannot work - I already have an ulcer from stress. it would all be worth it if I could just be loved... just be cared about and held and told it will be ok. But I don't deserve that. I don't. Despite me staying up 3or 4 day in a row to watch over my ex because of PTSD issues, I didn't deserve their love, obviously. When I was unable to provide, I got cheated on and dumped. But I truly do deserve it. 

God, I canteven convince people to not off themselves. I'm a terrible fucking friend and a terrible person in genral. I have no idea how long this is, but I am submitting this because something is telling me to.
