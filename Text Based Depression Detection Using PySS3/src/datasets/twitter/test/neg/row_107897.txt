Emotionally abused, ready to give upI donâ€™t care to share my story. If I make any spelling mistakes, you can fuck yourself. I am being emotionally abused and I have been for upwards of a year, give or take, now.
Iâ€™m still living with my family (grandparents, parents, and a sibling). I am also emotionally abused by them as well as physically abused by my father.
The main problem lies in a friend of mine, who I will refer to now as Daisy.
I met Daisy a long time ago, and heâ€™s been on and off with me. Heâ€™s dropped me many times in the past and left me terrified of him leaving again.
I have done everything in my power to comply to every demand hebmakes but itâ€™s never enough. Itâ€™s never ever been enough for him.
He calls me lazy, incompetent, worthless, pathetic, stupid, anything you could think of.
He treats me like shit and holds the fact that heâ€™s dating the girl I like against me. I canâ€™t take it anymore.
He started ignoring me again 3 days ago. 
This morning I attempted to hang myself with a belt. It was wrapped tight around my neck and I had the end wedged in between the door and door frame. I stopped because my cat came in and needed to be fed.
I feel utterly pathetic. I want to be loved so badly, I am so desperate for his approval. I will never get it. I want nothing more than to try again right now and end my life.
