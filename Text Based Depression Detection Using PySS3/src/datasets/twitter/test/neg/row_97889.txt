27f struggling to find meaning moving forwardI admit this is a bit of a long rant, so thank you anyone who manages to read through it.  I really appreciate it.

Anyway, I have quite a few good things in my life, including good friends and a loving family, but if you ask me what dreams truly get me up in the morning with the will to live, there are two (albeit corny) answers: pursuing a career in writing, and the idea of falling in love with the girl of my dreams.

In High School I decided I was going to make at least one of those two dreams come true, so I earned a writing degree and started posting my work online.  It was...marginally successful.  In the years since I graduated I've averaged a little under $10,000 a year between my own projects and freelance projects.  Then the pandemic hit, and my income completely fizzled out.  Now I haven't been hired since June and am living with my parents to make ends meet.  I was already getting fatigued marching forward on so little income, now I'm wondering what the heck will even be left after this whole pandemic subsides.  I made the decision a month ago to start applying for a regular old 9-5 job, but it feels like it's crushing me.  It's not that I dislike the jobs I'm applying for, it's just that this dream has been the one thing giving me purpose, the thing I've worked 80 hours a week for and poured my soul into, and it's hard to imagine relegating it to a side project I may or may not have time or energy for anymore depending on what day job I land.

Unfortunately, the love side has been even less successful.  Dating with social anxiety is hard, dating while gay with social anxiety is harder, dating while gay with social anxiety while also trying to explain that you're not financially stable right now is even harder than that.  Needless to say I still haven't found that dream girl and probably won't for a while.

I know my dreams are a bit childish, and I feel guilty that having a loving family and the essentials of life don't feel like enough, but the reality is I feel like I'm barely functioning right now.  I'm trying to move forward imagining a new life that may not have either of those things I wanted.  However, it quickly starts to feel like the life I always feared: waking up in the morning to go to a job I'm lukewarm about only to come home, slog around my apartment alone, and then go to bed so I can do it all over again the next day.  I need a new meaning, one that's actually in my control, but I'm being sucked down into the abyss with this much faster than I can handle.
