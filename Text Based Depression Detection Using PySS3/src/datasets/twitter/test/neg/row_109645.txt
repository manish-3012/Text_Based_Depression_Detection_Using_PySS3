I'll never be normal.I'm an emotionally stunted excuse for an adult. Twenty-five, and I don't know how to forge relationships because I wasn't allowed to go anywhere or have any friends growing up. So now I just don't bother. 

I got screamed and cursed at whenever I didn't excel at something, so now, even the slightest criticism sends me spiraling into panic. I was only ever good at school; that's all over now. I feel like I don't even know how to function in the real world. 

I wish I had the strength to say 'screw them,' to rise above it all and come out the other side. But I don't. I'll never be normal. I'm the sum of all the things that were done to me, not the things that I did. But I can change that now, right? Wrong.

I'm a spiteful, bitter person. I'll always be a spiteful, bitter person. Today, I instigated a huge fight with my roommate over nothing. I can feel myself becoming the kind of person my parents were. I don't want to live if I'm the bad guy.
