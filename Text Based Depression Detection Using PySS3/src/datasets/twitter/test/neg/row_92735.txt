No one knows about my depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, no one knows. It's getting worse where suicide is becoming tangible. It hurts.

It happened again today. All the thoughts, all the feelings, everything. I was able to stay home and it was raining. It was peaceful, quiet. I lay in my bed because of how tired I had previously been. There have been a lot of things building up until today. Lately, Iâ€™ve been having a lot of anxiety attacks and itâ€™s not fun. My heart would beat fast, breaths quicken, and my body would shake. Thatâ€™s not the only thing, I have had a lot of time to think about my life and where it is, not where I want it to be. 

All of these thoughts piled upon one another and as I lay there with my blankets pulled up to my neck, I couldnâ€™t help it. My mind started thinking about ways I could kill myself.  I started thinking about all the ways I could die, how I could go out. Who would care if I died, if my ex would know if I died, if people were even aware that Iâ€™m in this state of mind. 

No one knows, except random strangers. I know that Iâ€™m in this state. I had a lot of suicidal thoughts varying from pills, slitting wrists, to overdosing on drugs. It was awful. I didnâ€™t think I could hit such a low. When I â€œsnapped myself outâ€ of it, I took a step back in my head and wondered how I got to this point in my life. 

I couldnâ€™t help it. I cried, I cried so hard. No holding back whatsoever. I donâ€™t remember the last time I could fully cry. In the past, I have cried but it was more of a quiet suppressed cry. This one was tears, moaning, screaming, everything. I didnâ€™t hold back because I couldnâ€™t. So many emotions came pouring out of me. 

While I was crying, I thought about all the things that I saw wrong with my life. I donâ€™t have any friends, my sister (the closest person to me) is going away, I have anxiety, I hate school, and how unhappy I am with life. Tears after tears after tears came out. 

I lay there in my bed, crying to myself. It was emotionally draining. I fell asleep afterwards because of how depleted I felt after I cried. 

Looking back at it now, five hours ahead, it hurts. No one near me really knows what goes on in my head. Depression hurts. Suicidal thoughts hurt. Not being able to turn to anyone hurts. Everything hurts. No one knows, no one from my organizations I work with, no one in my family, no friends. I put up this facade that Iâ€™m perfectly okay, but in reality, Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m not okay. Iâ€™ve come to realize that Iâ€™m not okay with life. I know I have been told over and over again to â€œlook on the brightsideâ€ and â€œ**P**ositive **M**ental **A**ttitudeâ€ but thereâ€™s been a disparity of that in my life. I donâ€™t know how to get out of this shit hole Iâ€™ve put myself in. 

I can't stop it, it's this long downward spiral with no way up. If I tell anyone about my suicidal thoughts, it's just been getting worse and worse. The other day, I had this large anxiety attack and I decided to take a bath to relieve myself. I filled the whole bathtub and sat in it. There were a few points where I stayed under the water a little too long... I pondered what would happen if I killed myself right there and then. I sill do. 

I've stayed away from baths simply to keep myself away from that temptation. 

I don't even know what to do at this point. My life is pointless in my eyes. Only my family would care if I died, but I'm not all that close with them, except for my sister. But she's starting a new chapter of her life soon and would eventually forget about me. 

Fuck.
