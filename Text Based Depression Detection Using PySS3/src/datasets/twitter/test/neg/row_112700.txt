Autism/Asperger's really is a death sentenceAs an autist I will never be able to have a happy normal life. 85\~90% of autistics are unemployed and will never be able to have careers, 2/3 of autistic men die without even one relationship from start to finish, and the autism suicide rate is 15x the general population's. Everyone thinks it's okay to discriminate against autistics, there is nothing good about this disorder. Nothing will ever change because this is the way I was born. I will never find love and will never be able to connect with others like they can with each other because of this retarded disorder.

Better luck in the next life i guess
