If no one reaches out to me by the end of the year, I'll probably do it...I never hear from anyone. No one ever says hi to me, asks if I want to hang out, or anything. I can tell when I'm not wanted. Those who do keep me around do so because I'm useful. I only hear from them when they need something. 

Please don't tell me I need new friends. I've tried making friends but these are the only types I can attract.
