I am tired of being transgenderMy biggest problem with being Trans is that I feel no one believes me. Even Cis people that "understand", or say they're an "ally". It feels like everyone around me thinks I'm crazy. I'm not REALLY a woman trapped in a male body, I just think I am.

And you know what? Maybe it's true.

But that doesn't make it hurt any less. Every time I see a group of girls, talking about nothing, knowing that I will NEVER join them. NEVER be one of them. It feels like being punched in the gut. 

And it doesn't go away. Everyday, again and again. If I'm just crazy, it's damned persistent.

Everything I see online, and at work, tells me that the Trans community will never be accepted. Feminists see us as men, and don't want us anywhere near them. Lesbians see us as Men. (And I'm attracted to girls, lucky me! /s) Men just see us as gay. Gay guys want to drop the "T" from LGBT altogether.

The only treatment for being Transgender is to transition. But as I'm constantly reminded, that won't make me a "real" woman. So what's the point?

And so this is why I want to kill myself. It's become increasingly obvious to me that Trannies have no place in this world. I have no place in this world. And I'm done fighting my Dysphoria everyday, only to be mocked and told that's it's not real.

It's just not worth it anymore.
