All I've ever wanted was a normal life but have been denied it.All I ever wanted was a normal family and friends but have received nothing but rejection, loneliness and misery. It's like the world wasn't made for people like me. My mother hated me and had considered aborting me (I wish she had). My psycho dad terrorised, beat and abused me constantly. 

As a result, I was a weird kid, a reject, and everyone hated me. Even as an adult, people sense that I'm an outcast so they ostracize me. The final nail in my shitshow of cunt of a "life" has been losing my health but I can't even afford a Swiss clinic to get the fuck outta this shit world. I nearly ended up plummeting off a cliff recently. 

I want to end this joke of a life badly but I'm afraid of the pain of death. I even contemplated suicide by cop at the airport by shouting "bomb" at a heavily armed cop. With my shit luck I'd end up being arrested only and humiliated so I didn't. I never asked to be born. Why the fuck is there no OFF button???
