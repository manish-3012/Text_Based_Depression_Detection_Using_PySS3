Wow!Simply put, thanks. I've been somewhat depressed for almost a year now and, like many of you know, it's a tough thing to deal with. My depression is mostly born out of a horrible feeling of lonliness. The feeling that I am totally alone, that no one understands etc. Despite that though, I don't think I've ever seriously contemplated suicide. I've had the thought, but never felt the need (if that's the right word) to actually do it. 

Anyways, the purpose of the post is to simply say thank you to all of you on this wonderful website. This is, admittedly, my first post but I've been watching this subreddit for a long time and not only have you made me feel like part of something, like I'm not alone and you all have seriously helped with my own problems, but you have helped me be there for someone who has seriously contemplated suicide. Someone that has hit rock bottom. You've helped me, in a sense, to save someone's life and no amount of thanks on my part will ever make up for the amazing help you've all unknowingly given me.

Once again, thanks.
