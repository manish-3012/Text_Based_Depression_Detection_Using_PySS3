Don't wanna commit to anythingSo spring semester begins tomorrow for me (delayed a week due to snowstorm on the east coast) and I don't wanna drive to school. I dropped out last semester due to injury and have lost all my motivation since then. My body, it seems, is breaking down. Furthermore, if I don't finish my program in three semesters, my dad would send me back (I moved to the US from a developing Asian countrt four years ago). I have been doing physical therapy but the progress is too slow.

I have come to realize that people who look like me, sound like me, and have my background don't get to be successful. I would rather focus on getting my health back than spend many a sleepless nights trying to get a fucking certificate. My dad, however, thinks that my injury is minor.

I have no friends. The people who genuinely care for me (my mom and my sisters) are in my country of birth. I am 22 and a virgin. I don't have a girlfriend either. I have so far kept everything to myself but soon, I feel I am going to explode and (mentally) hurt the people who love me. 

I have been punching and kicking walls and crying uncontrollably for a few months now. I need a friend. Help me. Please. For the sake of my loving mom and my sweet sisters.
