I don't want to live...But I don't really want to die either. I just want everything to stop. Or I don't know... I don't know what to do. I don't know what I want. Everything is meaningless. And I'm sick of going through the motions every day for no reason. I just want a reason to live, but I can't find one. I have no hopes, no dreams, no aspirations; there's nothing that I really want to do and no one that I feel compelled to stick around for. My family and friends could all get by without me. Even my cat; he'd be fine in the hands of my roommates. 

So I'm left with no purpose. Nothing that I need to be here for. And I know some would say, "Who really does have a purpose, anyway?" or "Maybe yours is out there; you just haven't found it yet." And maybe that's all true, but I am sick to death of waiting for my life to make sense or to have meaning. And there's only so long I can sit stationary before I begin to rust and fall apart. 

I have tried to find something worth fighting for, but I just don't have the strength to stand for anything. I'm just so tired and I can't think and I can hardly function and I just want to give in to this urge to sleep. I just want to close my eyes and fade away from here.
