A long, uninteresting storyI'm 40, female, and I don't exist. I work a minimum wage job; my boss and all my coworkers are younger than me. I'm married to a man 9 years younger, who has an intense fear of being alone and proposed to 3 other girlfriends before he met me. I don't think he chose me, but rather accepted me because I was there. I don't feel attached to him, or anyone. I can't have children. I'm 5'7" and 242 lb (down from 296), but both knees are failing rapidly and I can barely work, let alone exercise, anymore. I find very little enjoyable and have existed for years only to not upset my family. I can't afford school (I get bored and stop going anyway) or therapy or to fix my knees. We could never get approved for adoption and I don't really want to raise other children (I know that seems selfish, but I can't bond with others properly and I feel the chance would be better with my own child). I don't believe anything happens when we die, but stopping my consciousness sounds amazingly restful. I won't leave children. I won't change the world. I don't particularly enjoy life. I feel like I'm putting a lot of work into this to just fade from existence with zero impact on anything. If I leave, now, my attractive and humorous husband will find another wife and have the children he always wanted, my mother will be sad, and my sister will have a kid and name it after me. If I don't, I have another 30-40 years of the same shit and I just don't see the point.
