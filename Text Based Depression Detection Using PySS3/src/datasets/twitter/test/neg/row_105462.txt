Thank you everyone for everything you've given me.This is probably the last you'll hear about me. I've been throwing up for the past hour because of the liquor and I'm sure I'll be dying soon. I hope it'll be in my sleep to avoid any pain. Thank you to anyone who ever bothered to read anything about the mess that I am. I got to vent like I wanted and decisions have been made. I wish you very best.  You're all good people with good intentions. I'm sorry that I couldn't contribute anything here or anywhere. 

Peace, love, and good luck. If any of you are struggling, I hope I don't discourage you. You deserve better in life and I hope you find it.
