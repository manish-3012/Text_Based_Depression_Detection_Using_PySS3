I do not want to be here anymoreI feel like everyone around me is happy and I just canâ€™t be happy with them. Its like I resent people who are happy and push them away even further. I feel like cutting myself or trying to kill myself is the only way to make people care about me. I go to therapy and I am trying to better myself but I can't help feeling that there's no hope for me. I wish things had turned out differently, sorry not much to the post just needed to vent somewhere.
