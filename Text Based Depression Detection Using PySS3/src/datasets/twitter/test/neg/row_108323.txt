Emptiness/NumbnessIâ€™m 20 years old currently serving active duty in the United States Army (42A). Even tho Iâ€™m pretty successful in life, I still want to die. Iâ€™m not suicidal, so please donâ€™t say that. Iâ€™m not going to do it to myself cause Iâ€™m a coward, I just want it to all be over already. Iâ€™m sick of feeling empty and helpless. Iâ€™m sick of feeling worthless and alone even though Iâ€™m surrounded by my best friends all the time. I just want this pain to stop.
