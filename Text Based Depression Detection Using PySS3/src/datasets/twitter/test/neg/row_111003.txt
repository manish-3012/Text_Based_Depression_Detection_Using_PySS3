I'm so tiredI took a handful of benadryl and hydrocodone. I'm not sure how much exactly.  I threw up a little after but I still feel woozy. I cut my arm twice. I haven't done that in like 5 years. the wounds not too bad cuz I only had some hair scissors to use. 

I need help mentally. I need some outside people to talk to. why is life so hard and does it  ever get easy? ? I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, since I was like 8 at least. it just seems to always get harder. . I hate everything and everyone lately. I'm so tired of being walked all over by everyone and having my emotions controlled by other people. I don't think I'll try another attempt tonight and I'm getting a cat tomorrow so hopefully she'll cheer me up but I'm scared I'm gonna get back in the habit of cutting every day. I'd rather just stop all together whether from dying or getting better.
