Have the courage to post, don't have the courage to not end itMy husband left our family for our mutual close friend. I've been raped by my ex fiance and I lost our baby at 22 weeks. I'm convinced my daughter doesn't love me. No one does. I'm isolated and driving around feeling lost. I've been feeling like this for a long time and I just want to die. I don't want to be here. Nothing is helping. I want it to end.
