Why some medications drive us suicidal?I am used to sneaking some Clonazepam from my mom who has Bipolar Disorder. Those pills help me to sleep well but make me feel slow and suicidal. I made three suicidal attempts last month under the effect of those pills. I like how they make me have a real and sober view of my life. I wonder why those pills have such power to lead me to extreme rationality.
