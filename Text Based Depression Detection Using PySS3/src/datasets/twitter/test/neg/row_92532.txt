I donâ€™t see how living longer will helpIâ€™ve been told Iâ€™m manipulative and attention seeking, which I can easily see. Iâ€™m perfectly average, no special talents. I donâ€™t feel any genuine connection with any one, and Iâ€™ve been told that my anxiety will prevent me from ever being in a relationship. I genuinely hate my life and donâ€™t see how Iâ€™d be able to better it. My days are spent just trying to not be over stimulated, but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve only ever wanted one genuinely good day, but I never get one.

Iâ€™m planning to hang myself from the closet bar, using a simple noose. Donâ€™t have the ability to access a high up place, so Iâ€™ll use my closet. This way, I can just kneel down and die. In the case that I have some magical epiphany and discover my self worth, Iâ€™ll have a knife in my pocket to cut myself loose.

I just genuinely want it all to end. I donâ€™t see how Iâ€™d be able to live a pleasant life, so I just want it to be over.
