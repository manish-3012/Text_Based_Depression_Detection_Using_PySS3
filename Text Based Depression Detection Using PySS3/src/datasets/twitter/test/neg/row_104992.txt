Post all over the place because Iâ€™m so confused myselfI have a loving family with some conflict but nothing too bad itâ€™s just I have no motivation to do anything. Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m am miserable or depressed every day I do have good and happy times but I have no motivation to do anything I named for myself like school work. I know it sounds weird and I canâ€™t I understand it myself that there are people who have felt abuse and neglect and have serious issues in their lives but I donâ€™t have any of that it is just sometimes so hard for me to be productive in the smallest way. I am never going to do it because my mom has already lost someone suicide but I am having these thoughts really often.  Or that I am typing this I am realising that the hardest part for me is that for every that went wrong in my life is nothing but my fault and I have nobody to blame but myself. I am very scared for my future because i donâ€™t what to do while so many people I know my age already have plans for the next 5 years which terrifies me. I am turning 17 and after I moved countries and started doing online school I feel that o have no friends in my country and itâ€™s hard to spend time with the friends that I left because of 4 hour time zones. I have always been awkward with girls, all my life and even when through the years there were not a time but several who were interested in getting to know I always pushed them away, idk why whenever they talk to me I donâ€™t know how to act or talk and push them away so they lose interest. Too many times I have been to mean to my friends and then realising it later feels horrible and I try to not do that but just sometimes it happens without me realising it. I have good friends but sometimes I feel they do t like me very much. 

If you read this far I know my text has been all over the place because it sounds stupid and I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m feeling now often wishing that I just would not wake up the next morning but I just wanted to share my puzzled thought and feelings that I donâ€™t understand
