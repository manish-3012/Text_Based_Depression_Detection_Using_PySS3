I hate myself and want to dieI fucked up big time.

My BF is pretty much don with me after seven years of borderline bullshit.

I've been drunk for a week.

I don't have any will to live.

I thought I was fixable. My therapist told me I was fixable. I'm not.

I said and did inexcusable things. Any humane society would either lock me up or kill me.

Is it better to live as a monster or to die as a good person?

Edit: I'm not dead, obv. Still feel like shit, but talked to my therapist. He'll call tomorrow to make sure I'm okay and I have another appointment in person the day after tomorrow. I am gonna stay at my friend's house over the weekend so I wont be alone. Sorry for having anyone worried, and thank you all for your concern.
