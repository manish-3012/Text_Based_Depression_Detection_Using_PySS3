I finally care about myself...So... where to start, i made a post on a different account and stated that i felt suicidal and useless and that i was nothing. I got alot of support for that and i got mire into art and creative writing and just feeling better about myself. I still have those moments of depression although they become less frequent and i even set up an art page on instagram to where i feel even more better. 

My grades in school have boosted with my increased confidence and ive even seeked help which is something i avoided, ive built up so much energy that ive even progressed to trying to write my own novel and just honing on my art. Life does get better, if u seek support. I just wanna thank anyone who had helped me in my old post that, lifted me from that period of isolation. And too anyone feeling depressed now. Fight!
