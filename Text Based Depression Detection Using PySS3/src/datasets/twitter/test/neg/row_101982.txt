Circling the drain...I've always been depressed in some form or another, but about six months ago it hit a new low. It finally got so bad that I sought out professional help for the first time ever. I'm trying out different drugs, but so far they've had no positive effects (but some negative ones, which isn't helping...).

I think about suicide constantly. Most days are a bit of haze. I don't want to die, but it feels like I've exhausted every other option of relief. So I always come back to that sure way of solving things...

I'm hoping some meds will finally help. But I'm finding it increasingly difficult to keep my life running until then. Each day is more difficult than the last. I need to find some source of strength to hang on...
