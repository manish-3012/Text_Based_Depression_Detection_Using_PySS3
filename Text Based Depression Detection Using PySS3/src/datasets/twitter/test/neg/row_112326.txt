I want to stop existingI've had this feeling for a long time of just wanting to stop existing. I'm not really depressed i think and have a very good life with a lot of people who love and care for me and idk I just can't make sense of the whole situation I would probably never do anything but I do feel myself living more recklessly almost like I'm hoping someone will do the job for me. i guess it might be because im not really feeling emotions anymore but not really sure
