Read this or donâ€™t idcI am too lazy to live and too scared to die. Please excuse how unorganised this is I am new to reddit. Whatâ€™s the point of living if there is no afterlife? Letâ€™s say there is none, then living and doing good or bad would not matter because tomorrowâ€™s generation and their children are all going to die anyway. If literally everyone will die in the end, then why do we try to progress as a society if we have nothing at the end of the line? Letâ€™s say humans will survive forever. And for what? Just to advance and advance? There is no meaning in that. There is no end goal. There is nothing. Why then, should I live? I feel numb already. I have been consumed by a 6-year addiction. I am done (but not really since I keep coming back to it) I am unmotivated in my classes, I do not want to even try. I already believe I have failed, and have done nothing to make progress (which makes me a failure all the more). I apologise if this is confusing. I just want to write. This is actually the second time Iâ€™ve wrote this, because the first draft got deleted. I am scared this draft will not be as well written as the one prior, and I am debating whether or not to post this. (Well youâ€™ll see or you wonâ€™t). I do not want to die, but to go somewhere nice. Just not here anymore. Maybe where I can get a good hug. I just want a hug
