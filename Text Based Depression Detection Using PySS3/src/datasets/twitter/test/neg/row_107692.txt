feeling like shit againi haven't posted here in like 2 years. it's not that it got better or anything i just didn't want to post. however what i post might sound selfish and a stupid reason to feel like shit but im gonna write this out anyway.

im gonna start by saying im not gonna log in to this account again after i posting.

im in 2nd year of high school and it's alright, ive met some people in my new IT class and it hasn't been the worst time.

now that it's christmas break and christmas eve i started feeling like complete shit. i told my dad about a gaming pc i was trying to get that ive been telling him about since last year and i got the same response, "we don't have a lot of money" but i know he got paid a significant amount of money for christmas so it's clear that he doesn't wanna get me anything. just like last christmas, and the christmas before and the other christmas. ive learned to expect the least from him and that's exactly what im getting.

that made me feel like complete shit, made me feel that no one cares about me, that the people i met at school don't actually want to talk to me, that my online friends just tolerate me. the fact that im gay doesn't help either, i know for a fact that my family and my "friends" from school would hate me if they found out since they're openly homophobic. my online friends know. im going to distance myself from my so called friends at school to the point where i don't talk to them anymore.

ive been crying for the past hour, i don't wanna do anything for christmas and i wish i was dead so i didn't have to go through a shitty christmas again.
