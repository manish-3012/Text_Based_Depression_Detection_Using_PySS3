I'll be dead before I'm 16For the past couple of months I've been stuck in a cycle of coming home from school and staying in my room to hurt myself. Nobody likes me nor wants to talk to me at school due to the scars on my arms and legs (I'm 15), they call me edgy, emo and ugly, to which I acknowledge and agree with them. 

Most of the time I kinda just exist, like I'm there in the back of the class but not really. Can anyone acknowledge my existence?, or do the teachers and students don't want to.

I'm going to commit suicide by the end of this year and I think that's a good thing, I've already attempted it in the past a couple of times, this time I'll make sure my methods are properly done. No one will miss me or remember me and I think that's a good thing.
Komm SÃ¼sser Tod.
