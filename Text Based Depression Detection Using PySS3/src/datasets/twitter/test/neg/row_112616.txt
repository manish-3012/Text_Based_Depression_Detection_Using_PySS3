Sick of this lifeI am 18, I don't have any friends, I have a very bad relationship with my parents and with my sister.

I am sick of feeling so depressed and sad. I thought to kill myself to kill myself last week, but i couldn't make me do the move, but tomorrow it's the day.

This life ain't for me, please don't say to don't do it or think about your parents, because they don't care about me or anything that I do.
