I'm 16, should I just kill myself?I'm a 16 year old male and I've pretty much have fucked my life up already. I don't see anyway how I'm going to be a successful adult. A little about my situation:

Well, I'm pretty much done with school. I'm not technically a drop out because in my state you have to be 18 to drop out but I haven't gone to school in about 4 months and my school hasn't really done anything about it. I don't really have any friends. I don't talk to anyone at all. Most days I just sit in my room, listen to music, read philosophical  books, and play video games. I also really like mathematics. I taught myself some calculus. For anyone knowledgeable about math, I can do limits, derivatives, integration, and I just started to teach myself differential equations. I am going to do series a little later after I master differential equations because it seems a lot of integration is used to solve differential equations and I don't want to forget how to integrate. I do genuinely like learning and I figure that since I'm probably not going to college or any higher education institution I should probably just teach myself some of this stuff now. I also hear Einstein mastered differential and integral calculus at 12 and even though I'm 16 I told myself, "Hey, I want to do that." Not saying I'm a genius or anything. Honestly anyone with an IQ of at least 90 can do this stuff. 

Anyways, I really hate school though. I hate the way everything is "enforced." Some of the stuff is so useless. Don't get me wrong, I do think there is some genuine learning going on in public schools. But I just don't like the set up of it. I can't stand it. I need to be independent to study. I prefer to teach myself than have someone teach me. I know, I probably sound like the typical winy angsty teen and truth be told I probably am. But I am just expressing myself because I rarely get to. 

As said before, I really do nothing all day. I have no life and no job and no drivers license. I actually did apply for a job a while back but they never go back to me. Probably because of how low my GPA is. All the other jobs I have looked at you have to be 18 for which is honestly fucking ridiculous. I'm not even old enough to work at places like Family Dollar or Walmart. :/

I am seeing a lot on the internet and news about prom and prom stories. I'm not going to my junior prom because no one knows I exist anymore. Besides, I am really fucking ugly. Like I a strikingly ugly and that is what I hate most about myself. Even if I was still in school no girl would want to go to prom with me. I am gross and disgusting. This makes me want to die the most. I hate myself. I hate myself so much. I have social anxiety in public because of my hideous face. I was made fun of as a kid for being ugly. Their words have never gone away. 

I am ugly, smelly, stupid, and have no future. I'll be living in my parents basement. I fucked up. I fucked up so bad. I am such a low life piece of shit. I am so lonely. I feel so so lonely. I never go anywhere or talk to anyone and it is eating me away. I just hate myself. Why should I keep being alive? I just want to die. The worst part is, I know the situation I am in is all my fault too. I have really thought about maybe hanging myself or overdosing or maybe even jumping off the bridge downtown from where I live.
