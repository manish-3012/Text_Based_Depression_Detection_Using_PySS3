.....Iâ€™ve tried to kill my myself twice. The first time with a knife (but I was caught and hospitalized before I could do any bring) and the second with Tylenol (I was taken to the day after and obviously survived). 

Iâ€™m wondering what others have tried that didnâ€™t work. Because when I try again, I will succeed.
