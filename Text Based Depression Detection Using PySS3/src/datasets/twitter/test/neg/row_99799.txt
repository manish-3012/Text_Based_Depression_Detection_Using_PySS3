This virus is breaking meI've spent much of the month of March indoors, and I'll be indoors for much of April because of a mandatory quarantine (we have a guest staying with us that just returned from Japan). Today all I've been thinking about is how much I want to die. I don't want to live with the aftermath of this. The world is falling apart, and it's going to keep falling apart and I can't do this. I can't deal with this.
