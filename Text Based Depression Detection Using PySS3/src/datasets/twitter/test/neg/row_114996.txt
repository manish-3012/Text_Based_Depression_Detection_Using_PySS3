Finally.I just took a bunch of meds, nothing yet but I feel kinda dizzy. Iâ€™m a bad person who thought was good. I blamed everyone but me for things, but everything bad that happened to me was my own fault, I was waiting till my dog dies I donâ€™t want to live him alone but I guess Iâ€™m kind early. Sometime I felt so much pain in my heart I was only left to curl myself in bed like I was stabbed. Itâ€™s bad I canâ€™t distract myself forever, soon or later. Iâ€™m sorry for dropping it on u guys but I had to put out my chest. Miserable life. Iâ€™m sorry.
