I don't know what to do anymore.I've dealt with this depression for so long, but i know others have the same problem and it makes me feel guilty for being so weak compared to anyone else. I was always right up there at the top of the class, maybe not the best but definitely up there. I never felt challenged. I love to work hard, I have a job and help my parents. Yet, this feeling never goes away. I just want to sleep and never wake up. I met a girl and was dating her for 3 years. She attends college on the opposite side of the country. I'm in California and her school is in Pennsylvania. During the last 3 years we were only able to see each other for 2 months. The long distance relationship took its toll on both of us, and she finally gave up. I didn't do much to help the situation. During most of our relationship I just sat in my room or went to work. Couldn't find the joy in doing anything, just wanting to die. She tried really hard through skype, and i saw that and I loved her for it, yet this feeling never went away. It was only when she was here, that it was kind of kept at bay. She dumped me a couple of days ago, and it was one of the hardest things i ever went through. There have been other girls in my life, and I know down the line there maybe others, but I don't care. I only ever cared about her. When our relationship first started, i was in very dark place. My stepmom left my dad, because she didn't want to deal with my sisters and I. It was hard having to see my dad go through that. I've seen him go through it not once, but twice, with my own mother. Yet, he can still keep going. I feel so guilty for being so weak and a coward. I just don't know what to do with my life. I never wanted anything, until I met my ex, but now that's gone. To live a live for myself is what everyone keeps telling me, but I just don't see anything for me. I never wanted anything out of life. She left me because she saw me as a dead end. Of course she would give up on me, after all i gave up on myself. Before I met her, I was so close to achieving my BA, just had one year left of school. I just couldn't find the motivation to finish. What was it all for I told myself. Now that I lost her, all i have is regret. This should make me a better person, I should learn from all this she told me. I'm not stupid, I do see that. I just can't keep going, no matter how hard i work, no matter how much i try to find something just for myself. I just can't live for myself, if it was up to me I just rather die and get it over with. I opened up to people about it, and many tried to help me. I can see them trying. I have even gone to a psychologist in the past but the feeling never goes away. My life was ruined, my relationship destroyed and I have no one to blame but myself.
