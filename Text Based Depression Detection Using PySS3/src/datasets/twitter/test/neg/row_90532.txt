This is it, 2016 is the year for me. I can feel it.This year is the end for me.  
 
Moments into 2016 my long-distance girlfriend of 3 years dumped me. I haven't been able to focus since. I can't eat, I can't sleep and no matter what I do, I can't get her out of my head. She was the one for me. I've never clicked so well with anybody else ever. She was the only person I could actually be myself with, the only person I could confide in.  
  
We both had so much in common, neither of us had relationship experience before this so it was a real joy getting to learn it all with the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. Now, all I can of is the person she replaced me with and the thought of her with anyone else makes me physically sick to my stomach and I don't want to feel this anymore.  
  
This is only the tip of the iceberg of depression and self-harm that has pushed me down this road. I'm going to write my note, and do a little bit more research and then poof. Hopefully I'll be gone before the end of the month.
