I have no one to turn to. I have lost all hope and strength. My mind and body are falling apart.I can't even call a suicide hotline. I am starting to become so physically ill, my voice is now just a useless, scratchy hissing noise at best. The back of my throat feels so dry and so cold. My body is so weak.

It was bad enough just dealing with the effects of anxiety and depression, but now that I never leave my bed, that I hardly ever eat because I can no longer afford to buy food (even if I somehow had the courage to leave my house and go to the store). I used to just sleep as much as I could, but now I just toss and turn in my sheets. I used to numb the pain, distracting my mind on the internet with anything that I could, but now the numbing effects are no longer effective.

Everything I try to do to help myself is useless. I have so little energy, and my tolerance is really starting to run out. Anything that I can even try to do now, I just feel like a struggling infant.

I feel so fucking ill, it's starting to get unbearable. I feel incapable of getting help. The only person I trusted, and actually wanted to help me, just kept saying that it was something I had to do on my own. And I know that is at least partially true in some ways, but I just feel like I can't fucking do it. They got so fed up with me, they had to get away from me. And now I feel more lost in the world than I ever have in my entire life and I don't know what to do.

I feel so hopeless and sick.
