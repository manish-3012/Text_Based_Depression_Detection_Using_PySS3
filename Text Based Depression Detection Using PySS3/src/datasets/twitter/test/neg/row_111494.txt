Ladies and Gentlemen, this may be it. The show is over.Friends, Family, Strangers on the internet, this may be it for me. My entire life, from the day I was ten years old, I have been depressed. While it is probably from genetics, or the abuse I suffered through as a child, today I reach new depths in ocean of despair. My college career is over as I am no longer able to afford it. I will soon be homeless as my father intends to kick me out. I have no close friends to turn to so I leave the world with this. A lasting message to mark my puny existence on the forums of reddit. Before you ask, yes, I have attempted before. Yes, I have tried medicine. And yes, I have tried facilities. But to no avail. Today may be my last day, and if it is, I bid you all adieu.
