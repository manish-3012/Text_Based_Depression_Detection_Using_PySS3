Slow burn.My 29th birthday is next month. 

I don't really want to live anymore. I've always been a depressed person, but I've always had good reasons to keep on going with my life, or at least, I used to have things that made me feel alive. I used to make music with my friends, and I used to have friends. Lots of bad ones, and a handful of true friends. Over the last ten years, a lot of them have changed, moved, or just plain moved on. I totally destroyed my friendship with my best friend, claiming stupid reasons that weren't real. 

I have never believed that I would live past 30. For the past six years or so, I have been withdrawing from the people around me and self destructing pretty heavily with drugs and alcohol. I decided to quit my band, give up on being creative, and withdraw from any part of the community. It wasn't just some weird purposeful thing. I also felt really alienated from everybody. When surrounded by so many of my peers enjoying the fruits of their long, hard effort, it's depressing to sit back and think of all of my failures. Eventually, I went too far on drugs, having at least a couple of near death experiences. The only person in my life I really want to live for is my mom.

After those, I decided to see a doctor to get on antidepressants. Before I made that decision, I was suffering heavily from anxiety attacks, and I would cry myself to sleep every night knowing that I purposefully fucked up my life. I hate myself. I have always hated myself. When I look in the mirror, I am disgusted with my body. I hate the way that I use people, and I hate that I have lost my ability to connect to anyone. I don't even think I really love my mom or any of my friends anymore. All I can think about is my disgust and self loathing, the pain of being alive and feeling like an outsider no matter where I go or what I do, or feeling like I'm not good enough for anything. 

Since I went on antidepressants, I no longer cry myself to sleep and I am able to function. I feel little to nothing 90% of the time. The ten percent of the time I do feel anything, it is regret for the family, friendships, and relationships I have thrown away. I spend most of my time either throwing myself into my job to the point that it affects my life in a negative way, or distracting myself with TV or video games. 

I do not feel like I can make a connection with another person in a meaningful way. I am not a social person. The only thing in my life that really makes me feel loved at all is my cat. I had another cat that I felt that way about who died a couple of years ago; it was devastating because it was the only living thing that I really was able to bond with and love. This inability to bond with other human beings and the hatred I have for myself make me want to take as much prescription medication as I have available with as much alcohol as I can drink, or seek out enough opiates to die a peaceful death in my sleep after taking enough Ambien. 

I have thought long and hard about killing myself over the past 13 years, but there has always been some silver lining to keep me going. I have given up on my dreams to go to school to do something I'm not really sure about. I have severed all my social ties in the town that I currently live. I have no friends to talk to anymore. The only person I really feel horrible about hurting is my mother. The pain of being tired and alone is just getting to be too much. Even with antidepressants, there are days when I can just barely get the motivation to breathe. 

I'm just so tired. I don't want another year, and I don't want another ten, or twenty, or forty. I just want to let go of everything and end the pain of being alive and alone. I don't want to continue on the path I'm on in the world we live in. This is a terrible place and I am a terrible person.
