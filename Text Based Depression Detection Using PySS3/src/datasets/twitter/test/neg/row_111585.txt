Leaving a traceWell when I do eventually do it, Id love to not leave a single trace behind but just deleting ur prescence like that is just too sad isnt it. I personally think my dreams, my likes, my dislikes is basically contained in my phone so for whoever who finds it might be able to know that I once existed. But then again, doing that would be entirely devoid of the point wouldnt it sigh.
