I can't take this any longer. What did I do to deserve an alcoholic mother, a concussion, a panic disorder and a life like this?I got a concussion yesterday and I cannot think straight, therefore I apologize for some menial grammatical English errors. I want to attend Harvard, so incredibly bad. I have an above 4.0 GPA, am involved in 4 clubs, most of which I either founded it or am the President. I am also in marching band. As you can see, I live a very stressful life. I have had countless panic attacks due to my panic disorder and literally do not know how to relax. 

Also, my mother thinks I need to go to a mental hospital. I accidently pulled her down the stairs, because I didn't want her to leave. She now thinks I intended to harm her and that she should have called the police.

I finally flipped today when she wanted me to see my regular psychologist again today, even though I was in an insane amount of pain and didn't want to go. She almost dragged me to the car. I don't see why I should see a psycologist if a condition has only been like this for barely a day. 

My panic disorder, my asthma, and my concussion is unbearable. I faint about every other day and last night I went unconscious about 6-7 times last night and I feel awful. I can barely walk or anything.

I am on a few new medications and I have a concussion. I am obviously not the same person I was before hand, due to the added side-effects and a concussion. My mom is still convinced I should see my psycologist, even though I hate how he talks to me. I have called my friend and I don't know what to do. I want to end it all. Please help me.
