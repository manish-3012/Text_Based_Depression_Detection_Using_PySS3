It'll be okay.Hey friends, I know it's really hard right now. I know you feel like garbage and the world is pretty shit at the moment. I know you probably feel like you are worthless, that you don't matter. That there is not a single living being on this earth that cares about or loves you. I swear to you there is. I care about and love you and wish you the best in your life, and I bet someone else out there does too. You might not have met them yet, but I promise you that they're there, waiting for you to come along.

Your life is worth living. Take it day by day. If you can't do that, take it hour by hour. Whatever you enjoy doing? That's worth living for. Have a pet? That's worth living for. Its one baby step at a time, love.

You will fall down and feel like you can't get back up, but I promise you that you can do it. Nothing in this life is impossible. You can do this. I love you.
