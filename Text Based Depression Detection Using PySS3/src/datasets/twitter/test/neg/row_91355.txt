chit chatWell.. do you have any franchise or media you take comfort but oftentimes feel like you are getting repetitive and a menace to be around because you constantly make references and mentions of it? Please feel free to share! 

Like many of you here, I find myself in a really dark place right now and self-inserting into characters from series, manga, videogames etc. has been a coping mechanism of mine for a while now. I know, this is pretty unhealthy in retrospect as I become stagnant in terms of personal growth but oh well.
