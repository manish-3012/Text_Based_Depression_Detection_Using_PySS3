How to write the perfect suicide note?I don't want anyone to feel any regrets about not being able to have helped me and I want them to know that this was inevitable. Also I want to tell my family to go on happily. I want them to go, explore, and traveI the world like we always wanted to. I especially want to tell my brother that he should achieve his goals in life and not get demotivated. I want to tell him to get married early and start a family so he doesn't feel lonely. And just tell my family that I love them.

I am wondering if reading all this could be traumatic to the family? In that case should I just leave a simple sentence that says nobody was responsible for this and that I killed myself of my own will.

What is the least traumatic approach to writing a suicide note for your family to read after you are gone?
