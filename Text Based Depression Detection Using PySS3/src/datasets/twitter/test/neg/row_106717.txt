People who say thereâ€™s a light at the end of the tunnel are full of shitWhat tf is even the point?? I know Iâ€™m gonna end up homeless so dying now seems like a goo alternative. I invited some day one friends over today and it was incredibly uncomfortable. I wanted to talk to them but it seemed like they had other, more important stuff on their minds. They make friends so much easier. People are talking to them all the time. I barely get one text a month. They clearly just want me around bc Iâ€™m willing to spend money on weed. Nobody needs me around.
