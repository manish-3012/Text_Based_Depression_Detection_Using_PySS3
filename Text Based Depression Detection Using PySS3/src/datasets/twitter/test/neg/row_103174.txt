In the end, it's the only sensible conclusionI got a new job. A two-week contract, putting together fridge shelves. A machine could do it. I've never had a job that couldn't be done by a machine. That's all I'll be doing for the rest of my life, between failed attempts to study something. This is all I'm good for, and I can't stand doing it.

 I keep feeling like Iâ€™m too good for the only kind of jobs Iâ€™m good enough for. I keep failing the only thing I'm good for because it disgusts me that I'm not better. Unfit to work is unfit to live.

 Suicide isn't the only option but it's the only one with any moral or dignity.
