happy death dayI thought that title was pretty ironic considering itâ€™s my birthday today lol...Anyways, my countdown has come to its end and so has this account. Iâ€™m going to speak my mind because I have nothing to lose. I tried to be a good person surrounded by people who donâ€™t even know what good is. At a time like this when Iâ€™m speaking without a filter and with tears blurring the letters on my screen, my one wish is to go back in time when I was young and my heart wasnâ€™t as bruised as it is now. Being good to people whoâ€™ve thrown me under isnâ€™t the only foolish thing Iâ€™ve done though. Iâ€™m here letting out my heart to people I donâ€™t even know. I wish I could be the me I was just a year ago. Full of dreams and goals, full of passion and motivation. I used to look forward to the future but now waking up scares me because I know itâ€™ll be another day full of disappointment. I feel so fucking stupid saying all this on the internet but thereâ€™s no one I could think of being this open with. Right now it seems as if Iâ€™m just talking to a blank screen. Will my words reach anyone? I donâ€™t know. But the words of the people whoâ€™ve messaged me these past few days have definitely reached me. Iâ€™m grateful for that. My hands are shaking and my breath trembles as I type every word of this. It seemed like for the longest time I was trapped in the sea and for some reason I thought that Iâ€™d learn to breathe underwater but I remembered Iâ€™m only human and itâ€™s just physically impossible no matter how hard I try...no matter how much I believe. Iâ€™m allowing the waves to swallow me up now. At this moment of weakness, Iâ€™ve realised how I strong Iâ€™ve been. I hope everyone and anyone struggling can continue to be strong for much longer than I was. Fear is the sole reason why Iâ€™m sad with what my life is. Fear is also the sole reason I used to hesitate in taking away this sad life. Iâ€™d always wonder, what does one do when theyâ€™re too scared to live but also too scared to die? Where does one turn to where they can find a safe haven between these two things that make us human beings? Maybe Iâ€™ll get the chance to rest now.
