I donâ€™t want to wake upIâ€™m only 16, yet I just donâ€™t see anything getting better. At school I have no real friends to spend breaks with. Today I spent half of lunch in the bathroom and the other half in the library. I didnâ€™t eat because I am too embarrassed to be seen alone. School is awful. Honestly the only thing keeping me alive right now is gaming. I play one game and itâ€™s literally my only source of happiness. If I could I would fast forward 10 years. Maybe I would be happy then. I have 2 years left at my school. Iâ€™m not sure if I can survive another 2 years of absolute misery. Life really doesnâ€™t seem worth living. Iâ€™m so close to just ending it. I cut myself a lot tonight after a year or so of being clean. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I have no one to talk to... the â€˜friendsâ€™ I talk to in lessons donâ€™t care about me, like at all. Iâ€™m always the second choice, no one would willingly talk to me. Literally the only things keeping me alive are my fish and gaming. I wouldnâ€™t want my fish to die because of me. I donâ€™t have a good relationship with my parents. Im willing to bet most people would forget about me pretty soon after I died. Iâ€™m so close to just drinking bleach but I donâ€™t want to make my family find my body. Thereâ€™s literally no hope for me in the future. Iâ€™m so fucking done.
