I just want to go...I don't know if this will help at all but, I want to share my story if that's ok...

I have been dealing with depression for years now. It's been hard. I was molested and raped when I was 8 years old. I was bullied at school, because I spoke broken English and I was poor. Growing up my parents never seemed to get along.. I can only name a couple of moments, so growing up I never knew a healthy relationship. I don't remember my childhood and counselors say it's because I blocked it from my memory as a defense. My senior year is where it all just unlocked, I guess. After my first serious relationship ended I kind of lost my shit, and started having suicidal thoughts. I ended up in a mental institution. Never tried anything but the thoughts were always there once I got out. My hs bf was the first I opened up to about all this and the psychiatrist said it was what set me off.. I moved on..still depressed I met someone else.. mind you I don't really trust easily especially guys.. we were together for a while but given my trust issues... it went downhill... I tried to overdose when it was over.. I just couldn't take any more pain...but I was ok.. I threw it all up... of course I then met someone else... this guy was different.. I felt safe and comfortable and it was an instant connection... they say when you know, you know and I knew... we got married... and now we're getting divorced.. again all my issues.. this pain it's different from my previous relationships and it really really just broke me. I just want to go already and stop all this pain..I've had enough. I tried antidepressants and therapy, but it doesn't help.. I just want to die.
