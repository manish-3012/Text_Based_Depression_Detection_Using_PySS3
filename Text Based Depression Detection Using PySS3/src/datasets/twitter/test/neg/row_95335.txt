When a (non)reply is enough to make me suicidal..maybe its just the last strawI Was feeling a bit depressed,but its become much worse since I whatsapp-ed a friend(actually my crush),I told her some really good news about me and my family but she just saw it and didnt answer.Other times previously we had talked but she was a bit..distant, a bit cold. This is strange,she doesnt act like that when we're together IRL, and because of lockdown I cant see her IRL

The fact I will never get to marry the girl I truly like depresses me,the fact I cant (possibly)marry a virgin girl to have a large family,as my religion dictates i should do, depresses me..Im trying semen retention(a cool kid term for male celibacy),and Im kinda going insane ,I have done 1200+ abs crunches daily for example. Im also upset at the incorrect hiearchies of society and rich people being degenerates,and not conservatives as I once thought.

I cant suicide painlessly with the items I have avaible, so I doubt il try it but the feeling of despair and hopelessnes is certainly there,I even researched foolproof methods for suicide recently.
