I have no future, idk why I keep goingI dont think I'll ever live a normal life. My mom didn't let me go to high school, said I'm too dumb for that. I struggled with math but that's so unfair. I just wanted to go to college, dude. Have a career, be a good guy. Maybe a firefighter or a paramedic. I try to study on my own, I'm good with words, but that shit is hard, not everyone can learn alone...

I wonder if I did something bad my past life to deserve this life. Mom almost never lets me leave the house, drinks all day, says we dont have money for food, but always have money for booze. I'm almost an adult with no skills. If she ever kicks me out I'll never get anything. I don't have skills for a job, friends, nothing. I'm totally worthless, this house sucks but it's the only place that I have to survive. I have zero chance outside. Totally set up for failure. It just hurts so much. Knowing I will never accomplish anything. She beats me and it hurts, but it hurts even more knowing this is the best place for me. My life is over already, I didn't even had a chance.

I just wanted so bad to have a gun or a bunch of pills and get this over with already. There's no way my life is going anywhere, it's too late already to change anything. I hope that I can have a fresh start in another life after I die.
