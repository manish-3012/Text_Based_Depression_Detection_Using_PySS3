Every moodswing brings me closerI go through phases of stability before it comes crashing down again worse than before. 

Recently I tried to draw again, something I always loved doing, and couldn't stand it. I can't keep myself afloat with the prospects of future endeavors anymore. They don't matter. I don't care to find out if I'd get married or what my career would end up being or if I travel everywhere I want to go.

I want to be a big girl that can have tough conversations and go out of my comfort zone without getting triggered. I miss being able to love without wondering how long it'll last. 

I find myself trying to dismantle razors again and I'm slowly planning a suicide everytime I fuck up. I know that it's dangerous to find peace in death but I do. Im barely holding on and it's almost histerical no one can see that.
