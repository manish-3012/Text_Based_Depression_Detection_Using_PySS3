I donâ€™t want anythingI just donâ€™t want to to do anything ever. I just got my dream job, Iâ€™m not excited or happy. I go through life getting by on the little things that make me smile, but Iâ€™ve just got tired of anything that gives me joy. Iâ€™ve been numb for 14 years, Iâ€™m 24. Itâ€™s starting to feel like Iâ€™m never going to feel real happiness ever again. Iâ€™ve tried therapy, medication, dating, making new friends, and nothing makes me feel anything. I just feel like the day my mom dies, Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I couldnâ€™t put her through that, but I just donâ€™t want to live.
