Perhaps I can help. I am an eternal optimist. I am not here to show you how cool I am or lucky I am; rather I want to help you find your happiness. Because happiness is the one thing that can let you over come everything. It is the foundation of my success in life. So if you need anything reply to this thread or PM me. I would be honored to help a fellow human being. 

My three (rings)principles
&gt;BE HAPPY 
&gt;BE HUMBLE
&gt;BE HARMONIOUS 

Lastly my mantra 
&gt;REMAIN A STUDENT.
