Don't know what to do anymoreNo girl in life, no future ahead of me, I hate my job. Ive been suicidal since high school ive been getting more and more depressed as I think of my life. I don't know what to do anymore. My life is heading down. The only things keeping me in this planet is thinking I'm gonna be famous one day by my youtube channel. Other than that I would have ended it a long time ago.
