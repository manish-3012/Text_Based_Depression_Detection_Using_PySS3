I just want to sleep foreverI have no friends, no (meaningful) family, no dreams, talents, or even hope of a better future. 

My mother has literally told my sister that sheâ€™s glad that we donâ€™t talk, and my dad is kicking me out in the middle of a pandemic.  Iâ€™m unemployed, mentally ill, and have no money because my bank â€œlostâ€ all of my savings (all $200 of it) and is fighting me on any dispute Iâ€™m making with them.

My dad has over $100k in the bank and refused to even buy me a card for my birthday because he â€œdoesnâ€™t do giftsâ€.  He ended up screaming at me during my birthday, and talking about himself and his day for most of the time we were together anyways.

Iâ€™m going to be homeless in the beginning of next year, and no one around me even gives a shit.  No one has ever loved me for who I am, and as far as I can tell, never will. 

Please, I donâ€™t want to die, but I am so tired and hopeless that I donâ€™t see any other way to have any semblance of peace in my life.
