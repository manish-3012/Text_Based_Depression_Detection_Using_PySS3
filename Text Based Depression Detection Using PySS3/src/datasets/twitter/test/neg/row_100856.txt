Wife doesn't love me anymore. What if I just "went out for cigarettes" and never came back?As my wife's career is taking off, she has fallen out of love with me. At the urging of her father, she isn't divorcing me since she doesn't make enough money to support herself. I've been having a lot of suicidal thoughts, but I made myself a promise that I wouldn't take my life, I would just take off. Just stop being this person, because it's not working anymore, and there's no reason to expect it to get better here. I'm not strong enough to go through the motions in hopes of something good happening someday. I think I'd do a lot of hiking for a while. There are no kids, fyi.

Has anybody done this? How did it go?
