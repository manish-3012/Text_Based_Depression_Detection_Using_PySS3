on the way homeas the title says, on the way home. from the psych ward. over the weekend. was there over the night between Tuesday-wednesday as well. 
not feeling okay because apparently the health care system can walk over you when they think it's been going too far and been such a long time that they'll involve your parents even if you're an adult. im 28. 
which feels like shit. i want to have a private life. they're suppose to call my mom this week. could be today or tomorrow or whenever. it feels like my parents will never leave me alone after they'll found out i tried to take my life during Tuesday.
