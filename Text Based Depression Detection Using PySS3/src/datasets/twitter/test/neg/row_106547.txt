I want it to be quick and painlessWith no chance of me surviving in a vegetable state in the hospital causing my family more pain.  I'm a coward I'm to scared to bite the bullet but there's nothing going for me. The only thing keeping me alive is the thought of the pain my death will cause my family. I haven't had a hug in years or had a real 1 on 1 conversation for years I've completely shut myself off from the world and am just a living zombie. I come to work just to get it over with then go home get black out drunk and wake up and have to go back to fucking work I'm so sick of it. I can't save any money i spend it all as soon as i get paid.. i don't know what to do. . My work is making me work longer hours and I'm so depressed im spending hours at work not even doing anything I'm actually trying to get fired.. but all i have to go to is my old job loading trailers and i was just as miserable there but it was less hours and i wasn't as bad as i am now.. i dont know what to do
