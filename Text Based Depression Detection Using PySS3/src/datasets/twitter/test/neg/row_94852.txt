I almost killed myself last night.Last night I started to fall back into my depressive state so I had the bright idea of taking 4-5 shots of rum. As Iâ€™m wallowing in my self pity and hatred I reach for my pistol and load a round in the chamber. Iâ€™m staring at my gun thinking about how much I hate myself and am ready to die when I look up and see my dog. Heâ€™s a puppy about 8 months old and heâ€™s always by my side. I started thinking about how his life would be without me to care for him. Then I thought about my parents, brothers, sister. I couldnâ€™t do it to them.
It hurts. 
Everyday I have to battle my depression. Everyday itâ€™s a struggle to get out of bed. Everyday I just want it all to end. 
Some of my friends and family battle with depression and suicidal thoughts and like to come to me to talk about their depressive issues or suicidal thoughts, in seems to help them seeing as theyâ€™re still here. 
I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. 
I donâ€™t want help
I donâ€™t want to take drugs
I just want to be free. 
Maybe one day I wonâ€™t bitch out and Iâ€™ll actually pull the trigger, but not today. 
Thanks to my pup, my family, friends. 
Iâ€™ll still battle my depression quietly with a bottle. 
But Iâ€™m still here. Waiting to see if thatâ€™s a good thing or not. 
Iâ€™ve been told that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Iâ€™ve also been told it just passes the pain from one person to another. 
My question is though whoâ€™s the selfish one?
The one killing them-self or the ones stopping one they love from killing them self?
 None of asked to be born (obviously) why is it so bad to take your own life if you donâ€™t want to live it anymore?
