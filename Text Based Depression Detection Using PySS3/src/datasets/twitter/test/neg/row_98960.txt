School is coming up again and I wish I could just die before thenLast semester was a huge embarrassment where I failed 3 of my 4 classes. One of the classes was Math which I was doing really well in for the first 3 years and my 4th class was music which I had been getting really good at, and just barely passed this semester (though I feel like I didn't deserve that and my teacher only gave it to me because he liked me and it was his last year)  


I had no friends at all in any classes so I was alone all day outside of lunch where I would talk to one person, the semester before I had a friend in one class that was the only thing keeping me from being a depressed mess that semester and since then they haven't responded to me online at all in 7 months, haven't tried to contact them in 5 months but they ignored those messages so I've kinda given up, though it's probably my fault since they gave me an address for the Crisis Center they went to to get help for depression... but I've been too lazy to do anything about it  


I'm huge and have developed an eating probably where I'll eat whenever I'm bored or stressed, it's gotten to the point where I've been eating less but that's only because I've been feeling full extremely quickly these past few days, but not the kinda full where I'm no longer hungry but the kinda full where I have stomach pains and regret eating in the first place   


I've wanted to kill myself for 3 years now and I haven't done it because of laziness, which is also the reason I haven't gotten help  


I'm 18 years old, a huge failure, scared to grow up and go to college or get a job and I cry over the stupidest things ever  


Sorry if I used too many commas, got a 30% in my english class last semester
