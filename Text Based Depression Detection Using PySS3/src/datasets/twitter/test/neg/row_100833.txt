I'm sitting in front of a loaded .357I can't think of any reasons not to put it to my head and pull the trigger. There is no god. There is no order to the universe. there is no purpose to this existence beyond what we give it. Camus said in regard to this problem, the problem that the universe is utterly indifferent to our daily struggles (what he called absurdity) that: "This world in itself is not reasonable, that is all that can be said. But what is absurd is the confrontation of this irrational and the wild longing for clarity whose call echoes in the human heart." I want there to be a reason to continue to live, but there isn't one. Of course I could give my life a meaning of my own, but ultimately it would be as empty and worthless as the universe itself. There is nothing that can be done to solve this problem, and even suicide does not stop the universe from being irrational, but at least it puts an end to the perpetual struggle for clarity. At least I could finally stop trying to reach a goal that i've known from the outset is unachievable.
