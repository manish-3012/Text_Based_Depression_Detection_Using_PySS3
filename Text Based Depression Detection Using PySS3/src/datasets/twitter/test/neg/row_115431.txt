I'm trying to get betterI constantly think about suicide. I'm constantly lonely and I hate myself. I feel anxious and angry and unfulfilled all the time. I don't know how to deal with the loneliness. I've been abused my whole life and it feels like I'm fucking doomed.

I don't know how to get better. I keep trying, I really do. I'm trying to sleep right now but all I can think about is how empty I am and how easy it would be to die.
