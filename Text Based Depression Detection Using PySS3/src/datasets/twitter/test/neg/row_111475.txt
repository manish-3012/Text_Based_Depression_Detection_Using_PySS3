My cat is the only good thing keeping me alive...I donâ€™t have friends or family that would give a fuck about me if I died. I just have my little buddy, my one year old cat. I love him a lot and I think itâ€™s safe to say he loves me to. But lately Iâ€™ve been so depressed Iâ€™ve been thinking about ending my life a lot but I always put it to the side for my cat, my best friend. I donâ€™t think I could ever leave this earth knowing heâ€™s still around I just couldnâ€™t do it. He brings me the little bits of joy that keep me alive when there is nothing and no one else who can.
