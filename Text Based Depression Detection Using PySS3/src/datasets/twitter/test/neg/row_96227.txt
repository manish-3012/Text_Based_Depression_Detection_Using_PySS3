I Am so Tired of This Suffering...Iâ€™ve honestly grown tired ofâ€¦everything going on for the past seven or eight years in my life...It's been filled with so much crap...these past few months have been especially crappy...I'm already failing two of my classes in this fall semester...there are still a lot of problems going on back at home...to top it off...my girlfriend broke up with me on our six month anniversary. She told me she couldn't be in a relationship for a while, but earlier today, I see her in picture with another guy at a dance...I can't take it anymore...I try to be a good person, but all I manage to do is annoy people with what I have to say, and annoy them with the problems going on with me...I've come to realize I really don't have a purpose to live...I feel like I wouldn't be wrong...I have great people in my life...but I feel like I'm always bringing them down with just being around them...and I don't want be a burden to them anymore...(and sorry if I seem like I'm jumping around...)
