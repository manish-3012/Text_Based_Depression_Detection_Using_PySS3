Find myself posting here yet againI've tried so hard. Tried so hard to get myself out of this seemingly never ending hole. I moved in with family, threw myself into job applications, and got 4 interviews on one day. For the first time in a long time, I started to see a little light... Until I was pulled over and my car was towed due to unpaid registration. I missed all 4 interviews with no way to get to them. I feel like that one little step forward become 10 steps back. So now what? Literally only $23 to my name, so it's not an option to get my car out. I'm trying to figure out if there's a way I can just sign it over to them so I won't incur storage fees. This is just... Never ending. And I'm having a really hard time not just ending it myself.
