HopelessI tried to kill myself yesterday and even after practicing it hasnâ€™t worked. Iâ€™ve been out of work for 4 years while being a full-time caregiver to a family member, so no one will hire me, not even gas stations or nursing homes because there is nothing useful on my empty resume. My college degree is being completed online, which people see as worthless. No car. I have absolutely no hope moving forward and I really just want this life to be over with. I still live at home in my near-mid twenties. Pathetic. Iâ€™m done with this, but my method to die still wonâ€™t work. I wish I could just get into a car accident or get past survival instinct.
