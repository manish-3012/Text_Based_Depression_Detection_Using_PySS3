The End.Last night, i had a breakdown while i was in the bathtub; i reached for the blade but i was too much of a coward to finish what i started, but i've made up my mind, i'm going to finish off what i was too much of a coward to finish last night. I don't know why i'm writing this. No one cares in real life so maybe "someone" will read this...
