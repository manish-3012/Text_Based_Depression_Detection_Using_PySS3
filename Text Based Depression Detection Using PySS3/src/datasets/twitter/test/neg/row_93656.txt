How much longerI donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep doing this. I canâ€™t stand living anymore. Everyday gets worse. Iâ€™m not even living just surviving. 
 
Iâ€™m so drained. Iâ€™m surprised Iâ€™m still even here. For years Iâ€™ve been trying to live. Always tried to think itâ€™ll be okay and itâ€™ll get better but it doesnâ€™t itâ€™s the opposite. Iâ€™ve always said my lifeâ€™s is a cruel joke and it really is. Even if I do feel happy itâ€™s only for a short time then everything crashes. Itâ€™s devastating. Itâ€™s so hard to live with the pain. Nothing really brings me joy anymore. Every smile or laugh is fake. Iâ€™m so sick of just everything. I feel like a zombie and that Iâ€™m just going through the motions of life. 

My last attempt was a few months ago and nobody irl knows about it.  Everyday I see the pathetic scar I think what if I would had succeeded?
 
I  tried to get help for depression years ago    but I was treated like a criminal. I was forced into a mental hospital. The way they looked and treated me was awful. The way they looked at my arms like they were so disturbed and disgusted Iâ€™ll never forget that. 

Thereâ€™s so much on my mind but I donâ€™t even know how to word it. I just want the pain to go away. 
 
Iâ€™m just a lonely pathetic human.
