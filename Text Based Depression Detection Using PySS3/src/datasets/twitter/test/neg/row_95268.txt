I wish I was successfull at suicide 3 years agoWhere to even begin, 

Originally I made this account to tell someone my thoughts without actually having to see them, as you can see in the post history. It did help a bit, and I found out that expressing myself in "sketches",memes or these kind of posts does help.

To recap my previous posts, I tried attempting suicide 3 ish years ago when I was 16 due to a abusive/horrible mother with a father absent due to divorce, sadly I was unsuccessful but I moved away and took control of my life as I made friends, hobbies and worked out, grades were decent too I guess.

However, the past 3 years I had episodes every day, hallucinations, voices, break downs, mood swings, self harm to being frequently on the verge of suicide, with absolutely no reason.

Atleast 3 years ago I knew why I wanted to kill myself, but now i know nothing. Honestly it's getting to me lately, as recently I wrote a suicide letter and started researching on effective methods, and I'm becoming more and more unstable every day, one day it's going to happen and I hope soon tbh.

I mean, what do I lose? My friends obviously hate me (logically speaking this isn't true but thats how I constantly feel), I have nobody close except a best friend, but to be honest I started distancing myself, and maybe that's the way to make it less painless for all. Just isolate, let them forget me and do it. I uh don't know at the point. It's a nightmare, it just hurts living without a reason.

I just want someone to come to me, give me a hug and say "it's ok". But nobody will do that, cause no one knows how serious situation I am in. Nobody knows about the fact that right now I'm on the roof, on the edge specifically ready to jump off to the electric pole a few meters below.

I want help, but nobody seems to be able to help, not even the psychiatrist.


I don't know anymore
