The only reason I won't do it...is I'm too afraid to fail. A friend of my mother's failed. He's blind. I also don't own, nor plan to procure, a gun. I don't want anyone to have to clean up the mess. I don't mean loved ones, I don't have any of those. I mean anyone, ever. I don't want to affect anyone, I don't even want anyone to notice I'm gone. I just want to be deleted completely. 

But I don't want to live. I don't want to be me anymore. For as long as I can remember (I am 35) I have wanted to be anyone else. I would daydream in school about how even the kid in class with the seemingly worst life had it better. I get it, we all say that, but I was *right*. I knew we were poor, I knew we were being abused, and I knew we had an abnormal home life. I knew. 

I have done everything I could for the same entire life to try to **NOT** get to where I am right now. All I wanted was a quiet, normal life. I don't get to have that. Everything gets taken away or every person disappears. 

I am so incredibly alone even when I'm surrounded by people. All day, I imagine a bullet going through my head, a semi failing to see me in the lane, a bridge collapse, any random anything would just put me out of having to continue to wake up and go through the motions. 

Every one of you who has family, friends, or a spouse who still supports you are so lucky. I sit here and weep when I see how actually lucky other people are. 

All I've ever really wanted is to feel a little loved, and I mean the kind internet people can't give me. Closeness, intimacy, and just a little security that each time I come home they'd be coming home too. 

I get nothing. I get loneliness and heartbreak followed by more loneliness and more heartbreak. I just want it to end.
