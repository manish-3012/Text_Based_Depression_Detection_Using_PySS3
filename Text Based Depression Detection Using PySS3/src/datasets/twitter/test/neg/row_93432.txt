Tne Struggle is too muchHello redditors, I feel like reddit is currently the only platform where I can share these thoughts without holding back at anything.  
Anyway, I'm a 21 y/o male college student in Germany. I have been depressed for about 6 years, with the last 2 years being super unstable an suicidal.   
Quick Backround information:   
My parents got divorced and used me as some Psychological-warfare e.g., before their divorced got finalised, my mum came up to me and said to me (I was 4-5 back then): "You better tell the judge that you want to stay with you mom, otherwise you can look out for a new mom and won't see me ever again." Both eventually found new partners, but   
I grew up with both of parents sh\*ttalking each other whenever I was with the other parent.   
Now, my father is a Psychologist and my mum is a special educator, author and quite renowned for talking up publicly against child abuse in any form. (She was at a special needs school mostly for children with learning disabillities in a shady neighbourhood in another city)   
My mum had mentally abused me for years, as I mentioned earlier both would sh\*ttalk each other but my mum took it to another level, telling me my father doesn't want to see me, doesn't love me etc. while she would say things in the line of: "Your step mom is a whore, if you ever go over to their house you should just forget me etc."  
This so f\*cked up typing it out really hurts more.   
Over the years my mum cemented a shady picture of my dad in my head, leading myself not wanting to see him for a year or so. To be fair, my dad never was the emotional type of guy and he would forget to pick me up, or forget to call me on my birthday, or would just pick me up and park me in front of a TV.   
My dad raised my stepbrother and stepsister, but would just pay bills would not really give a shit about me.   
When I was 15/16 my mum caught me smoking a joint with a friend (honestly like the third time We've done it), leading her to throw away my Playstation, my Yu-Gi-Oh! collection (2kâ‚¬ worth at that time, had a lot of ghost rares and 1. editions), called the parents of the few friends I had and basically told them to not let me chill with their child because I am the devil and a bad influence. Being bullied 3 years and not having that many friends didn't help either. Nor that my mum told me to pack my things and move in with my father. I cried for like 2 ours in my room, went into the kitchen and told my mum that I think it is the best if i move out. Threw a tantrum at me how I could ever say something like that and that I really hurt her feelings. Well, my father wasn't even in the country, so he suggested I should call our local youth office to see what they could do. My mum dropped my ass of at foster care and said deal with it, only to pick me up a few days later.
