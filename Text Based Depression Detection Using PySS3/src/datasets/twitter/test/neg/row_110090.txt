I donâ€™t have an interesting titleMy whole life has been a fucking mess. I suffer from an intense mental illness. Medication exacerbates my negative symptoms. Iâ€™m tired of fighting, Iâ€™m tired of being the bad guy, Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™ve sincerely thought about suicide for years. Often. The only reason I havenâ€™t is because I donâ€™t want to hurt my son. Heâ€™s the only good thing that I have. Iâ€™m at a point where I feel like having a mentally ill mother is worse for him than killing myself. Thereâ€™s so much that I want that Iâ€™ll never be able to have. Normal things. I donâ€™t want to keep trying anymore.
