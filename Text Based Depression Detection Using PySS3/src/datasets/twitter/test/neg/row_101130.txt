guiltthe only things im really living for at this point are my boyfriend and my dog. i love my dog to pieces, and i know she would subsequently pass due to grief if i died during her lifetime. and i love my boyfriend so much, he means everything to me. but i feel like im too fragile for him to love. i know he loves me, but i have C-PTSD, and a lot of issues that just make me feel like a messy person. a lot of the time i think people would be better off distancing themselves from me, as i have too many problems that stick to me like tentacles, and pull everyone i love tight into them. i think that maybe, if he got rid of me and cleansed himself, he would be better off in the long run, because i would go and poison somebody else. it truly does feel as if every day im alive i just make a bigger mess to clean up. i dont want to bother him even more than i already do, which is why im saying this here.
every single part of who i am makes me want to destroy it. suicide feels more like a necessity than a desire at this point. i keep thinking i should blow my own head off with a 12 gauge, rid this planet of me, doing everyone a favor. every day is more uncertainty, more anxiety, more stress for everyone i know. i feel the need to be coddled and taken care of, like a baby. i need to be carried and rocked and told that everything is okay. i dont want to stress my loved ones out like this anymore. i need to get out, but i cant leave. i love my amazing boyfriend and beautiful puppy too much to pull the trigger, but simultaneously i feel as though im harming them. im not sure of anything anymore.
