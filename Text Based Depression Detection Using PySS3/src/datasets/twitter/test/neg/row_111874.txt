All getting too muchIâ€™m 16. 16 with a completely messed up head that doesnâ€™t know how to be happy. What is happiness? I canâ€™t bring myself to feel it anymore and even if I feel it a bit, the slightest glimpse of happiness I feel depression just doesnâ€™t let it happen

Been battling a battle Iâ€™m constantly losing for years and worst thing about it is Iâ€™m young...and if this is the way life is going to be I donâ€™t want to live it and this is why Iâ€™m typing this tonight. 

I have my GCSES but I donâ€™t go to school due to my head completely just holding me back so Iâ€™m not going to have a good future, Iâ€™ve completely let my parents down and ive messed up my whole body and mental health even more due to the drugs and I canâ€™t take it anymote

Just wish there was a reverse button to go back to the good times, but unfortunately that canâ€™t happen and all I have to say now is I hope u never get in this much a hole as Iâ€™m stuck in but it happens to the best of us. If ur going tbrew a hard time keep ur head up but for now Farewell
