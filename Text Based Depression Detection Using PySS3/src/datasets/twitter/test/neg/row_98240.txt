I've been practicing hanging myself and I can't wait for the day when I finally do itMy life is fucked now. There's no turning it around. I'm just worthless trash who deserves to die. No one is going to convince me otherwise. 

But yeah I practiced and there was no pain really. I'm going to keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct my body has and I will succeed. The thought makes me so happy. 

Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy. I take great solace knowing that this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon. I'm saying this on reddit because if I were to share this with people in real life they'd try to stop me and I don't want anyone to take this away from me.
