I hate that my internal conflict is too complex to be fixed.I tried therapy. I volunteered like they asked and tried to view the world in a positive light. I mostly do anyway. I just don't like my situation and how it's never improving. I'll never be able to start a family again. There is no one in my life that loves me or that I can reciprocate that with. I've been alone since the day my last family member died and I don't have whatever it takes to meet someone that wants to be with me. 

Lack of feedback is what I'm going to blame all this on. You try and try but without feedback how do you fix the problem? All I've ever gotten is generic advice to that question. Nothing of any substance that will help me. 

I've been lonely for so long now I'm not even sure I can adapt to being with someone if it did happen. I've been able to fix a lot of stuff but not this because I have no idea what the problem is. 

I just want to die. When I woke up this morning I was so disappointed I hadn't died in my sleep. I've been toying with the idea of killing myself for a little over 5 years now. I think I'm finally serious about it. I'm tired of hearing how things will just magically get better if I wait. I'm sick of everyone waving their success in my face. I worked really hard for basically nothing in the end. It was all a waste of time.
