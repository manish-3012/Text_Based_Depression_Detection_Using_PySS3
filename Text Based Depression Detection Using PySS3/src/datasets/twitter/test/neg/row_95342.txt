I'm honestly just so sick of being suicidalIt's been plaguing me for literally longer than I can remember. I am almost *constantly* making plans, but I haven't actually made a real attempt yet. I've gotten close a few times in the past, but I always stopped short. Nobody ever caught me.

I feel like I've known for a long time that I'm going to kill myself. It's not a question of if, but when. I mean, maybe I might get killed instead. I'm definitely not dying of old age.

I admit I find myself falling into fantasies of all the various ways I could do it. It's usually shame that holds me back. People genuinely care about me and would be devastated if I went through with it. If I did, I would certainly hope they'd be mad at me, and even hate me, but I wouldn't ask them to; I'd have no right to ask anything.

And I feel such an overwhelming sense of guilt about it. How could I? Why am I even wasting time with this shit? As long as I keep living, there is no use to accepting my imminent suicide as a possibility, because planning for death is inherently harmful to my goals in life. Yet it's always there, tugging at my throat like so much I'm-not-crying mucus...

I also find myself fantasizing about failing a suicide attempt. I want someone to help me. I mean. People are already helping me. Not long ago I was homeless, several times. I went without food and walked up to 10-15 miles a day sometimes. Now I have an apartment, a job, sometimes friends. Heat. Hot water. Electricity. Consistent access to food and a bed. A safe place that I can invite people to. I've started therapy and was prescribed medication but haven't started it yet because I haven't been able to muster the energy to bike to the pharmacy.

I have been really shaky at work though because I have been having a really hard time focusing and not falling asleep randomly. I'll start to feel kind of dead and go to lay down for a couple minutes, and I'll wake up a few hours later, often feeling worse. A lot of the time this is because I forget to eat. I don't remember eating anything today. I might have some bread.

I don't want to kill myself, but I want to die. I don't think I am going to do anything rash tonight but I am afraid that eventually I am just going to accept all the horrible things about myself I pretend aren't true or don't matter so much and I'm just going to stop the embarrassment.

I felt better when I was homeless. I don't know what I'm thinking or doing. I am so afraid of being gaslighted. I am so afraid of failing and getting brain damage or being maimed. I feel like I've said all of this before
