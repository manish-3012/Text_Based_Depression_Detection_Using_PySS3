I'm ready to give up the ghostI had gender reassignment surgery 3 years ago and it was totally botched. Since that time, I have been mentally abused by my surgeon and had a total of 3 failed revisions, each of which has left me more fucked up than before. My partner left me  2 years ago because I've been so miserable, and over time, I have lost all of my friends. I don't ever leave my room, I'm in continuous discomfort, and I've gained 50 lbs. My life is not my own, and every shred of what I loved and enjoyed about life has been taken from me because of how I was mutilated. I am only a husk; my soul died long ago. I have a follow up appointment where I get to ask for further revision in a final bid for normalcy in 1.5 weeks. If I am denied help, I intend to hang myself in my room and just fucking end this nightmare.

Edit: A user in another sub used this post to reply to one of my submissions, encouraging me to kill myself and making fun of me for having posted here. Now I just feel worse.
