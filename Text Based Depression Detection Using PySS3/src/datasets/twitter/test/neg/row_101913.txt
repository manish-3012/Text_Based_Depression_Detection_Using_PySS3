I'm gonna end it soonI don't really know what to say, i've tried killing myself like 5 months ago and failed, today i woke up feeling ok it was the one day that i said to myself "ok lets try to be positive, they say that this shit works right?" and it all backfired, got home and got into a fight with my mom because she put all my stuff on boxes and i couldn't find shit i was looking for, then she freaked out and threw his phone and glasses in the ground and then my stepfather started to throw shit at me, so i just left for a walk, wanted to throw me over a bus at the highway but no bus passed, came buck come, minutes later they left to watch over my sister who is at the hospital because she has some pains, they don't know what it is yet, after they left i went to buy some cigarretes and some booze (i've been trying to stop smoking for the last few weeks but fuck it you know), so i came back home, alone, and started binge-smoking and drinking, texted a friend of mine who has been throught this and said that i should call him when i'm feeling low, he just ignored my texts, fuck him, i tried looking for the sleeping pills and other drugs i am supposed to take but apparently my mother took'em with her, so here i am drunk felling like fucking shit and reassuring myself what i've been planning to do to kill myself for the past few weeks, idk what to do, idk why i'm even writing here, i just feel fucking lonely you know?, i've been isolating myself for the past few months because if i go with it i think it will less painfull for the people i know if the connection between us is more weak, i got the job of my dreams a few months ago but i still feel like shit, i don't know how to socialize with people, i also been thinking about my sexual orientation i think i might be bisexual but i don't know how to cope with it, i'm an open minded person but i don't think my family and friends would understand me if i came out to them, life just feels empty you know?  i just want to end it soon, and i think i might be trying my second suicide on the coming days, just need someone to talk to, anyone, im looking for a reason to stay alive, because right now i don't see one
