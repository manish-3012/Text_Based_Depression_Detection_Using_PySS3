The only reason I"m not dead is because I don't live alone.I have basically no chance of achiving my dreams any more. MY government hates me. I hate me. I don';t want to kill myself. BUt god I wish I was dead. The only reason I haven't already killedmyself today is my girlfriend, and even then She won't be here forever. So I guess when she hates me too, I can just die without hurting people.

How can republicans be this hateful? What gives them te right?  How dare they.
