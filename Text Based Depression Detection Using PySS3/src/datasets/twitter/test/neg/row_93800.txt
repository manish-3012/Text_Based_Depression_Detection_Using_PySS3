I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing. Iâ€™m tired.I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing anymore. 
I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m in the right place for this, or if Iâ€™m saying the right things. I just know I need help.
This is just kinda a giant vent about some things in my life and I donâ€™t expect anybody to read this or respond.
My name is Ari. I am 15 years old. 
I feel like I was created wrong. 
I feel like I donâ€™t deserve a life. 
I know a lot of you are going to say this is just teenage hormones talking, but I know it isnâ€™t. I know it isnâ€™t. 
Iâ€™ve always been a good kid. Great grades. Not many friends. Never got in trouble. I was valedictorian of my elementary school. The way my school is divided up is kids from grades 7-12 are put together. As soon as I entered high school, i started getting depressed. My parents were fighting, school was getting hard, and some things happened that caused me mental health to decline. I was also figuring out my gender and sexuality. October last year, i went to my guidance counselor and told her I wanted to kill myself. She called my mom, sent me to the hospital. The car ride there was my mom screaming at me, blaming me and my period for my suicidal feelings.
Fuck Iâ€™m sorry I canâ€™t 
I canâ€™t relive this 
Iâ€™ve been going to therapy since September. She said I have depression and PTSD caused by that day I went to the hospital. She thinks Iâ€™m bipolar too but she doesnâ€™t know. I started getting medicated a week ago. Prozac. 10mg a day. So many things are happening now and I just feel like my life is falling apart. Iâ€™m not even changing my name or age on here because I just donâ€™t care anymore. I need help. I talked to my friends about everything and they havenâ€™t helped. They keep saying theyâ€™ll be there for me and I can talk to them if I want to but when I do they repeat the same things they always say. I know I shouldnâ€™t expect them to say much, but I just donâ€™t know where else to go. 
I want to kill myself
Iâ€™m tired of fighting
Iâ€™m tired of living
Iâ€™m tired of waking up every morning
My grades have been slipping. I used to get 100s and 90s, now I get 70s and 80s. 
Iâ€™ve been turning to crime. I yearn to steal and do drugs and all that stuff for no reason.
Iâ€™ve smoked weed once, no alcohol yet, my friend is trying to get us cigarettes. I know itâ€™s bad for me. Thats kinda the point. 
I want to run away
I want to steal a car and run off a bridge
I want to get really drunk and slit my wrists
I donâ€™t know what to do 
I canâ€™t go to the hospital
I canâ€™t talk to my parents 
I canâ€™t talk to my friends
Do I have any other choice than to kill myself?
Will I ever be happy?
