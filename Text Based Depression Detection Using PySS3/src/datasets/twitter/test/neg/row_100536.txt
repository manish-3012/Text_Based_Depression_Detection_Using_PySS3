I would make a throwaway but what's the pointI've been depressed for some years now along with being diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder and even though I see a therapist and psychiatrist I still feel like they don't "truly" want to help me. If anyone cares enough to respond I'd rather be PM'd
