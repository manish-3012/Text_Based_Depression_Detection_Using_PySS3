questiondoes anyone know if trazodone is fatal when overdosed on? I'm planning on taking my moms whole prescription and a decent amount of alcohol to finally snuff it but I want to make sure it will be lethal enough. I'll probably be taking around 2500 mg to 3500 mg, depending on how many pills there are. I'm almost 100 pounds so 2500 should be enough if its lethal.
