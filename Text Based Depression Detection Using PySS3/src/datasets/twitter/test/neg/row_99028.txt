Whenâ€™s the time limit? How long do we have to live in misery before people say â€œfair enough, you triedâ€ instead of telling us to keep living for their sakeSo sick and tired of people telling me I need to try more, do more self improvement, go to more interviews, ask more girls out, work out more, talk to more people etc etc etc

No matter how much I fail, itâ€™s never â€œenoughâ€ to satisfy these people that Iâ€™m just a fucking failure, so instead itâ€™s just my fault for not trying some never ending amount of times. Iâ€™m not the guy who gets to have friends and a girlfriend and a job. Iâ€™m the guy who gets to live in misery while seeing other people get those things just by being themselves instead of trying constantly.

If theyâ€™d say to me something like â€œif youâ€™re still a virgin and unemployed by 30, then you can kill your self and I wonâ€™t complainâ€ then Iâ€™d say fair enough. But itâ€™s always just â€œkeep tryingâ€ forever and ever regardless of how retarded it is, as if itâ€™s gonna work out when Iâ€™m 50 and thirty five years behind everyone else.

These same people simply donâ€™t understand what itâ€™s like to never succeed. They know *some* failure. But they also know whatâ€™s it like to succeed and have a relationship, to know they can attract someone, to get a job, to have friends. 

They honestly canâ€™t even fathom what it feels like to have a 100% failure rate. How it eats you up inside, and it just feels worse and worse and worse each time you try, you know itâ€™s a failure before even starting, and itâ€™s always true.

They wonâ€™t ever understand because they can always remember the time they succeeded. While Iâ€™ve tried far more than they ever have and have no memories but pain and failure.

Just needed to vent
