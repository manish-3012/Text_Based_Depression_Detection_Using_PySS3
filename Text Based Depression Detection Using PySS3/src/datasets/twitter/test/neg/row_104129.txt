abusive mothersEven though Iâ€™m not living with her anymore it still doesnâ€™t get any better, Iâ€™m planning to end it but really want to admit myself. Last time I was at a hospital she told me how much she hated me, hated that I was born and told me how sheâ€™d leave me in the desert to die. Now I have plans with her the first day of October and Iâ€™m afraid if I admit myself I wonâ€™t be out by then and sheâ€™ll find out Iâ€™m in the hospital and hurt me when Iâ€™m out. There really is no point of getting help Iâ€™m going to get hurt if I do or donâ€™t do it.
