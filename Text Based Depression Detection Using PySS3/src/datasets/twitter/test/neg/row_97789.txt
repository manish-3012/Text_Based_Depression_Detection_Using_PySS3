i donâ€™t see a point anymoreeverything is going to hell and iâ€™ll never get help because my parents keep denying me any psychiatric care. iâ€™m going to rot from the inside out and once i canâ€™t bear it anymore iâ€™m going to end it all. i want to get better and live a full life but at this point that just seems so distant and i canâ€™t wait any longer.
