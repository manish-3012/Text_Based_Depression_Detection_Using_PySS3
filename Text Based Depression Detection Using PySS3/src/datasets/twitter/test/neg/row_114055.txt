Tired of it all.Tired of waking up alone, tired of spending my day alone, tired of going to bed alone.    My depression includes the "suicidal ideation," but my friends are so tired of it, nobody even responds anymore.  (I have a filtered group of people that I trust enough to tell them things like "I want to die."  They just ignore it at this point.)
I've always gotten the "there's someone out there for everyone" line, and I've always heard the little "It's just not me, Oh, DEAR GOD, NO!" at the end.)  I've heard every variation of "too good a friend" or "I'm just not ready (for you)," had a couple women suddenly turn gay upon meeting me, and now each rejection just adds to the Why The Fuck Are You Sticking Around pile.  It's been too big to ignore for years and now it's crushing me.
The loneliness only ends when *I* end, I get that now, and I get that everyone's been trying to tell me to leave.  At least, nobody's willing to step forward and give me any reason to stay.
I've asked in the past if anyone has a gun I can borrow.  Nobody will let me.  I'm convinced it's because everyone's enjoying the show too much.  Every year around this time, I keep thinking of getting one but it seems so much for something I'm only going to use once.
Anyone know where I can rent?
