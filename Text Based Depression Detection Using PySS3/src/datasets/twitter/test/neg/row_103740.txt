I'm running out of reasons to stay alive.I'm just going to preface this by saying it didn't get better. People have been telling me for years that "it gets better". It was supposed to get better when I moved. It was supposed to get better when I graduated. It was supposed to get better when I went to college. It didn't. It still hasn't. Every day just turns out worse than the last.

My family wouldn't care if I died. I have no friends. I don't have a roommate. There is no one who cares about my life, so why should I care? Really. Why should I care about my own life?
