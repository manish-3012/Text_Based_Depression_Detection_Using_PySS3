Losing hopeEvery day feels worse than the last. My body is failing me and betraying me in every way imaginable, and it's only going to get worse. It's much worse now than it was even 6 months ago.

People say, "there's hope for the future, science could find a way to fix this," and maybe they're right. But who knows when that will happen, and if that will happen. It might not be for 10, 20, 50, or 100 years. 

In the meantime every day is a constant struggle. I can barely leave the house; I can barely *be in* my house.

I constantly feel hot. My entire body sweats profusely almost constantly. I always feel moments away from sweating through my clothes; I often do sweat through my clothes almost daily. 

Why would doctors do this to me? Why didn't they warn me? Why did they lie to me constantly throughout the process? I'm in Canada! Doctors are supposed to be helpful and not try to profit off of patients! We grow up believing they're Gods and they know everything. 

They say my side-effects or symptoms aren't life-threatening so they don't really care. But what if it doesn't have to be physically life-threatening? What if you're left in a situation where you don't want to live?
