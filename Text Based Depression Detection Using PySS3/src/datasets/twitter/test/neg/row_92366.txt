Please help meI just don't have the motivation to keep going. All I want to do is just sleep all the time because my dreams are better than real life. The only time I really feel happy is when I'm smoking some green, but it's only a temporary escape. My boyfriend doesn't understand how I'm feeling and always just asks me why I'm pouting or he tells me to get out of bed and I'll feel better. I just feel so alone and scared right now. I have already failed an attempt many years ago, but I feel like I'm in the same place now. I just really want help and a friend right now to get me through the night. I'm so scared.
