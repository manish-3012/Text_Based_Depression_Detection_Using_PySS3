I need helpHey guys, I've been on this subreddit for a while and I really love helping people with their issues but recently I've just fallen into a spell of shitty depression. I'd never commit suicide or harm myself because I know how silly that is but the thoughts are constantly on my mind these days. Honestly, I just need someone to talk to and who I can vent to. Hope someone decides to humor me and chat for a while. Thanks.
