I'm so tired of everythingI don't want to do this anymore. I hate myself, I'm a loser. Nobody wants to hang out with me. The loneliness is the worst. Sometimes I feel so alone that it literally hurts. I don't deserve this, I'm not  bad person. I'm tired of being sad all day, of pretending I'm fine. People will be better without me.
