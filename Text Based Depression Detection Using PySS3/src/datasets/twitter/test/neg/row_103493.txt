Help me pleaseI'm not sure if this belongs here but, I have really bad anger issues and I have a service dog for depression whom I tell at all the time which makes me sad. If you are wondering why this is on suicide watch, I feel really bad for doing it, which makes me very suicidal out of guilt. So could you guys please tell me to deal the anger.
