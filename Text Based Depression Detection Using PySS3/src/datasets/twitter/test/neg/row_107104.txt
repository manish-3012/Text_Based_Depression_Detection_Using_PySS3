Tired.Damn, I donâ€™t like bringing things up like this but I feel like I have to. But umm.... yeah itâ€™s Thanksgiving and I have no friends or family or anything. I live alone. I just started drinking and thought damn if I died right now no one would even care. I hate saying these type of things cause the few people who do know me online find me as this always happy funny person. And damn itâ€™s stupid. I always feel like failed everyone when I have no one. Does that even make sense? But yeah this is gonna be my first and last post. If I spelled something wrong sorry!
