Toxic family makes it impossible to get betterToday I had a session with my therapist and afterward my sister called. Throughout the whole conversation all she did was remind me of the mistakes Iâ€™ve made with school and condescend to me about my job prospects and what a waste college was and about paying off loans. Iâ€™m aware of all of this, but she sees it as important to remind me constantly of how much I fucked up and how fucked I am. She also saw it necessary to call my interests in theatre a stupid waste of money, so now Iâ€™m too upset to go see a play I had been eexited about. She knows how to destroy the joy in everything.

I feel completely worthless after talking to her and I can remove her from my life or distance myself from her. If she wasnâ€™t around, my life would be so much easier. 

I already hate myself, I donâ€™t need someone reinforcing all the reasons why.
