Lost my wayFeel so lost and empty anymore, and i keep thinking about ending it just to stop feeling the negative emotions... i feel only the bad emotions, anxiety, sadness, ennui, hopelessness, haven't felt a single positive feeling since last year... i graduated from law school and felt nothing, no triumph, no happiness... passed the bar and felt nothing... now i'm unemployed and feel nothing... except for misery and the hopelessness of student debt...

Unemployed, in debt, depressed, isolated, unloved, ugly, fat, stupid, useless and a drain on my family... i try to tell myself that things could get better, that i can change all of that, but i'm losing faith in it, and it all just hurts so much... i know my viewpoint is distorted, that's what they say, but it all feels so real, and i can't seem to force myself to believe otherwise...

Worst thing is, i'm turning into the kind of person i hate, negative, paranoid, unsociable... it's pushing the few people who vaguely care about me away, and i can't live with who i'm becoming.

just don't know what to do... just saying this out loud helps though... makes it feel more like something real, and not something that's just in my head and my fault for feeling this way.  everyone says i have nothing to be sad about, but no matter how bad i feel for feeling this way, i can't seem to feel better.

What can i do?  god, i'm so unhappy... i don't have a solid plan, i don't want to make my family or anyone else find whatever's left, and i don't want to cost funeral expenses.  been enough of a drain so far.  i know it's selfish to go, but i think everyone would be better off without me.

tell me something that can help, point me back to the road... give me something to hold onto when i feel this low... please..
