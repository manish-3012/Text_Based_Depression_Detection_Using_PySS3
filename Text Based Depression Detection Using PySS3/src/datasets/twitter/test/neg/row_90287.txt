My life seems to be getting better, but I feel like shit.The title says it, really. 

I've been off and on depression for years, since middle school really. BPD has a big role in this probably. But my point is that.. well, shit's been getting better lately but still I feel shit when I get home. I'll have an amazing day, be social, make friends, but then I come home and BAM alcoholic, lonely, depressed me is back. I'll hate my life no matter how hard I try to look at the positive things.

I'm just so sick of it.
