Feeling really alone and everything in my life is suckingHi everyone. I have had a particularly rough life but the past couple of years have been very hard on me. I have thought about suicide for a long time but only the last couple of months have I considered it a real option, and it seems soothing to me. I was 14 when my dad attempted suicide, and I became numb after that. I don't want to die really, but everything is so damn hard all the time and I have never experienced a time in a life where I thought things were good. I am under stress constantly and feel very alone, without any family or friends to support me. If anyone that sees this could just read my story, I feel really alone and like no one cares about me.


I've had depression for as long as I can remember. But later in college it got particularly bad. I was drinking and doing drugs a lot. Shortly after I graduated college, I cheated on my long-term boyfriend/roommate when I got drunk and was out of town. After that happened, even though he forgave me eventually it was really awkward to stay in our house together. I decided to move back to my parents house and get my old high school job back. The first night I stayed at my parents house, we got in a fight and my dad ended up shoving me around. I said I was gonna kill myself while he held me down on the bed (not really meaning it) and he called the cops on me, who took me to the ER. My parents never came to pick me up, and after three days the doctor sent me to a mental hospital in the middle of the night that was 3 hours away. I was there for 8 days before they let me out, but it was pretty traumatizing. My boyfriend picked me up from the hospital and took me back to the house we lived together. 

Around this same time, I started losing all of my hair. I had very long thick hair and it just all started falling out. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, a chronic condition where a woman has higher levels of testosterone than she should.  I also started growing facial hair and thick hair all over my body. After the diagnosis I felt worthless and self-conscious and as I watched my hair fall out every day due to male pattern baldness I wanted to die more and more.

Shortly after I got out of the mental hospital I received a full-time position in another city so I moved out. Unfortunately since I didn't negotiate a higher pay my job doesn't really pay me a living wage to live in the town I do, it's very expensive here. I didn't know anyone to move with so I signed for an apartment by myself. The cheapest apartment here (which I live in) is still 50% of my paycheck not counting utilities, internet etc. I have spent all of my savings just to survive here, and I feel really stupid for it. 

Shortly after I moved I met a friend online who I became really close to because we shared a similar dark sense of humor and we really cared about each other. He lived 1000 miles away but we texted all day and Snapchatted. We were really good friends for about 5 months, until Valentines day. We wished each other a happy valentines day and then I didn't hear from him after 2am. I texted him for about a week and I got worried that something was wrong, he didn't want to be friends anymore, etc. I checked his sisters facebook, and it turns out that night he bought what he thought was a morphine pill but it was actually carfentanil, an elephant tranquilizer. He died that night, alone in his parents house, on valentines day. It crushed me at a time I was really going through a lot. He was one of my only friends for a while, and it hit me really hard that I could never talk to him again. 

The months that followed after that were a blur of hating my life at work, being broke, getting drunk and high, and being promiscuous. Dealing with a roach infestation at my apartment. Crying over my hair loss after showers. Shaving everywhere, constantly. Spending my remaining part of my paycheck on doctor's visits, supplements, and "cure-alls". 

After reconnecting with my boyfriend ( who lives 2 hours away) for a few months, I found out I was pregnant after I didn't get my period. As I write this, I am 7 weeks pregnant. At my boyfriend's father's birthday party, his sister revealed she was pregnant (she has a husband/career/nice house). I didn't tell them I was also pregnant because I will probably be getting an abortion. I don't want to, truly. i have always wanted to be a mom, to feel needed and loved by someone else. Unfortunately because I have no money, and my job sucks, and my mental health/ life sucks, I can't give that baby the life it deserves. I figured I'd probably have a miscarriage anyhow, considering what a piece of sh*t my body has been to me. I am not looking forward to the abortion or how I will feel afterward. I am not looking forward to my boyfriend's sister's baby being born, knowing that I had to give mine up.

Just last week I got written up at work because I went and picked up my coworker a salad for him, and I used his meal tag to pay for his meal, which I didn't know wasn't allowed. They told me because I was written up I wasn't eligible for a raise next year or a bonus, which I didn't even know existed but desperately needed. They told me if I "did it again" I'd be fired. One of my coworkers is constantly mean to me when my boss isn't around, and I often find myself in the bathroom crying because of it. Unfortunately the job is my source of health insurance and food (meal tag) and I don't have any without it. 

I live in a fancy college town where most people are below my age and have no interest in others except other 19 year olds they met in class. No one here seems poor, they all have nice clothes and everyone seems to be eating out a lot. The girls are young and beautiful and of course hairless. I know this is the case most places, but I feel completely invisible when I am walking around here. The only people that ever talk to me are homeless people. Sometimes I do talk to them because I feel very alone, and beneath everyone here. I can't afford nice clothes, my hair is thinning at an alarming rate, I have hair growing everwhere else even my butt. It makes me feel so ugly. And now I am carrying a baby that only I want, but I can't have. I feel so incredibly stupid. I don't have any friends here to talk to at all, I spend every night and weekend alone. I go out sometimes but I have a bit of social anxiety when it comes to starting conversations with others. Guys will try to flirt with me but that's not what I want.

I am currently studying for the GRE to apply to graduate school. But I'm not even sure I want to do that, especially because it's in this city. And I feel that in another two years I'd just be left in the same position I am now; I think the only reason I want to go to school is to escape my job/any full-time job. That sounds stupid. But working only to barely pay my rent has me really burnt out and makes me wish I was a student again. But that's not a good reason to go. 

Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) has been a nightmare to me, and I feel a strange psychological disposition toward being a woman. I feel like I exist biologically between a man and woman, like I can't understand being either. I can't imagine having a womanly figure or hairless arms. It makes me resent a lot of attractive feminine women even though I know it's not their fault. I just wish I could be more like them, and I feel really gross the way I am. I feel really weird and self-conscious and don't want other people to see how hairy I am. I can't even afford hair removal things so I've just been covering myself up. It makes me incredibly sad. 

I'm sorry I made such a long post and I don't think anyone will read it...I guess I just needed to say it all. I don't have any friends or family to talk to, and my boyfriend is on vacation. He's heard me say I want to/going to kill myself too many times now, seems like almost daily for the past two months, so I'm not going to bother him with that anymore. He deserves a lovely girlfriend who is happy with life and doesn't have a lot of problems like me. And i feel bad I haven't been able to be that person. Sometimes it feels like I'm not meant to be alive, it seems like nothing good ever happens to me, and I try very hard to do good things for myself. I really try to be nice to others and make them laugh, but for some reason life has been treating me really crappy with no end in sight. My 20's have been a blur of depression and hardship, and I have nothing to show for it now. I don't know, I just want to die. I am tired and sad. So very sad.
