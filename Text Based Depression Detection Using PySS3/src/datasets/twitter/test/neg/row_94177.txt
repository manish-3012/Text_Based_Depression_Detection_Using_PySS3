I was this close to being done tonightHi I go to college in rural south Georgia. Iâ€™ve failed over 5 classes just in the past year, Iâ€™ve ruined my relationships with my family and friends, Iâ€™m in an exceptional amount of debt already and I had decided for weeks that my days have come to end and finally worked up the courage to do it tonight. I went out on the balcony thatâ€™s off my bedroom to smoke one last cig and looked at the sky and saw my first shooting star.  

Just seeing that reminded me that there is beauty in the world and I want to see it. I will graduate from college eventually and I will make it out of this little town. I will make something of myself.  If I have to do it all on my own, then so be it.  

All I want is for some of you find at least a little bit of hope, even where youâ€™re not expecting it, like I did tonight.
