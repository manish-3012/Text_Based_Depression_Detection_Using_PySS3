What are these alternatives to suicide I hear about?I hear all this stuff about how people shouldn't commit suicide, they should instead do something fun! If you don't care about life, have an adventure! Go backpacking in Europe, catch a boat to the Congo and meet Kurtz! 

Okay, fine.

One problem, I'm very poor.

What kind of adventure can I have? Are there ways and means to travel as a poor person (I have like 100 dollars to my name)?

The go hitchhiking across America might not work because I'm female and not street smart at all. I don't want to end up raped and left in a ditch.

Any other suggestions?
