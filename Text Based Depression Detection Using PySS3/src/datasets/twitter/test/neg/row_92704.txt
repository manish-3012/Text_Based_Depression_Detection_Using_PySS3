Fuck me I just want to do it so badlyWhy can't this pain end. Every night it's the same thing, the same throbbing in my brain, and the same feeling of blood rushing through my wrists, can anyone else feel that? Feel the life in your veins and know that it can all end with one quick trip to the bathroom. I can't go though, there's someone I care too much about to ever do anything serious. But fuck me, I can't tell you how badly I want to.
