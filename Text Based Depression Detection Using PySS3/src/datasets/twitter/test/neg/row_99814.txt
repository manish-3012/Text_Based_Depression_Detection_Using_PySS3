[Q] Talking to people who are encouraging suicide.So I'm on Facebook, doing my once a day "whats-the-hippidy-haps" with my friends and I see a post by this girl that I barely know, lets call her Amy for the sake of writing. Amy posted on another girl's page, who I don't know in the slightest and we'll call her Heather. Heather made some post to the effect of "I should just kill myself already" and there are a bunch of people commenting about how she should go through with it, among other things that I don't understand because it's a bunch of broken, SWAG generation ghetto bullshit speak

For example:
&gt;[To Amy] , shut yo ass up fr fr lol u crack me df up. justshut up its a social network. she post somthing , bitch we comment. so what u talkin is irrelevant. now go geet you some fcckin cookies. weak fucks !! q

If anyone can decipher that let me know. Anyways, Amy is basically telling these people off for being assholes, props to her. The other people are just talking shit to her about how she should stay out of it because Amy doesn't actually know Heather, but I assume these assholes are actually acquainted with Heather in some way.

Basically, what are you recommendations for talking with these people in a rational manner? I'm developing a quick speech about how fucking childish and disgusting they are being but I've got a feeling it will just be met with something like what they already said:

&gt;[To Amy] SHUT YO WEAK PUSSY ASS UP LOL AS LONG AS SHES OKAY 'FACE ASS. HOE SHUT UP LMFAOOOO. imma dumbass but yet u daa only one fallin for the fuckery fuck ass lil gurl. bet u 15 cash haa ass will be sittin at home chillin tomdrro watchin cartoons laughin at all this attention she go. DUMBFUCK
