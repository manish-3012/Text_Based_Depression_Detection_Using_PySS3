Borderline girl's FP isn't replying and now she wants to dieYeah, I know it's a little thing. I have borderline personality disorder and there's a thing in BPD wherein a lot of the sufferers have a FP or a Favorite Person. A FP is the person you're most emotionally attached to, the one you seek attention and reassurance from the most, the one you fear abandonment from the most. Anyway, my FP isn't replying because he's probably ghosted me already. He hasn't replied in, IDK, three days. He's some online dude. I know it's dumb but it hurts so much. I want to kill myself right now. I don't care how; I just want to die RIGHT NOW in any way.
