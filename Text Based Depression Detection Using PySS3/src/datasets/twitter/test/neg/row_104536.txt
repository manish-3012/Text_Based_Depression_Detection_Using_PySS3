The hole just keeps deeper no matter how hard I trySo roughly 48 hours ago I turned 20 and as with every birthday i took a stock take of my life. So to keep this short here is what is happening:

- My Girlfriend told me she is scared of me and doesn't want to be intimate with me

- My mom is sick to the point she can't work and the medical bills just pile up and we always try keep our head afloat

- I am studying Networking and I'm failing it and consistently lying to my grandfather who is paying for it. Telling him I am doing great. I'm buying time for god knows whatT

- I'm getting fatter because I'm eating to feel happy. I feel like a blob that rolls around disappointing people.

- I haven't got my drivers license so I can't drive my mother around when she needs it because I feel to scared to drive as well as I'm so stressed about college I don't feel I have it in me.

I feel so alone. I don't have anything left in me. I just want to hang myself from the railing by our stairs. I don't want to do that note shit I just want to stop existing. Until that point I just keep dying inside everyday until I get the balls to do what needs to be done. 

Also before I get the "speak to a a friend" comment. I haven't had friends in about 5 years. I don't leave my house for months on end. I am truly and utterly alone.
