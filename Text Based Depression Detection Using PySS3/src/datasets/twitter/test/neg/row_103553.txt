I'm fed up. FUCK THISFuck this shit dude. I've had enough. Imagine being so pathetic to procrastinate your fucking suicide. For what? A person? Fuck outta here.   


I'll talk to them one last time. Whenever they hop on to check up on me will be the last time I talk to them and I'll make it the best it can be. I'll remind them that I love them a lot and I'll remind them that they're actually doing well with recovery. I'll send them all the memes I've been holding back on. All the art I'm sure they'll like. A long list of yt channels and series I'm sure they'll have a blast watching. Lots of songs I haven't yet told them about.   


I just hope they find happiness but I probably wasn't going to be around to see that happen either way.  


Once I'm done talking to them I'll be ready to finally die.
