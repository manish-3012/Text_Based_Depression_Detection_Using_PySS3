I'm Effin Tired of Being Disappointed In People, So Effin Tired of Being Sick of LifeIt's the umpteen time I'm disappointed in a girl. Again, I fell into the trap of trusting people. I hate myself again. Everything I did I did for her. She was the only thing that kept me in this life. She fucked me over and it's the worst feeling.

Anyway I'm sick and tired of my friends ditching me. I want to die. No reason to live for me. What I do anyway? Why should I love. For what for who? My life is meaningless.
