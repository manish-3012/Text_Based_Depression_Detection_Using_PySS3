I feel like Iâ€™m at my last strawIâ€™m having a gender identity crisis and I feel like this is the last straw. I donâ€™t want to get out of my bed because Iâ€™m to scared that Iâ€™ll be impulsive and that try to kill myself or something. Iâ€™m starting school in about a week and as stupid as it sounds, I donâ€™t want to live if Iâ€™m going to be forced to do that much work. If I donâ€™t kill myself now, then I will probably just plan or attempt suicide next summer, because thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happened for the last 2 or 3 years. It sounds really tempting to drink 10 bottles of water, knock myself out with melatonin and hope that I die of water intoxication. Iâ€™m not saying that I will, but that sounds pretty good right about now.
