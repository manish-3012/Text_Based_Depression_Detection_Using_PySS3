Just not sure where to turn any more.My life has just been getting shittier and shittier. I always thought suicide would never be an option but it seems like I'm constantly thinking about it lately. I'm pretty sure statistics say people who have a parent who committed suicide have their chances of doing it increased.  Never thought that would ever pertain to me. Everyone I love leaves and if that's not bad enough I tried checking myself into the hospital and was told I'd have to attempt to kill myself to be admitted. Nice to know I'm not the only one who doesn't give a shit if I'm alive or not.
