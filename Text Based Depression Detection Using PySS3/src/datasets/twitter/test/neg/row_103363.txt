I just want the pain to stop, please.I'm thinking of ending "it" later night, because I don't want it to hurt anymore. It's been like this for the past 2 months, and I don't want to live life with my under achieving self. I have no real talents that could be used in real life. I don't have musical talents, I don't do much crap at all. I'm useless and of no actual use in the real world.
