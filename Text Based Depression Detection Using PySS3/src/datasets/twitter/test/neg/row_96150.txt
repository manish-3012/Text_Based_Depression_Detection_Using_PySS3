I don't know what to doReddit, I'm severely depressed and constantly feel like shit. I'm getting bad grades in school and both of my parents dislike America. My parents want to move back to India because my dad is struggling with his job. He's doing it, but he's spending a lot of hours on it. My parents came here so that me and my sister have a good education. However I'm getting bad grades. But I like it here because for the first time, I've found people that I can truly connect with. People that have a similar sense of humor, people that have the same interests as me. And in the six years that I spent living India before, I never found any true friends and not even any of my family wanted to talk to me much. I don't know what to do. I wish I could stop existing. Please give me advice, you guys are the only ones I can talk to.
