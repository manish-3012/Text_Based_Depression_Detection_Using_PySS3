I asked for a sign last week not to kill myself.I never got it. 

I tried to feel better for another week but Iâ€™m back to the same place I was before. I shouldâ€™ve listened when I didnâ€™t get my sign and killed myself right away. Itâ€™s what the universe is trying to tell me at this point. Iâ€™m too afraid I guess. Iâ€™m afraid of what happens next.

No sign is a sign though. A sign that no one is listening and the pain doesnâ€™t get easier. Nothing good is coming to me, no miracle, no whatever. 

When I didnâ€™t get a sign that I shouldnâ€™t kill myself I got a sign that I should.
