I could have been beautifulI have low functioning autism and it has destroyed my face.  I look like a man due to the severity of my autism.  I heard of a suicide of a 19 year old girl with high functioning autism and she looked like a model.  Tiny nose, big eyebrows, chiselled jaw, thick platinum blonde hair, flawless bronze skin, and no facial fat whatsoever.

I used to think that all autistic people had deformities up until now.  I also remembered some of the higher functioning girls and women I have seen.  One was 6' with the face of an Instagram model, another was maybe 5'9" with no facial fat.  Both were very muscular.  Meanwhile I'm 5'5" at the most with no muscle tone.  I also have facial fat at 21.  I have a round moon face with several chins.

I know low functioning autism is an explanation for my subhuman face and body but I'd rather not have autism because then I wouldn't get upset that I could have been beautiful if my disability was of a different severity and functioning level.  Also at least if I was neurotypical I'd be capable of feeling empathy.

I hate my giant nose, apple shaped body, height so short I am not classed as human, tiny lips, and the fact that I have no eyebrows or eyelashes.  I just have a couple of blonde hairs (the hair on my head is almost black) where my eyebrows should have grown and a few short hairs where my eyelashes should be.  Once I starved myself down to 9 stone but I had the face of someone who weighs 30 stone.  I'm now over 30 stone but have the face of someone much fatter.  And to make it worse I still have acne and it's worse than ever.  It's all over my body.  The hair on my scalp is also very very thin but my leg hair, arm hair, armpit hair, facial fuzz and moustache are thicker than ever.

I cannot live knowing I am visibly disabled.  I must kill myself.
