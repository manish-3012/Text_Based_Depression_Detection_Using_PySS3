My stomach issues are killing meI got diarrhea again.

This upsets me. From the ages of 16-19, I had issues with frequent diarrhea. I never got it checked out for 3 years. I didnâ€™t actually attend highschool so it was easy to lock myself in my room and manage it. I was too afraid of getting help because I was afraid of getting judged for my weight issues. At 19 I got gallstones. I had to deal with my weight and having to see doctors judge me and some blaming me for my problem put me throw living hell. You simply canâ€™t understand the pain I went through. The constant agony of hating myself endlessly and plotting to kill myself at all times was beyond any type of pain a normal human can understand. I no longer blame myself and think that was due to a misunderstandong, but it still bothered me for over a year after the surgery and I frequently wanted to hang myself over it. 

I had my surgery and that solved my stomach issues for a while. After about 6 months they came back with varying intensity.

I think for the past month Iâ€™ve had diarrhea. Iâ€™m sad about it. One because of the pain of holding it so tightly and running to the bathroom 7-8 a day. Another because it would prevent me from doing various things I want to do with my life, including even getting a job. 

No one understands how I canâ€™t fix my diet or work out. No one understands that without a car job or money I canâ€™t buy food from a store like a normal fucking person. No one understands I have to eat what my family serves in general. No one understands I canâ€™t just run everyday and cover myself in sweat in humid weather everyday because I only have 3 shirts and two pants. Everyone hates me for it. Iâ€™ve been trying to limit my portions recently and Iâ€™ll try going to the doctor after doing that for a month. Iâ€™m trying to lose weight and a month from now Iâ€™ll try seeing my doctor again. But I think they wonâ€™t care. Life is so painful and hopeless.
