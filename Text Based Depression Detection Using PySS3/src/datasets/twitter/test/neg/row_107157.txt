I've never thought it would come to this.I can't force myself to do anything regarding my situation in high school. I don't want to disappoint my family but I can't do anything to save myself. They don't understand, I don't understand either. I'm so scared. I'm running out of options, there is no future for me. Some people are just destined to fail.
