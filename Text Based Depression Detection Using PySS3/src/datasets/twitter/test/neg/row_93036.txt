What do I even do anymore.I have a horrible Gpa of 2 something. I can't get therapy even though I've tried to ask for it. My parents refuse to let me seek help and I've been depressed for so long. They want to kick me out next year when I turn 18 in the middle of my senior year with no job and I don't have any money to live? Like??? I don't know what to even do. My depression has gotten so bad that I've developed a bad Anxiety and negative mindset that I've started to harm myself, burn Myself as punishment. I've punched Myself as punishment for being sad and for eating. I feel fat, I've gained weight and I feel fat and DISGUSTING for eating. I. I just. I can't?? I think about killing Myself all the time, when I'm with friends in their car I think about jumping out. I think about killing Myself when we're all laughing and smiling and having fun. I think about killing Myself but the guilt I have because I know they'll be sad. I know that I'll be missed and that they'll try to figure out what was wrong. They would blame themselves and want me back, they're the kindest people I know. I want to cherish Everything and give them everything, they're good people. I feel like I treat them horribly and I don't deserve anything, I feel like I can't go to college with my grades and gpa, I can't do anything. I can't. I don't know where to look and where to go? I just wnst to die and end Everything but this guilt is holding me back. My parents will miss me but they won't let me GET help when I've been vocal about it. The gas lighting and telling me I'm crazy and need to be locked up makes me feel so worthless oh my fucking god??? This is so funny. I can't. I really don't know what to do anymore, please. Please what do I evend o.
