If anyone is feeling down and needs a friend, please message me ( if you are living in the Netherlands we can also hang out sometime)I just stumbled upon this subreddit and would like to do everything I can to help anyone in this situation. (We can go see a movie play some pool or just hang out and have some fun. ) Even if you're not living in the Netherlands and need someone to talk to, please message me. We can just talk a bit and maybe laugh a bit, just whatever I can do to make you feel better. I just want you guys to understand how many ignorant people live in this world that might not even understand how much damage they are doing. And that most of these idiots are hurting you only because they are insecure about themselves and you are probably a threat to them. And I'd rather you guys be angry at them for what they're doing to you then sad for yourself. (What sometimes helps me when I'm down is to scream at these people inside my head and actually feel the anger. I know that this may seem a bit strange but venting out the anger, even just inside yourself, can really sometimes help you go to the second stage of understanding that we are just all a bunch of ignorant humans who want to be loved.)
