My dreams are too distantI have no friends, I never have. I'm not charismatic, I'm not funny, I can barely hold a conversation. I've been alone for so long. I'm emotionally exhausted from constant mental breakdowns. I'm already numb at this point and my anxiety medication just numb me even more. I might as well be dead, it'd be no different. I just want friends, a bright future, to travel the world, a loving partner. Yet I can't have any of that, all because of who I am as a person. I try my best to be nice towards others but I'm just not good enough for anyone. 

I'm almost 20 now, I have no education, no job, no friends. My life is over before it even started, I hate myself so incredibly much.
