I'm alone, depressed, and suicidal. I'm just a failure.I'm alone. My best friend whom I usually talk to about this is grounded with no form of communication for two weeks. I lost a huge love of mine who I told everything to, she broke my heart. My family treats me like I'm incompetent and just a fuck-up in all that I do. But whenever I try to stand up to them (very rarely) I get screamed at. I am so alone right now. I have no one. I can't bring myself to tell my sister about my 2 year old depression. I usually listen to music, and it helps, but now it just further ensures me that I should end my life.
If anyone even responds, thank you.
