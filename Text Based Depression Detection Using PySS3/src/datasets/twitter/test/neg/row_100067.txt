DefeatedI've been undergoing therapy and taking antidepressants for a while now. Everytime I feel like I'm getting slightly better I always end up feeling overwhelmed and unable to function properly... I wish I could stop the dark thoughts, and I wish I could stop feeling this way before my sister gets married. I love her so much and I don't want to ruin her special day. I can't do this to her.

If only I didn't exist at all, the pain is unbearable.
