Ready to go but scared of failureI'm 48 and I know it is over for me. I make tons of money with little effort but it depresses me even more. The state stands to seriously benefit when I go. No one else is going to get it. What good are numbers on a website? Even 7 of them?  I cry everytime I look at it.

I never had a real life, never married, no kids, and at this point the chance of that are zero. Even if I live I will rot alone as I get older. I am in perfect health but it is only going to go down hill.

Now I am just invisible. I tried self improvement but it did nothing. All working out and eating well did was give me a skinny body with a bit of muscle. I'm still invisible to women and have no friends.  A part of me dies when I see couples holding hands.

&amp;#x200B;

No one give a flying fuck about me.

My only fear is making the situation worse. I wish I knew of a surefire way to die without any suffering or repercussions. I am human detritus.
