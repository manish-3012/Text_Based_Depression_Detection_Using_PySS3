I have 2 options, Kill myself or get help (increse time before I kill myself)I can either die today, or I can get help. (Too scared to do btw) If I tell my parents theyll be like "ugh this again?" And I dont want that to happen. Its midterm week for me, and I didnt and dont plan on studying for anything. Im just laying down in the comfort of my dark room on my bed. I have no motivation to do anything, and im on the verge of crying. Ive always felt a sense of impending doom and the doom feels closer than ever. My mental state had been deteriorating since I was 13 (Im 16 now), its at the worst its ever been and its still getting worse. Im really useless, have no motivation, direction, or passion. I dont want to do this anymore. My grades have been the worst that they ever have been. I dont give a fuck about changing them or my future. I have no hope. I didnt choose to be born. Dont attempt at convinving me to rebuild. I dont have any energy left. I dont give a fuck anymore either.
