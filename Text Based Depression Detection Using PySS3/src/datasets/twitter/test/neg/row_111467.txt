Tired of being the good guyI'm always the one who is there for people when they need help. I would bend over backwards to help people close to me and even some that I'm not close too. But when I need help nobody is around, nobody will come to help me. Nobody really cares about me and I'm tired of going through life alone. Even my girlfriend who always said she will be there for me is pushing away and I'm worried she will leave me soon. I'm just tired of trying to be happy.
