My final fuckupI've been dealing with depression for over a decade, I've done so many stupid things in all those years that still make me regret today that I haven't had the courage to take my own life yet. I've been nothing but a thorn in the sides of the people around me, leeching off of my parents still as a fully grown adult because I have no idea how on earth I'm supposed to function properly in our society... I feel guilty constantly because of how much I rely financially on others when I should have been working for a decade already but I can't do it, I'm not good enough, not strong enough mentally or physically for even "low skill" jobs. I've ruined my physical and mental health by neglecting issues I've been dealing with since middle school, I've been in therapy for a year now and nothing has changed, except that I now feel even worse because of how much it's costing my parents. I need to stop wasting other peoples time and money, and after my last fuckup which has pushed my parents about ~600 EUR in red right before the holiday season is the final straw. 

I'm currently writing up an ad to sell my computer which should get me enough money to fix that and get them through till next month, and after I've sold it I'm done. I can't take another month of dealing with myself, I've had enough of it. I will never be okay, never will succeed in being a functional member of society, I've accepted that ages ago so I don't know why on earth I'm still here. 

I've spent many nights researching suicide methods, their failure rates and consequences when surviving and how much they'll make you suffer etc. It's a thing I've used to stop myself from doing it for so long, literally scaring myself into not trying at all, but luckily there's some methods that don't seem too bad and have a pretty good chance of working the first time around that I discovered more recently... I've got it all planned out, I won't do it at home neither and call the police before I do it so they're the ones to find me and not my parents. I'm a POS but not that big of a POS.

Idk honestly why I'm even writing this... I've taken enough of my alprazolam subscription to sleep for a couple of hours through my manic episodes but my mind isn't really able to relax rn I suppose, maybe I need another 10 minutes or so for it all to kick in... meanwhile I just need to vent and ramble about my shortcomings but talking to the same people over and over feels pointless because I just keep getting the usual "it'll be fine dw" bullshit... ugh I wish there was just a switch I could flip to turn off my mind and sleep forever. I'll probably not even read the replies so don't bother I guess... just hope you guys are doing better than me and get the help you all deserve. Take care.
