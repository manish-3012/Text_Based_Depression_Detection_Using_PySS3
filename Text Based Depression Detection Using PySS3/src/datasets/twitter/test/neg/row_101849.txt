It takes everything I have just to hold offI cant let myself hope anymore, I cant let myself feel anymore, I feel surrounded by pain and bullshit all around and its all dragging me down hard and making me worse and making people deal with things they shouldnt have to deal with.

Im sick of everything and Im tired of letting myself hope
