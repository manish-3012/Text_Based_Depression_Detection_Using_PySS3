[22] F - I hate my life and I hate myselfI haven't felt triggered in a while but I was today. I am unhappy to my core. Therapists and medicine doesn't seem to work. The suicidal thoughts always seem to come back. They've been here since I was 15. I wish I had the courage to actually go through with killing myself. I held the knife to my wrist but couldn't push it down far enough. Just left barely an indent. I feel angry at myself for not following through. Why can't I just put myself out of my misery already? I tried saying it's the depression talking and getting my mind off of it but the truth of the matter is I don't want to live anymore. I don't like my life and don't have hope to change it or even the willpower. I don't even want to try to change it. I just want to end it. But I'm too much of a coward to.
