Give me a reason to go on.What's the point? I am a 15 year old morbidly obese anti-social prick with no life. I lie to the point where I don't even know who I am anymore. I have the worst parents on Earth. I have a horrible diet. People constantly bully me. I am sure I will commit suicide (most likely accidentally, I'm too much of a pussy to do it myself) and die a virgin. Please, don't give me any sentimental bullshit. I'm a piece of shit, and that's final. I will most likely be dead very soon. Why am I even posting? No one will care. No one. Not one single person will care to type one fucking thing so that envelope will glow. I'm pathetic. I've tried to get help so many times and the same thing happened each time: they laugh, and ignore me. I'm not sure when, it could be now or sometime later this year, I am slitting my wrists and strangling myself with a belt. I don't care what the fuck happens after I die, and I'm not leaving a note. By the way, this isn't some sort of joke.
