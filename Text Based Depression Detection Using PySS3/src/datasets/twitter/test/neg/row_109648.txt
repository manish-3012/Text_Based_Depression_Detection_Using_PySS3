I'm going to do itI amÂ a 18Â year old male virgin who has never had a girlfriend. I just think about what could be going on in my life. I have like 20 contacts in my phone and 90% of these contacts I have completely forgot about. I have social anxiety and all I do is listen to joy division and the smiths all the time. I'll occasionally watch a movie or tv show. Pretty everything I do is isolating. ItÂ has recently become harder to enjoy anything including isolating activities. I live a small town in the south with nothing going on. This makes it harder when I am avegetarian, agnostic, and don't do any alcohol or drugs. I am seeing a therapist and been to a mental hospital twice in the past month. I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE!!!
