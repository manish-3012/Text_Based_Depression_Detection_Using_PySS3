Been diagnosed with PTSD, been in treatment for months with no improvement.Without going into all the details, a series of traumatic events took place over the past few years at college (high brother attacked and tried to kill me, someone committed suicide in our backyard, several deaths in the family, sister was molested, watched a man OD). Despite all this, I was still able to keep it together, just barely, until the day before my final semester at college my dad snapped for no reason, choked me, and repeated punched me in the face.  He ended up breaking his hand.


That sent me over, and I have been in treatment now since February.  They have tried around ~25 different meds for anti-anxiety, sleep, and depression, but so far I have had bad reactions to all of them: either ineffectual or produce terrible side-effects.  I have landed in the hospital twice this semester because of allergic reactions.


I'm honestly not sure what to do anymore.  I am desperate for something to change soon.  My mind is shot and I've exhausted all my energy and optimism.  I almost tried killing myself about 2 weeks ago now (was on Lexapro, which exacerbated the thoughts, currently off it) but the thoughts keep coming back stronger and stronger each day.


Aside from the meds, I have tried hypnotherapy, meeting with a psychologist regularly, exercising, going out with friends, etc. but nothing works anymore.  Please, please, please - if anyone could shoot some advice my way, it would be deeply appreciated.


Thank you.
