please just kill me nowi donâ€™t want to live anymore. iâ€™m so tired of being manipulated by people and lied to. nothing ever goes my way. i feel so helpless and lost and i just canâ€™t keep forcing myself to be happy when iâ€™m miserable inside.

i lost everyone i have no one left. i am so broken and numb inside. i keep cutting my legs just so i can feel some pain. i feel selfish for wanting to die but i just canâ€™t take it anymore. my whole chest hurts, my brain hurts, my eyes hurt from crying iâ€™m just a fucking mess

i want to just fall asleep and disappear, i want it to be painless. i donâ€™t deserve to feel this way. i work hard, i try my best, iâ€™m a good person. why does everyone intentionally try to hurt me??? i donâ€™t deserve this. whatever i did, i never deserved this. i just want to die and have this over with
