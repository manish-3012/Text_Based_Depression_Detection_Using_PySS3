Struggling to hold on...Hello everyone.. 

I'm really having a hard time trying to hold on... I feel like I have nothing left to live for.. and I have lost everything and everyone that I have cared about... everyday is a struggle. I just feel like I don't have any will left in me to live....I'm really trying to hang in there... but I don't know if I can do this anymore..  

My presence wouldn't be missed by anyone if I left... I have no one in my life... 

I just want this pain to end... 

I'm tired of waking up everyday feeling this way...

I don't really know what to do at this point.....

What do you do if you have no reason or will to live anymore..?

Can anyone give me reasons to keep going...?

I apologize for talking this way... but I just honestly need some advice....
