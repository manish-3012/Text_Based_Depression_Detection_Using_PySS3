What can my therapist do if she (falsely) believes me to be suicidal?After a few years away from therapy I've decided to seek help again because I definitely need it. I am not suicidal, or at least, I would never go through with it, but I worry that talking about my feelings on the subject might make a new therapist believe I am a danger to myself. I have been put into inpatient facilities against my will twice in the past (5-6 years ago) and really, really do not want to experience that again. So worst case scenario, new doc decides I'm liable to kill myself; what power does she have over me? I am an adult in my mid 20s, in Texas, if that matters.
