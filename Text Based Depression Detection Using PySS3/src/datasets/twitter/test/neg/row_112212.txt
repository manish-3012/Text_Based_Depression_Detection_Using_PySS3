Iâ€™m alive out of guiltAnd fear, I guess. But mainly guilt. My parents are the best people in the world and I donâ€™t deserve them. Theyâ€™re constantly trying to support me and comfort me and cheer me on in every aspect of my life. They compliment me, hug me, bring me places, give me money if I need it. I really do love them both more than anything. I donâ€™t deserve their love.

Since I feel so safe with them, I take everything out on them. Itâ€™s usually just minor snarky comments and eye-rolls that I make when Iâ€™m feeling irritable, despite them having done nothing wrong. But sometimes itâ€™s full-on yelling. Donâ€™t get me wrong - theyâ€™re not saints - they yell at me out of nowhere too, but I feel like thatâ€™s more justified since they have authority. I donâ€™t know. I always try to apologise to them afterwards but apologising doesnâ€™t undo anything. I often wonder if they ever regret having me. I wonder if they wish theyâ€™d skipped right to my brother instead. 

If I killed myself, Iâ€™d be ruining their lives. Fucking up one last thing that echoes forever. But then again, they wouldnâ€™t have to deal with me anymore. 

I also feel guilty for being suicidal when I have such a good life.
