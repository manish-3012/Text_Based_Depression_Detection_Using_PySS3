I'm so tired.I just want to sleep. It's been this way for years - like having a phone that won't charge above 12%. It's not just chores or schoolwork - it's EVERYTHING. Playing with my dog, talking to friends, anything and everything drains me dry. I thought it was depression but then everything else that came with that got better except for this. I'm exhausted and I don't know how to make it better - it's physical and mental and there's no doctors who've been able to figure it out. I don't know what's wrong with me that I don't have energy for everything. 

I'm not actively suicidal but I haven't been completely non-suicidal for years - the thought keeps creeping up like a bad joke that I can't seem to get rid of. I don't like myself very much and I think my family and friends would be better off if I wasn't around. I can't really remember any places or times where I've actually made places or groups better by being there. They'd miss me for a while and it'd break their hearts, but I think it'd be better for them in the long run because the pain and irritation and anger I cause them wouldn't be a thing. 

I don't know what my future looks like. I have a couple of jobs I think I'd like, but I know I'm probably working off of idealized versions of those careers and that I couldn't hack it in the field if I were really there. I'm just so sensitive and fragile. I imagine happiness as a cabin in a forest, an apple orchard maybe, where I brew hard cider, write short stories, and keep quail and raise rescue dogs. I have a badass, gorgeous wife who loves me and would kill for me, and I'm at peace. I'm not tired anymore.

I know I'll never find that cabin. I don't think it exists.

Everyone says I'm talented and kind and a brilliant writer but I feel like my talents are wasted on a person like me. My life in general is wasted on a person like me. My mom's close friend's daughter died of cancer recently at 20, and I would have traded her life for mine in a heartbeat to save her family that grief. There's a lot of opportunities in front of me and I don't take them because I'm too exhausted, afraid, or ashamed. I'm happy sometimes but it doesn't seem like it's worth the rest.

I want to want to live, but I'm not certain how. Death scares me but, god, what else is there?
