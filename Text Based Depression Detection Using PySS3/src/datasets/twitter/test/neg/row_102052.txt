To understand the living you gotta commune with the deadTonight Iâ€™m going to attempt talking to the spirit that wonâ€™t leave me alone. Itâ€™s been following me and affecting me for so long, I donâ€™t know what it wants. Iâ€™m not afraid of it and I donâ€™t care what happens to me anymore. If a professional canâ€™t remove it from me, I might as well try to see wtf it wants. The night terrors, the depression, the anger and suicide attempts. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™ll try anything at this point.
