Iâ€™m going to see my favorite band at the end of August, after that I think Iâ€™m done.My favorite band (Slipknot) is coming to my hometown on August 23rd and Iâ€™m fortunate enough to have the opportunity to see them with a friend. Once that day passes however, Iâ€™ll really have nothing left to live for or look forward to. I was going to wait till Halloween was over because itâ€™s my favorite holiday, but even that doesnâ€™t seem worth it anymore. Iâ€™ve been struggling with Major Depressive Disorder and suicidal thoughts for almost 6 years now and itâ€™s never been at itâ€™s worse than it has been recently. I make no money from my job, I have 1 good friend but no others, I donâ€™t go to school because Iâ€™m too dumb, and the girl I like is going away to college and doesnâ€™t want to be in a relationship because she thinks school would get in the way. I figured seeing my favorite band perform one last time would be a perfect memory to go out on. Anyways Iâ€™m sorry if this was a long read but thank you if you stopped to read it, it means a lot.
