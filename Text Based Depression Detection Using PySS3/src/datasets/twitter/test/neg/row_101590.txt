Tired of repeated failureI have been watching porn for about 6 years now. In the last year it got kuch worse. I feel like I have been truly an addict. I have ben trying to end that damn thing but I got no results. 

I tried fighting it alone, telling a friend, having an accountability partner, making myaelf busy as hell but no matter what I do I get back to that horrible habit.
I feel these days that I am in a prison and can't get out of it. I can't tell amubody about it.

I thought of commiting suicide but I think also that I'm even afraid pf doing it

Sorry for bothering you guys but I really don't have anywhere else to ask help from.
