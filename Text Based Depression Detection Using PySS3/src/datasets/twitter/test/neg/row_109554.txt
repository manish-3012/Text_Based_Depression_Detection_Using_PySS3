I Didn't Want Any of ThisI got out of an emotionally abusive relationship with my mother in the middle of last year. I'm now flying solo at 30 which admittedly sounds pathetic, but it's amazing the power zone people can have over us. Anyway I almost miss that part of my life. I was miserable, but at least it was consistent misery. Now everything is so up in the air. I can't seem to keep my apartment clean. There's never enough money to pay everyone and everything. When I actually can sleep it's usually preceeded but my just sitting on the edge of my shitty twin bed crying. I maintain a decent facade for work and my few friends, but it's hard to do. I don't find anything really fun anymore and every time I try to think of the future I break down more because I only see the same twin bed, empty, dirty apartment and dead end job. My latest semester of classes starts tomorrow and I already feel like it's only going to make things worse. Like I'm treading endless water and the only way out is to stop paddling.
