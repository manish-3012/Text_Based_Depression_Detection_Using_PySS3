I don't want to be alone with myself on Valentine's DayI just went through a bad breakup with a nice girl.

I want to see friends this weekend to take my mind off of it, but they all have Valentine's plans.

My estranged best friend/crush has a boyfriend now, so there goes my last single friend I could hang with. And yeah, I'm happy for her, even though it hurts to see her with someone else.

Everyone is going to go out and do romantic shit on Sunday, while I sit at home missing my ex and knowing that she's probably not happy either.

I've struggled with depression before. I feel like I'm winding a jack in the box, waiting for my suicidal thoughts to pop back up on Sunday.

I may just stay up all night Saturday and try to sleep through V Day.
