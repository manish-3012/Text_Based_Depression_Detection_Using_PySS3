Thinking of ending itItâ€™s currently 12:44 AM as of writing this, Iâ€™ve been depressed on and off lately but Iâ€™m getting major urges of ending it. Iâ€™ve just turned 18 and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m gonna make it in life. Iâ€™m too afraid to tell my mom because i donâ€™t want her to worry and I donâ€™t want to go back to another hospital. I just need someone, anyone to talk to, even one person is enough. I hope someone sees this....
