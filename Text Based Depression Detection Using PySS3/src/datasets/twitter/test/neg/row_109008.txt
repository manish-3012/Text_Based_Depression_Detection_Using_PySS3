I tried my best and I thought things were going to be different but I fucked it up, I'm done tryingI've been depressed my entire life. When I turned 20 I was an angry, emotionally undeveloped ball of self-hate. I'd lash out at anyone who was close to me when I was upset. I hurt a lot of people, myself included. I thought about killing myself everyday, and I attempted to do so twice. 

After my last attempt I met someone who inspired me and made my life so much better. I worked on myself, I improved mentally so much and I was so proud. I learned how to communicate with my emotions. I made the decision to make my life better. I made plans for the future for the first time in my life and actually looked forward to them. I was going to have a house with a garden and kids, I was going to be with the person I loved. My career would get better and I'd have a job where I mattered. I believed all of these things. I wanted them all because this one perfect (in my eyes) person loved me.

Today's my birthday, my SO hasn't messaged me a single time and I'm sure at this point they turned off their phone after I tried calling them. The last messages they sent me were perfectly normal but it's clear I've done something and they hate me. My job is pointless and no one would notice if I never came back. I hate the town where I live, but I'm too chickenshit to move because I know I'd fail by myself in a larger city. I hate myself. I must be worth hating because the person I love thinks I'm worth throwing away without a single word. 

My life is never going to happen, I used to 'joke' when I was a kid "I'm not going to make it to 30 because I'll have killed myself by then". It turns out I was right. 

I had a trip booked for christmas, I'm considering rebooking it to leave asap and quitting my job. To everyone I know it'll just look like I disappeared and they won't know how much of a fuckup I am.
