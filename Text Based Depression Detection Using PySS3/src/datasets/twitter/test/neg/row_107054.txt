Iâ€™m scared to try again and fail. Again.I know I already posted about this before. 4 years ago I failed at my suicide attempt and since then, I havenâ€™t tried again in fear of failing again.  

Except when I tried, I was newly married and so ready to go. Now I have two babies, Iâ€™m still married to the same man, and I still want to die.  

But I canâ€™t bring myself to come up with a plan. I want to die and not exist anymore so bad, but I canâ€™t let my babies grow up without a mom.  

I want to be the mom I wish I had growing up. They deserve the best, theyâ€™re so great. But this life sucks so much and I am so hopeless. Iâ€™m not good at anything, not even parenting since my husband does 99% of the job.  

Actually my husband does everything around the house, Iâ€™m just a lazy piece of shit whoâ€™s just sad all the time about anything. I donâ€™t bring happiness to anyone, I donâ€™t bring anything to anyone, I never have. I donâ€™t even know what my purpose is on this planet. I just want to be gone withiut hurting my family.
