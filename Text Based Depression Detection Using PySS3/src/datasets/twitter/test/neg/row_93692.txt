No Friends and extreme loneliness lead to suicidal thoughtsOk, so I'm 18 years old college freshman and I have suicidal thoughts every day now, very often. Ok I don't have any friends in college. I am not interested in the whole party scene and the only clubs that actually have any people in them are either academic clubs or religious clubs. I go back and forth with religion but I don't know if I can handle the type of ppl in those clubs. And I can't really make friends in class cause it would disrupt the lecture and you usually sit next to a different person every day cause the classes are so big and I'm naturally reserved person.

But i and many ppl usually think of suicidal people as pill poppers, you know long hair skinny, mentally ill kids that still live with their moms and they do drugs and they have bad relationships. But this can happen to anyone I guess it's happening to me even tho I've never done any drugs or even drank alcohol before. Also I exercise every day, I try to eat healthy, I meditate, I don't play video games and read sometimes I try to build good habits and healthy lifestyle but nothing replaces friends and social interaction which I have none of. 

But after my classes and after the gym all I can do is lay in my dorm and do nothing. Sometimes I stay outside where all the ppl are walking but nobody will ever start a conversation with me and when I try to start conversations they usually last for like 10 seconds. Yes I've thought about suicide because I realize nobody would care or even notice I was gone. My mom would be devastated, and my brother and dad would be sad but I never see those people anyways. 

Where should I go from here? I'm definitely not telling my mom, she would think I'm mentally ill and I can assure you I'm definitely not. I also don't feel like telling a school counselor, I just want to talk to someone normal. Also I think it's hard for 18 yr olds to buy firearms and that's my preferred method. I can drink a huge load of laundry detergent or something like that but nah. 

I understand suicidal thoughts and actually taking action are 2 separate things but every day it gets just a little bit closer to the taking action part as I realize nobody cares
