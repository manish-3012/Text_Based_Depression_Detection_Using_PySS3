A Decade of DepressionThis is my first reddit post, and itâ€™s almost depressing in itself that itâ€™s in this subreddit. Iâ€™m a 27-year-old female who was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety in my teens. Iâ€™ve been having suicidal ideation since I was about 15.  Around that same age, I started seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. In high school, I was psychiatrically hospitalized three times. Iâ€™ve had over 7 years of therapy. Iâ€™ve analyzed every part of my personality and my childhood at length. Iâ€™ve tried nearly every type of psychotropic medication there is. Iâ€™ve had psychiatric genetic testing done that confirmed that I am highly resistant to anti-depressants and at a higher risk of weight gain as a side effect of these medications (during my most recent severe major depressive episode, I gained 80 pounds in a year while on meds and have still been unable to lose the weight). Iâ€™ve had blood testing that showed my serotonin to be extremely deficient (my levels at the time being 26 ng/mL whereas the National Institutes of health state an average range is 101 to 283 ng/mL). Iâ€™ve undergone unilateral electroconvulsive therapy (â€œshockâ€ therapy). 

I have the most loving and supportive fiancÃ© who Iâ€™ve been with for nearly 9 years and a wonderful 10 year-old soon to be step-daughter who Iâ€™ve helped raise since she was a baby. And yet, I canâ€™t seem to escape this pervasive depression and the dark thoughts that accompany it. It ebbs and flows, but it always creeps back in. When I was younger, I hoped that the way I felt was just a temporary response to the awfulness of the teenage experience and the chaos of my home life. Most people assumed it was a state that Iâ€™d outgrow, and when I came off of my medication in my early 20s after 6 years of taking them, I convinced myself that I had grown out of it, as well. I lost 50 pounds, and was in the best shape of my life thus far (a nice change of pace after the weight gain from my anti-depressants in my teens which resulted in teasing and awfulness at school). I was still anxious, but I was functioning better. 

In high school, I transitioned from advanced classes to barely graduating with my class. While all of my friends went on to college, I stayed home and tried to fix my head. It took me years to feel somewhat normal. Around 22, I started taking classes part-time at my local community college. By 24, I had been recruited by the Honors Program with a 3.97 gpa, I was selected as a student representative for a college board, I was elected to student council, I was selected to speak at Honors conferences along the east coast, I was a peer mentor, I was president of a club, I received a full scholarship, and I was applying to Columbia University to study psychology. The semester that I was supposed to graduate with Honors, I had fallen apart mentally and had to leave school because I was so depressed and anxious and suicidal that I couldnâ€™t function or sleep or concentrate. I was so ashamed and felt like (or should I say feel like) such a failure. 

This was the second time that my depression had completely uprooted my life. I had come to view the first depressive episode as an isolated incident, a period of adversity over which I had triumphed and was now stronger for having experienced. But when it happened again, that changed the narrative that I had created for myself. Twice was a pattern. It could happen again and again. The second Iâ€™m finally starting to feel better and getting my life back in order, it could creep back in and destroy everything all over again. I spent the next year hardly leaving my bed. I took pill after pill and nothing helped. I was even put on a drug cocktail that included lithium by the end and so I had to get regular blood work to check for toxicity. That fall, I started ECT and that helped more than anything ever has, but itâ€™s also an exhausting process and short-term memory loss is a side effect around the time of treatment. 

That was all about two years ago. I havenâ€™t felt the same since. It feels like what I imagine being in remission from cancer feels like after being so sick. Every time I even feel the inklings of a normal negative human emotion, I feel like itâ€™s back. Iâ€™m always on edge, waiting for it to sneak up on me and drag me back down. It feels like my normal mood state is just lower to begin with. Iâ€™m always hovering above depression. In my mind, the analogy most fitting has always been that it feels as though Iâ€™m perpetually treading water, struggling to keep my head from going under. It doesnâ€™t take much to start drowning. I feel like I have all of this potential but Iâ€™m stuck with a brain that doesnâ€™t work right and I donâ€™t know how to reconcile that. Iâ€™ve been feeling down again lately and I still havenâ€™t even fully recovered from my last depressive episode. My suicidal ideation creeps in almost as if theyâ€™re intrusive thoughts. Upsettingly graphic images of my death flash in my mind on a daily basis lately. I try to imagine my fiancÃ© or his daughter finding my body strewn on the floor or in the bathtub, and the guilt stops me from doing anything to myself. But it feels like itâ€™s getting more difficult to ignore the thoughts lately. I can hardly sleep. I canâ€™t help but think that my brain is unfixable and I canâ€™t fathom a lifetime of feeling like this. Even if it subsides for a while, the fear of it returning is utterly paralyzing. Iâ€™m at a loss. I donâ€™t expect many people to read this, and I know thereâ€™s nothing anyone can say to make me feel better at this point, but I guess thereâ€™s just something comforting about writing this all down. To everyone else out there who is feeling pain, Iâ€™m sorry for you.
