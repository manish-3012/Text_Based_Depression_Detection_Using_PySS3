If Harry Potter spells existed, would you use "obliviate" on your loved ones memories of you, and disappear somewhere instead of dying?For those who don't know, obliviate is a forgetfulness charm in the Harry Potter universe. You can erase particular memories from yourself or someone else. Perhaps you would use it on yourself and erase your own trauma to try and live happily? Or use it on someone else and die anyway, as they won't mourn the death of a stranger? I'm curious.
