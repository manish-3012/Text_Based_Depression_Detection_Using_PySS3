I think im ready to end thisI dont have a date but i got what i need to die... im thinking maybe friday or saturday... As long as things go right I wont be coming back... and im just more nervous about it than anything else. I don't fear death but there will be things and people I will regret leaving behind, but you can't have regret when you're dead lol so i guess it doesn't matter. Its funny how even when we are certain of something how we sometimes want to reach out... i guess what im saying is good luck everyone... and goodbye
