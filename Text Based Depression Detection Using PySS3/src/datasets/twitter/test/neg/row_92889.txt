I feel ready to goI know this is permanent, but I donâ€™t care. Itâ€™s not like those bullies care anyway. All they do is make fun of me for being nerdy, and playing bass instead of guitar, or doing karate instead of basketball or football. Iâ€™m not attractive.....at all. I wear glasses, fairly skinny, always wearing converse or vans. I try and keep a positive attitude, and try and make people happy but it doesnâ€™t work. 

Furthermore, people keep telling me Iâ€™m gay and I donâ€™t deserve a girlfriend, which Iâ€™m actually as straight as humanly possible and had...HAD...a girlfriend who was a cheerleader at my high school. That was lucky for me, but we split after I got too depressed and even she couldnâ€™t help, I hope the people who bullied me are happy whenever I go.
