Feeling downMy psychologist told me that if I keep being this day, I'll probably end up alone.

She also told me that I can't change others, but only myself.

Deep down I know she's right but... I can't stop feeling that I wasted half a decade.

I know how much things I missed, and how many people I let down, and I always keep repeating my mistakes again and again, no matter how much help I get...

I feel like I'm very close of snapping...
