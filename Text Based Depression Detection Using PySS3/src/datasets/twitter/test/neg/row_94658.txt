My friend made me cry last nightI hope I'm posting in the right place. Anyway, one of my best friends told me she was going to commit suicide last night. She didn't thankfully but I'm still shocked about how serious she was.

Another friend and I were texting with her and I ended up writing her a small heartfelt message. It was her response that got me tearing up.

She told me that she was thankful for the message and really appreciative of me and our other friend for always being there for her. It was really genuine. She said she really loved us and thanked me again before saying she was just going to sleep it off. I woke up this morning to her saying she was still here.

I cried last night because I seriously couldn't imagine a world without her. I was hurt. We've all got our issues but these two people are my best friends. We're still just 18 year old kids. Seeing one of them that low had really started to break me down.

I don't know what else to say really. I'd like to think that what I said actually got through to her in the end and made her reconsider. I don't want to experience anything like that again. Also I'm sorry for the long post. I just feel I have to get this off my chest. Thanks.
