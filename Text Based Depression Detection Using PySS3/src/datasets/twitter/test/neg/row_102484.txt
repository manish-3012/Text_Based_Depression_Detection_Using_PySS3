Disappointment and lonelinessFor years now this has been the story of my life. Suicide has been part of my daily routine for a majority of my life. Three months ago I was placed in the emergency room by my mother and held there for two days. They diagnosed me with bipolar disorder I. These past three months Iâ€™ve talked with therapists, doctors, and loved ones. Iâ€™ve also been prescribed medications that have shown improvement. Thereâ€™s just one thing...

The thought hasnâ€™t gone away..

Iâ€™ve had a very nice life. Great parents, great friends, good in school, athlete, etc. Iâ€™ve never had a reason for any of these thoughts or so I thought. Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion itâ€™s all within my own head. 

Disappointment- The feeling of dissatisfaction that follows the failure of expectations or hopes to manifest
Iâ€™ve always had such high expectations for myself as I believed I could do so much. My biggest goal was always to help others so they never had the feelings I had and as Iâ€™ve gotten older Iâ€™ve no longer been able to do that. Iâ€™ve added on to peopleâ€™s lives and itâ€™s the most disappointing thing Iâ€™ve ever done. I just feel as if Iâ€™ve failed everyone whose been close to me and mainly myself. I canâ€™t go day in and day out with this feeling weighing on me at all times. 

Loneliness- Feeling sad and unhappy about being socially isolated.
This is the toughest to dissect because itâ€™s something I shouldnâ€™t feel. Iâ€™ve been blessed with amazing friends and family. I just always tell myself that they donâ€™t love me. Iâ€™ve grown to be a loner over the past couple years and cancel plans with everyone or Iâ€™m shy and or irritated when Iâ€™m around them. 
Have you ever been at a family party during Christmas or a 4th of July party with your closest friends and felt like you were locked in a dark closet by yourself? Itâ€™s the most miserable feeling. 

Thereâ€™s many more factors but these two have been the most consistent in my life. Iâ€™ve tried taking my life 5 years ago by suffocating myself. I knew it wouldnâ€™t work but it was a test to myself. I walked away alive with two feelings. 1. Feeling grateful I was alive and it didnâ€™t happen. 2. Disappointed it didnâ€™t happen but hopeful because it showed I could do it if I wanted. 

Lately my life has been falling apart and Iâ€™m thinking about putting an end to it. Iâ€™m willing to take the risk of pills.
