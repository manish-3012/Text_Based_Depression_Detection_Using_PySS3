Scared, lost, disoriented, aloneLiving a horrifically unstable, unsustainable lifestyle and don't know what to deal. Have been struggling with Bipolar 1/Bipolar depression, severe alcoholism, and gender dysphoria for years. Mid-20s, utterly alone in a major American city. No friends. Unemployed, officially. Been doing sex work (I'm AFAB trans and pre-testosterone, so the sex work is worse because it's crucial that I act like a woman) in order to pay for cheap rooms to stay in, one week at a time. Had almost six months clean and sober, but relapsed earlier this month and my tolerance has gotten higher and higher - my habits and not having a permanent residence make it impossible for me to save money for an apartment. I've been cut off from my family for years, and isolated myself from my social circle months ago. I have no support, and no hope.

I don't know where to turn. I don't know what to do. Ever since I was a 13-14, I pictured an early death for myself: didn't think I'd live to graduate high school, or turn 21, or ever get out of my small hometown. Have never had long-term plans because my life has always been a cycle of chaos, mental illness, substance problems, and poverty. Don't know how I'm even still alive, but I don't want to be anymore. There's a draw, almost like a physical pull towards death for me; it's like it's lurking just around the corner waiting for me to finally accept it.

Sorry to be so self-centered, and probably melodramatic. I just feel like my time is coming to an end very, very soon. I had a very real plan, but confessed to my therapist and ended up being put in the psych ward against my will - and not for the first time.

Don't think I can take this life much longer. Maybe there will be more peace in the next life - but can I count on coming back if I kill myself? I've been told suicide is the route straight to Hell or bad reincarnation, point blank. I guess spirituality is literally the only thing keeping me here (and I apologize -- I know this may be tough to relate to bc Reddit is heavily atheist/agnostic). I fear the consequences of offing myself, but am desperate for the release of it, and the freedom from my own insanity.

Sorry for the wall of text. Thank you to anyone who has read this far (which was probably not anyone - I know I wouldn't bother with myself). It just feels good to get this off my chest, even on just some random anonymous internet account &amp; screaming into the abyss.

Hopefully soon, I'll OD and not wake up. Thank you.
