Trying to kill myself (again) tomorrowThe title says it all. I just can\`t bring myself to write a wall of text knowing people won't read. I should have know that dying by overdosing is hard. So i will jump in front of a train tomorrow around 7:00 A.M and i hope it works because i'm seriously fucking tired, and do you know what is the worst from this whole situation? I've been telling **certain** people since last week i'm going to attempt suicide and they don't give a shit, it's just astounishing the lack of empathy of the human being.
