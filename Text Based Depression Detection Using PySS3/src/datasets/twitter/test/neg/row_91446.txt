I am ready.I'm done. I've had enough. I'm starting to get my legal affairs in order. I'm giving the things that have meaning to me away to the few people I care about. I've started letters to my children. I don't think I will be coming back from the edge this time. I've enjoyed the memes and the meta. Excellent distractions. Also, I met someone great on here. I hope he can forgive me for wasting his time when I knew all along I would be ending mine.
