I don't see a reason to be happy.My life has been going out of control ever since I started middle school, I started feeling worse and worse about myself and I don't know what to do, I feel like my life is a mess and that I want to die, but that woluld upset my parents so I never actually act on my impulse, and I feel like everyone hates mle and that no one even cares about me. Please give me some advice.
