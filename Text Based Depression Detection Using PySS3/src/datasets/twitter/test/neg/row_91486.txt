I just want to go homeBut it doesn't exist anymore. My happy home where we loved each other and communicated and trusted each other. My home where we laughed and talked and touched. My home where addiction didn't exist and he didn't hide from me. Where we didn't blame each other. Where we worked on our problems. I just want to be there again and I can never be there again. It's not real. It may never have been real.
