There is no hope, and Iâ€™m just ready to be done with it all.Long story short, my 13 yo daughter has suffered from suicidal ideation for three years, I have tried to do everything and anything to help her (sheâ€™s been in therapy for as long), and to protect her, and to be a good mom to her (by always listening and being open and talking to her, amongst loads of other ways Iâ€™ve tried to be a good mom and do the right things by my children), but I reckon Iâ€™ve been shit because Iâ€™ve just found some very disturbing things that sheâ€™s into (sheâ€™s a writer and writes fan fiction that is straight up sex smut). I also reckon Iâ€™m shit because I want to kill myself because *there is no hope*.

Iâ€™ve suffered from suicidal ideation since I was about her age, too, but my father died when I was 11, so, I was quickly dxâ€™d, but not helped very much. The only thing that kept me alive was 1) not knowing what happens after death 2) my mom finding my dead body (or having to identity it). I have 3 children and for the past few years, my suicidal thoughts have disappeared (FINALLY), but now theyâ€™re back because... I just have no hope. I also recently found out thatâ€™s sheâ€™s been hearing voices, and idk how to deal or cope with any of these things and FUCK! I have no hope. The last two years have been absolute SHIT. Not with her, but with a myriad of things and now theyâ€™re just getting worse and I donâ€™t think I can live not being able to help her. Iâ€™m a shit fucking mom. Why the FUCK was I allowed to have children??? They deserve so much better. I hate myself. I hate that Iâ€™m this fucking weak. I hate that I canâ€™t figure out what to do to help her. I just want to help her and I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m useless. Sheâ€™s seeing a psychiatrist next week, before you ask. They wouldnâ€™t see her this week because I sent her out of state to be with my mom thinking it might help her to get a change of scenery. Who am I kidding? I thought itâ€™d help her to get away from me. Iâ€™d rather die than this. Iâ€™d rather die than ruin her life.
