Not really suicidal, but...I'm 29 nine years old and have been battling with mental issues since the age of 16ish.

The last 4 of years or so have been without any major problems, but the last half year have been a nightmare.

I have bills up over my head, I have no joy in my life, my medicine isn't working, I can't get out of bed and I'm seriously considering just calling it a day.

Life shouldn't be this hard. I honestly can't remember what it feels like to be happy or have joy. The closest I get is eating junk food. Instant gratification but no fulfillment.
