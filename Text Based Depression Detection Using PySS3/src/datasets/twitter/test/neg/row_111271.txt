At a LossI am a good person. I am smart. 

I wish things could have gone differently. I wish that people would love and protect me. That just doesn't happen. I feel overwhelmed. I wish someone would pick me up and take me far away from here.

There are very few things left for me to do that would make my life worth living.

I am making a detailed plan to do it, but I have to be careful because I have student loans. I have to make sure that it doesn't hurt my mother.
