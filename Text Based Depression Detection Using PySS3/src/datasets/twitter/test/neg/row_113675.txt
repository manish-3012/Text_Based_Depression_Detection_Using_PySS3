I canâ€™t do this anymoreMy sister was murdered last year, my dog also might have been killed. I made $700 a month at two jobs that treat me like shit even though I have two bachelors. I canâ€™t find other jobs

My husband, mom, family, therapist keep telling me I â€œshouldnâ€™t be depressedâ€ I keep telling them Iâ€™m not well and they wonâ€™t listen. I havenâ€™t heard from my best friend in weeks, she doesnâ€™t talk much but I messaged her saying I need to talk and she left me on read. 

I was just hospitalized for a kidney infection. Iâ€™m always being hospitalized for something stupid or another. My boss is firing me because I keep getting hospitalized. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m sick, but Iâ€™ve been to several doctors who said they werenâ€™t sure either. My psych took me off anxiety meds because I was throwing up, I begged for them because I canâ€™t handle my anxiety but she â€œwants to wait until Iâ€™m betterâ€ before she gives me Lexapro or something. Iâ€™m not going to get better, Iâ€™ve been vomiting for months and having seizures, I donâ€™t know why and no doc has figured it out sans throwing seizure and nausea meds at me, 

Iâ€™m so tired of fighting, Iâ€™m so tired of trying to make everything okay when I can barely hold it together. I have no income, no car, no job and no life. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m even typing on here. Iâ€™ve seen 8 doctors in the past week, I am so tired of them saying â€œyou must be feeling badâ€ YES IM FEELING BAD I WANT TO DIE. 

I wonâ€™t be able to stay employed and I donâ€™t qualify for disability (had a hearing) honestly there is no point to my existence anymore. Iâ€™m in pain all the time, Iâ€™m so angry and anxious all the time. Why shouldnâ€™t I just take all my pills and sleep forever? 

Iâ€™m sorry I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting Iâ€™m just venting to the world I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m writing
