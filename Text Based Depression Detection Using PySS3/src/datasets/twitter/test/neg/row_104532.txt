I was supposed to commit todayI was gonna do it but the girls in my class invited me to go hang and it was actually fun. We never hang out as one group bc each of us is part of a different click so it is u expected and super odd they invited me. BUT THINGS KEEp GETTING IN THE WAY OF ME DOING IT AND IT IS SO FRUSTRATING!! And idk if I wanna do it tomorrow because since I didnâ€™t do it today, it means I have to do everything I was supposed to do tomorrow like make a huge decision. And I kind of want to go to a party this weekend so I can get drunk and forget all my pain. But that also means Iâ€™d have to stay alive for longer and sleepover the hostâ€™s house bc Iâ€™d be drunk, and that Isnâ€™t a good idea because I will have to keep a sweater on the entire time, while I get hot from dancing and then sleeping. Killing yourself Is so difficult already because there arenâ€™t that many options and few actually end up being successful, plus trying to get this timing right is hard. Plus, I keep pretending to be happy and am trying to be extra buddy buddy with people so they know when I do it, it wasnâ€™t their fault and they couldnâ€™t have done anything to help me
