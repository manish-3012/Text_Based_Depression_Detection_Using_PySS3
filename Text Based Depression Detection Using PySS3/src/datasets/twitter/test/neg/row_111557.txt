I believe I might just end it allI honestly have nothing to live for I have health anxiety to the max, my cat just died, and Iâ€™m worried about if my performance at work today was bad and Iâ€™ll be fired. My family buried my cat without me because I was at work. I feel so left out and I feel like nothing is going well in life for me. I just want to die, but at times I donâ€™t. Everything just goes wrong. I have PCOS so I might not have kids. I have temper issues. I have hair on my face due to PCOS. I gained weight. Who the fuck would want me? I realized things are a two way street,and you get what you give but Iâ€™ve given and been walked all over so many times. The death of my cat really triggered me and I honestly am so burned out
