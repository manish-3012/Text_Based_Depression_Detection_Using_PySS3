Recently got the courage.I planned to bus it out somewhere far and end it. I wouldn't tell anyone, just one day i'd leave and do it. The one thing that bothers me is that there seems to be no way to keep it private. I wouldn't want my name to end up somewhere and I wouldn't want my family looking up death certificates. The only thing I'd want is my privacy. And I don't believe I'll get that. I don't have to care, but it is something that bothers me.
