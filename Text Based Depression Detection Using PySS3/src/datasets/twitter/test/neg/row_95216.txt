The end of the day...Do y'all ever feel that massive weight just press really hard at the end of the day?

Like you did really good and had a productive day and nothing bad even happened, but despite it all you can't suppress that urge to just do it?

That's where I am right now. It's bizarre, even things that should make me happy or "love life" or whatever just drag me further down. Like today, my boss's cute little son remembered my name after only having met me once. I don't deserve that shit. No one should look up to me, I'm fucking dirt. 

It's days like today that you feel like you've been on a weird high that lasted all day, distracting you. But then the sun goes down and reality crashes back in.

Fuck, man.
