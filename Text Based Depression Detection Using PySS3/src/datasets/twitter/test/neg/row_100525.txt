Barely afloatI feel like everything is falling apart, everything is on fire etc..
im 22 and have no social friends, everyone else has friends and I dont, everyone else has gotten laid except for me, everyone else has had relationships, not me.

I feel like im just a burning trainwreck, as for methods of suicide, I think ill either shoot myself or hang myself, something reliable. My necks been bothering me anyway, might as well break it.

im barely hangin in there, its litterally a day by day fight, my grades are starting to fall, I just want to stay inside my dorm and sleep, just sleep away all the pain
