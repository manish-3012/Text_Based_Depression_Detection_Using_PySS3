I'm so lost and I don't know what to do anymore.I've been depressed and suicidal for a while but I've always been able to hold myself together to an extent, right now though I have no clue what to do, Im in college getting a degree I don't want and it's too late to change it, I've got a great job that I've more or less quit, they told me I'm welcome back whenever I want because its specialty work, on the outside I have that "perfect" life and that mask is starting to fall apart too, I've made a lot of mistakes and hurt a lot of people and I hate myself every single day for it, I've nearly killed myself 3 times but at the last minute I chickened out and I just hated myself more. I am just so lost. I always thought I would get through all this shit at some point but I don't know. There was a point where I was making progress but that failed and It's a struggle just to get out of bed in the morning and a struggle to fall asleep at night, I just lay there and cry. I was talking with another person on here awhile back and I'm pretty sure they committed suicide and that just makes me feel even worse and being a volunteer firefighter/medical responder doesn't help either it just takes pieces out of me, and the mask I wear around my colleagues there is falling apart too and late last year one of them passed away and everything just builds on top of each little or big thing that happens and I just cant take it anymore.
