I feel bad for being born1. First off, i rlly tried my best to format this right by looking at the rules and other posts. So if i did it wrong im sorry ill fix it 

So basically my problem is that I feel extreme guilt over the fact that I was born because by me being born, I made my mom go through childbirth and childbirth is very traumatic. She has never once said anything about this, she talks about childbirth like it was a positive experience, ect. So it isnt my mom being abusive or anything. I feel like i don't deserve to live because i made someone go through trauma. 

But i havent ever seen anyone else with this problem. I feel very guilty and im trying to find out how to make it up. I feel like i dont deserve to be alive. What should i do?
