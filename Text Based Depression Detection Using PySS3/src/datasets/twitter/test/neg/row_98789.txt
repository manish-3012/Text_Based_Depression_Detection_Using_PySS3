How is suicide selfish?So here's my thing; I've been thinking about blowing my brains out for the past year or so and been too lazy/weak to actually pull it off. Why do people say this? My family and "friends" might give a shit for a couple weeks, but I know for a fact that they'll move on and be ok after the initial grief spell. So why do people say this so much? Isn't their desire to see me alive selfish in and of itself? I'm not trying to be edgy or whatever, I just legitimately don't understand. 

I actively try and hide the fact that I want to kill myself, so I really don't care about attention or any of the other shit people threaten suicide for. I have friends, I have a good relationship with my family, and the ones I've told have helped me out more than I could ever ask for. However, things don't work out the way I ever want them to and I always end up in the same spot like I am now, drunk and alone on a Sunday afternoon. 

Anyway, why is suicide selfish? It seems to me like the best thing I can do for myself at this point in my life, and I don't understand why everyone tells me they'll miss me and it's a bad idea blah blah fucking blah. The only thing I ever get out of that is "don't kill yourself or I'm going to feel really bad about it." I know you're just a bunch of strangers on the internet and I highly doubt anyone is going to read this, but I'm tired of just existing. I don't feel happy doing anything, work is just a waste of time, and it doesn't seem like I can connect with anyone I haven't already. I just don't get it. I know this is just a rambling mess of bullshit but I'm at the point where I figure I'll reach out to a bunch of strangers on the internet. 

tl;dr I didn't use the search function but I want to know why people make the argument that suicide is selfish and not a legitimate course of action
