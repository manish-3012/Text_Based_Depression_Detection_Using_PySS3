I wanna help my friendI'm not sure if she's suicidal, but she's declining in school work and I know about how she feels toward her family.

Just yesterday when we were supposed to have a little swimming party with friends when her mom suddenly banned her from going. She(my friend) told us that her mom allowed her to go the day before, but she(her mom) was surprised to see her dressed up and ready to go on the day of the party and consequently didn't allow her to come.

She managed to slip by her mom and asked her older brother to come with her and meet with us but when we saw her she was really, really sad and cried. She made an excuse to see us but wasn't coming with us. Good thing her brother was a nice guy and he promise to let her catch up with us later. She did come and we were both happy and all but still, I'm concerned about her. 

When we tell each other stories she often says things like her mom doesn't believe in her, they often get into fights, etc. I'd like to talk to her more but since it's our Xmas vacation I can't go to her place(we often go to her's after school), plus she can't go online very often, and she doesn't have her own number(she broke her SIM out of anger yesterday). I live near her place but I'm afraid that her family might think that I'm invading their space or something. So please, what can I do to communicate with her.
