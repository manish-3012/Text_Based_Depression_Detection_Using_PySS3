The story of my lifeI'm from a small Texas town I was born into a abusive house hold my earliest memories are of my parents fighting all the time my father was a good man at times but he had two sides to him and the good side rarely showed he was a schizophrenic bipolar ex-marine who would beat my mother and me and my sisters I never felt like a normal kid even as a kindergartener I remember feeling different from every other kid I dint have many friends in elementary or middle school but middle school is where my life starts to get fun it was my 8th grade year my parents marriage was going really downhill they were only together this long for us kids but they were talking about a divorce which devastated my father we had gone to a hotel during winter break for a day but ended up coming back to the house than fast forward about a week there was a huge fight we were at the movies and things got out of control we ended up leaving  the  movie my father had been doing some things to my sisters very wrong things at the time I wasn't sure if it was true but it was finding out later on this was the night my life flipped upside down we went back to the house they were arguing and my mom was going to take the kids with her I still Remember my father standing at the top of the stairs with his arms opening for a hug but I ignored him and walked past him without looking back at him I wish I would've know later that night my mom had us driving all over the back roads to keep us safe he had the guns with him we drove till it was safe to go home around 2 in the morning I fell asleep and when I woke up I was told of what had happened he drove to the lake and shot himself I still remember the half empty coke bottle on top of his car he looked like he was sleeping months went by and our household was falling  apart my mother she was a drinker after a couple months she abandoned us and went to start a new life now alone I found out I had no home I was been sent too live with my cousin because I was unwanted my freshman year was spent there my cousin was the typical jar head I appreciate what he did for me but he was very strict than comes my mistake I had some stuff at school and ended up with a charge  thrown in jail at 15 then later sent to a alternative school ran by the police department my life that I new was over I had everything stripped from me I mean everything my family school I was in a new town I dint know even my dog was taken away from me by my cousin after that year was over and I somehow managed to survive it is was sent back home and that's where my life starts to return to normal I'm 18 now and doing better somewhat I still get depressed and feel low at times but I grit my teeth and push through it, i still wish I would have hugged him if only I knew it would have been the last time I saw him
