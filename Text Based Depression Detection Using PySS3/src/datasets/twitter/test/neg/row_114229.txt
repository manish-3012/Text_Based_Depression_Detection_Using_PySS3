Might get a revolverSo think I got a good idea, gonna get a revolver. Every morning I will play a game of russian roulette and that will determine if I will stick around for another day. Perhaps if I make it a few days in a row it might spark something in me, like maybe I should stay on this planet. If I "lose" well.... Guess it was suppose to be.
