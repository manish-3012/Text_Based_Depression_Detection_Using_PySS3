Today I tried to die.I have been listening to this song for the last I don't know how long. It's Daniel again, by the way. 
[Cartel - Wasted](http://www.listenonrepeat.com/watch/?v=d-PGNFRGw9U)

Basically I'm thinking of every possible way to die because this is bullshit I'm so sick of feeling like this and there's literally no point to life. Like I just don't give a fuck anymore. Nothing is going right for me. I have no friends. I have no family that loves me. I have nothing. I'm broke, got kicked out the other day, living on the streets, seventeen. 

I guess this will be the last post I make.
Thanks for the times reddit, though they weren't all very good.
