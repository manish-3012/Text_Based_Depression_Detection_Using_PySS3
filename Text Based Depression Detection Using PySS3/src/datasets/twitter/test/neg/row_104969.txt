Thereâ€™s no point to anything. Iâ€™m going to blow my savings and end it.I canâ€™t figure out a job to save my life. The one chance I had just fucking rejected me today. Iâ€™ve been unemployed for months. I donâ€™t want to go back to call centers as they sucked the soul out of my life and then fired me, but itâ€™s all I have experience in. 

I have no degree, I donâ€™t want to go to school, donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™d do if I did. I have no friends, Iâ€™m so lonely, I have no experience, no drive, no opportunities, nothing. And thereâ€™s no point anyway. 

Iâ€™m fighting for what? To survive one more day closer to the end of my life? Iâ€™ve got about 1.8k saved and rents coming due on the 1st. I think Iâ€™ll just spend about a grand, fly somewhere nice like Japan, Iâ€™ve always wanted to go. See some sights. And use up my money. And when itâ€™s gone, just jump off a building or in front of a train. 

Itâ€™s better than spending a few months here wasting away and having it dwindle away until Iâ€™m kicked out and homeless again and just wanting to die, still.
