I'm worried I'll kill myself sometime in the next two weeksI've been pretty depressed for about a year. I'm 17 and I'm at the cottage w my family right now. I have only been here two days but it's becoming so fucking unbearable I thought getting a change of scenery would make me feel better but I'm so much fucking worse. I don't know if it's that I haven't smoked weed in a couple days or being away from home but I feel so fucking suicidal and depressed. I'm going home tomorrow morning but my family is staying another two weeks. I don't have any friends and I'm kinda worried I won't be able to handle two weeks of solitude and I'll kill my self at the same time I'll go fucking crazy if I stay here. I don't know what to do I'm so sad and so tired I want it to be over so fuckinf bad
