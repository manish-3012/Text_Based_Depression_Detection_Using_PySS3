It needs to stopI'm 15 and a total wreck. 

I've been pretty bad at everything I do lately. Everything I do ends up failing or losing out to someone else. Grades, school, faith, everything. I've just been playing video games in my dark corner and I can't seem to win at those, either. I don't have any professions to turn to for income, and I have no special skills. 
My friends all stopped talking to me. I feel like my life fucking sucks. Should I just end it all?
