i'm too nervous to tell this to my psychiatristhello, i'm a 17 year old male and i've been diagnosed with ADHD, Depression, and GAD. ive been taking lexapro for a couple months now and while i think it was making a difference at first, i'm now realizing that i've been having suicidal thoughts for some time now. i'm always apathetic and i sometimes feel the urge to open up my window and jump out (i sleep on the second floor of my house). i know i should tell my psychiatrist about this but i'm really too nervous. i know telling him is the right thing to do but i can never muster up the courage and i end up not saying anything. 
i feel like if i don't tell him soon i might start acting on what my brain is telling me to do and that thought scares me. 

i know that my fear of telling him is completely irrational but my anxiety will not let me tell him. 
ive always had trouble telling therapists about how i feel because i'm afraid of getting close to people/ people judging me. i really need help with this and how to tell him. 

thank you so much in advance
