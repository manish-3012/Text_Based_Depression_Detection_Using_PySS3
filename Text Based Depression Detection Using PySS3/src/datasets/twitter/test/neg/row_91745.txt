Itâ€™s not worth fightingLife is not worth living. Itâ€™s not worth fighting for a better life where you donâ€™t hate yourself. Iâ€™m inpatient and Iâ€™m tired and so fucking over it. I havenâ€™t even turned 20 yet and Iâ€™m so god damn tired of this life. Whatâ€™s it all worth in the end? What am I even doing this for?
