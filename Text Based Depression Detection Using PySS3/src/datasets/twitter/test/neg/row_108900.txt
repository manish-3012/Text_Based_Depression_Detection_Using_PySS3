ignoring quarantine for my mental healthfor the past months i was extremely depressive and i never had so much anxiety, i was trying to ignore those problems by playing games 24/7 but i reached a moment that it doesnt worked anymore and i was suicidal,
my familly organized some social events in this quarantine, but i wasnt in any of them, they organised one this week and i was thinking, why not? i was missing those moments a lot and i think that this could help my mental health, a little bit of social interaction would help a lot, so i went, and it really worked, i was feelling much better after this, so i went into a meeting with some friends irl cuz i miss them, but a certain friend said that what i was doing is wrong af and i should stay in doors until the pandemy ends, and i was being selfish trying to care about my problems but potencially prejudicing others, is he right?
