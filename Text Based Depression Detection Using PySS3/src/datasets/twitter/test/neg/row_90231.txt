Does anyone else get cold when they're distressed?I'm having one of those moments where I just cry, read about suiceid and am generally panicking. I realized that whenever that happens I feel extremely cold even tho I'm sweating. I have heating on, a thick sweater, a blanket, but I'm shaking and feel really cold. just wondering if anyone else can relate
