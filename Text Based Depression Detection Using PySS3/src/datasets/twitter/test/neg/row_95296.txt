Was just fired today, negotiated two weeks to live with myself.Today I was fired from the job I thought would be my career. I have had suicidal thoughts/depression before. I have a plan, and have successfully distanced myself emotionally from the idea of leaving my loved ones behind before. 

I almost drove to a gun store right then and there, but I stopped myself on the driveway. I decided I will give myself 2 weeks to look for a job. If I can't find one, it will be *very* hard to stop myself then.

I plan to write a will, buy a gun, max out my credit card with a cash withdrawal, withdraw all of my cash in my checking account, leave all my money to my fiance, drive out into the desert and kill myself.

I don't want to die. I want everything to work out, but if it doesn't, i'm not sure that I'll be able to stop myself.

If there's anyone out there who has gone through a similar situation; anyone who has rebounded after being fired, it'll give me hope to keep moving forward.


Please don't give me generic advice such as, "things will work out," or "you have too much to live for." If I can't find a job, then niether of those statements are true.

Thank you.
