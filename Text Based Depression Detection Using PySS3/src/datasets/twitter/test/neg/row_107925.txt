I won't go back to forever alone &gt;:[ I wont &lt;:( I am going sunday to pack the last of my stuff from my and my ex girlfriends/fiances place. I am going to try one last time to get back together. If it doesn't work. I am just going to stand in front of the train or step out in front of thr bus right after I leave.  

I won't go back to alone I can't, I won't. I have been alone and fought off killing myself for so long. I won't go back to that suffering.

We lived together for 2 years and I don't know if you have lived with someone but, it is an incredible emotional bond, and now all there is is a fucking void. I see my sisters too who are all married and have kids and I think about the kids WE talked about having and the future we talked about. Thse thoughts haunt me, and eat at me everyday.

 *random thought:Whoever said it is better to love and lost than never love at all is a fucking twat. * 

To top it off I am year older now Im almost 23, almost half my life is over. My grandfathers only lived to be 50's, my dad who is in his 50's is probably dying of cancer (wont know until biopsy) So FUCK!!!!!!

I still dream about her almost every night, and then I wake up and look at the foreign white ceiling, with white walls and feel like I am in a prison. Not the home we were renting, not cozy, no animals no space. It is a nightmare, I find myself yelling help inside my head in hopes that someone psychic will come help me. 

Thank you all for listening I just wanted someone to know my plan, a couple of my friends know I am going to try sunday but they don't know my back up plan. The ironic thing is that I used to hang here and help people through things because I had been there. blind leading the blind haha. I am actually looking forward to something now :D either way I will get release from this suffering.
