Thinking about deathIâ€™m feeling like Iâ€™d genuinely like to die. We donâ€™t really think that itâ€™s okay for people to feel that way. 

Itâ€™s not very profitable for people to actually die. But being mentally ill is a highly profitable condition. Therapists, hospitalizations, medications, the additional physical ailments that accompany mental illness like diabetes and heart disease. 

I tried to take my life last year and when it didnâ€™t work, the psychiatrist asked if I was glad. I told him a resounding and angry, â€œNo.â€ 

I understand that there are a few people I would really negatively impact by making this decision. So I feel like maybe over time, when those people move on to bigger and better things, I might have the go ahead. 

Because I feel as though it is inevitable that soon I will be so entirely alone, that my disappearance will not matter. It might be a bit burdensome. Like my parents will have to chip away at my student loans. Theyâ€™ll have to pretend like I never existed to everyone else. But we are estranged. Their anxieties will be soothed in the finality of my end. 

I always wanted to be this loud force for positive change, an idealist. But the world is just too fucking cruel. Being alive and feeling my pain and the pain of others is just too much. I feel too deeply and I think too deeply. Critical thinking and feeling are not welcome in this world. They mean resistance and difficulty. Not that I want things to be a breeze but I am not welcome in this world. I have known this for a very long time. People who arenâ€™t neurotypical, who arenâ€™t following the stream, know this. 

Their circumstances dictate their response. Maybe they become a positive role model, an ideal messenger for change. Like look at me, I made it out, and so can you! As though there is something to make it out of. The only thing Iâ€™m seeing a way out from is the human condition and that doesnâ€™t mean being alive. 

Like look at me, I have been in the trenches, and I have battled Lucifer himself, and you can too. 
But who is this person to say that THEY understand all of the worldâ€™s suffering. It is impossible. You canâ€™t know every possible form of human suffering and still think, suicide isnâ€™t the answer. Who are you to tell someone that? 

There are people who are quiet about their pain. Silent, in fact. All around us. And I feel it. It is so loud. I never knew silence could be so goddamn loud. 

I never knew I could feel simultaneously tapped into the suffering of the masses and so extremely isolated. What a paradox to live in.

Iâ€™m not here for you to tell me, â€œyou arenâ€™t alone.â€ I know damn well that Iâ€™m not alone. Itâ€™s all the more depressing. I donâ€™t want other people to suffer. It hurts me more than my own pain. To learn more and more about how fucked up things are. The burning planet, the dystopia we live in. The human condition is a disease to this planet. But we egocentric fucks forget the planet is far more resilient and expansive than we. As though we are capable of destroying matter. We are destroying our own livelihood. 

Iâ€™m going to go search for something to numb this pain now. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.
