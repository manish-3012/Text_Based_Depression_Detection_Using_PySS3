I woke up to a bitter storm...Let them eat poison like it Tastes like lemonade

The sadder story ever told (bitter year)

Is feeling safe in or suburban home 

Like soldiers of an endless home 

And ever church have a liquor store

If only churches had a liquor store to drown sorrows in. 

If only poison was easy to drink. 

I'm tired of being stuck at home felling sad.
