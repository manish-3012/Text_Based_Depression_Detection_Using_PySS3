I think Iâ€™m gonna end things soonIâ€™m failing all my classes and Iâ€™m trying hard to 
get the back up 


I literally have no will to live anymore and no one seems to care 


My mom is literally going insane and is always trying to fight with me because I donâ€™t believe in qanon 


I asked for therapy and never got it 


Iâ€™ve done nothing with my life since March


My grandpa and uncle passed away this year and I couldnâ€™t even say goodbye to them.


I really donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I plan on trying to catch up with most of my work today but I know Iâ€™m gonna give up. Iâ€™m really thinking of ending it soon. Thereâ€™s no way I can get my grades up to a point that theyâ€™re acceptable.
