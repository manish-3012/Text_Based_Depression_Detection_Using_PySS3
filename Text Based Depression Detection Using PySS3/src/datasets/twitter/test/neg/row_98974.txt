I don't know what to do.Ever since my dad passed away my life has done a complete 180. I've gotten in trouble with the law and have become completely addicted to xanax(lying about how much I take). I can feel how disapointed I make my partner when I look in her eyes. I love her but I feel like a huge disappointment. I am at the point where the only way I can truly release my stress is to cut myself and every day I get closer to wanting to die. I'm trying to get help but nothing is working and I'm afraid one day I'm going to put myself to sleep permanently because I feel I am just a leech on my family and partner. Maybe it's time to put down the whole bottle and sleep for good. The only thing I would feel bad about leaving behind is my dog charlie. At this point he's the only one who still needs me around. Maybe I just need to talk with someone. My friends and family pretty sick of hearing it and just send me to the psych part of the hospital or threaten to call the police. I'm sure that suicide is the way I will die. I've thought about it since I was a young teenager.
