I feel so aloneGrowing up my family tried to pretend we were as normal as possible. But as I've gotten older and moved out on my own I've come to realize how fucked up my family actually is. I have little to no communication with any of my 7 siblings or my parents &amp; on the rare occasion that I do see them it literally always ends in fighting. I've hit a spiral with my anxiety recently making it really really uncomfortable for me to be able to talk to literally anybody, even my close friends. I have a million thoughts running through my mind at all times and I just can't do it. Being alone is easier for me right now but I also know I can't overcome this by isolating myself. I've come to spending my days doing nothing but fighting through my work week, smoking as much weed as I can get my hands on and sleeping. My apartment is trashed, I don't have any money, and I'm just fucking tired of fighting alone. Someone help, fuck.
