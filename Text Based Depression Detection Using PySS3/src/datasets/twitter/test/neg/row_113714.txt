Psychotherapy/MeditationA girl broke my heart so badly a while ago. The last two days, Iâ€™ve seen a hypnotist to help me. Heâ€™s helped me seal up memories and hurt regarding her. Heâ€™s also helped me deaden my emotions quite a bit. I really donâ€™t feel anything. No sadness. No hurt. No pain. Not happiness, either, but Iâ€™m not complaining. $300 a visit isnâ€™t cheap, and itâ€™s only about an hour, and I should be seeing him once a week or every other week for awhile. Worth it to me, I think. I donâ€™t really remember. Seems pretty drastic for me to do something like that without causality. I barely know who she is now, aside from scrolling back in messages to her. Just a distant memory or acquaintance at this point. It looks like she just refuses to leave me alone. I donâ€™t want her to know I did this, but my hypnotist says that a traumatic event or memory can re-trigger my depression, suicidal thoughts, and emotions. Any tips on avoiding a re-trigger? Anything to help not have a distinct hurt memory? At this point, Iâ€™m fine to cut contact off immediately, but it looks like she said sheâ€™d get in touch with my friends and family if I donâ€™t respond. Otherwise, Iâ€™d have blocked her from contacts.
