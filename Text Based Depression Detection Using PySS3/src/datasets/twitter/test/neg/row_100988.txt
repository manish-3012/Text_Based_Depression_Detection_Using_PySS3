How exactly can people explain to others why they want to die?I dont think I could bring myself to just tell another person that I think about death allot. My SO knows it, but I couldint tell my parents or my friends. I think the less people that know the better. When you tell someone that you want to die, all they know is that you want to die, but they wont understand why because for me its a very deep rooted feeling. How can another person possibly understand why you want to die?
