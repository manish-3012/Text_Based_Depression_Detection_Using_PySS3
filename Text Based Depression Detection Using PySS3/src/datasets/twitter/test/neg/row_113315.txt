I'm trans and things just don't feel like they will ever be normalEverything about transitioning for me has gone well. Details that people can't understand. Things people take for granted have finally leveled out for me. Yet starting transition at 25 makes me feel like I lost my whole childhood and all those memories, photos, stories are all radioactive.

I cringe when someone starts telling a story about me because family often misgenders me thinking that's okay because "at that time she was he" like okay thanks for stopping everything and making a scene to explain yourself. 

When I see old photos of the old me I get upset that this memory is ruined because I wasn't myself then, I can see the pain in my eyes and feel what I was feeling at that time. 

Sure things have gotten better but there's permanent damage to my life and I just don't feel like continuing is going to work.

I wish my wife would just leave me so I could disappear without causing her pain. I hate the responsibility I have to everyone in my life to stay alive. This is my life, if I feel it's fucked I can end it if I want to.

But no. Fuck no. Everyone would be all broken up. People would blame my transition because they don't understand. They don't understand if I didn't transition I would have already been gone 3 years ago.
