PatheticI feel like I was cursed at fucking birth. Everything I do, turns to fucking shit. I was born fine until I had to get  a tube in my fucking neck. Spent my childhood hating myself and feeling like shit. Finally got it out and had to spend my life not knowing what to do next. Realizing iâ€™m gay and bound to hellfire was just a nice touch God added to my shit sundae of a life. I feel worthless knowing I will never find someone that I will be comfortable loving and that my whole life is destined for suffering. I feel so alone. Knowing that no one will care about the REAL me if I ever decide to come out is harrowing. Wish I had money for a secret therapist bc I donâ€™t know how much I can take of this. Thinking about self harm as that is my only true way of release bc I donâ€™t want to turn to drugs(crazy family history). I didnâ€™t choose to be gay and I canâ€™t change. Iâ€™m so scared. This is long and Iâ€™m sorry about that.  I just need someone to see this.
