I would rather be dead than gay.I am sure people here know how I feel, I would really like to be dead. Every day is very hard for me. I tried to kill myself 10 years ago, and again last year. I have a lot of people who say they care about me but I wish they would stop and let me escape the pain I feel. 

Iâ€™m not being overly dramatic when I say it hurts really badly. I donâ€™t have any future and I canâ€™t cope with the things my life has given me. My therapist says Iâ€™m not depressed, Iâ€™m just sad all the time about it. If I kill myself now it will never be known why I did it. I told my mum I was sad about work and coronavirus and my divorce.

Honestly I love my job. I just want to be dead rather than gay and I donâ€™t want anyone to know thatâ€™s why I killed myself.
