Finally Over. That's right, I'm going to commit suicide sometime this week. I'm getting 15 strong sleeping pills these week from this gangster I know that attends the same public high school I do. Plus, I have some vodka and Jack Daniels that I can combine it with. I'm finally going to do this. I despise myself, my life, and this entire world. Suicide has been the most logical conclusion I have ever come to and made in my entire 17 years of living. 

I'm even happy for my future suicide just by typing this. This whole week will be dedicated to allowing me my last moments in letting me do  whatever I want. No rules, restrictions, and no one else. I don't care what anybody else. I'm tired of failing and not living up to my expectations. This is my moment of truth. I don't care about anything anymore. Just what I've wanted.
