I have no one left to turn toMy friend, well, â€œfriendâ€ I tried to talk to about how shit I feel told me to stop wallowing and just get out there. And when I tried to explain to her what depression feels like she asked what I wanted her to do about it, â€œinvite you out?â€ And I said yeah but â€œI assume you need some spaceâ€ cuz she was really mad at me for how I was feeling for some reason, cuz I said she didnâ€™t understand how bad I was feeling. And she didnâ€™t reply. And here I am, my last friend ignoring me and everyone else posting fun shit to their social media while I stare at my ceiling, intense angry, sad feelings radiating from my chest. This is the first night I donâ€™t black out drink. Iâ€™ve now been forward with everyone about how Iâ€™m feeling. Everyone says they care, but wonâ€™t take me out of this hellhole. Every night the same. Iâ€™ll have a breakdown, contact someone, theyâ€™ll say they care. But here I am again. Alone. People only really care when youâ€™re dead. Itâ€™s taking every ounce of will in my body to not get drunk and slice my arms open. 

Iâ€™m so alone
