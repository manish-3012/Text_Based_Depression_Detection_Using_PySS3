If I didn't love my mom so much, I would do itShe has been through more than I could even imagine, and I respect her more than anybody on this planet. I wish I could just do it and be done with it, but it's unfair to her after all she's done for me.

So I guess I have to keep living this miserable life. I'm so... numb.
