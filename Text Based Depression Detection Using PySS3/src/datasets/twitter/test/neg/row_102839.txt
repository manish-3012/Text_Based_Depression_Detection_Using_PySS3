Why shouldn't I kill myself?My name is Nick, I'm 19 years old and I think that I am going to die soon.

All my life I've been on the outside looking in. I've always been disconnected from the world and the world doesn't seem to give a fuck. For years I've been depressed. For months I have been suicidal. Never has anyone given a fuck.

I used to love learning about outer space, history, geography, engineering and architecture. I used to love writing stories and poems, I used to love drawing maps and designing my own cities and worlds. I used to love travelling and going outside. Now I'm numb to everything. I feel no passion. I struggle to stay awake most days and I struggle to look like I'm not a suicidal mess in public. 

Every once in awhile I'll experience a bit of the inspiration or passion that I used to feel when I was younger, like a sudden rush of adrenaline is just pumped into me... then it's just fucking gone. I'm briefly reminded of what happiness feels like and then I'm right back to being sad and jaded.

I see no hope for me, I'm lost and I think there's no way I can get back on track. My Mom is depressed like I am. She drinks and takes pills to self-medicate and she's been staying in bed for the past week. I look at her and I wonder, is that going to be me in the future? What about life made her so depressed? I think that my life is going nowhere, I might as well just kill myself and avoid living a life as awful as that. I think I caused her depression. People always say bullshit like "it isn't the child's fault" but I think it really fucking is. I'm a complete fucking disappointment who's dropped out of college and is moving nowhere in life. What parent wouldn't feel depressed raising a piece of garbage like me?

I'm a socially awkward loser with asperger's, I only have a few friends and I often wonder if they hang around me just because they feel bad for me. They(or anyone for that matter) don't know about my depression, but is it obvious that I'm depressed? It must be... I'm not very good at hiding it. I feel like I'm just their charity work or some shit; hang out with me once in awhile just to make sure I don't commit suicide then leave. I never talk to anyone at my work and I'm pretty much just known as the weird quiet guy there. I'm practically incapable of making small talk it seems and other coworkers try to include me in conversations, but I either don't know what to say or I am just in too shitty of a mood to really say anything.

I'm sick of being an outcast, I'm sick of seeing so many happy people when my house is a fucking wreck, I'm sick of trying to fake my happiness in public, I'm sick of thinking about my career plan, I'm sick of slipping into an ever deepening depression, I'm sick of being the weird creepy guy at work because I never talk, I'm sick of feeling exhausted constantly.

It's almost like my suicidal thoughts have evolved into voices that scream at me to kill myself. I could be on the bus, be at work or at home and all of the sudden this wave of dark thoughts just comes flooding in and it just fucking consumes my mind. It's the worst feeling I've ever experienced.

I think that I want to die soon. I don't want to live anymore. I'm sick of my mental state, sick being everyone else's burden, I'm sick of this world.

Death is calling me and life is telling me to fuck the hell off.

Why shouldn't I kill myself? I'm going nowhere, I have no motivation, I'm tired constantly and life looks dreadful to me.
