My dog was taken from me and I have thoughts of suicideAlmost a year and a half go my mom and brother told me we were going to go and get a dog. I was not an much of an advocate for this idea but I decided it would be OK anyways. Little did I know that dog would change my life.

Five months ago I went out to go with my dad to get some food. As we were driving home we saw 3 police cars outside my house with one animal control police car right in front of my house, and my heart dropped. We soon found out that my dog was accidentally let outside of our house when my mom opened the door for him. He sprinted out and bit three people. He bit three people, because right when those victims saw the dog come outside of the house, they started screaming as if they were going to die. As you know, dogs get excited and riled up when people scream, so he decided to bite all three of them thinking it was play. When he left I didn't even get to see him or say goodbye to him. One month later, I'm sitting in my room. To make this this part short she gets a call from the sheriffs department. After she hangs up and looks at me, and she tells me were not getting him back.

"What do you mean were not getting him back?" I ask. She tells me after the police reviewed the injuries they said that the dog was too dangerous for our neighborhood and would be sent to rehab we can't even visit him. I couldn't process the information. I just sat there, and went back on my computer.

A couple days later, I'm on my computer watching some YouTube. I click on a video with a thumbnail of a dog. I see the dog running around playfully and I pause the video and just sob. I'm crying so hard it's painful, and my eyes start to turn red. This goes on for an hour and there is an unbelievable amount of tears, because I realize I'm never going to get this back. That dog was like a son to me. He was so aggressive towards everyone and so antisocial to everyone else but he expressed so much love to me I could not just let him go. He was more beautiful than any other woman I had seen in my life. I had hope for him and I told him and I fix him one day. I used to dream of a time where I could go to a store and have him not lunge or bark at anyone. I told him everyday that I would protect him and keep him safe.

Some nights I have dreams of him. I see him and get excited and go over to pet him, but he just sits there looking at me. He just walks away and I wake up. My emotions these days are not really coherent to me, and I just feel like I can't really explain them in words. It somewhat involves me crying immensely and not being about to breath. I just want to tell him I'm sorry, that I respect him with my heart. But I can't do that. And I feel the only way to show him love is by killing myself because I can't have him. I can't really process the entire consequences of my death towards other people, but I feel like this matters more about me. My mom is always worried about me. If I don't come home after 11 she threatens me that she'll call the police and cries. I'm afraid to tell her how I feel right now, but I'm scared she won't understand and I'll just end up in a mental hospital. Nobody in my family can understand how I feel about him. Other people just tell me he's a dog. I'm sick of that. I truly am sick of people saying that. If anyone is religious out there I want them to tell me why God is doing this to me. I ask for his mercy every single day and tell him I would take care of him so much if he came back, but every other day things get worse. Last week we got a call from a lawyer telling us were getting 3 charges from each individual from the incident (3 people). I couldn't understand why they would do this even though all their wounds are healed and no one suffered from trauma. They know I've lost my dog and My Mom even payed a visit to their house to apologize, but I guess that wasn't enough. They live a couple blocks away from us and we live in a upper middle class area. Why does money drive people like this. I have just lost faith in humanity completely. People say be grateful for what you have, but how can I be grateful when I lost the thing I was most grateful for?
