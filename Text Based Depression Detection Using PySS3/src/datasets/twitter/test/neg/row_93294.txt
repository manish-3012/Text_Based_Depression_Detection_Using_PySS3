I had a planI honestly thought I was finally ready to start at least the first few stages of my plan: write the letters, buy the rope, find a nice tree. For months now there was some kind of peace throughout the day.
 
Yet by some magical fucking coincidence, my parents had started getting really nostalgic watching TV the other night - we talked about all the shit we did on holiday, the inside jokes we made, all the more things I could've and did achieve 5 years ago. Now I hit the brakes. 

I don't understand why they invest so much in me and I hate it. With the way I was born the amount of time and resources I took just for speech therapy and learning the most basic of social cues I felt bad enough for anyway, when all that "development" hasn't given back to anyone like they think it has.  I don't have any set talent left, I'm not really motivated by my course of study anymore, and now all I have is a wall of stupid fucking trust issues with all the friend groups I have to hop between from physically scaring them off. And it was only after these past 2-3 years, I loved to write and bake and just be dumb with so many different people and I have no idea what the hell happened.

Why is it so selfish of me to take these stockpiling obligations off my back?? Is it not more so being unwilling brought into the world to unconditionally fulfill other people when I can't even do so myself??? 

Whatever excuse I pile up, the bottom line is that I'm a coward and a bastard, to not decide between "living" and dying. I did have a couple writing pieces to get out - maybe having a lament of myself on earth to remain is a better compromise first, could be reassuring.

Till then, I'm done questioning anything, any kind of authority. The way I've been overprotected is never gonna change, and it's easier not to think on it at all. For whatever few years I have left, I think I'll just resort to a vegetable mindset. 

Maybe this is a goodbye note of its own, of my character and will. I still feel selfish to expect anyone would read it at all.
