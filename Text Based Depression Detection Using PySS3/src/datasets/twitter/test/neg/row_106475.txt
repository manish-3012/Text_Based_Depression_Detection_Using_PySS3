There's nothing left that moves me anymore. Emotions are long gone. Is this it? I'm not sure if I qualify to post here but honestly, I don't care. I just want some other persons opinion on this matter.

First of all. I'm a 28 year old man living in Sweden. The reason I feel I don't qualify is that I'm not sad, depressed, angry or in any other negative/destructive state of mind. **I feel simply... nothing**. The ONLY emotion I can say I regularly feel is being bored. And I don't just mean bored as in "this movie was boring, lets watch something else". I mean a deeper sense of boredom, as in bored of life and what it has to offer. I hope I'm making sense to anyone.

And yes, I've tried a LOT of activities, hobbies etc but theres this constant financial chain of not being able to do exactly what you want, when you want.

I wouldn't say I'm the "forever alone" type of guy. I'm more the average Joe. I've had several girlfriends in the past, friends, been to parties, traveled the world, yadda yadda. But everyday life is like an ENDLESS cycle of mechanical activities. Seeing the same people, talking about the same pointless topics of discussion, doing the same thing, everyday. 

I recently saw a meme of a bored dude in a grocery store. The text was: "Buys car to get to work. Works to pay the car". This is how I see life as it is. Pointless. Meaningless. Emotionless. There are no songs, movies, hobbies or people that can summon any kind of emotion in me anymore. 

**The only thing** I'd think could change this a bit is if I suddenly won a gigantic amount of money on the weekly lottery. That would open up some possibilities at least to do exactly what I want, when I want. 

A couple of months ago I reached my limit of this robotic lifestyle, so I took a huge bank loan, quit my job and am now living off that money which will last 6-8 more months or so. **My "plan" or whatever you might call it is that I will spend and enjoy this money as long as it lasts, and when the money runs out, end my own life.** 

So at the moment I'm just being completley spontaneous everyday when I wake up since I don't have anything I MUST do anymore. 

Some people might read this and think: "For fuck sake, grow up, do you call this problems?" and I know and agree with you. There are people who have it a lot worse. People who lost family members, been raped etc... But to be completely honest, I don't care about any of them. Comparing myself to them doesn't invoke any kind of appreciation of life. And as I said, I am NOT sad, lonely or depressed. I just feel totally empty. Like a robot. And I see no point in continuing this life like this. I've tried talking to people about how I view life and nobody understands me. They just say: "Go and do something". 

My english is very basic and I hope I somehow succeeded in translating my thoughts into words. If anyone has any opinion at all, I welcome them. Even if you wanna bash me and say "boohoo what are you whining about".

**TL;DR;** 28 year old. Bored to death by life. Took huge loan. Quit job. Waiting for money to run out. Then end my life.
