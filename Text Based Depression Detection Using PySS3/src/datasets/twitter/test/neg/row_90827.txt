Really debating on attempting on my birthday. 4 days.Iâ€™ll be an â€œadult adultâ€, 21. My mental health just keeps deteriorating. Everyone around me has no idea that I feel the way that I do, on the surface it seems like thereâ€™s nothing wrong... I feel it would be appropriate timing, but who knows. I guess weâ€™ll see how I feel when I wake up on my birthday.
