Does anyone else get sick of the "it gets better campaign"?Since the recent celebrity deaths that's all I see on Facebook nowadays. It's the fucking hot topic of the month. A lot of my "friends" posting to reach out to people especially that "strong" friend that puts on a front like everything is fine. None of my friends have checked up on me recently. I haven't told anyone my problems because I am that "strong" friend that is private and doesn't want to burden anyone. Well I have news for them, for some people it DOESN'T get better. They are continually given a shitty hand in life and fight on for as long as they can before they are just so exhausted. Do you fault a cancer patient for deciding to end chemo when it's continually failed them? No you fucking don't. You applaud them and tell them how strong they are. You still treat them like a fucking human. I'm just sick of this campaign that further stigmatizes suicide. 

Does anyone else feel this way?
