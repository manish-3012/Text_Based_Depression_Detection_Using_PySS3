Well, I'm not sure but I definitely don't want to be here anymore- I've been out of work for 3 months. Trying to change my career as I hate what I used to do, but the thought of having to go back because I have no money is terrifying.

- Every single person I've made plans with to just even grab a coffee, has ditched me. Last straw was a buddy who said he'd go fishing with me, so I got up early and dug worms and got my shit together for him to ditch 10 min before.

- My cat needs a surgery called FHO and I can't afford it. Tried fundraising, nothing.

- My kid is an asshole. Don't understand why. But she makes fun of me, and only ever wants money or for me to make food.

- All I seem to do is clean and cook. No thanks or appreciation for anything I do. Just fuck everything up and laugh or make fun of me. Like I ask to empty the fucking trash can in the bathroom cause obviously it's overflowing. No one ever does. So. I threw out the trashcan and now I get bitched at for it.

- Nothing I do is good enough.

- Make fun of how I say certain words. Like Adhesive. And will not fucking let up about it.

I have no friends. Can't drive cause I was never taught. No money. Nothing. I'm a fucking useless lump. And everytime I ask for help, I'm let down. Or told I'm grumpy and to stop being grumpy. Like wtf man. I'm so fucking tired of it. Even when I get mad and stand my ground, everyone ends up pissy with me and nothin g gets solved. It's always turned around on me.

I have stopped cleaning, and nothing. Plus I hate living in a pig pen. I have taken away dishes ffs so only enough dishware for the 4 ppl who live here and still get bitched at.

Im absolutely done. I've had it. I don't know whether to scream and scream or die or fucking run. But at the same time. Dying seems pretty awesome as then they will for once have to figure everything out for themselves.

Im done.

I spend 90% of my day just staring at the fucking wall now. Sometimes there's tears.
