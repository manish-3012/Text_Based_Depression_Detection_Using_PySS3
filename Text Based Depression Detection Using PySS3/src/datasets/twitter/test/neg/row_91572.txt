Update on writing this from my hotel roomHi guys, I hope you're having at the very least an okay day.  I know shits hard, and if you're reading this theres a good chance you havent had an okay day in a while.  You deserve to though, and I know we feel like we dont matter, but you really do.  You fucking matter, it took my dad to hold my head while i was tearing as he looked me in my face and told me i mattered.  I dont know if you have that father figure in your life, or if you have anybody in your life, but this is me virtually grabbing you by your sweet face and telling you that you matter.  Youre capable of doing whatever it is you truly want to do, whether you want to do nothing or do everything.  The world is your oyster

Im updating about the interviews i wrote about last night.  I got to the first one and they told me that you have to be 23 and im 20.  I got to the second one, in which i applied to be a delivery driver, and they looked at me and said "you have a excellent resume,
Would you be interested in our assisstant manager position?" Im not 100% whether im going to stick to delivery or do the manager, because delivery makes more $, but regardless.  Im fucking feeling okay.  I have a feeling im going to wake up tomorrow and not be so sad to wake up.  Ive been on lexapro for about a week or so now by the way, i think its helping.  Took me years to take the medicine plunge, and i dont know why.  Love you guys even though i dont know you face to face, i appreciate this sense of genuine communal caring.  Truly
