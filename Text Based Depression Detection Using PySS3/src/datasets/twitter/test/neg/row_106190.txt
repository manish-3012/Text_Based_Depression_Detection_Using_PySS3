The best retirement gift I can give my parents would be... suicide.I am the product of first-generation immigrants to the UK. I am the youngest of 3 children by a large margin (my oldest brother is 15 years my senior). My parents are also old - both are 72.

My siblings have established lives. They are married, have children and live abroad. My parents want to retire but cannot as I'm a scumbag daughter who cannot live on her own. They work tirelessly together to support me and I am the only reason they are still in this country. They want to retire. They want to go home. They can't as long as I am a burden they need to carry.

I cannot work right now as I am suffering multiple issues with my health such as migraines and fatigue from anaemia and hormone problems. I have also been suffering from depression on-off the last 10 years and have a total of 3 suicide attempts, only one of which my family knows of. It was my first attempt and I tried to overdose on codeine and paracetamol when I was 15. I stupidly did this at home and they were able to take me to the hospital. The other two were half-assed attempts that only made me pass out but not enough to do significant damage. My liver function is fine.

It has gotten to the point where I dont know how I can possibly improve my life and my parents, and all I want to do is for them to stop working so hard for someone who doesn't even want to live. They constantly ask me, they want to stop, I need to get on with my life. That I have no career, that I'm not married, and this is all a strain on them.

I feel like the best thing I can give them now is to just kill myself so they can go home. They would no longer have any financial worries. They no longer have to work. My dad can continue his hobby of tinkering with classic cars and my mother can put her tired feet up.

I have nothing else to give them.
