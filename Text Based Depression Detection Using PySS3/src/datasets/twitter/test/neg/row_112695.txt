Illegal in the US, financially poor, socially anxious, agoraphobic, depressed, and stuck.**Preamble:**Please don't turn this post into an illegal immigration or took err jobs discussion, I already know I am breaking the fucking law and I am not proud of it, on the contrary, it makes me feel ashamed.


My life is shit from almost every perspective. Brought to the US at the age of 14 unfortunately I didn't qualify to obtain legal residence in this country. Lived with my parents and my sister. My father was an alcoholic and aggressive idiot who didn't get legal residence in this country because of his past. Basically we all lived in fear at home because of him but we all stayed with him because we needed the money to help with the transition in this country. My mother became a citizen, my sister a resident, and they managed to get retail jobs so after a while my father got sick of supporting us and went back to Mexico. 

I never managed to make new friends, I was and still am too insecure because my parents weren't too involved in my upbringing. They don't speak English, my father would rage if I asked him to take me to school or buy anything beyond food even if he was making $2500/month as a peon and not even paying in full for rent and utilities. I guess the cultural shock was pretty fucking harsh and never managed to get past it, I was almost 15 when we moved so I was already nearing adulthood. Sometimes I wonder if it wasn't the cultural shock but rather the treatment I received at home.

I did like shit in school, no access to extracurricular activities, only one car and it belonged to my dad, fights all the time at home, sister got into drugs so that put a lot of extra pressure on my parents, I felt fucking alone so I retreated to a deeper and darker place in my mind. Eventually I got depressed, managed to finish school with an embarrassingly low GPA which I didn't even care to find out what it was, passed algebra, chemistry, but by physics I just stopped caring... I was ashamed of who I was, I had no life and working in group projects was fucking hell because I had to deal with normal people. I couldn't reach out for anyone, my counselors thought I had no future and just assigned crappy courses like interior design and animal farming -_- (sad LOL) when I asked for programming ones. I guess that as a minority with a low GPA with a shitload of mental issues passed as someone who barely spoke English and wouldn't have the ability to do some simple logic on a computer.

Fuck, I've deviated from the topic... anyway. My mother (late 50s) has been on medical leave since she had an accident at work where she fractured three vertebrae, she's soon going to undergo her 3rd surgery to attempt to get her shit fixed since now she has a limp. She'll stop receiving her payments in less than six months so that means that I have to get a job AfuckingSAP, the thing is that the last time I had a mcjob I would get anxious as hell when dealing with co-workers and the customer... I am even afraid of checking the mail if there's people outside. 

I managed to finish up to calc II in college (was working on a EE degree), couldn't do my speech class since I am too self-conscious (tried three times). Lost a shitton of weight trying to see if that would fix my attitude, didn't do shit. Dropped out of community college because we couldn't afford to keep paying it, but really, I didn't see myself going anywhere especially with what's going on around me. My mother is shit poor, doesn't have any savings, who knows if she's going to end up well and be able to hold a job after her last surgey (if it's even the last one) we don't even have our own home, we have around $5K CC debt which was accumulated after my father left... 

If I work, it will be to pay for my mother's debt, I have no incentive to work or study because doing both make me feel like shit. I am not lazy, I just don't see myself making any progress earning money because the little I would make would disappear as soon as I got it by paying rent, utilities, and debt. Did I mention that if I get pulled over I could get deported? 

Part of me wants to get deported back to fucking Mexico, to escape it all, but my sister is about to leave home because she's become fed up with all the fucking problems, an agoraphobic/socially anxious/no life brother, a sick mother... me leaving would mean abandoning my mother to rot in debt and physical ailment... you just don't abandon those who care for you. What's for me back in Mexico if I get deported? I don't have a degree, my Spanish is decent both in speaking and writing but far from a professional level, I do have relatives but they are shit poor as well and mentally unstable...

I look at my options... I can't court a woman to even attempt to get married and get a green card because I am an emotional mess (never had a gf, don't have any friends). I've developed a fucking speech impediment from not talking to people so my fluency is all fucked up when talking in both languages, this makes me even more insecure. If I get a job I wouldn't last long because the anxiety would make me quit... dealing with the Mexican version of rednecks is just unnerving... they are unpredictable, loud, aggressive, get away with doing drugs at work, can't hold a conversation that isn't about tits or soccer. I took french in HS and college so I do have basic conversational skills, but even if I wanted to immigrate to Canada I would require to have a useful degree of some sort and even have money to do all the proceedings. Sometimes I do fix or build the occasional computer, build a basic home network, or build a static website but these are shit, low grade IT skills, and without a social security number no one is going to hire me for shit.


I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAN UP
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAN UP
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAN UP

No one taught me how to deal with my fucking issues, stress, growing alone even though I was around people. A psychologist I once saw told me I had a lot of self-defeating thoughts and that all I needed was to be think positively HAHAHAHA and that apparently I had dysthymia. I don't have the energy to even do the stuff I like. Being at home implies masturbating three times a day, browsing reddit, and ruminating about all this shit that I've been telling you about while I am awake. I can't even join the military so I can at least die for a stupid cause during combat... I am too much of a coward to kill myself. I just want to never wake up from my sleep.

**tl;dr**: stuck with sick mother, 24 yo undocumented dude with no degree afraid of leaving his home and leading a normal life, can't even be a proud illegal and steal a job or apply for food stamps or federal aid.
