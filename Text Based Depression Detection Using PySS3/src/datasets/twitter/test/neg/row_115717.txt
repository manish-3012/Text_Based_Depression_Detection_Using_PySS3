Please give me the courage to kill myselfI have no one to live for. Right now I can hear my mother talking about my sister and I on the phone. She says that my sister is going to be successful, both in sports and in school, while the best grade I can get is a D. She says I'm fat, lazy, and I won't go anywhere in life. And I think that too. 
I have no one, my therapist forgot about me, I haven't talked to her in four weeks, and I don't want to bother her. She's been really busy since the lock down started.
I used to talk to one of my teachers, but she ghosted me. She hasn't answered my last two emails, and I don't want to bother her any further. 
I have no one else, the couple of friends I have only think about boys and shit, and I'm too ashamed to talk to them about this. 
Please someone tell me that I need to do it. I've been cutting myself for a while, if I really wanted to do it I could. 
Please tell me it's the right thing to do, so I can finally end this nightmare. Please.
