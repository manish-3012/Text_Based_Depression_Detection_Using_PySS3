Tired of being worriedI hate not being able to tell if I made my friend mad or if the text messager is screwing up. I might have accidentally pissed off my friend, which I worry about all the time. I feel like just not talking to anybody anymore. I'm tired of being worried if I make my friends mad. Was randomly texting a friend, he reads a text which might have been offensive, and boom. My text only says "Sent". It only says "Sent" if the WiFi is fucking up or if the other person signed out of their account or if they blocked you. I'm scared they blocked me and I feel like I did something but the next day I know I didn't. Honestly I feel like dying. I hate the feeling of losing friendships of people I've been friends with since 4th grade.
