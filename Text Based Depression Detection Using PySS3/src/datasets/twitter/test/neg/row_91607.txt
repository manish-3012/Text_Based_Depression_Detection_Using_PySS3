ApathyNot caring if you live or die. Is this the same as being suicidal? I donâ€™t want to kill myself. It would take too much effort. Making it look like an accident. Finding a way to do it that wouldnâ€™t inconvenience anyone. Getting affairs in order. No Iâ€™m not suicidal. But Iâ€™m not avoiding death either. Sometimes when I cross the street I donâ€™t pay attention to the cars. Because I donâ€™t care if I get hit. I'm impatient when waiting. I used to be very careful with mixing drugs. I donâ€™t care about dangerous combinations anymore. They feel nice. Heck, I donâ€™t even care what food I eat. A 5 star steak dinner or a bowl of oatmeal. The bowl of oatmeal is easier to eat. Iâ€™m not sad anymore. Sad is a feeling. Iâ€™m not *anything*. Well as I said, I donâ€™t want to kill myself. Iâ€™m worried that I will kill myself because I donâ€™t care about not killing myself. Make sense? Not dying is a lot of effort for someone who doesnâ€™t care. How do you find the will for effort?
