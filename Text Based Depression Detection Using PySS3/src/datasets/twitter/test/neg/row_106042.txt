i dont even know what im doing herei feel...purposeless?...useless?...an annoyance?...a cunt?...a piece of shit to my friends?...a piece of shit to my ex?...a piece of shit to everyone near me?...a burden to my friends, family, teachers?...

i just feel like i shouldnt be alive, i feel guilty about what i did to my ex even though everyone says that it was her fault, i feel guilty abt how i act towards my friends, i feel guilty abt how harsh ive been to my family members just to hide my face and lock myself in my room, i feel useless in every situation and it seeped right into the thing i had the most confidence in, gaming..i feel like a major burden to everyone..im probably am a piece of shit that acts like a dick to everyone and everyone probably hates me anyways..

i feel completely purposeless and useless, im 16 and its the part of my life that i should really think about what i want for the future, yet, i cant seem to find a reason to be an adult, i dont see excitement in anything..i tried programming, magic tricks, art (music and drawings), gaming, sports, random hobbies etc, nothing..i tried to listen to any subject taught by the teachers in my school, none of the subjects interests me enough for me to be completely passionate in it...and the things that i am good at, im not actually good at, im not good at anything..i suck in everything, i suck at studies, sports, gaming etc...i feel useless that i cant do anything properly without fucking up..i feel lost..

but what did interest me the most was astrology, but considering how useless i am, i slowly lost interest in it as well, its a dream that i could never reach for..

i tried acting as emotional support to my friends and now my ex, that didnt go well, my friends ended up solving their issues themselves or get over their problems or worries with the help of someone else, probably because my words mean nothing and i dont resonate with them at all..i couldnt even provide mental support for my friends..yet they have helped me through so many things...i cant do anything for them..

my ex left me due to an argument, i was overthinking abt a lot of shit at once (really private stuff so im not gonna go much into detail),i wanted to get her attention but i did it in such a stupid way that i feel guilty and i punch myself thinking back, i threatened to kill myself to get her attention to me, she got pissed, she couldnt handle it, people said that its her fault anyways because she understood me and knew that i couldnt think clearly when my brain is already going multiple directions at once and would act rashly..but its obvious that im the retard, im the cunt, im the villain...

school holidays started, im always alone in ny house till 6pm(from 7am)..my pet cat died, and i really loved my pets..it was heart shattering, for the person that "understood" me to leave and have my pet cat, the only thing keeping my sanity in check during holidays, die, in just the span of 3 months...i feel completely dead inside and mentally exhausted and have no vent to speak of because i used to vent to my ex only and i didnt want to vent on social media because i dont want to be more annoying than im already am...prior to holidays, i attempted suicide several times, all of it failed due to not having enough pills, not tying the rope tight enough, having the rope snap, or pussying out..i never attempted a suicide attempt since...but i did hurt myself multiple times, i slashed my wrists, i punched the wall till my right knuckle is obviously bruised, i slapped myself multiple times until i almost fainted, i tried to hold my breath underwater(using a bucket), i starved myself, i refused to drink as much water...now im even considering throwing up every few hours or so just for the sake of it..until i eventually die from exhaustion or trauma...im already an underweight kid, i used to be 48kg(being 167cm), now i fell to 43kg due to neglect of care for my body..i have no reason to care about my body...i just want to disappear..

i have nowhere to go

i just want everything to end

i dont even know why i typed this...its 0349..i started typing at 0310..i need to sleep..but i cant, its been that way for so long....
