Heya I made a post yesterday and my feelings are still the sameI've tried to reach out but nobody has been answering or providing the gentle non judgemental support i've really needed... I've given it more time and thought and I think I'm going to go through with it... can someone atleast help me find the least painful most successful method or ending my life please?
