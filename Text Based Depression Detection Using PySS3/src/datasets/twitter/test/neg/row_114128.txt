I was raised by a pedophileTitle. One of my parents is a pedophile that abused me and my older sibling for about 5 years, not to mention the 10 years of physical and emotional abuse. I donâ€™t care about the â€œyouâ€™re not your parent Bullshitâ€. I share half my DNA with a monster who I protected for years. Every chance to get help when a teacher asked me about the bruises I told the lies we were taught to tell. I refuse to let myself love another human being ever again, because love made me protect the same person who told me they wished I never existed and I was their greatest mistake/regret. I lied about the bruises and said it was from my sibling; I told the story we were told to tell. I will never again let love hurt me or allow myself to feel because all it does is drive me deeper into this hole. I donâ€™t want to bottle everything up but I have to because no one understands and everyone is temporary. There is no justice in my situation and I canâ€™t go on with this shame and never being able to have a normal life. I quit. Iâ€™m done. I havenâ€™t quite decided how Iâ€™m going to make my exist but I have a mental list of options. I canâ€™t go on, Iâ€™m sorry. &amp; if anyone knows me and somehow pieces this together, Iâ€™m so sorry. This world just wasnâ€™t meant for me &amp; I was too weak to continue. Iâ€™m sorry.
