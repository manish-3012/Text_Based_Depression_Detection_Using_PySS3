CuttingI cut my leg earlier. I haven't cut in....15 years maybe. Maybe longer. I liked it. I know normally guys don't cut, guess I'm am anomaly. I was trying to see if a knife in my parents house, where I'm being forced to live for now, was sharp enough. It wasn't. I used some real force and it was a decent cut but wouldn't be enough. Not sure if I'll get over it or go buy some razor blades tomorrow. Well goodnight and good luck.

Also there is no god so go ahead and rip off that bandaid now.
