I don't understand why it has to be so painful.I was having a good week. Eating right  wellbutrin seemed to be stopping the dark thoughts. I was getting up early to exercise. Showering daily. I was keeping a routine. 

The person I live with that stresses me out because they have to have everything "just so" decided to visit somewhere. And I figured it would be a good weekend with them gone. I could breathe. I could relax. I was planning to leave this place before covid. But that financially stuck me where I am so I look forward to times when they are gone. We have an agreement that they say when they are returning so I can clean up before they get home. I used to have to hire a maid to keep them off my back but I can't afford it. I honestly couldn't addors it before but it eased the tension here. If something was done wrong they would not blame me.

They came back early. And because they came back early I hadn't had a chance to clean up the way they liked. So when they got in they were annoyed. Started cleaning around me which makes me a nervous wreck. My medication is in the kitchen where they are cleaning. I am afraid to go in there. I retreat to my bedroom after an altercation over something being out of place. I am crying.

I have asked several times that they do not engage me when I have a meltdown. But they follow me in my room which I cannot lock, but even if I could having them angry at my locked door would be just as bad. I have autism and scolding me while I am crying won't make me stop. Telling me I am overreacting won't make me stop crying either. I just needed time to cool down. I hate this place. I hate existing. I hate that everything hurts. That I can't function the way anyone wants me to. I don't have family anymore that can help. I don't have anyone to talk to. I want out so bad and the depression is closing in around me. 

What the hell are we even here for? Life feels like a sick joke. I just want it all to stop.
