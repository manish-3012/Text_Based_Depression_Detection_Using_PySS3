I just want to disappear.I am getting to the point where I am just tired of it all. I want to go missing and disappear. I don't think many people would look for me or miss me anyways.

I'm almost 24 and graduated university with a useless degree in social sciences, and am now in the hole almost $30,000. I work full-time right now at a crappy retail job where I am treated like shit more often than not. I live on my own and have had my family visit me less than 5 times in the year (since I've moved out). My mom has called me once the whole summer, and I do not speak with my father because he and my step-mom abused me when I was in their home. 

I have a boyfriend who was my saving grace for a very long time. But he is falling out of love with me. I can feel it and I can see it in his actions. It's been 3 years of him being with me, and I can feel that we will be coming to an end soon. I have gone through someone pulling away before the inevitable end, and I can feel it now. I'm terrified. I can't do anything to change his mind... and when he leaves me I will have absolutely nothing and no one to keep me going.

I don't have anything going for me, like at all. I spend all my free time at home. I just don't know how to get through the day any more. I don't know if I want to.
