I want to ask for help but I donâ€™t want to burden anyoneI havenâ€™t gone a day without thinking about it in about 10 months, with treasured exceptions here and there. The only thing is I can feel how hard it hurts other people to talk about this, so I donâ€™t. The only reason I donâ€™t do it is that I wouldnâ€™t want to hurt or burden anyone.
