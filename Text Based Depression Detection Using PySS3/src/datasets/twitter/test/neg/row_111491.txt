An urge to self harmIâ€™m young, ya but that doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m immune to depression. Ive wanted to die as long as I can remember. It started out like a quiet voice, silence then a whisper, quietly talking, to talking at a normal tone to now. Itâ€™s starting to yell, to scream at me. And I donâ€™t know how much longer I can take this.

Iâ€™ll say this now, I have never gone to a professional about this. Iâ€™m too scared. And I never will. I feel like Iâ€™m starting to get a form of anxiety. I still just refuse to get help for it. For anxiety I feel like Iâ€™m stuck and I canâ€™t breathe sometimes Iâ€™ll start to twitch or shake and my breathing becomes uncontrollably at points. But this only started recently.

Now I know self harm isnâ€™t the best option and I know what people will say. â€œDonâ€™t do it, it fixes nothing.â€ And all that, but what can I legitimately do? Truthfully I would just kill myself but Iâ€™m too scared about my boyfriend finding out I died. I talk to him often about suicide and depression so heâ€™s fully aware of how I feel. He will sit on call with me till I fall asleep just to comfort me when Iâ€™m scared to be alone. He is my world. I know Iâ€™m making a mistake but I need an outlet...

I made him a promise, â€œIâ€™ll try not to hurt myselfâ€ is what I told him. I said try because I know I canâ€™t hold on forever. Iâ€™m extremely suicidal Iâ€™ve wanted to self harm for awhile but now I have an urge, a want, a feeling of need. I donâ€™t want to die as long as heâ€™s with me but Iâ€™m not scared of dying, or well I think. Iâ€™ve been too scared to cut myself before but today I did hurt myself. It wasnâ€™t cutting or burning, it was scratching. This morning I was already feeling anxious and I had a bit of a breakdown, I started to scratch my skin trying to make myself bleed and to feel pain, but I donâ€™t remember much pain I remember feeling relieved for a few moments then looking at my arms there were red marks all over. I quickly grabbed my sweatshirt to hide it and Iâ€™ll say I made sure no one got even a glimpse and my arms or wrists. What would people say if they saw my arms all red with marks all over? I donâ€™t even know what came over me to push me to harm myself. I genuinely wanted to bleed I genuinely wanted to. I felt horrible all day, to anxious to talk to people besides teachers and the few people I can somewhat consider my friends. Never said a word about what I did or felt. I just acted like nothing happened, but people did notice how I was anxious and constantly losing focus and coming in and out of a daze because I was so worried about everyone else.

Now I have an urge to keep doing it, I want to keep doing it, itâ€™s easier to do then cutting, it can fade away after all. And I donâ€™t have to think about the pain of a knife cutting my skin. Or burning myself. I want to keep on doing it I loved it before, even though I was anxious because I broke my promise, because I didnâ€™t try to fight the urge I basically welcomed it in.
