not sure where to go from hereJust got a call from a hiring manager who was considering me for a high paying technical role within my city. He called to tell me that I didn't get selected for the role. This is the third rejection from three different departments. Last night my wife of 4 years, (together for 20) during a heated argument screamed at me that I need to be a man and that she fucking hates me and threatened to call the cops on me to remove me from my own home. I over-reacted and threw my keys at the window, kicked some dishes flying and grabbed a knife and threatened to stab myself in front of her if she didn't stop pushing me. She left and called my parents and now she doesn't want to live with me anymore and I am not welcome back to my own home and she is filing for a divorce. I am basically now existing for the sake of my 3 young kids who are pretty much the only people who love me and that I love fully in return. But how depressing is that? That one of the people they look up to, to care for them and teach them is a complete and utter useless reject who's contracting business failed after 6 years and can't land a full-time job in order to provide for them and their mother who now wants nothing to do with him. Not sure where to go from here. Other than back to my parents place at 38 years old. If I didn't have kids, I would probably just jump off a bridge right now. But I will just keep trying harder I guess cause I can't bear the thought of them knowing that I gave up on them.
