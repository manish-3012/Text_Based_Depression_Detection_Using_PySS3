I donâ€™t want to fight to be alive.Why canâ€™t I die so easily like everyone else with my conditions? Iâ€™ve been bulimic and drinking daily for years. But my heart wonâ€™t give out. My chest hurts every morning and I just pray to have a heart attack so I can stop being alive. I donâ€™t want to try to be happy anymore. I wish I was dead.
