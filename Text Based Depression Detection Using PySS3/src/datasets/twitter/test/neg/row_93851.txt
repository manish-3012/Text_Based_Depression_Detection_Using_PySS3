I'm ready to kill myselfI'm sick of living in a world where I can never be accepted and only seen as a worthless piece of shit. I'm sick of being seen as a retard for having a disability and always being denied help and encouragement because of it. I don't see what the point of living in such a world is anymore, considering how much hate and stigma I have to go through on a daily basis. I'm going to go to bed tonight, tell my family goodnight, and immediately suffocate myself with my pillow, I'm just sick of it all. I feel like I'm screaming for help and nobody will listen, and when they do, they'll deny that my problem is as bad as I think.
