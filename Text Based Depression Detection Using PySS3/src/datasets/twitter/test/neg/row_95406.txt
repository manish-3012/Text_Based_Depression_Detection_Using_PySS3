cant see a reason to keep tryingim at the lowest point ive ever been in my life and while ive gotten the most support i could ever ask for from my friends and this is the best my family has done to support me, i genuinely cant see or understand how i affect the lives of the people around me in good ways.

ive been on antidepressants and have been doing therapy for over a year now, and ive made improvements in myself, but theres still a lot of bad things about me and im sick of constantly disappointing and hurting the people that are the most important to me.

i dont have a plan and neither do i have intentions of hurting myself, but i really dont want to keep living and i know the world and the people in my life would be better off if they had never met me in the first place and if i never existed. i start school monday and my schedule this semester is hell and i dont know how im going to get through it, i just wish i could passively die.

i dont know who to talk to in my life anymore about things like this bc i keep wearing everyone down but i need to get it out and so im posting here. i'll probably delete it later. thanks for reading if you did
