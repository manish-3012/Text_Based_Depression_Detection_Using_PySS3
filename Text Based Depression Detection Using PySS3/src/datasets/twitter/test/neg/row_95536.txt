MoneyI donâ€™t have any. Fuck debt collectors.  Iâ€™m never going to be okay. I just want to die so theyâ€™ll stop calling. Why the fuck a hospital charges $45 for a fucking Benadryl?  Thereâ€™s no reason for the prices to be this high but thanks for letting me know my debt is gathering interest and Iâ€™m fucked further. I want to die. I want to jerk the wheel and just die. I canâ€™t ever pay it off anyways if itâ€™s gathering interest. Itâ€™s too much. I couldnâ€™t work for 7 months and Iâ€™ve been struggling this entire time. Itâ€™s only more struggling. I canâ€™t do it.
