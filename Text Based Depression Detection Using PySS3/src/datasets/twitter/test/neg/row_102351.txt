Everyone and everything has given up on me and I am in unbearable pain&amp;#x200B;

Everyone. Therapist, my parents, etc. Today my abusive, narcissistic mother was like, "Why don't you just get married and get out already? I want to have a smart grandchild i can raise to be like me instead of a failure like you." 

I know I'm a failure. I couldn't even graduate high school despite wanting to. i couldn't achieve my dream of becoming a writer. i wish I was anyone but me. i hate myself. i want to take a knife and cut my face and wrists and my body because I'm a disugsitng person and I need the physical proof of it.

I'm tired of seeing the person who sexually molested me as a child and not being able to go anywhere because I'm unemployed, broke, codependent my mother, low self esteem, and stupid. stupid as fuck. I'm tired of this 

She said it in  a joking manner but it got to me.

There are a lot of other things. But I honestly cannot take this pain anymore. I am giving myself a week. If my new medication doesn't work, I will steal some of my molester grandpa's vodka and down my antidepressants and try to slit my throat. No one listens and no one cares. 

My stupid DBT therapist says its because I don't try the fucking skills enough. My life is shitty. I'm a toxic person. I am in an abusive relationship with myself. I keep hoping I'll change and things will get better and deep down inside I'm a good person, but I'm not. I'm anything but good. I'm stubborn and I hurt and push away everyone.
