Need advice for a high school sibling.I just found this community and would like some advice about my sister.

&amp;#x200B;

My sister is just finishing up her first year of high school. She has always been a smart, witty, funny person. She still is at points, but over this past year, Iâ€™ve been at college and havenâ€™t been living with her anymore. Sheâ€™s changed a lot, and isnâ€™t the same person she used to be; she absolutely hates going to school, she sleeps a lot, and makes a lot of jokes about being sad or sometimes even suicide (which is difficult to hear). Itâ€™s hard to watch her go through.

&amp;#x200B;

I love her and want to help, but my family isnâ€™t the best at helping. We arenâ€™t qualified professionals, and Iâ€™m mostly just afraid of messing up or saying the wrong thing. When I try to help, my sister brushes me off as being disingenuous or uncaring, which probably is just making it worse. Since Iâ€™m not a professional with helping people who are struggling mentally, I donâ€™t know what to do. I wish I could help her without her â€œseeing throughâ€ what Iâ€™m saying, even though I mean what I say when I tell her that I love her and want her to know that she can talk to us.

&amp;#x200B;

She has recently started going to therapy sessions, which I am relieved to hear about. Iâ€™m not expecting effects from therapy yet, but from what sheâ€™s told me about the sessions, it seems like theyâ€™re helping only marginally; it seems like she feels the same way about her therapist being disingenuous.

&amp;#x200B;

For anyone who has gone through something like my sister has, what can I do to help? Regardless of anything, I want to know if thereâ€™s specific help I can provide that I wouldnâ€™t know how to give otherwise.

Iâ€™m willing to provide more information if yâ€™all need any. Thereâ€™s a lot of minor details, but I just donâ€™t know what is or isnâ€™t relevant.
