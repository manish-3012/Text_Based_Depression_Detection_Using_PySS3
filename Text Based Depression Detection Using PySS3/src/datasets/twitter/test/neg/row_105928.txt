I've decided what I have to do16 f I'm not killing myself yet, yeah everyday sucks and I feel like a lonely depressed blob that can't even move unless I have an assignment due the next day... but I'm lucky to have parents who care about me, a home, and a sister... yeah they told me they gave up on me but they're still family and they still feed me and love me I guess.
If I tried to explain why I wanted to die it would go on forever but basically its because I'm stupid compared to everyone in my school they're all geniuses and I'm nothing compared to them... I have a terrible act score and sat score and terrible gpa... im only head of one club in my school and I have to be at least head of 3 to even get into a good college. I can't speak to my friends about it because they'd look down on me for being stupid but still having problems when they work so hard. And once when I did tru to talk to them they told me to get a book on self confidence. I've realized that pretending to be happy is much easier than being called an attention whore. There's also more reasons but I dont want to go into them right now. 

Here's what I'm going to do, I'm going to keep on living until I've completely severed ties with everyone I know and then just die when I have no one left... that way it wouldn't hurt anyone around me and it'd be perfect. Im not sure when this will happen but I'm going to keep playing along until that day comes.
