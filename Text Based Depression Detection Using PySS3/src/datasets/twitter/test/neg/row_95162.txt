I'm the happiest I've been in a long time, but I still feel trapped.I'm happy. 

I have been suicide sober for a year since this August and I'm quite proud of myself. Depression hasn't been won over, but I'm managing to be quite happy throughout most of my days. There was actually a night a month or so ago where it was hard to sleep because I was so happy. It's a totally alien feeling after suffering for so long. 

But sometimes...Doing it now feels like it would be more viable than doing so back then. I feel like I could actually pull it off. 

Reason being is I still feel trapped. I've been trying to find part-time work for a little bit and have gotten a few interviews, which is nice. My sibling and I have been applying for awhile now, but problem is when some people make it seem as if you aren't doing anything, or have to do it *their* way. Well, I have multiple confirmation emails and interviews as proof that that isn't the case. They make it seem like I don't want to work, when I've explain multiple times it isn't about not working. I just don't want to end up being one of those people becoming complacent with where they are and not striving for more. I don't want to be one of those people whose job is sapping their life-force and become crestfallen. That would be counterproductive to keeping my mental health where it's at now. 

If I'm not striving to make my passion a reality then what's the point? So I can be like them and realize that work makes me miserable and not continue to search for something more? I think, I'd just use that money to buy myself a ticket out of here. That was one of my plans. 

Someone thinks I need to do full-time, but part-time would allow me to get work experience while also have adequate time to work on what I actually need to be working on. I just don't want to be trapped working for someone when I know I could be doing something better. That's different from not working or not wanting to work at all. I'd rather die than let that happen. I'm just getting tired of it. Just because you have a job doesn't mean you're going anywhere if you're working places for years on end without making your goals happen. 

Honestly, I don't believe I deserve to live, or kindness. I don't know why anyone thinks I'm some angel or whatever. I ain't. I have this rage pent up in me and I think evil thoughts. They know this, yet continue with the platitudes. I'm happy, but I think it's best I see my way out. 

People say there is some fucking ripple effect when we commit suicide? I mean, sure, but it won't be anything significant, I don't believe. 

I don't know... There is a nice lake I can walk to, by some pretty neighborhoods. That would be nice for some of my last sites. 

I guess that's all hypothetical. I'd love to keep going, but I'm tired of being jobless and being made to feel as if I'm not looking, or being expected to work them instead of following my passions. Stupid. 

I'm currently writing a book. It's in its final stages. Once its all done, that would be a good time to go. 

But again hypothetically speaking.
