When you see an open windowdo you imagine running fast at it, jumping through, opening your arms and gliding to what would hopefully eventually be nothingness? Because I do that a lot nowadays. Although I don't think I'll do it (it's 5th floor, my dumbass wouldn't die), the thought is so tempting that I once had a sudden movement towards the window. It was like a reflex. It was weird.
