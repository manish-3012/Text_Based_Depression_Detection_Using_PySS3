My name is Trinity, i have a thing for the number 3, tomorrow is my 33rd b-day.If I were going to end it, tomorrow seems like the best day. Three has no deeper meaning to me, I just like it, it's aesthetically pleasing.

 I'm a trans girl, I picked this name and went through the legal trouble to change it to this. I'm depressed as shit.  I only have 1 friend and 2 family members that talk to me on the regular. That's it, no one at work talks to me, I have no social life. I'm so alone. I spend 95% of my free time alone in my bedroom  It's been this way for about 5 years now. Nothing in life brings me joy. My favorite foods that used to get me excited have lost their taste. The music has become repetitive and boring. My other escapes, anime and video games can't hold my interest. 
.
I'm so lonely and want to make friends and do things together.  But I don't have any hobbies or subjects to relate with others about. Pre transition all my free time and money was spent doing drugs...because I was depressed and needed to escape the reality of being born wrong.
.
 I'm stuck in the wrong body and the only way out is surgerys=mass amounts of money. Even then, EVEN THEN...if I fully transitioned I don't know what I would do with myself. I feel like such a blank slate. Like I never became anything, like I was never able to "find myself" and become an individual. 
.
How do I make new friends when I don't have hobbies? When all I ever did with my life was drugs to escape. 2 people I got pretty close to online eventually rejected me once they found out I don't have much to talk about. All I could talk about was drugs because that's all I did, that's all I  knew...they got bored and ditched me. 
.
My social anxiety has me so twisted that it's hard to go shopping and get through a grocery list without a panic attack. I can't even reach out on an individual level and tell others how bad I need them and how much I'm suffering. I always feel like a burden to others, even internet randos in FB groups.

Last week I requested the 17th off work because, "my birthday". Invited my only friend and my niece to go bar hopping. They both hit me up today, i told them both I cancelled because I'm too depressed to function. 
.
I'm not living life, I am simply alive and I don't know why I don't call it quits.
