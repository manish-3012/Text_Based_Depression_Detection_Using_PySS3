Need help.I don't know what to do. Ending it seems like the only way out. 
Have no idea why I'm even on here, maybe it's a good place to say goodbye!

Edit: I don't know where to start, but here goes. I'm a 21 year old female. Live with my father's parents who are strict Sikhs. I myself have no interest in religion, yet they force it upon me. I'm under a strict regime, I can't socialize with friends at college and have to notify them at all times as to where I am. Due to these rules, I have no close friends, as I have been living back and forth between Canada and England. My parents and siblings still live in Canada and I haven;t seen them since September. I had a history of depression but had gotten over it until recently when I felt myself slipping back into it. I know that what I'm feeling is irrational but I feel as though it would help me. 
There is more to this but it's too hard to share as I know it would just worsen my attitude towards my decision.
