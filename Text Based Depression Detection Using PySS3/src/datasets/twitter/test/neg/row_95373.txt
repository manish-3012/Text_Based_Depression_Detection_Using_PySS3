Im so stressedI started taking lamotrigine a couple weeks ago for bipolar and i realized that ive started showing side effects, body aches, mouth sores, increased depression and thoughts of hurting myself. The paper they gave me said to call my doctor when i notice side effects but its like 2 in the morning. Im super stressed out, what do i do? Also im down to just talk about whatever to take my mind off it if youre interested
