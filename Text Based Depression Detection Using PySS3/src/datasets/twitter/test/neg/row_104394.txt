Please help....      I've literally just been laying in bed scratching my own body just so I can feel something for the last hour. I just threw my knife across the room because I almost stabbed myself, then I just laid shaking for about 10 minutes
I've cut myself off from most of my friends and to the rest I fake it.
I work 40hrs a week on top of school, and honestly with the way my family is being out of the house and away from home at work is better and I avoid trying to go home... 
Help please
