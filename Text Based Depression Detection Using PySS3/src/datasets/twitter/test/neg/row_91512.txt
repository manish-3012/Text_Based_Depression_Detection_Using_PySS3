Got released from hospitalAfter finally building up the courage to go to the hospital to get help, they released me a few hours later because I wasnâ€™t enough of a â€˜threatâ€™ to myself... even though I admitted I was suicidal and wanted to hurt myself.

All they did was give me numbers to crisis lines that I already knew of and thatâ€™s it. Going there was basically a last resort and it blew away just like that. 

Like what the fuck, now what am I supposed to do?
