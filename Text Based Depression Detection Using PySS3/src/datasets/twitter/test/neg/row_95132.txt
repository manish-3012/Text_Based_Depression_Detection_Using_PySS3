First note rough draft! Check it out![names changed for obvious reasons]

Suicides notes. So clichÃ©, but here I am. Let me just start of by saying I'm sorry. I know how much this will affect my family. Especially Mom, Dad, Tom Sal and Claire. I really am sorry. I didn't want you to have to go through this, but I just can't keep going. I'm sorry to the couple friends I have, mainly Brian. Thanks for being one of the longest running best friends I ever had. 

Now, I'm sure you're wondering why. Well, Lisa is breaking up with me, and I honestly just can't handle it without her. Lisa, I love you. I've never met anyone who even comes close to you. The thought of us not being together is too much to even process. I can't even sleep anymore because I'm so destroyed. At work, at my apartment (the only 2 places I ever am), it's all I can think about, and I just can't go on. This isn't how things were supposed to go. I know lots of people go through rough breakups and come out of it ok eventually. Well, I'm sorry, but I'm just not that tough. Please, live your lives unlike I did. Live them for others, and live them so you can be happy. All I ask is not to be forgotten. Kisses to Spots and Fin for me. 

I guess as an unofficial will, please give Lisa a few grand to help cover grad school and all the gas money she wasted on my lazy butt. The rest of it put into helping clean the oceans. Also, I'd like to be turned into Coral reef; it's a thing, look it up. Bye everyone. I'm sorry I wasn't enough for you.
