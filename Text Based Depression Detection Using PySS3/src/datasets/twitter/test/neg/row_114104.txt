People are tured of dealing with meI'm quite sure people are tired of dealing with me. At this point the bad in me outweighs the good. They may not say it to my face, they may not leave me, they may act like it's okay but it's not. It's not okay for people to have to deal with me and my pathetic idiocy. They deserve to be free of me. They deserve happiness more than I deserve the air I breathe. I just don't want to be a burden anymore.
