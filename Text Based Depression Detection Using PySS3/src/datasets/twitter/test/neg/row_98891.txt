"vote up if" I Done GoofedI have failed to do anything with my life.  For the last fifteen years I have had three jobs, two have lasted around a year and the third a few months.  I knew about bitcoin when one could buy multiple for a single dollar and I had no clue that it would be what it is today.  The idea of trying to find a job with my resume-gaps, dealing with asshole employers, working for minimum wage, working simply to live, and basically being treated &amp; paid like a slave-with-benefits, makes me want to end my useless life.  I enjoy helping others and I despise taking advantage of people (I am not going to sell someone something they do not need).  I am not lazy:  when I work, I work hard.  I was once offered a job while working because I was the only one consistently working when a contractor walked through several times throughout the day.  But I am dumb as I miss opportunities a lot.  I live in a constant state of "I should have...".  I have worked since I was a kid, except the past 15 years, which seemed to have flown by.  I am tired.  But, thanks to my laziness when I am not working, depression, and using substances to cope, I am soon to be at... something.

I do not know why I am posting this or what I expect to come from it.  Life is tough for those born losers.
