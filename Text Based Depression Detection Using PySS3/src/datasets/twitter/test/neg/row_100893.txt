I am a burden to everyone and should've died a long time ago.After 9 long years of struggling with depression and several failed suicide attempts, I finally got on medication. It really started working, and I started feeling more optimistic about life. And then all of my friends left me. I'm too crazy, I'm too much to deal with, my medicine and depression issues are just too much. I have maybe two real friends and I can't talk to them about this anymore because I know they're sick of hearing about it and will just think I'm being overdramatic and self centered. 
I did what everyone said to do. I found a great therapist. I got on medication. I reached out to others. I started exercising. And things will work out for a few weeks and then go right back to shit. Maybe living isn't meant for everyone, maybe some of us are mistakes and just living on borrowed time already, and that's why our lives are nothing but a failure because that's all we are. 
I'm incapable of keeping close friendships because I'm fucking crazy. I have too many mood swings and I'm self centered and overdramatic, and no one wants a friend who says they want to kill themselves every few weeks. It's exhausting. And it's selfish of me to put that burden on others. I overcomplicate everyone's lives. I think tonight may be the night, not sure yet. Working on writing out the note now. Not sure why I'm posting this, maybe I want someone to care about me, and that makes me cringe because now I'm even begging fucking internet strangers to listen to my bullshit problems. I'm sorry. I truly hope that others posting on this sub find answers to their issues. But I don't think I'll be able to find a way to solve mine.
