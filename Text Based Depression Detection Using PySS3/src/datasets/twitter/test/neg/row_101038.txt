If an uncaring asshole kills himself, is it a really a negative to the people around himListen. Imagine someone who's been lying and manipulating as far back as he can remember. Someone who stole from their 'friend' because they wanted something that friend had. Someone who nearly got another person expelled because they found it funny. The person in question has trouble recalling when they felt a truly unselfish emotion. 

This someone is lazy, elitist (their friend described them as such just yesterday, and they agreed with the description), apathetic to everything in life, sexist and creepy (it's been told to his face on multiple occasions) with women, and spiteful of them too (for little reason). This person is a compulsive liar, and different people see him in drastically different lights. The person in question has made a fool of themself on multiple occasions, and people bring it up in jest amoung themselves, without letting the subject of their joking know what exactly happened. The reason why the subject doesn't know is because he was black out drunk (the black out was one of many). 

The person enjoys seeing other people miserable, and he feels like human scum. He doesn't show non-coerced affection to his family, or his friends. 

What would the world lose if he decided to finally rid it of his presence? I can only see a gain.
