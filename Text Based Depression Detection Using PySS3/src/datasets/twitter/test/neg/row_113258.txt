We all may talk a good one on here, but I for one dont have the balls to kill myself. No matter what hell and torture I endure in this world. I know that it will happen without me having to.You know when your time is getting near. I know too much to know that I will be going to hell after. Whether I kill myself or die from something else. I know my destination is hell. I ve had moments of happiness here on earth but my pain, my decisions, the mental torture here in this world eclipse any happy moments I had here on earth. I am damaged beyond repair. I ve lead my name down to the dirt. I let everyone who I felt did me wrong get the power by reacting to it to where they get away scott free. While i deal with the effects of it. I want to die but that uncontrollable fear that come upon me as I know demons are waiting for me on the other side. They mess with every now and again when sleep, and throughout the day through emotions. I know they cant wait to tear my spirit apart as if it was flesh.  They convinced me and I also convinced myself that there is no saving me, nobody will love me fr, I'm nothing but a nuisance, an abomination to everyone that sees me and that God has forgotten about me. I dont think nothing that can be said or done at this point to change this mental view. I hope everyone that's thinking of suicide know that demons are real and they cant wait for you to do what you are thinking. And there is no "I'm not afraid". You ll have no choice but to be as you wouldnt be able to contain your fear. Unimaginable pain and horror.
