It's my birthday and all I want is to not wake up.I hate my birthday. It's the biggest reminder that I matter to no one. I am so completely and utterly lonely. No friends, my family are awful, nothing.

Up until recently I thought I thought I had a friend. They meant quite a lot to me, chatting with and messaging them made things seem just that little less awful but recently any attempts at conversation with them has been a one way thing, an uphill struggle. Like they don't actually care anymore, they just don't want to say so. part of me wants to tell them this, to say that at this point it'd be less upsetting to cut ties and stop talking to them rather than carry on with what has become of our 'friendship' (the odd message that feels like awkward smalltalk with someone you don't know despite having known them knowing me for a couple of year)

But then I would even be able to pretend there's someone who cares even a little bit even if they actually don't. That would be it, the point where I could quite literally not go on.
