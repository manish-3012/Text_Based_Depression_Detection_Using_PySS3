I think I'm going to do itI guess I can't talk methods which makes sense. Suffice it to say it's probably going to be painful, as painful as you'd expect a body reacting to dying would be. That's scary but there's going to be pain either way so I guess it's okay. The big thing is that you can't back out once it happens. No matter how excruciatingly painful it is or how loudly your deep reptilian self-preservation instinct is screaming, once you do it you can only ride through it and let it happen. It's freeing in a pathetic way to know there's nothing you can do anymore.





Anyway I guess I'm here to hang out lol I'm eating a whole pizza first, gotta say goodbye to that good shit
