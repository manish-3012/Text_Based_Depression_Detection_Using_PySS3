HurtI've been depressed for the last few years but thanks to medication and supportive surrounding I've managed to live with it. It got worse in the last couple of months but my friends/family always managed to get me out of killing myself, indirectly and directly.

Yesterday someone I love dearly assumed the worst of me  and treated me terribly. To say I'm hurt is an understatement.

I feel terrible because I'm surrounded by very supportive friends and family, but it just. Hurts so much. I didn't know that it's possible to be mentally hurt so much that you physically feel hurt. All I wanna do now is to take my life to stop hurting, and also to send a message to the person who hurt me: this is on you.
