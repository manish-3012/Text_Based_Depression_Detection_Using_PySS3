I donâ€™t want to move on with my lifeI have been isolating myself and getting pretty deep into a black hole of depression recently. Iâ€™m supposed to graduate college in May but thereâ€™s nothing that I want to live for. I do not have any skills or passions and no job or next step lined up. I donâ€™t want to burden anyone in my life by talking to them about this. I havenâ€™t seen my friends in a while. Iâ€™m not close with my family. Everything hurts me so I just donâ€™t do anything or talk to anyone. I donâ€™t know what to do at this point. Iâ€™ve stopped drinking because I think thatâ€™s when Iâ€™m most likely to have the courage to kill myself. I also canâ€™t afford my medication so will have to be off of it until I get paid on Friday. Iâ€™m trying to take care of myself and go outside. Iâ€™m hurting so bad and Iâ€™m not sure what else I can do at this point
