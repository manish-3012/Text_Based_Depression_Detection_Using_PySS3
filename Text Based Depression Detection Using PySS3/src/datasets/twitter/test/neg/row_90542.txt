Keep thinking about the detailsI've been suicidal for as long as I can remember (I'm 20) but lately i've been just thinking about all the little details suicide involves. I'd have to wipe my computer/phone/ipod clean, sell those so there's some money for the funeral. Create some apology letters to some close family members and friendsâ€¦ Plan how the body should be found, the methodâ€¦ Suicide is not as spontaneous as I once thought it was.
