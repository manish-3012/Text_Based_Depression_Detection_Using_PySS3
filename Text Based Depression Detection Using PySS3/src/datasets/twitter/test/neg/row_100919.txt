Can't believe I'm here againI'm tired of working 10 hour days and having nothing to show for it. My life is in the fucking crapper. People around me lie, cheat and steal and then they win the fucking lottery (like what just happened to my roommate, who is a poor excuse of a human being). THERE IS NOTHING TO LIFE EXCEPT BEING CRAPPED ON BY PEOPLE WHO ARE PIECES OF SHIT. I just can't do it anymore. Goodfuckingbye.
