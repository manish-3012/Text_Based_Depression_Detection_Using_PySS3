Today I am going to dieToday is the day that I am going to do it. I'm tired, I've been battling this sickness for so long.

I'm tired of everyone telling me it will get better, that it will be okeii, that I have such a bright future. I've had enough.

I'm sitting at the sea shore typing this at my phone, looking out at the sea and for the first time in years, I feel peace, I'm going to go. 

I'm sorry everyone. I can't fight anymore.

Goodbye
