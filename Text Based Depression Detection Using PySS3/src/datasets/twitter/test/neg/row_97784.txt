You don't actually care. And if you do, I don't give a damnThat's always the response when you tell someone you're suicidal. "Don't do that, I care, your friends care, your family cares" no, none of them do, they're all too busy wrapped up in their own lives, and that's fine, but don't fucking lie to me about it. And on the rare occasion that that isn't the case and somebody actually does care about a person other than themself, how is that supposed to solve the problem. "Oh, somebody cares about me, I guess I have reason to live now". Yeah right. Eventually they're going to die too and then they won't care. Eventually I was going to die anyway. Why not make it now? And why am I staying alive for other people, anyway?
