I think I might try killing myself after I make my own game.I really have a very strong burning passion inside me to make my own first game. It might be not that entirely great, but maybe a few people will like it, I don't know. And also, even though when I create it, it might not change my life around that much, so, thats why I still prefer suicide as an option for myself.
