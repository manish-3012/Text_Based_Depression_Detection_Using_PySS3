I'm probably gonna kill myself in the next few hoursI'm honestly just sick of life I have no friends no romantic interest no girl has cared about  me other than just as friends  my life is literally worthless my medication does not help therapy doesn't help I've never had any  relationship of any sort "friends" talk about me behind my back they make fun of me infront of everyone at my school aswell I get humiliated on a daily basis I'll probably never amount to anything everyone thinks im literally retarted because I do foundation maths which Is the lowest form of education for maths in my country  I've never been with a girl I get made fun because of that daily everyone my age is having sex and it makes me depressed that I've only kissed one girl i can't see my life getting any better im only 16 and It actually scares me that I think this way my mind is so messed up now I literally only want a friend someone I can't talk to and trust I also would like a girlfriend or a girl that's even interested me in the slightest I just want to feel wanted and not feel like the ugliest thing in existence i have acne and even without I know I'm not the best looking  i know I'm going to kill myself eventually I've tried a couple of times but I havent had the courage to do it because I'm a pussy I just want any form of relationship at this point I'm just so lonely all the time I know this may seem really stupid because I'm 16 but I don't even know at this point my mind is so fucked I don't wanna hear that it's gonna get better or anything because it wont I have constant chest pain all day due to my costochondritis I get anxiety attacks because of my GAD and I obsess over my health every day due to my ocd even though I want to kill myself Im also scared of dying at the same time my mind is so fucked I'm pretty sure I'm an alcoholic aswell because I've been drinking pretty much 4 out 7 days a week alcohol makes me feel slightly better even as I'm writing this I'm slightly drunk I'm after 8 cans which is about 4 litres of alcohol within the space of 4 hours if my depression doesnt make me kill myself the alcohol will kill me  I just want a friend the main thing that is bothering me really is the fact I've never been with a girl sexually I don't  mean to sound like a fuckboy or anyhting but I just want to feel wanted and attractive this might be worded really badly and could be a load of shit seeing as I'm quite drunk but I just wanna vent somewhere and maybe get advice because I'm honestly scared of what I might do some day
