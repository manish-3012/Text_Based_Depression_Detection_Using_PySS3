So tired5 year relationship ended.

I know I will find someone again. I know time heals broken hearts. But knowing that the pain is going to end at some point is sometimes just not enough to get through the pain. What guarantee is there that the next guy will work out? What guarantee is there that I won't suffer this heartache over and over and over again? I am tired. I am scared. I am lonely. I just want it all to go away. I wish I could sleep forever and never wake up.
