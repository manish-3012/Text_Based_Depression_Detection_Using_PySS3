I won't stop until I'm dead.I can't get better living with my family. I'm too depressed to get another job on top of the one I have. I don't function. I daydream the whole day and sh to cope. I'm tired of being alive. I've been on almost every medication available for my mental illnesses and not a single one has worked long term. I'm tired of the hallucinations and the bad thoughts. Every second I'm awake I want to hurt myself. Even in my dreams I'm hurting myself and trying to die. Im too depressed to cope and I've tried to reach out for help , even with professionals, but they never pay attention. I'll try to talk to my counselor about it on Tuesday and see if I can get admitted to the local mental hospital to be assessed to see if I'm eligible to be put in the state mental hospital. If this doesn't work out my only option is to continue trying to kms until it works. Or I might kill myself tonight or during the weekend.
