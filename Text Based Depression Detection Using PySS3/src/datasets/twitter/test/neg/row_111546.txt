HurtingThese last few days have been really hard on me and I dont know if I can keep going. I'm either numb or crying. Like ugly crying. Nothing holds joy to me anymore. Not even my children. They once saved my life. But now I fear nothing can save me. Not even my ex husband. The man I love to deeply and want back so bad. I dont want anything else anymore but he wont take me back. He couldn't love me. No one can. I'm so lost and angry and sad. I feel like I have nothing left and that my world and life are over. Nothing can make me whole again. All I think about is death and killing myself. I tried to last night but was too scared too possibly wake up again. I dont want to wake up. I dont want to get out of bed or shower or eat anymore. My world is in black and white now, all the color has left my world. I dont want this anymore. I dont want to be strong anymore I just want to die. Please let me die
