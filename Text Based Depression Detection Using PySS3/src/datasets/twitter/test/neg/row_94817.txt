The best thing about ending your life is that you'll no longer be encumbered with the responsibilities and have them weigh you down.As it's the beginning of the month, I'm at my computer paying all my online bills, and I just see them all piling up, Student Loans, Electric, Internet, Gas, etc. And it's just too much for one person to deal with. But then if I end it, I'll no longer have to deal with all these bills and the like. It'll finally set me free from everything. 

But it just won't happen will it.
