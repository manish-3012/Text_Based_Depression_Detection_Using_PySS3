Hello friendSorry

Sorry to do this to you guys. Fact is, Iâ€™ve been in immense pain for years just living my life. Some highs, some lows, but every day, thereâ€™s just pain. And fear. Iâ€™m not a courageous person and I never have been. I always choose the easy way out and I guess thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve done here. 

I havenâ€™t felt like I really belonged anywhere in a long time, and my existence is meaningless without a tribe. I tried to start a family but I canâ€™t even do that right. I married a woman that has her own issues and all I did was bring mine into a marriage that shouldnâ€™t have happened in the first place. I knew before we tied the knot. Iâ€™m just a coward and couldnâ€™t say no to her. I never have been able to. I just wanted to fit in somewhere.

My brain is just not wired for this life. I give up, give in, or am just flat out beaten every day. Iâ€™m not a winner. Looking back, I never have been. And I canâ€™t lose anymore. I just canâ€™t.

At the end of the day, maybe Iâ€™d fight for my life if I thought it was worth it, but itâ€™s not. Sure, Iâ€™m good for a few hugs and maybe a few laughs but thatâ€™s really about it. No marketable skills and frankly Iâ€™m just too tired of fucking things up to start something else that Iâ€™m going to fuck up.

Look, if I thought I had something to offer you or the world, I would stick around. But I donâ€™t. I wonâ€™t stick around just to keep fucking things up and taking your time and money and love and attention because thatâ€™s really what Iâ€™ve done with my life. Taken. All Iâ€™m leaving you with is a vacuum of space time and I think thatâ€™s pretty fitting because I suck.

Heh, that was pretty good. Hope you got a kick out of this. I did, once.

Hope God gets you through this. He wasnâ€™t able to save me. And donâ€™t put this on yourself. You all have your lives to live. Itâ€™s no oneâ€™s fault but my own. 

Besides, Iâ€™m not around every day anyway so you wonâ€™t miss me too long. Youâ€™ll get over it. â€œLifeâ€ goes on with or with out us.

Okay. Iâ€™m done wasting time and oxygen. Iâ€™m going to sleep. Goodnight.
