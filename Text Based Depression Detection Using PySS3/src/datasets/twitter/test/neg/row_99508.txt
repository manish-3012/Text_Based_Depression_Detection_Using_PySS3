If the Bible thumpers are right...Then suicides go to hell. That is meant to scare people away from killing themselves... 

Problem is, for those who truly want to die, hell is no deterrent. See, hell has one perk that life cannot offer us, there is no hope. Hope is poisonous, hope is a cancer, hope is the surest way to damnation. If you end up on hell and know each day from here to worlds end will be filled with pain and sorrow, you at least have the comfort of knowing you will never face another day where you have some hope of it all getting better only to have that ripped from you once again. Those of you who arent suicidal will never understand how badly hope tears at the soul, or how it is the single greatest enemy you will ever know. You can't conquer hope, no matter how many times it is used against you, no matter how many times you think you have learned your lesson. Even at the end of it all, as the last vestiges of life ebb away from your empty shell, hope will rear its ugly head and leave you with some blind optimistic lie that there is something better waiting for you. Those in hell know no hope, there is only the beautiful honesty that everything will be pain and sorrow and there will not be a reprieve. I will embrace that truth gladly if it means I will never have to feel hope for something better.
