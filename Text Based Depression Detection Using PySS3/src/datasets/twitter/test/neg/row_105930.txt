Passive suicideI don't want to end my life but I keep hoping for it to end. I hope that I could slip in the shower and crack my head open or get hit by a car. This feeling just keeps growing and growing. It's taking control. Its like a car that's going of a cliff. I don't want to be the driver but I hope that it will drive off.
