jealousyHello everyone. I just had a question. Am I The only that gets angry and jealous whenever there is a fatal accident or that some dies from being in the wrong place at the wrong time wrong? And all you can think about is. I would have been me. I could have escaped, and there would be no suicide or blaming. I pray every night for a brain aneurysm. So I can die in my sleep.

Am I the only one who thinks like this?
