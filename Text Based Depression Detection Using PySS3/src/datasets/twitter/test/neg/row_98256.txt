I can't talk about this to the one person I want to talk to as he'll accuse me of being manipulativeYou ignored my last email asking if we could talk. I expected that, but I hoped you wouldn't. I know you read it, repeatedly. I didn't tell you what was really going on, or how bad things were, just that I wanted to apologise and I'd like to meet up when I'm in town next week. No answer. I wanted to tell you the truth, that I'd spent the last few days researching suicide methods and how to get what I needed for it and making plans. But I told myself to reach out to you first. Maybe if I could just apologise and get some closure I could try and get through this. 

It's funny. Your brother was the one I was in love with. He was the one who constantly called me manipulative. I don't know what I did to deserve that. He was the one who lied to get me to sleep with him, after I'd already told him repeatedly I was too drunk. He was the one who said he was single when he wasn't. I never even told his girlfriend, or threatened to, so it's not that. I never even told you, for fear you'd be disappointed in him. He was the one who got me fired and kicked out of my home, spread lies to my friends and even got my visa canceled so I got kicked out of the country. But that was fine, hes an ass, I knew that from the start. The one time you called me manipulative though hurt more than anything. I don't know what I did to make you think that. I never wanted anything, I never tried to get anything.

So now I can't talk to you. I've no doubt if you knew how bad things were you'd let me talk to you. That's all I want. Not to be friends again, I know that won't happen, just to talk and apologise and put everything to rest. But I can't tell you. Even if i did you'd just think I was saying it to manipulate you and not belive me. So instead of telling the truth and being upfront, I emailed you pretending things were fine, hoping that you'd talk to me. Ironic that I have to be manipulative to not look manipulative. People keep suggesting to ring you from a new number or just turn up on your doorstep, but I can't do that. I won't trick you into talking.

Fuck, Matt, I'm scared.
