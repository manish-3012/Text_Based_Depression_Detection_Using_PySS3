Today my brother told me that I looked like I was tired of living..I thought I was good at hiding it but each day my mind keeps getting more clouded and it gets harder to enjoy life.

Back when my dad got cancer I got into a big depression, yes I always had a mild depression but him getting cancer was something else. It led me to suicide attempts then to realizing that why should I die when I can live life and do whatever I want?

That thinking and the fact thay my dad got better made me happy for a few month's. But I think I'm relapsing... My mind is getting more and more clouded to the point where I have become very self destructive and simply don't care about living, I feel like there's no meaning in life but at the same time I don't want to die because what if there's nothing after life? What if I die and I become nothingness or  what if there's something and because I took my own life I will punish for it? I just want to stop time be in bed and do nothing for eternity. I don't want to think I don't want to do anything I just want to be alone for eternity.

The way I see things two things will happen I will end up ending it all for sure or just do nothing with my life and regretting it more as a I get older. This is why I want to go to my doctor and seek help.

I have been planning for months yet I don't go because I'm afraid, I'm old enough to go alone but I still fear my parents finding out, or my brother and they all looking at me like a crazy person or like a loser. Yes I am loser loner but they putting it on my face more because of the meds and probably therapy I would be given, sure makes me feel worse.

Sorry guys I wanted to vent out a bit, idk if this the right sub and I'll play more the thought of seeking help. I will most likely delete this post later.
