I feel I do not belong, that I am not meant to live.I am being emotional as I write this so please, bear with me. I have a massive anxiety problem. I just freak out over the littlest of things and I ruin the things around me. People want me to be a certain way, and there are certain traits in me which makes me unsuccessful and are bad but no matter how hard I try I cant change them. I think I was just born bad. I am not meant to be here, I am not meant to live. I disappoint everyone around me. I am bad at making choices and I push away the people who love me. They say that no one needs a needy person as an SO but I cant help but be needy. I feel odd. I am not autistic but I share many of their traits like how obsessed I get. I just want to be loved but when I do get love, the way I act pushes them away. I try so much to change but I cant. I feel it to be a part of me. I dont know anymore, I want to run away to the desert and stab myself so that no one ever finds me (I am in the middle east). Life is meant for the neurotypicals, why should I live?
