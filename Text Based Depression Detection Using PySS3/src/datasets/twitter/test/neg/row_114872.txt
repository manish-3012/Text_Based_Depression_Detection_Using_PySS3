Im my own problem.I feel like a lot of people in here were given a bad situation and lost all hope. I don't think i'm one of those people. All the problems I have feel self inflicted. The biggest issue in my life is me. I can't work, I can't maintain friendships, I can't find love, my parents were willing to put my past aside and think about now but I don't have the ability to do anything. I failed at school. I feel like a drainage on my parents. All they get from me is a hole in their wallets. I'm not helpful to anyone. If I can't work and my parents are gonna lose their jobs from personal lives getting in the way I don't wanna be here anymore. I don't want to be the person to ruin my parents lives and put my brother through hell. I just want my life to be over. I have no passion. I have no significant other. I have no friends and all I do is drag my parents down.  I don't want to fucking talk about it I want this bullshit to be over. Nothing anyone says helps the fact that i'm incapable of change. I give up. I'm not changing. I'm not in charge of my life and I never will be. My inability to act is why i'm in here in the first place. No one can save me. It's too late. My life is becoming a blur. Im heading down this road to quickly. I'm gonna put an end to this. I'm gonna make my parents lives a lot easier. Good bye.
