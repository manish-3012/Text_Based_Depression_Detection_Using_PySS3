I'm not really aliveI think my family would be devastated if I died but they can't fill the void that exists in me. I want friendship. I want a reason to wake up. I want to do something. Anything. Absolutely any fucking thing.

I have anxiety. Every time I get anxious I can't stop thinking that the only solution is to put a knife in my stomach. But I know, realistically, that won't help. But maybe if I twist it? Maybe I should pull it out. Try again. Keep going and going and going until I'm not anxious anymore. I probably won't be anything. 


I want to have friends. I want validation that they don't hate me, friends who ask me to hang out and talk to me once or twice a week. Just a "Hi" or even "How are you?"


I've got nothing but this feeling of being sick and this obsession to kill it and myself. How do you cope with that?
