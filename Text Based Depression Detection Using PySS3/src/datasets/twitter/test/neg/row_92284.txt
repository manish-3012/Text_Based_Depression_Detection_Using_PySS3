Working up the nerve is all that is left.I have sacrificed and given and helped others my entire life.  I have volunteered and mentored and taught.  I have pushed through and endured and hoped.  I have scraped by and hung on and tied a knot when I've been at the end of my rope.  I dug deep.  I've gone for years surviving on nothing but the knowledge of what my departure would do to others.  But I can't do this anymore.  At some point I will finally have the nerve to do what I have wanted to do since I was 10.  25 years plus I've felt this way, telling others in similar situations that it will get better, that they could get through it - all the while hoping that it would be true for me.  It never was.  I've been to the "professionals" but they can't do squat.  They have nothing for me.

Everything I have had I have used in what I thought was service to others.  That is what I lived for.  But now I'm empty.  I have nothing left.  I don't care anymore - I finally don't care about anything.  I've lost interest in everything - nothing that I used to like means anything to me anymore.  I watched it happen, but couldn't do anything about it.  I used to care and be concerned but I don't anymore.

And above all else, I hate myself.  I loathe the person in the mirror with a passion.  And why would somebody as worthless and sinister as that even deserve to ever feel better?  I can't say that others and the world will be better off without me - it is going to suck for some and I do have things I could contribute to the world but I just don't have it in me anymore.  This isn't about making things better for anybody else, this is about me finally getting relief.

The methods are quick, painless, effective, clean and guaranteed  The location, undecided - I have to find somewhere where I will never be found.  Once I find a place and how to get there (it will have to be on foot for the last several miles to avoid leaving a car that can be traced) I will finally be at rest.

Had to vent, get this out somehow.  Throwaway account, randomly generated password that I don't even know.  Won't be able to log back in if I wanted to so don't bother sending PMs.
