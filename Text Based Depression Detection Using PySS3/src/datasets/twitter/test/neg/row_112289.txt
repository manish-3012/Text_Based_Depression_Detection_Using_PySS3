All I can see are burnt bridges.I have to leave a lot out of this, as much of my family is on reddit and I wouldn't be posting this if I felt comfortable opening up to them. I am 19. I have been depressed for as long as I can remember. My first attempt at suicide was as a young child (elementary school). I have struggled with self harm and substance abuse since junior high going from periods of complete self destruction to times where it seems I can cope without it. I have tried to kill myself twice since the time when I was a kid, once leading to a stay in a crisis center and subsequent therapy. The therapy helped for a while. I had friends I could relate to, people who would answer my calls and tell me I was loved and I believed them. I have since pushed all of those people away. I was forced to move a year ago and for a time I lived with family. As the family I lived with didn't know about the extent of my depression they quickly became fed up with me and I chose to leave before they hated me. I was worse than usual when I lived with them because the move came shortly after a traumatic sexual experience, for which I was meant to get counseling, but never did. I now live with a man I don't love, but who seems to love me, or at least that's what he says. He was the only one willing to take me in when I left where I was staying. I am no longer in therapy and have no idea how to get help again. Both of my parents are deceased. I have no money and have burned most of my bridges. I am alone. The only escape I can think of is death, but I want so badly to find another way. Please help me.
