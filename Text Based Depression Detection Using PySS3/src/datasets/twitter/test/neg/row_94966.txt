I Have No Idea Why But I Am Super SuicidalI recently stopped smoking weed and right after my grades started slipping so much I have no motivation to do a my school work and tomorrow being 4/20 I really want to smoke again but I am on prohibition and I just really want to kill myself and want don't want to live anymore. My relationship with my parents is horrible and all they talk about is wanting me to get a job and if I don't they are threatening to move me away from all my friends. Im super stressed out and have started to just get fucked up on prescription drugs very very regularly. I am constantly thinking about if I am going to make it in life and be successful at all, I am constantly puking and losing a lot of weight so tell me reddit am I fucked in  life?
