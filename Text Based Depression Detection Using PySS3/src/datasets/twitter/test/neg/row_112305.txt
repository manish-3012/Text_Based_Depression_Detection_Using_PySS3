ventGoing to high school just made my life more worse, even though I donâ€™t care much about school anymore im still anxious about my grades and get disappointed in myself when I fail something. All my other friends are in honour roll which makes me feel even more terrible, it feels like I shouldnâ€™t be talking to them because theyâ€™re better than me. Iâ€™ve always felt like this even before high school started, iâ€™ve always felt like nothing I did even mattered because there are always people who do better than me even if i try or not in school and in other things, I know itâ€™s bad to be envious of other peoples successes but iâ€™ve grown up told I would do well in life which made me feel like this. 

I donâ€™t care much about my future anymore because I know iâ€™ll turn out a failure or be someone whoâ€™s just like everyone else. I donâ€™t want to keep living life knowing iâ€™m just going to work til iâ€™m 60 and die a few years after, itâ€™s a life that doesnâ€™t seem fulfilling. I plan on killing myself when once graduate but iâ€™m poor and canâ€™t afford a gun to finish it all, is there any other painless way I could do it? I heard insulin overdose is painless and I have access to it right now but another person said it was agonizing, what should I do? What other ways are there? Or is there a way to make things better? I just wanna stop this feeling but right now it seems death is the only option.
