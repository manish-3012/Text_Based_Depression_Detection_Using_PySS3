Tired of being the only one in my family losing my shit anymore.Everyone used to lose their shit at one thing or another in my family. But now that theyâ€™re past their problems with support outside of home, theyâ€™re doing better. Iâ€™m not. I have no friends and no support and the shitty thing is that this is all because Iâ€™m still suffering from a bad decision my parents made which changed my life for the worse. 

Hate how theyâ€™re all expecting me to be the only one to shove my face into the ground begging for forgiveness cuz of my victim mentality. I get it. I know I fucked up 1000000 times over. But I canâ€™t seem to fix everything that happened in my past, my fault or not. Nothing is worth working through all of this anymore. Iâ€™m tired. Convince me that itâ€™s possible to work through if you want.
