Once again thinking about ending it allI just don't get it. I'm getting treatment but I'm not getting better. New meds, therapy sessions. They won't stop my feelings from coming back. I've thought about dying many times this week especially today. I want out of this endless suffering. At this point dying is the only thing that would work.
