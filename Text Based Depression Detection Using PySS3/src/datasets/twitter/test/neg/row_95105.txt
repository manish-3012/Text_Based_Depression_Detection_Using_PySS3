Second try. So I posted a few months ago with how bad things have gotten. Well, its probably worse now. I just cut myself for the first time in a while and my mom found out about me wanting to build a stealth box for growing a few plants because to be honest the only time I can handle being alive is when I'm toking up with some freinds, and I know it's usually not okay to depend on a drug like that but it actually gives me hope. When I'm smoking I feel like maybe I can get through it and maybe the world isn't so fucked after all when I go on /r/trees. I can understand why she said no but to be honest that was the only thing keeping me going right now. The feeling of doing something for myself and enjoying the fruits of my labor just vanished 15 minutes ago. But truthfully, that's not important. The important part is I hate almost everything in my life. I hate my parents (not because my mom said no), I hate my sister, I hate summer, I hate school, I hate being fucking bored all the time and I fucking I hate my fucking socially conservative cunt of a therapist. I've become so cynical and I gave up a while ago and I've tried everything, including a mental hospital. I'm 15 and I just want to die, I lost all motivation to try anymore because when I try to help myself it just gets shot down. 

tl;dr: I dislike life.
