Found out I have a life-threatening health problem and I don't want to treat it.I don't want to get into specifics but the doctor basically told me if I don't do anything I'll likely die within 10 years or so.

I just started crying and walked out of the office. (In hindsight, I don't think that the doctor knew what the fuck to do with that reaction, and it's darkly funny.)

I think I was supposed to stay and like...talk about it? I literally don't know how I would be expected to do that.

Idk, man. I have panic attacks going in for checkups. I don't know how I would handle dealing with more than that. I've been suicidal (on and off) as long as I can remember. What does it matter if it's dragged out a little? Does it still count as suicide if you just don't fix something that's probably fixable?

I guess I just wanted this off my chest.
