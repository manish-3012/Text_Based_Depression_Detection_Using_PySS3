I was supposed to kill myself next week. I decided that five months ago. Iâ€™m not going through with it.Things are better but I donâ€™t know how to tell my dad and friends why Iâ€™m a mess this week. I just canâ€™t. But Iâ€™m falling apart. I had a plan. And stuff changed for the better and I got rid of the plan but I was drafting notes five months ago with next Friday as the date. I just feel really strange.
