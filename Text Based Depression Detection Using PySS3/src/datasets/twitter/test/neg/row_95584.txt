it ends tonighti know i post a lot here, but itâ€™s tonight that will happen. i have a plan, i just need to write a note. everything is set up. i feel bad because my friends are over (just two) but i know itâ€™ll be the better. i can spend my last hours with them. iâ€™ll be overdosing on my old sleep medication, which i have stash of. iâ€™ll never be happy with myself. ever. i hate myself. iâ€™ll never be a man iâ€™ll never be skinny, nothing. itâ€™s better off this way. iâ€™ll be gone in a bit. see you later reddit, thanks for helping me.
