MelancholicI'm sad and depressed in depth. I don't have a reason I don't know why do I feel this. It is hard to be alive, every day is becoming deeply monotonous. Everyday I wake up I just wait for the night to arrive so that I can sleep again. A feeling of negativity has started to arise lately as well. I feel like my existence cause negativity around, anyone who's happy around can feel negative talking to me. My emotions have mostly gone numb and I feel completely empty. Just wishing that I get enough courageous to end myself, what I fear is if my attempt fails and I am stuck in this body forever. 
That saddest part is that I envy happiness all around now. It makes me frustrated to see others happy. I might be sounding like a sadist but I don't wish bad for anyone, it's just that looking at them I feel highly envious if I can feel like them ever. And before one may suggest to do what interests me, or whatever that i find interesting, nothing at all drives me. Nothing at all! It's just all dull and sad and melancholic all the time. I never knew this would happen to me, but now that it is happening I've to carry myself every day convince myself that this day will pass too. But till when will I keep fooling myself. It sometimes just feels like these feelings of happiness and joy are just being pretended by everyone in their life. It feels like it's a mass lie being told out there. 
I don't understand what is happening, it's all just blank and empty
