Everyone thinks I'm so lucky, but I've already made plans to end it all.I'm 23, engaged, at university and I own my own home. It sounds so perfect but I've never been more miserable. 

The man I'm engaged to rarely shows me affection, argues with me almost daily, and makes me feel bad about myself. I feel stuck in the relationship because I do love him a lot and also because we own a house together. I can barely afford my monthly payments for the house with my minimum-wage part time job at mcdonalds and I'm left with hardly anything left over for food or bus fare. The house and the job are to make my masters degree possible, but even that is turning out to be a complete failure as my previous education has left me unprepared and inexperienced - I'm struggling with it so much and my confidence has hit rock bottom. 

I've already put plans in place to write my will, leaving my house to my fiance and then I will take my life. I feel like my future is very dim and I'll never escape financial struggle and stress. I have absolutely nothing to look forward to.
