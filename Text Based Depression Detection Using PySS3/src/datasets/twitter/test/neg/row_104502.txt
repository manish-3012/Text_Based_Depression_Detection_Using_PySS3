Death By CandyI have a severe allergy to peanuts, and I managed to get a hold of a few snickers bars. I think I'll eat them late tonight so nobody at home will hear my quiet gasps for air. 

I'm a trans female, but when I talked to my mom recently about transitioning, she said that my father would kick me out of the house premature and that she would kill herself as a result of that. Even tough she assures me they are accepting

I've had serious thoughts about cutting, and even thoughts of amputating my male parts by myself, but I've done neither.

My parents expectations are unrealistically high. And if I don't meet them, or do something that they don't like, they'll take away everything that helps me deal with anxiety, and telling them this is apparently "talking back".

All the friends that I have, I talked to someone much about my problems that I'm certain that they don't really care anymore. So I've stopped talking to them. And if they really did care, they would have checked on me over the past two weeks to make sure I haven't killed myself already.

I have no control over anything, not even my own body. I can't live up to the expectations set up for me. And nobody cares about me. I can't see any reasonable way out of this, only the one, permanent, peanut filled, way.
