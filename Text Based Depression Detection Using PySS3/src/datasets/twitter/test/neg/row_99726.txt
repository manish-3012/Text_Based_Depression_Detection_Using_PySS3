Recent relapse into depression (x-post from r/depression)I don't really know what I want out of this, maybe advice, words of encouragement, idk. but here goes nothing

Ever since I was 14 I have been battling depression, I didn't realize that I wasn't as happy as everyone else and that occasional suicidal thoughts were not normal until I was 17. About six months after an initial visit to a psychologist (when I found out that my mentality wasn't the norm) and convincing myself that I was fine and didn't need help, my significant other of 2 years left me. It sent me into a downward spiral and into feeling isolated and lonely and led to a suicide attempt. I was taken to a hospital and prescribed antidepressants. After that everything started to get much better, I began regularly seeing a therapist and taking my meds until I felt stable and that my therapist wasn't helping anymore. I continued taking meds but no longer saw my psychologist and I met a new girlfriend. That was about 2 years ago.

The new girlfriend and I fell very deeply for each other, both of us thinking we could make it the long run, marriage and family and all. Everything was fantastic for our first year, but then I began to sabotage our relationship. I would pick fights over insignificant things, begin to try to control way too many aspects of her life, I even got violent with her once. I didn't understand what was happening. This cycle of me getting upset over tiny things, her apologizing, and us having one or two days of peace before I found something else to be mad at continued for about a month or two.

This last week however, she called me after work and she told me that she wanted to end things. To me it was sudden, we were talking about living together and how exciting that was two days prior. But in the grand scheme of things I could see where she was coming from, we were fighting a lot. That night I convinced her to have it just be a break until this Thursday. It was obvious that I was really hurting her.

Since then it has been a huge wake up call for me and I have been doing a lot of introspective thinking. And I came to realization of me sabotaging everything and always blaming her for making me upset. This has sent me into a horrible downward spiral. I don't think I've ever been this depressed. I called a new therapist to set up an appointment for next week, but it's finals week for me (Junior in college) and I cant focus, or study. Time is going by incredibly slowly.

I don't know what to do. I want to be with her so badly, she was my best friend, (blah blah blah classic I loved her thing), but at the same time I can't stop thinking that she deserves better, or that she left me because of someone else, etc. I'm going down a really dark path again, I started having suicidal thoughts and I began cutting myself again, this time worse than ever. I just feel so lost and pathetic for not even being able to make it a week without her before falling to pieces.

For the sake of this long ass post, I'll stop it there
