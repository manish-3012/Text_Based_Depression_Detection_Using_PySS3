Sonder"Killing oneself is, anyway, a misnomer. We don't kill ourselves. We are simply defeated by the long, hard struggle to stay alive. When somebody dies after a long illness, people are apt to say, with a note of approval, "He fought so hard." And they are inclined to think, about a suicide, that no fight was involved, that somebody simply gave up. This is quite wrong.â€ â€• Sally Brampton The constant ringing in my ears may very well drive me insane, or they may dull out the sounds from the outside world. At this moment I am pitched in the hardest combat I have experienced, looking for a reason to live. I write this in the dark while my wife sleeps for I cannot bear to share these thoughts with her just to receive her empty platitudes. For years I have struggled with the coursing memories of combat in Afghanistan; the lives lost, the dark days, and the exhilarating adrenaline of being pitted against an adversary. Now four years after the last day I saw war, it weighs heavy on my mind. It is a burden that I wish to put down yet I am unable to. This situation is not made any better by a spouse, though well meaning is utterly ignorant to the pain I deal with. My situation is exacerbated by her dismissal of my needs, physical and emotional. This disconnect that she fails to see. My problems are minute in her mind compared to her years of drug abuse and shitty relationships. I have been lucky to her to still be alive; I resent the statement with seething rage. It has driven me to contemplate suicide more often. I now more than ever want to just end it all. I don't feel angry at her for it, I actually feel relief at the thought of eating a bullet. The only thing that I have found that seems to quell the desire to exit this life is drowning in music and they high of abusing my medication. Something will have to change for it can not be a long term solution. I fight on for another day hoping to find respite in the sunrise of tomorrow.
