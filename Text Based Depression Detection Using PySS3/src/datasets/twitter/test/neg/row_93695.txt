I really don't know what to do anymoreI feel like I've lost myself completely. I guess I've become an empty shell of what I once was. I have no one to go to. Therapy isn't helping. It did, but everyday I've had a breakdown. I'm losing it. I have no motivation to do anything. I'm going to school, but I'm not trying at all. I fake it. I hide it from the people around me. My closest/only friend has no idea how I feel and that everyday I want to just leave this shitty place. I'm so close to just ending everything. Even though I'm probably going to regret posting this, I need to let this out right now before I do something worse. I push myself from everyone and isolate myself because I don't feel I'm worth it. No one should listen to me or even care, not even the internet. I want help, but I feel I'm a lost cause.
