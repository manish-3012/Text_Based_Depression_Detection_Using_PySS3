Will therapy help me(M20) improve my social skillsI tried everything but canâ€™t change how people perceive me I donâ€™t want attention but today heard my mom saying what went wrong raising me and Iâ€™m non existent for every one of our relatives. Anyone who spends time with me says Iâ€™m chutiya ( stupid in Hindi ).I have grown a Velcro image I donâ€™t know how to get over this image people perceive me and everything related to me as stupid 

What should I do I literally want to die 
Iâ€™m sick of this whole thing
