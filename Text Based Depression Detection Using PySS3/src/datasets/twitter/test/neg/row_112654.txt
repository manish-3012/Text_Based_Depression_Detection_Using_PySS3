Gratitude to people on this subredditHey everyone, I know this isn't life threatening, but I just browsed an looked and was mind blown by the dedication and thoughtful replies you have put on peoples post. Its really heart warming to see individuals who come on here as a last resort and receive thoughtful, concerned replies back. Its really awesome all of you. 
For those still fighting to find value to your life, I promise you there is a purpose. 
I personally am depressed with a lot of truama and distress, some days I feel like giving up and have done self harm.. But a few days after I get upset and think how silly i was for disrespecting my life. 
Regardless, thank you everyone who takes the time to look at peoples posts who are in need of help, and even replying to them. 
That makes you all a serious hero.

Edit: Thank you so much for gold, you didn't have to, but much appreciated!
