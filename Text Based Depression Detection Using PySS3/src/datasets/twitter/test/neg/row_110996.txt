I want to get it over withI'm so tired of this. I'm tired of being alive and caring too much about other people to kill myself. I just want to die. Can somebody just kill me so I don't have to? I can't even talk to my family anymore without upsetting someone and hating myself for fucking up again. I'm so sick of ruining things and I'm sick of not having anyone and I hate the sound of that because it's so selfish of me to want to have someone to dump all of my problems on. But I can't carry this weight anymore. I can't. If I could wish for anything I would wish to die without anyone being upset. The simple answer would be to wish for happiness, right? I don't think so. I don't believe true happiness exists. How can someone be happy about being alive when the world is so horrible and it's impossible to feel anything but pain and sadness? I don't get it. Are there really people out there that are happy? People that want to be alive? How?
