BDD and how it's made me suicidalI'm 17 and know that I have a serious condition, while also being terrified to death to seek help for it. I have dwelled on my appearance in numerous ways, ranging from obsessing over my weight (or rather the lack thereof), my height, my face, and honestly anything possible to feel self conscious about. I'm a master at escapism and have resorted to using recreational drugs (weed) to keep myself from facing the truth. I dropped out of high school and took up independent study during the last semester of my senior year, then promptly lost communication with every single person from school to avoid the truth of the situation. My friends before didn't know anything about me and were the type of people who made fun of those like me. It's possible that my parents fostered this condition with a mix of child neglect and by harboring such an out-of-touch sense of reality that it was only inevitable that something would be wrong with me. For reference, they are conspiracy theoriests who have both thought that the apocalypse was eminent (on multiple occasions), and have even resorted to pulling me and my younger sibling out of school during the school year to have a "last week" together. This was last September. 

I harbor a much different sense of reality - one even darker than theirs. One where I slowly fade out of everyone's minds into irrelevancy, and ultimately die an unfulfilling life of mediocrity and agonizing regret. I can't face the fact that I also attributed to the situation i'm in, and would prefer not to bog down this post with details but I can say that thanks to my Body dismorphia, I have officially developed what I can only describe as an abject fear of social situations. I am the absolute master at escapism and use it to escape the mess that is my life. I've always said that I was born into the wrong family, and I'm slowly seeing myself start to become the very thing I promised to never become - my parents. And I will die before I let that happen.
