Iâ€™m seeing my therapist today. She doesnâ€™t know I feel this way. Iâ€™m scared to tell herI have made a couple posts on here asking for help and to try and resolve why I feel this way, I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety and stress issues and also had a autism diagnosis when I was younger.

I have been suicidal and badly depressed for a couple years now. I have made plans on how to kill myself and recently bought a gun to do so, I have tried hinting to my parents I feel this way but my dads sole response was people who feel this way should â€œjust get over itâ€.

He had no sympathy or advice what do ever, That night I went to my room and put the gun to my head but passed out before I could finally decide whether or not to do it.

That same night I made a post on here asking what to do and a lot of you guys and girls told me I should tell my therapist. I have came to the conclusion I would and still know itâ€™s in my best interests to do so, In 2 and a half hours i have my first face to face session since corona and Iâ€™m starting to get really nervous about telling her.

I donâ€™t see her that often so I know now is the chance but my anxiety and stress is kicking in really badly thinking about what to say. 

Iâ€™m worried, My anxiety is making me shake right now.
I really just want to tell her but it seems like thereâ€™s a mental block.

Please just give me some advice on how to overcome this please ðŸ™ðŸ¼
