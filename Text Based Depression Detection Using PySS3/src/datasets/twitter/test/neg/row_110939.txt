I know I have some mental health issues, but I don't know how to go about dealing with them.Hello, I've been quite aware for some time now that I likely have some of the same depressive/anxious tendencies as both of my parents.

I often find myself thinking about buying a gun and putting it to my head or paying for the equipment necessary to induce a carbon-monoxide poison-type situation.  This has probably been going on for a few years (since I was about 15.  I'm 19 now).

Along side of the suicidal thoughts, I cry uncontrollably for long periods of time, I lose sleep over thoughts of self-loathing and disgust, I often feel that every single person I have ever met secretly wants me to die, I picture myself being absorbed by my sheets and violently strangled, I have huge spikes of anxiety whenever I feel worried about certain issues, and I'm sure I could list a few more if I was feeling more focused.

For a while, I felt I had control of my issues.  I would have relatively large spikes of these and other varied feelings about once a month, but I was generally capable of making it to school and being ok for the public eye.  I never wanted to talk to my mom about it because I don't feel that that would be good for our relationship.  (I often have to be the happy one due to her hindering depressive qualities.)

I'm going into my second year of college and am with a girlfriend of 2 and a half years.  She is the only one that knows about my issues but doesn't seem to quite grasp the severity.   She knows I'm depressed (or whatever it is) but does not know that I often consider killing myself.  I would not feel comfortable telling her that I feel this way often.

Anyway, I only recently felt that my issues have been getting out-of-control.  I'm worried that it's going to ruin my relationship (which is really the only thing that I am genuinely happy about in my life) and eventually my life.  

I only have two friends that I ever hang out with and one of them is moving away.  I talk to the other one once every few months.  I do have a very good online friend with a lot of similarities, but I don't know that I'll be able to rely on him forever.  If my relationship ends (and I would obviously never tell my girlfriend this) I feel like I would take the suicide thing far more seriously.

I think the relationship might end because of my over-bearing personality and serious trust issues.

I have a tendency to a bit smother-y and jealous, but it stays within a controllable and relatively reasonable level unless I am also feeling my depressive and anxious symptoms.  She is the nicest and most trust-worthy girl alive, but despite the reality, my brain often fucks me over and produces an illusion in which my girlfriend (and every girl I might trust, for that matter) is a cheating and lying back-stabber.  

I can convince myself that all of this is just me being stupid when I have the willpower saved up from a good day, but when I get taken down by my emotions, it's a practical impossibility to pull myself back up without spiraling down deeper.

I know this is rambly, but writing it all out is making me feel better.

My main question is this:  I know I need help.  And professional help at that.  But, being under my mom's insurance and not being very well-versed in the issues of health-care and the coverage provided for therapy and the like, how could I go about getting the help I need?  I have no money because I work at a toy store and commute from home to go to school.  So, what should I do?


**tl;dr**  Live with ma who is also depressed and would be worse off if she knew about my issues.  I am under her insurance and have no money.  How would I go about getting help?  (Be that a prescription or just someone to talk to)

I posted this to suicide watch because I *do* feel that suicide will be imminent if I don't change the way things are.
