I know this doesn't seem bad, but I'm suicidal about 10k of college debt for my freshman yearextremely depressed introvert loner here. I made a bad decision and now I'm 10k in the hole and my family keeps making fun of me about it , I cant stop thinking about it , it debilitating because I'm going to have to pay it back,  how can I get over this , I know some people study useless majors and end in debt but I just cant seem to get over this.
