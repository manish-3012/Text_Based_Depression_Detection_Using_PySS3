Lord God please end me.Iâ€™m a worthless drunk and I deserve to die. Lord god if youâ€™re listening please end my life. Iâ€™m a coward and I just want it all to end. Please please oh god just kill me. I live in hell and I just want it to end. No one loves me and I donâ€™t know how to talk to people. Iâ€™m scared but I want to die. Please lord, have mercy and kill me.
