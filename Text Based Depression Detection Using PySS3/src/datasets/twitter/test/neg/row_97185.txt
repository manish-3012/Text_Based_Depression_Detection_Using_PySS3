friends.I just don't know anymore. I've been depressed for 12-13 years, and it's only worsened the past few. I keep thinking that maybe I just need to open up to people about how I feel, but all I've found is that nobody really seems to give a shit. Even if I tell people I'm considering ending it all, or that it's been a thought on my mind for half my current lifetime, nobody really seems to put any effort into trying to help or have a conversation about it, ask what is causing it, what depresses me, if there's anything anyone can do to help, etc. I just don't get why I even try anymore when I know I'm going to be met with a bullshit response/selfishness.

Every time I find myself trying and receiving these bs responses, I can't help but assume they don't care a single bit, and if they do, and they're holding something back, something they want to do or say, I can't help but wanting to kill myself that much more. Maybe because I feel like nothing else will feel better, maybe I'm trying to prove a point to these people who pretend to care but won't even do that much when I express that's what I need. Fuck, even I don't know what I need anymore, talking doesn't help.
