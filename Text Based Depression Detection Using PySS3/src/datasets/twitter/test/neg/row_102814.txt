I donâ€™t know how to continue...Today I took 10/12 painkillers hoping to numb the pain. I canâ€™t cope anymore.

I feel so lonely, empty and lost.

Nobody cares, nobody wants to know, I will always be second best to everybody. My boyfriend doesnâ€™t care, my family doesnâ€™t care. Iâ€™m nobody and nothing.

How could a person be this unlovable? Why am I hated so much?

Help me
