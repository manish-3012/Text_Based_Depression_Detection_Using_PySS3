read if you could be bothered toI'm 14, male and currently in Year 9. I come from a wealthy family, and life seems to be perfect, at least from the eyes of a stranger, but it really isn't. My mum and dad are both really successful, and I guess that's how it all started.
I saw my dad only three or four times a month up until I was 7. Still don't really feel that connected to him. My mum has always been working late and I rarely saw her too apart from on weekends. What I remember is she had always been pressuring me, making me read and revise and all that stuff. I was really fragile as a kid but I guess they didn't care. Most of the time I lived with my grandparents, who are the traditional Chinese type. They beat me a lot and made me study hard and so on. When I was in school up to like Year 7, I was bullied a lot. Like A LOT. I was beaten and verbally abused on a daily basis. I thought things were going to change when I went to study abroad, but it didn't. You see, I don't know where it all started, but I remember in Year 6 when I was crying and told my grandma I wanted to kill myself. Luckily, I didn't, and I've constantly been suffering from depression, severe social anxiety, and stress disorders since then, or at least that's what all my school psychologists and counsellors told me. 
Now that I study far away from home, it's been getting worse. I don't really feel close to my family and friends anymore and people there make me feel like shit sometimes. I cry a lot, mostly on weekends when I'm alone in my boarding house and nobody is there to see and hear it. 
This is my first long holiday. Ten weeks, all with 3 days of holiday school per week, 2 days of sports classes and even more random academic shit. Ever since I got home, I realise why I wanted to go study abroad at first. My mum and dad. My dad has booked 12 hours of golf lessons a week for the entire duration of my "vacation". My grandparents are surprisingly quite supportive and caring... so are all the other relatives I have, but my parents...

We've had many arguments especially in the past week. Today my mum said something along the lines of "why wouldn't you ever do anything for me", "why are you so ungrateful", "is it so hard just to do something for your mother". And bear in mind this was in a conversation regarding my haircut. 

My mum has called me stupid and dumb many times, although I'm normally like near the top of the whole year.

Arguments are starting to get more trivial and happen more often, and I have no clue why

I try to hang out with friends more to avoid my mum, but to no avail

She still constantly verbally abuses me, comparing me to other kids and all this time claiming she did nothing wrong and isn't pressuring me in any way...

All this time my mum has made me feel like shit, and my dad too and I think it's time to just end it all.
