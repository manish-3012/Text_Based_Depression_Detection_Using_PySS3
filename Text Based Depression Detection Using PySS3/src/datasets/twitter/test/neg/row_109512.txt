I have absolutely no direction, no aspiration, no assets at all for the future. Just immeasurable existential dread that I can't cope with anymore.I've never had it this intensely. I'm about to graduate high school with no scholarships, no colleges in mind, no career paths in mind and my family doesn't have much money. I don't have anything at all to do or anywhere to go but the world doesn't care. I'm just fucked, I guess. The dead pay no rent. The dead need no degrees. The dead need no jobs. The dead feel no concern for the unrelenting buffets of life. Truly the dead are much more free than the living in any sense of the word.
