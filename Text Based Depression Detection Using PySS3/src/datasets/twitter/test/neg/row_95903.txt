Thinking of rescinding my promise.A couple of months ago I promised myself that I would live at least until May 23rd, but am having second thoughts. I bought tickets to a concert that night which I really wanted to see before I died, but at this point, its losing its luster. Basing my existence off of one event is a poor decision anyways, since im bound to be dissapointed by it anyways with that much pressure. That's two months away. I don't think I can handle this for that long, especially since each day is getting worse than the last. I should just accept that its not worth the trouble.
