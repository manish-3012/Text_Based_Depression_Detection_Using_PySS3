Reached the endI want to be dead. I have found that I've simply given up. I honestly don't care about anything, and I hate everything about myself and I just don't want to wake up in the morning. This would probably shock most people that know me, but I can't take life much longer. I'm dying on the inside.

I'm 24 in a month, all I can hear and think about is what a failure I am as I didn't finish college, and I left to pursue music, and live with my parents. I don't even know what I want out of life anymore and I'm tired of searching and being a burden on my family. Every girl I've been interested in has lead me on, or left me. I just feel unaccomplished and apathetic and I want to stop livng altogether.
