Dead man walking on the green mile.I wrote this 3 months ago in another suicide reddit that got shut down for some reason. I found this note somewhere and it is true today as then. Feel free to mock me, I'm not holding on anymore. 

Iâ€™m committing suicide. Theres no way around it, theres no talking me down. I almost killed myself 10 years ago while going to some bullshit college. I regret living, I regret that I didnâ€™t just kill myself. I see the, â€œyour life will improveâ€™â€™ bullshit that people say, and its only gotten worse. If I had died then, my family would be 10 years closer to healing, they would say, â€œhe had so much to live for.â€ Now, seeing me broken and collapsing, I think it would be a relief that Iâ€™m not suffering. Theres no, â€œhe had so much potential.â€ They can see Iâ€™m just a waste, and theyâ€™d mourn, but I wish I hadnâ€™t been so selfish to stay alive. 
I came back from an overrated music school knowing Iâ€™d never be successful or famous. Broken completely. I donâ€™t even play music anymore because its not what it used to be. I spent 12 years playing an instrument, half my life at that point and it meant nothing. Iâ€™m not even going to connect the dots here, Iâ€™m just going to tell you: After years of working shitty retail jobs, I decided to join the military, I was going to go Special Forces (not saying which one). I trained like crazy and I was good at it and I had hope, I was scared but I had direction. I used my music training to help me prepare, spending years working on your weaknesses was something that I specialized in. 
And I got injured, badly. Iâ€™ve had a terrible leg injury for 4 years. It hasnâ€™t healed. It might not ever. Physical therapy has barely helped. This injury cost me the opportunity of a lifetime, a job I could do, that I believed in. Iâ€™m not even good enough to die in combat. 
Instead, Iâ€™ve been exiled to work shitty minimum wage jobs, some retail, while being in excruciating pain. I almost killed myself working at a truck stop job where I was on my feet, (even though I told those idiots I couldnâ€™t stand and had to have a sitting job). I was going to jump under the back wheels of a truck to end it. I should have, I think back and wish I had killed myself when it would have been easier. That was the same week that Robin Williams killed himself, and I was going to call the suicide hotline, but I didnâ€™t want to bother them, I didnâ€™t want to distract them from saving someone who was worth something. 
I quit after a week, and did even more damage to my legs. My mom convinced me to go back to school, which has been an absolute struggle. Iâ€™m a semester away from getting an associates degree (a fucking useless degree), and I canâ€™t pass the math class. I struggled insanely through the first one, and this second course, (on the second day) Iâ€™m absolutely lost. Theyâ€™re the basic math classes, nothing advanced. Iâ€™ve worked harder at school now than I did with music, (which I loved) and SF training (which I loved) and its been for useless college bullshit. I fucking despise school and I have to go other wise its poverty. Iâ€™m physically limited now, and I donâ€™t want to do a trade, nor can I physically. 
I'm 32. I never pictured my life being like this, being this terrible. I worked harder than my friends and have nothing to show for it. I see them with careers they like and familiesâ€¦ They played it safe, and they came out doing really well. My dreams died, and I regret not dying alongside them. Its just obvious. I donâ€™t belong here, I never did. There was no possibility of me carving out a future for myself, this was always going to happen. 
Iâ€™m in so much pain, Iâ€™m just planning on slitting my throat. If I do 15 jumping jacks, my feet will be throbbing and I promise you I wonâ€™t feel my neck open. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself is because Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll botch it and live, and be unable to kill myself again. 


3 months later, tonight. Probably going to kill myself over the next couple of days. I donâ€™t know how many second chances I need before I get the hint that I need to die. I keep trying to carry on and shit, and its all been for nothing. You can call me worthless or whatever, I agree with you, my best days are over and I will never see happiness.
