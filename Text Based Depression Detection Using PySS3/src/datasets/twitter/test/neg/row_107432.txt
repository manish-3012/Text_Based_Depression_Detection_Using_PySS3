I want to die and I don't really know whyI look at people on here and I feel like they're reasons for wanting to die are more 'valid' than mine. I went through a really suicidal period of my life recently where I had multiple attempts, but then the past 3 months have been going really well. Today I feel myself wanting to go back on those bad pro-suicide websites and wanting to withdraw more from my friends so it hurts less when I die. I don't really understand why I'm on this Earth and why I want to leave here so bad. Maybe my calling is elsewhere.
