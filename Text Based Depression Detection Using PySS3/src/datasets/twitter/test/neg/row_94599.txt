Canâ€™t do this anymoreI want to die. I have no hope for the future and I canâ€™t see myself getting better. I want to end my life but I donâ€™t want to fail and be still alive and probably in a worse off position. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I canâ€™t tell my friends and family about this because I donâ€™t want to hurt them. I just want this all to end.
