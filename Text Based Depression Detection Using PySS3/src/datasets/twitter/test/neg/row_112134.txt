I was doing fine but then everything fell apartSo, for someone with depression, anxiety and panic syndrome, I was doing reasonably well, I was able to go out and do something, even if I had no company. But today everything broke down.

Me and some brethren of mine are planning a stage play on my local church, and today was our first practice run, and turns out Iâ€™m not as talented as I thought I was. They criticized me, but in a friendly manner, and I was able to get a lot better by the end of the run, but still, being criticized, even if itâ€™s necessary for it to turn out actually good, made me feel terrible, like I wasnâ€™t good enough.

To make matters worse, when I got home, I watched porn to try to â€œrelieve the stressâ€, breaking my No Porn No Fap streak, I felt fucking awful.

Right now I doubt I can be of use for anything. I laid in my bed for hours just wanting to time to pass by, or to sleep and never wake up again. I CANâ€™T believe that things will get better. I just want it all to end.
