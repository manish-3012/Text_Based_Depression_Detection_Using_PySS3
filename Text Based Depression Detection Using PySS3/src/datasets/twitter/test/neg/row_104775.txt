Skinny LoveI'm a reddit haunter, but I think it's time to come out of the shadows.
Some background: I'm 23, female, currently in a relationship, and attending Community College. Can't seem to move out of parent's house or move onto a better college.

I've slowly been disassociating myself from everyone I know. Not intentionally, but I guess it's a symptom of the "disease".  I've lost interest in everything I used to love, and now I can barely take care of myself. Everyone seems to busy to notice something is wrong, or just wants to ignore it. They expect me to carry on like there's nothing wrong, yet I'm struggling just to wake up in the morning.

I sit in the shower, just staring at the designs the water makes as it swirls. A couple weeks ago I decided to fill the bathtub to the brim and drown myself. I went under the water for a long time. I could feel my chest heaving for air, but I felt determined. I don't truly remember what happened. but I resurfaced, dried off, and contacted the Crisis Text Line. 

I've only told two people of this incident, each of which have never spoken of it again. 

I hate burdening people with my problems, so I've been pretending to these two people that everything has been fine after. But.. it hasnt been.

I don't know what else to do.
