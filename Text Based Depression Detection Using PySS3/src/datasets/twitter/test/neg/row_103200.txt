Not really sure where to go from hereHi I'm just throwing my thoughts out here so I can hopefully process.

My girlfriend/fiancee of nearly 4 years wants to break up entirely because of me.
I took on a school I can't really afford, and she was willing to help me out paying for it, but I'm costing her too much, I don't drive, so Ubers cost her too much as well. I was supposed to find a job while going to school to help her out, but with no success in callbacks really killed what little motivation I had. 
Long story short she's fallen out of love with me for that and without her I can't process or find any reason to keep going. And I can't stop thinking of taking my life, not because of her directly, but I just can't do this without her
