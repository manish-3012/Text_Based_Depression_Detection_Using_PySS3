I'm drowning. I need to do it.Everything in my life just feels like it is imploding right now. I am getting closer and closer to going through with my plan every day - but tonight I got some news - and now it is all just too much. I really really really want to go and do it. The only thing stopping me is the pain that it would cause the very few people who do actually care, but I know they would get over it soon enough. I feel like I am close to doing my impulsive plan instead of my thoroughly planned out one and my preferred method just because I am so desperate to be dead already. I feel like I'm suffocating - drowning - and every single day the bag is getting tighter, and I am sinking deeper.
