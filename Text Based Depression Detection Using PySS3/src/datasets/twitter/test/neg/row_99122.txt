I wrote a noteI have it right next to me. I sent a typed out copy to a friend. 

I'm not even sure what brought this on tonight. I don't even know if I'm going to die yet. I just wanted to get a note written and ready.

Since my last post in here earlier today I took my parents out for breakfast and it was kind of nice. I came home and just felt worse than before for some reason. I really can't even explain this anymore. 

In a way it's the inverse of what many people think. "What am I doing with my life?" I'm sitting here thinking "what am I doing with my death?". I'm handling it so poorly and jagged. Why get the note ready so proactively? I don't even understand it myself. 

Although in an odd way it made me feel better. Does any of this even make sense? Likely not. I suppose I'm just rambling on again.

Sometimes I feel like I care too much about people. I give them everything I possibly can, usually regardless of who it is. Sometimes I feel like I don't have any pieces of myself left. I just give them all to other people. But I love others so much. I'm just a fucking mixed up person.

Thank you for reading. Sorry for taking up your time for this nonsensical garbage, though.
