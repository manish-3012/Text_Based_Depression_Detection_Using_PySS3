Feeling despair and hopelessness, making plans that I shouldn't keepI'll just start off with I'm bipolar type 1, and yes I know I won't feel this way forever and I know all those stupid platitudes people throw at you but I really just feel like I'm at the end of my rope. 

When I was little and crying myself to sleep, I would tell myself I couldn't kill myself because I would go to hell.

Shortly after, when I realized I didn't believe in god, much less hell, I made a new reason, because it would devastate my grandparents. 

My grandparents are still alive thankfully, and as much as I love my friends and family, as supportive as they are, it doesn't change how I feel more nights than not, crying into my pillow and googling suicide for ideas. 

I never had a concrete plan before it was always ideation, but at this point I'm just not sure how much of an ability I have anymore to cope. The idea of it follows me everywhere, everyday. 

I've been on medications, I've been trying to work on it this past year since I've gotten diagnosed and I feel like we are no where closer to alleviating my issues. 

I feel like all my goals and plans in life are just things I have to do, I feel no passion. All of my hobbies have evaporated. And it feels like anytime anyone in my support checks on me, its just to make sure I am taking my meds correctly, which I do for the most part (absent mindedness is apparently a bad thing when you are on meds) I've only missed like a morning dose or something. 

I try to tell them how I feel, and I get platitudes in return. I just feel like no matter how hard I try no one in my life seems to understand that it isn't a matter of just take some medicine and you're fixed up. I wish it was that easy. 

I just wish there was something that would make it possible for me to not feel this way. The idea of living life and building one just doesn't sound like a future I want. I'm really not sure what I want anymore except to not exist.

And I think, if I can just get through finals, then I will kill myself. I keep trying to find ways to postpone it so I might feel better or change my mind maybe because I don't want to fail at it again.  Not really sure why I'm even posting this tbh. 

I love my family, I love my friends, and I love myself as best I can but I don't know what that means for me besides the fact I shouldn't feel this way. 

I am just beyond caring about life and the future and what kind of life I could lead. I just don't care I just don't think it is worth it anymore. I can't sleep, barely eat, and the only thing I can manage right now is getting my work done. Then I will need to get a job, which I use to be excited about working finally but at this point I just feel like it is a waste.

My doctor has been unhelpful so far, and I see all these things about what people are prescribed that are bipolar and I think maybe I just need something different at a higher dose or something. Seems like every doctor I have gone to basically tried to push me out as fast as I come in because I don't act crazy, I just feel crazy. 

I think going back to a psychiatric hospital would help but honestly I've been twice and it was a pretty awful experience because the doctors were pretty much like you have an education and things going for you therefore you shouldn't need to be here. Making comments like just think about all the good things in your life and get over it (grade A that was).

I won't call a hotline cause I have no fucking doubt I would get put in a hospital against my will and frankly, I'm sick of costing my parents money. I'm sure they would argue it is a worthwhile investment in me staying alive but I just don't see the point.

I'm only 25, but I also know that I've been holding on that whole time hoping something would change. Somehow I don't think time is going to change the fact that I want to die. So far, it has seemed to make it more and more of a wish. I can't even sleep anymore without dying in my dreams.

If you read this far thanks, sorry to be so negative but it is what it is. I don't know what I'm hoping for out of this.
