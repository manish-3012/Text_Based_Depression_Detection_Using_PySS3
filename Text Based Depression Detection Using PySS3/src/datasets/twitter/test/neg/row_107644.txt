Struggling right nowHey, 

I just wanted to post here so I could maybe break out of this insanely hard panic attack that Iâ€™ve got right now.

I donâ€™t really have anything else to say except that I canâ€™t get the thought of taking paracetamol overdose and jumping under subway right now. 

I feel like Iâ€™m terrible for even thinking like that, but it feels the easiest way for me. Itâ€™s just that I donâ€™t want anyone to get any traumas, which would make me feel even worse.

Sorry, wanted to just vent a bit, taking this post down when Iâ€™ve hopefully calmed down.
