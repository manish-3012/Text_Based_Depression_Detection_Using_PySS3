34 feet wasn't enough. 700 feet should do it.I wish it had worked, it would have looked like an accident and everyone would have been better off. It's 10 years later and I haven't accomplished a single thing. Literally nothing. I'm tired of people telling me about all the amazing things I could do if I just did *this one simple thing that literally the dumbest person in the world already knows*. 

Anyways I'll probably just do it tonight, I kind of like the idea of dying on black friday, although I'll probably have to wait a bit later for logistical reasons. The simple fact is that I gave life a shot, and it just isn't going to work for me, and no amount of telling me about all the amazing things that I've never been able to even come remotely close to experiencing is going to keep me here.
