What makes life worth living?Hi everyone,

After thinking about it for a bit, I've come to the conclusion that I have literally nothing to live for. The prospect of living my whole life without doing anything that I'm passionate about, or anything of real value, is much more terrifying than just offing myself. I don't even have any real problems, but there's barely anything that makes me even remotely happy nowadays. I know that I can be happy, because I was for most of my life. But nowadays, I just don't have the will to keep on going. I didn't go through a tough breakup, or lose a family member, or anything like that, it just came out of nowhere. Why should I keep on living if it's so much easier not to? 

(sorry for the rant-y-ness of this post)
