If no one can reach their hand out to help me out of this dark hole by tonight, I'm ending it all.I've been crying out for help, to ANYONE I possibly can for the past few months. And every. single. time. It has been swatted away. I'm convinced I wasn't meant to fucking be here. I get told and reminded of how shitty of a person I am. Even my ex, who I believed I was gonna have a future with just a month ago, doesn't care whether I am here or not. And sadly I'm still in love with her. hearing that from this girl I love with all of my fucking heart, I am an empty fucking shell. I have this bottle of pills that I've been looking at, for the past few weeks, every single fucking night as I'm sitting there, alone in my room, wondering why I can't be heard. This is a last cry for fucking help. A sign from god, fucking ANYTHING at all, I'm so tired of living. I'm tired of feeling this way. I fucking hate myself with a burning passion. If nothing changes in the next 12 or so hours, I am fucking gone.
