If you think about it, the world is in shambles and itâ€™s probably better to die than to see how it ends.Iâ€™m 14, suicidal, and I had a lot of thoughts about things.

I know someone will link r/im14andthisisdeep and thatâ€™s fine, I donâ€™t mind.

Truth is, the world is bleak. Did you See SunnyDâ€™s twitter make a depressed tweet to act relatable a few months back? Yeah, suicide is relatable since so many want to die.

Why that is? Well it could be our flawed school system that feels like the same day repeating over and over, being given tons of stressful work to do everyday, and ultimately we donâ€™t remember half of what we learn.  The school disregards bullying their studentâ€™s mental health. 

I can see why school shootings happen so often now. The world is so bleak and boring that you snap and want to put people out of their misery. At this point they could be doing us a service. I mean, I wouldnâ€™t go on a mass murder spree but I totally understand why others do.

Once you get out of school it isnâ€™t much better, you go to college and then get in serious debt and all that money and work piles up and you get homeless and sad people.

Global warming is also a thing too. The world is melting. Soon jackets will never be used. There is so much pollution and disease we donâ€™t know where to put it. Itâ€™s probably best to not have children if this is the world theyâ€™ll be forced to grow up with.

I can understand why suicide rates are at an all time high. The pain stops. If your religious, then hey you probably have a better place waiting for you. (Not saying that you should die, just saying if you did)

Honestly Iâ€™ve accepted the fact that I wonâ€™t make it past high school. Iâ€™ve accepted death. Everyone says: â€œBut no one knows what happens after we die, isnâ€™t that scary?â€  and I say no it isnâ€™t. I never understood why people are so scared of the unknown. If I donâ€™t know what it is it just doesnâ€™t scare me.

Yeah, Iâ€™ll probably die within the next 4 years, that kid who killed himself last year had the right idea.
