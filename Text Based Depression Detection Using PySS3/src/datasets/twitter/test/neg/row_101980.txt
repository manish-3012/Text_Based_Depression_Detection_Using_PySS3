There really isn't any reason to live, so why should I?I can't really feel anything anymore. Sure I can laugh, sure I can get angry but it doesn't feel real. 

Everything we do in life is to keep us occupied with the fact that everything we do is meaningless. We all will die, eventually our legacies will die out and every single memory, piece of evidence of our life actually taking place will be gone.

Eventually our sun will die out and that will be the end. 

Even if we weren't going to die out why would I try? In this world where people can't see reason, where people just can't seem to understand whats best for themselves. Where people try to annoyingly "teach" you that everyone is worth the same amount, even though that is clearely utterly fake. 

I remember being able to actually feel things when I was younger, I was happy, I was excited, I could actually FEEL things. Now things just happen and time goes by.

Family members have gone, friends have past yet not a single tear has been shed. I didn't choose to live, I never signed up to have to be forced to work the rest of my life away just to be able to afford food. 

So why shouldn't I end it if there is nothing positive in my life anymore? 

I am sorry for the long post but as I have also lost my sense of time its hard to realise how much one can write on the subject of nothingness.
