Maybe Everything isn't hopeless bullshitMy father committed suicide in December.  

I have spent the last 6 months desperately trying to find peace.  It shouldn't be that hard, I've dealt with prolonged lapses of sever depression myself.  I know what it's like to feel nothing.  I know what it's like to want a way out.  What I can't understand is the feeling that there is ABSOLUTELY nothing left to live for.

During my bouts of depression, whenever I came to the point that I was truly contemplating letting the world go on without me, I always had a reason not to.  The reasons could be small, for instance... I'd be embarrassed that my house is so disheveled.  Or, the reasons were huge... I could never leave my Mom and Sister.  Regardless of their importance, I always had a reason that my brain latched onto as a way out of taking this drastic step.  

My Father, even though he has two daughters and wife... His brain didn't latch on.  His brain, through the fog of depression, still decided that there was nothing to live for.

Today I found THE blog post.  If ever I need to explain depression to someone who has no darn clue what it feels like, I'll show them this blog post.  [Hyperbole and a Half Explains Depression] (http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/)

Read the blogpost.  It has pretty hand drawn pictures.  

I made this post and chose the subreddit for a reason.  Not because the above has changed my life and left me with no grief or questions about my father's death.  That isn't the case.  I made this posting so that one of you will go to the link I provided.  Use it to realize that you aren't the only one who feels the way you do.  Use it to help verbalize your non-feelings to the people who love you (because they do love you).  Use it to help explain to your potential doctor your symptoms.  Use it to realize that there is hope.  Depression Lies, but you can choose to kick it's ass.
