I'm out on ThursdayOn March 22, It was my birthday. I was very much prepared. I was very happy that my suffering will soon end, but everything changed for the worst in the eleventh hour. My mother found out that the rope is missing and confronted me. They started to surveillance me. I was as angriest I could possibly be, because my plan was stopped. 

On the next day, I found out that the rope I was going to use to hang my self and every rope in the house have been taken by them. The hopelessness I felt was unimaginable. But now I realized that there is no time for this kind of feeling. I need to convert my thought into action. I will go to every shop and place I can to have a strong rope and if by some reasons I didn't, I will use my belt or anything I could find to end it. There is no way I will going to be alive by the end of Thursday!!!
