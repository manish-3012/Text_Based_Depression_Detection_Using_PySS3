Hangin barely by a threadIâ€™m at my breaking point right now. I lost my grandmother in August and itâ€™s been the hardest hit Iâ€™ve ever taken because she was my person. 

Iâ€™m not talking to my best friend because she has grievously hurt me and Iâ€™m taking some space from her. My other friends I feel like I am losing left and right. My family is currently at each otherâ€™s throat and everyone keeps trying to pull me in the middle. And I want no part of it as I cannot emotionally or mentally handle the stress of it.

And I feel like I am just absolutely failing my children and my husband. I have literally fantasized taking my husbands gun and pulling the trigger multiple times before. And those same intrusive thoughts are coming right back because I cannot handle the stress.

I have not told my therapist, and just a few weeks ago things were finally going so well.... But now it feels like every little bit of support I have put up and milestones I have made is crumbling right back on top of me and drowning me. I donâ€™t know what to do...
