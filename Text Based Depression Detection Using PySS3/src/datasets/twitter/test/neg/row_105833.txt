337 days agoOh to be brain dead and in a coma right now, neither dead nor alive. Just the peaceful in between. 337 days ago I made my first post here. I can safely say that nothing has changed in my life. Still depressed and tired of everything life has thrown at me.

Thank you for reading, I just needed to let my heart out a little.
