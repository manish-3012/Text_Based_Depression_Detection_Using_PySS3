Seriously considering buying a gun in the next few days...I've had some kind of clinical depression since I was about eight or nine years old, with that has been this daily constant low hum of suicidal thoughts and ideations. At this point in my life, I'm just tired of this party and I'm really ready to leave.

I can't stay drunk or high all the time anymore. I don't want to live half of my life in this self-destructive rampage and the other tied to a mattress. I'm just tired of feeling dead and not actually being that way. I love opiates for that reason, for a small amount of time I can actually get what I want, and if I can take enough my heart will stop and I really want to pass that line. 

In March I'm planning a road trip to the west coast. The plan is to go to the southwest and end up in Santa Cruz, hang out with my only friend, drive up the one to Washington. I've been toying with the idea of buying a gun and bringing it with me in case it feels right. Just find some peaceful spot and just check out. Send my buddy some GPS coordinates and a little goodbye and have that be it. 

The only thing that's been keeping me alive for years is this idea that I'm going to miss out on something or that life could eventually get better. It's not getting better. I'm in the prime time of my life and I'm miserable, it wasn't better than my teenage years, and I don't think it's going to change in the coming decades. 

I'm not loved. I'm not happy, let alone joyful. I don't have any family anymore. Nothing works anymore, none of my vices. I just want to find a good view, get high, listen to Pink Floyd and blow my brains out. 

There's not really any reason I'm posting this other than my friend got tired of me texting him about all this shit and wanted me to make a throwaway and just purge this shit. But after typing all of it, it still doesn't help. I'm not happier, I'm not calmer, less angry, more hopeful. Nothing. Its all a fucking waste and I hope eventually all I am is some statistic just like the rest of you. Just a fucking line on a goddamn spreadsheet. 

Sorry, that was mean. Look, just, I dunno... tell me something I haven't heard before.
