I could use some help.First, let me say I myself am not the person in danger, and I would like to thank everyone on this subreddit. You all are doing amazing things, and that's why I've come here.

My girlfriend and I are both in high school, and for the first time last night, she explained to me just how she feels. For years she has been burning herself, pulling hair out, cutting, and just harming herself anyway she can, because of how much she hates life. She rarely does anything but lay in bed, because she wants her bones to diminish to the point where she just dies. Suicidal isn't the right term for her, but she has suicide on her mind, all the time.
She is this way because of multiple people, who have turned, literally everyone but me that she knows against her. She is harassed by everyone, insulting her in every way you can imagine. 

Lately, the energy has completely drained from her, and I'm beyond concerned. I'm scared to death she's going to try something. She said to me last night, "If it wasn't for you, I would have given up long ago. You're the only reason we're having this conversation right now."

I just don't know what else I can do. I love her so much, she doesn't deserve to feel this way. I feel like I need to be able to do more. I don't know if I'm asking for advise, or support, or just someone to say it will all be fine.

Thank you, so much, for taking the time to read this post, and respond, if you chose to do so.
