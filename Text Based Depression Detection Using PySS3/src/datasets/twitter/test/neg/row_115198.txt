I don't think I can ever be happy.The only thing I am good at anymore is sitting in the dark and eating and drinking too much. I've been unemployed for a year and have no idea what to do with myself. I've got no future, and no hope. The only reason I haven't bought a gun already is because I don't want my mother to be hurt by losing me...I'm all that she has. i'm ashamed at my wasted potential, and I have a lot of friends, most of whom are really thriving and making differences in the world and for themselves. I try not to be envious of people who have their shit figured out, but I am. Fuck me.
