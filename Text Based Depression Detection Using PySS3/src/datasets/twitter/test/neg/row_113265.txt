Happy Death Day to me!!My 26th birthday, and the 10th year that I'm the only one wishing myself. I'm done with this, goodbye universe.

I cannot take this anymore. The stress, anxiety, problem after problem after problem ;(. I'm broken permanently and I'm done fighting.

Good luck to everyone else soldiering on. I really wish that you can win this battle.
