I feel like dying soonBeen posting a bunch of stuff related to my anger, sadness, desperation at the disaster Im facing. I have no other word for it. I have tried to overcome it. But it did not work out. Am abandoned by fate? Do I make my fate? Which one is it..
I have deleted my contacts. Not getting any messages anymore on my phone. I am retreating from people because I know what will happen soon. I am afraid but I cant stop it. I am dying? Please, could life not have been different? Cheers yall
