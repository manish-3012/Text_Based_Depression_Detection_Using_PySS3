chronic pain - want to end itI'm 22 years old, and after injuring one of my hip muscles 3 years a go whilst cycling, things got progressively worse since then. which has led to many more problems that have cropped up because it wasn't diagnosed and fixed soon enough.

2 months a go I had hip surgery on both of my hips where they cut the tendons from my bones on my hip flexors. Before the surgery I couldn't walk normally, now I can walk without people staring at me, but I am in a lot of pain. Unfortunately I had an unneccasery surgery before this one which has left me unable to lift anything without very bad pain in my abdomen, which is making independent living a bit hard.

I won't go into detail about my injuries and surgery. The long and the short of it is I've been in 24/7 pain for almost 3 years, I've had to drop out of college, move back in with my parents, lost friends, lost all physical hobbies. I can tell my parents are getting fed up, and I am getting fed up explaining how much pain I'm in if I can't do something. Every day I want to just walk out and be independent, but then I think..shit..I can't because I can't walk more than 100metres , and I can't even lift up a full milk bottle without pain that stops me.

Being in pain for so long and being in pain still has really taken a toll on my mind. I'm generally a very level-headed person, and have never had any problems mentally. However I am now thinking about suicide every day, because the thought of living on for many more years in this pain, and not being able to do the one thing that really makes my soul sing..exercise and sport. I am 100% fed up on relying on people and I don't want to live like I am any more.

I'm not looking for attention on here, but I guess writing this shit out clears my mind a bit.
