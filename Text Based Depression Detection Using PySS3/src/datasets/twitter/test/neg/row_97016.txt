I need someone to talk toHello. I am a 12 year old in 7th grade and am hitting the wave of reality that i have absolutely no friends. In elementary, i had a couple friends desert me to join cooler "groups". I honestly can't stand this feeling of being alone and constantly being laughed at. The other day i started smacking myself in the head with a hard cover book for not being able to socialize. Please - i just need someone to talk to
