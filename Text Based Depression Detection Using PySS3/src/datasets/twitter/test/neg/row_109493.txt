Its happening but not yet. Just wanted someone to listen to my ramblings.**TL/DR was an idiot, failed at suicide, went numb, got a plan, still doing it, it sucks that not being able to feel**

Remember that time when I went crazy, went to the hospital, and was stuck with the insane for a weekend? I remember that moment so vividly...2010 or sometime around that year...I tell everyone that this was the one defining moment where I hit rock bottom, rebuilt myself, and grew stronger as a person; the one moment that motivated a should-had-been high school dropout into became a college â€œgraduateâ€ with a government job and a bright future.

Sounds good, right? Well that weekend, whatever that was, actually marked the day where I started thinking about death, why that time wasn't the right time, and what I can do to ensure everyone will be better off when it happens.

SEARS...every time I recall that word I remember fragments of good and bad times...Being promoted in 2 months for being a bad ass at my job, playing outdoor basketball with Kor and Peter, drinking Ice House at Bee's house, and failing at Community College. Those days seem like a blur where nothing made sense:

* Why was I trying to go to College?
* Failed another semester...Gotta write another Financial Aid probation letter.
* Drinking every weekend? Sounds great to me!
* College, why am I doing this again?
* Part-time commission based job? What the hell?!
* Damn that Feifei...I fucked up...Couldn't even act normal...Shit, her words hurt...

One day I needed money to pay for those student loans. I saw a manager level job posting at work, HR said someone already has the job, and I panicked. Pre-college graduate me thought a large container of Ibuprofen would do the trick. Such a dummy, even the hospital folk made fun of me.

I do recall calling my brother after I took all those pills that night and asking for help. He called mom and she took me to the hospital. I also asked him to come to the hospital and all he did was talk in a stern voice. Something about him taking the night off of work, not getting paid, and that he could had visited over the weekend. That hurt...a lot.

I wanted him to be there for me like the type of brothers you see on TV. He was never that type but I needed him to be. Still isn't today, even though I told him that's what I wanted from him. Why can't he even pretend to try or even say â€œI'm sorry that I wasn't that kind of brotherâ€.

While my mom was driving me to the hospital I gave her a check to pay all of my bills. Yep, it would had bounced. She was more focused on getting me to the hospital to care about money. Couldn't blame her though; I'd probably be the same way too.

Insane people are INSANE, I didn't fit the profile. Had to get out of there since I couldn't think straight. Did get some generic Prozac though and it seems to be helping me. Protip, if you ever suicide and back out, never do it on a weekend. You're stuck there for three days no matter what.

Death, God, afterlife, reincarnation, heaven, hell, purgatory; do they even exist? What about dying and experiencing nothing but darkness, complete darkness where your last feeling is all that's left then its taken away and you lose sentience. Fuck, that's scary...but for how long? Stupid empty void in my chest, them feels...Is it my spirit? Can I even feel anything anymore? Is piecing it together even matter? Do I even matter?

No.

My loved ones do. At least I think they do. Yeah, I gotta make sure that when it happens they'll understand or get over it quickly.

Money, that's what I need. I need money and lots of it. Gotta do it right so they are better off when I'm gone:

* No schemes or violence. Damn it, I need a better job.
* Ah fuck, I really need to go to College now.
* Got my AAS in 3 years, got my BS in four. I'm such a slacker.
* Weekend computer job? Not enough money.
* Supermarket? Why am I working in retail again?
* Contractor, gotta get it out of my system.
* Government job? Keep the bar low and you'll can do it for as long you need.

I finally made it. Two years and I'll be in the clear to do it. Two more years of trying. 

God damn it...
