i just want to fucking diei've posted here before so i'm sorry if you recognize me and i'm sorry for being boring and posting here so much.  
i hate myself so fucking much it's ridiculous. i'm so fucking pathetic. i'm almost 20 and i've never even kissed anyone. i have a horrible personality and i'm hideously ugly and fat and everyone hates me. my appearance is so fucking disgusting. i'm not good enough for anyone. i'm so stupid and pathetic and sensitive. i get my feelings hurt over the stupidest most pathetic things and i fucking hate it. everyone would be better off and happier if i just fucking killed myself already.  
like i said i'm so fucking ugly. people on the street laugh at me because i look like a fucking goblin. no one would ever love me, i know i'm going to be alone my whole life because i'm so disgustingly fat and ugly.  
no one cares about me. people just pretend to and then they turn around and talk about how much they hate me and what a creepy fucking freak i am. everyone wants me to die.  
i have severe depression (obviously) and anxiety and crippling ocd. it makes my life hell. but i don't deserve to be happy. i'm a piece of worthless shit who needs to fucking die already. i hate myself. i can't wait for the right moment to fucking end it already.  
sorry again for posting multiple times. it's just nice to be able to talk about it relatively anonymously without any judgement. thanks everyone.
