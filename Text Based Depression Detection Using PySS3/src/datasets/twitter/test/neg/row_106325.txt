I think I had enough, I want to prove a point with my suicide.A couple months ago I made a post here where I explained that therapy isn't working for me after over 15 years of trying.

Well, I think I'm officially done

a week ago I went drinking and drank as much as I could to attempt to black out, because that's the only time I'm apparently suddenly extroverted and "awesome".

Well, that didn't work, instead I threw up and had a panic attack in the middle of the street and my friend had to call an ambulance, of course, only about an hour into the painful experience.

The ambulance came and I was just bawling about how I want to end my life, and try something different for a change, but the doctors confirmed me nothing will change and that it'll just be wasted money.

After we came home I simply talked to my friend how nothing matters, and how suddenly the only time people care is when a famous person commits suicide, but not even then, because not all are educated about mental illnesses and suddenly you have people blame the victim for being selfish.

My only reason to become a better musician right now is to literally commit suicide if I ever get a following to send a message.

I also thought of doing a "100-days to suicide" blog/vlog type of thing just to see how everyone takes their time, censors, or gets defensive or aggressive as I post daily updates. Yeah, it's that kind of thing, only the only one to lose his life would be me.

I think that's the last way I can have fun before I end my life, because a confirmation for how lacking we are in the mental health department could make some things come up (or maybe not, so others will have their confirmation).

I'd really like to see the amount of inactive profiles that posted on this subreddit in comparison to other subreddits.
