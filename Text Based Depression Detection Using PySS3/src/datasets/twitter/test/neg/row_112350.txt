Soo close...I turned on the selfie can and hit record.  I don't really know why.  No one would ever see it if I was successful.  I put the object in my hand and racked the slide.  Pressing it my chin, I was shocked by how long it seemed that the squeeze was...I closed my eyes tightly, waiting for a swift ending.  Click.  I don't remember jumping, but the video was clear.  I was scared.  

Why was I scared?

Why did it fail.

Fuck...
