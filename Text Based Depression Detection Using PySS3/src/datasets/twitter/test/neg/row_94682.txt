Hi (rant)Hi, I want to die. 

I'm a 16 year old male,

The only reason I am alive right now is because of my brother. I play video games (Destiny 2) with him and some friends almost everyday, we are close to finishing the prophecy dungeon. I keep getting cut off from my friends by my parents who stare down my throat all-day everyday. My parents act like they care about me and treat me like god around their friends but when their friends are not around it seems like am am shoved into the dumpster and not cared about. All I care about is my friends. I know they care about me too. That is the reason I am alive. I can't let them down. I'm not bullied or anything it is just that my life is terrible. My grades are terrible in school and can't do anything with out chastising myself about how bad I am about it. I guess I am looking for a reason not to kill myself. I just feel useless.
