Fuck this noiseOk so I just found out my parents are going to be out of town on my birthday and as a condition for getting me anything on my birthday I have to schedule an appoint for the dentist and get a hair cut. My NMother keeps exaggerating that my teeth are black implying that all of them are when i know they are not, and I have told her to stop doing that, but what gets me super depressed is that if i need anything as I am completely unable to get a job (no place wants to hire me) if I could get a job, I would get all the things i need on my own, but as it is, I am stuck between a rock and very hard place  I feel like there is nothing left for me, that I need to end it sooner rather than later, maybe after my parent leave on their trip I will just hang myself and be done with it.  I can't fucking win, I can't get what I need, I have no resources, I HAVE NOTHING, whats the fucking point. I am tired hurt and unloved,  I may as well be dead, for all anyone in my family gives two shits
