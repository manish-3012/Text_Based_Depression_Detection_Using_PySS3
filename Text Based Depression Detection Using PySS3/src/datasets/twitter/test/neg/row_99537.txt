My life is crumbling before my eyes, I just want everything to endAbout 3 weeks ago my parents kicked me to the curb. They told me that Iâ€™m a good for nothing bastard. All I was given was my backpack. I have NOTHING I am nothing, just 2 months ago my own father threatened to kill me, he disowned me, I lost my only familial bond . My life has been a shitshow ever since my biological mother and dad died when I was 7. My life has been nothing but utter hell, I want the pain to stop, I have been in and out of mental hospitals to many times to count. Iâ€™m very sick and nothing helps. I suffer from clinical depression. I suffer from ptsd because my aunt and her husband abused me for 7 years. At the worst time there I was locked in a small room with NOTHING I was 14 at the time. I had a bare bed and a weeks worth of clothes. My door was locked i was given food through a slit in the door. The also put locks on the windows so I wouldnâ€™t escape. I wasnâ€™t allowed to use the bathroom when I need to. They told me when I could, I had to shit and piss out of the small opening in the window. I was in that hell hole for 2 months. I was going insane. I was homocidal and suicidal. I was either going kill my abusers to end the constant physical mental and emotional abuse that I was subjected to every single day. Or I was going to will myself to end the pain. On that day I wish I had killed myself. Ever since then I had to suffer from those demons. Everyday is slowly grinding my psyche down. Itâ€™s only a matter of time before I snap, and Iâ€™m scared of what might happen. Please help me anyone please Iâ€™m begging you.
