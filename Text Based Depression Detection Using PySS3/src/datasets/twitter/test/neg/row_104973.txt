Todays my last day, it ends tonigntSo my school break ended and i looked around this morning and let how depresed i am actually take hold. i dont like to let myself think about my "severe depression, anxiety, self injury, and anorexia" as that is what im told i have. but i also have insomnia, which gives me a lot of time to think, and honestly. im done with it all. im worthless and throughout the past year all ive been good for is sex. thats how ive been able to get through it all, that and cutting. I just decided that this is it. im done with this world, my family would be better off, my friends the same. Im dick and tired of the "itll get better" shit ive been told. it wont get better. ive given up on it all, so tonights the night, my last night on earth. ill leave all the problems behind, and finally be able to not have to worry. and yes i was prescribed pills for the depression, but im not one for the side effects, so i stopped taking them, with the knowledge that nothing would change. the reasons i want to leave are a list of a million, starting with being raped by my father in 8th grade. And ends with me. ive been hospitalized for this and it didnt do shit. im not worth anything. im done with it all.tonights the night, the night i end it all

tl;dr depressed  male teenagee wants to kill himself, after the many years of cutting and being used for sex
