Iâ€™ve had enoughIâ€™ve been living in this hell I call life for too long now. Iâ€™ve been depressed for 20 years of my life. I have been on anti depressants and that hasnâ€™t helped. Iâ€™m running out of options to make myself feel better. 
Iâ€™m an ugly pos and shouldnâ€™t be allowed to be on this earth anymore. 

Please just let me die. I want to get hit by a car or something.
