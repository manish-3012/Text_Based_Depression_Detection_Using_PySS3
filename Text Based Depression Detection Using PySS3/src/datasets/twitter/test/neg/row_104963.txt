Teetering between active and passive suicidal ideationI've been struggling with depression and anxiety since I was 12 so for 9 years I've fought it now. I feel so isolated and alone. I'm so frustrated with myself because I have a good fiance, a good job, a promising future in the career field I want, my family loves me and always offers to help, and my friends do the same. But I still can't stop thinking about how okay I would be if I was to get into a fatal accident or how I could cause the fatal accident. I'm medically educated which makes things worse because I know what drugs, how to dose and use them, how to prevent your body from rejecting them. All that makes the option to opt out so much more available. I'm deeply struggling with nihilism and have no desire to live. I've become very dark and fatalistic. I've had a plan once prior that was uncovered by my fiance and I was taken by police to a local emergency room. Every time I try to talk to anyone about what I'm feeling it's always responded to with comments like "you should just work out more" "how can you be depressed when your life is great" "everyone has dealt with depression and thoughts of suicide" and I get that. I am actively seeing a psychiatrist and counseling psychologist, I am exercising as much as my profound lack of energy and interest is allowing, I'm keeping myself and my home clean, I'm purposefully forcing myself to spend time with family. I still feel so very hollow and isolated. I just don't know what to do. I have a plan but I am very self reflective and I recognize that's a part of my sick brain and do not believe I will act on it. I feel like I understand my situation, and do everything that I should to help it, but it doesn't change it. I have no WHY to being this sad, or wanting to die. It's just such a primal feeling for me. It's always there. I don't want to be alone. The only person I felt could have ever made me not feel so alone with this is my sister. But she has killed herself a few years back and I'll never know how we could have helped eachother.
