I'm getting better but they aren't. What's the point?I came out as transgender about 5 and a half years ago. It's been one hell of a struggle since then but over the years since I've gotten so much better. I've been getting out of the house and trying to meet people, make friends, take care of my health, etc. The problem is that so many people noticeably treat me differently, in almost every facet of my life. I'd say 70% of interactions with people end up making me feel shitty, when I feel the most confident I've ever felt. People judge me all the time, misgender me on purpose, or the ones who seem nice end up being chasers or assholes if they do learn I'm trans. It's especially worse online but happens in person as well. I think about killing myself every day still even though I've stopped drinking, transitioned, became independent. I still Google about ways to kill myself, it's how I've ended up here. When I call a hotline it ends up making me feel worse. I think what's making it very difficult is that I never draw attention to it or talk about it with people, I seldomly mention it.

I'm stuck because this is my path in life whether anyone else thinks so or not. I just can't really live the way I want to even though I've personally taken the steps to do so. I've had nurses tell me I should go home and kill myself for fuck sake. When the place you go to get help has people who clearly don't want to help you it makes you feel subhuman. Maybe I should move somewhere else but I don't think I can live here long enough to make that happen in time. Luckily in Canada I'm not allowed to buy a gun due to mental health I guess.
