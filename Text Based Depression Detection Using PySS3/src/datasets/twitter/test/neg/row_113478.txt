they're finally going to throw me outthey've just given me the talk. they're good people. they're the only reason i've been eating. they even gave me this computer so i can work. i haven't been working. i haven't been doing anything but lazing around and eating their food. it's not like they want to throw me out. it's just that if i don't pay my debts, they really don't have any choice. okay. it's going to be money after all, isn't it?

i have no clean clothes left but i don't have any money for soap. i'm talking to my best friend in another tab about school stuff. she's gonna be so pissed. i want to tell her that the fire just became too hot and i really don't have any other choice but to jump out the window (i just read that quote).

i'm smiling right now because of a funny askreddit thread and it's scaring me a little. i'm always smiling at a time like this. my aunt just came in and she probably thought i look happy. i don't want to die, you know? i want to commit suicide even less. i want to live and go to college and fight some more with my friends just like what i was doing before all this. there's just really no other exit, you know? i tried looking. i really did, for years. i've never really gone this far with this, you know? so i guess it's really happening.
