I need to just talk to someoneI have been on here for a couple days, trying to move past my sadness and hurt. I am being kept from my son by the one person who I thought loved me more than anything. We had come so far, nearly 2 years living together and 3 month old baby with us, it was good. But I guess she woke up and decided I'm not good enough anymore and took off my son. What's worse is she got me arrested on complete lies... I feel so devastated and I have for almost a week. I haven't eaten a single thing since this all happened. I just want to let go and slip into starvation I think it would be better for everyone. Especially my family who now have to suffer with not being able to see my son they're grandchild and I feel so so bad, I feel like it's all my fault that I let her do this to me and more than anything I feel abused. I am the one who worked hard to get us to the point we are at and she left me alone and is trying to take my little boy away. I want to see him and hold him and watch him grow but now I can't contact her or go near her families place because of conditions placed upon me by the police. I feel so beaten down and don't want to get back up, I can't eat I can barely sleep I'm in the same apartment we all shared for so long, alone... I don't know if I can do this much longer I feel myself slipping farther and farther away and I just want to let it happen.
