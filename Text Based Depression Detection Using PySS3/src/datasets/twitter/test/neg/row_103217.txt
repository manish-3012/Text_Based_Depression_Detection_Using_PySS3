When should I check into a hospital?I'm bipolar, have been struggling with it for a while.
I recently moved out of my home state to attend college. Last week, I decided it was time to move back because I'm already thousands of dollars in debt and my mental health is suffering. 
And it's still suffering. Tonight is a really bad night. Going back home depresses me a hell of a lot because it's a final sign that I'm not good enough to be on my own, I can't handle it, and my mental health will forever have a hold on me.
I'm suicidal, but know I won't do anything. I have a cat that depends on me and a sister who wouldn't be able to go on without me. 
But I don't want to go on. I'm so sick of hurting people and my boyfriend and living for no reason. Should I check myself in somewhere? Or is that over reacting since I know I won't actually do anything?
Thanks in advance for your opinions
