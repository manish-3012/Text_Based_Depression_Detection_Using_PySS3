Don't tell me I am worth it. Don't tell I mean something.I'm tired of hearing 'it isn't worth it', 'you mean something', 'don't throw everything away'.

I have decided I am worth nothing, I am worth nothing to myself. To you I am worth something, cause you have a tie to me, you might say I mean something to you and you want me in your life on the expense of my sanity. To me I mean nothing, I'm unable to do anything of what I want and the moment I think I can it goes away, and this time it wasn't even my fault. 

My worth to myself is nothing. I have been fighting for so long, for half my life, following my dreams and fucking them up at the same time. I do nothing right and I have no future. I am a walking disaster without prospects and without worth. I am a liability to myself and everyone around. You cannot decide my worth. My worth has been weighed and considered by the society around me and it is nothing. 

If I take my life now no one would care, nothing will be lost. You will feel some pain for a while, some grief, wonder why. To you I meant to much, to me I mean nothing. 

To me ending everything now is worth it so I don't have to live out an adult life in constant pain, battling against myself and society. I am tired now, what will I be in a year or so? 

I'm not throwing anything away as there is nothing there to begin with.

I'm just waiting for the right moment and then I will take the car, go into the forest somewhere, and hang myself. 

It will hurt for a while but you will understand why in time. It's better this way.
