Best friend is suicidal, I feel helpless.My best friend moved a few years ago and now we live in separate states. We have stayed very close. Lately her life is going downhill and she told me the other day that she plans to commit suicide if things don't turn around.

I am obviously very worried so I told her family, who still live near me. They seem unconcerned. They have given up hope on her and told me to stop taking responsibility for her life and be supportive but ultimately let her do whatever she wants to do.

No, fuck that. She needs HELP. I am the only one who hasn't given up on her and I can't do anything to help. I live 2,000 miles away. She doesn't have a reliable phone so our contact is sporadic and mostly on her terms.

What the hell do I do?

Edit: We are both over 18, I live at home and she lives independently. To be honest I don't even know where she lives at this point in time. She is not in school and she is not working at the moment. She doesn't have any friends where she lives now. Her family is collectively unsupportive, so that means her aunts/uncles will follow suit if the parents are unsupportive of helping her. She does not go to church or do anything social. There is truly no one else I can think to contact to help her.
