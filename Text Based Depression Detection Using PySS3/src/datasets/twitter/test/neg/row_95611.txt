I don't know how much longer I can do this.The day my boyfriend killed himself two years ago, I died with him. Every day, I consider joining him. Ive tried to be strong, and fight every day to not give into my impulses. But Im afraid that one of these days I will not be able to stop myself and I will not be able to take it back. I know that I dont REALLY want to die but I dont want to live either and I feel it slowly getting worse and worse.
