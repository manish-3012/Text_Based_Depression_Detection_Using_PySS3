I fucking hate myselfEverything was going fine a few months ago, no more worries summer was fun but now I fucked shit up

I just lost 2 really good friends because Iâ€™m annoying as hell, Iâ€™ve recently lost a lot of friends, I feel like Iâ€™m not meant to be where I am, Iâ€™m stuck, suffering, and I just want to die.

Death would be mercy
