I don't know I remember my grade two teacher who had some kind of medical problem because she always limped telling the class people can't live without love, i though she was dumb but I now understand her. I feel like it impossible for me to make new friends of develop bonds and I feel so alone. Human physical contact is foreign to me. I don't get along with my parents, I have a few friends left but I don't have very good relations with any of them. I just want somebody to talk to me or someone I can talk to, im in high school, I've been asking my mom for therapist for a year now and she hasnt done anything. I have some deep rooted mental issues I don't feel comfortable speaking about, I have OCD, I'm not saying this  as a teenage hypochondriac, I actually have it. I force myself to do this uncontrollable behavior, I dont want to go into that either. I feel like suicide would be so blissful and an escape from conscious worries and problems, but the selfless part of me could never do that to the few people who care about me. I feel trapped, no aspect of my life seems worth living and my social fears are preventing me from improving my life. I just want friends who accept me and encourage me. I just feel lost, lonely, and frustrated with my life. This all feels like a numbing cycle of mundane tasks, happiness never occurs, I don't understand the point of living if I enjoy no part of it. Overall my personal issues, and fears has left me in a low place, I've found ways to cope, but they aren't healthy, and I've just given up on it all for multiple reasons
