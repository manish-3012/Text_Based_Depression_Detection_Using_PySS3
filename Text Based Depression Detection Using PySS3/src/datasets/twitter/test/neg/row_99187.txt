Tf is wrong with me?Got paid today, ordered some games to fill the void. Was happy, to happy.

So then I decided to dumb down the happiness by lookin up how to die. I realized what I was doin n closed out the browser. Cause I'm happy, so why tf am I ruining it?

I also realized I fucked up typing this at least 20 times. I also remembered that I'm gonna have $153 left for the month after bills n saving back for a car. But it Gucci gang, got roommates to help a bitch out
