I might be a terrible person...I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for the last 12 years(22 now). I've tried commuting suicide 3 times around the age of 10. I overdosed on pills and somehow each time I did it my mom would find out and get me to the ER in time. Spent a total of 8 months at various in-patient and out-patient clinics after that. 

When I did that I could see how much if hurt my family and my mom especially. It gave me the worst feeling in the world. I recovered for awhile and stuff didn't start go ing bad again until after high school. I tried college, I fucked that up; I tried multiple jobs, fucked all those up(and I just mean I stopped going or just quit on it),and have seen multiple doctors and mental health professionals. Tried every medicine known to man with no positive outcomes. 

Now most are my days I walk around feeling nothing. No happiness, no sadness, just empty inside. The decision to just try one more time to end it all and make sure it works creeps in more and more daily. I have nothing going for me at the moment, no job, no relationship, no future prospects on anything. The one thiing I think about and that keeps me going through life is my family and how it hurt them when I did his in the past. But does it make me a terrible person if that is slowly becoming not enough of a reason for me to keep living? 

I just don't know what to do and I feel like nothing really matters.
