I lost a 6 year relationship and she took my sonThrough my own fault i consequently ended a 6 year relationship, she took my son and my money. I'm broke and alone on NYE listening to sad music. 

I'm waiting to end it. But i know it's coming. I'm a failure. I'm a bad dad, a bad boyfriend, i have no money. I'm a pos. I love my son so much but i have nothing to offer him.
