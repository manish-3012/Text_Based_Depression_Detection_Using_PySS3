Itâ€™s stupid.I havenâ€™t felt so low in such a long time. Itâ€™s still such a familiar feeling that I know I shouldnâ€™t indulge and yet I canâ€™t help crawling back to it. A breakup shouldnâ€™t be a reason for me to be feeling this way but itâ€™s not just the breakup, itâ€™s an accumulation of shit things that have happened over the course of a year. Im stuck in a city I donâ€™t know with people I donâ€™t talk to. Everything thatâ€™s happened so far is my own fault.
