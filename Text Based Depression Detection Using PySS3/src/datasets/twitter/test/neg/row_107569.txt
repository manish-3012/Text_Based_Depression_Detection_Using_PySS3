I don't know what to do anymoretl;dr : 21 yr old waste of oxygen doesn't know what to do after coming to terms with the fact nobody cares, and his life does not matter a fuck. 

Let's go back a bit. I was finally happy. After years of anxiety, depression and this ever lasting feeling of worthlessness I was happy. I had found myself a girlfriend 2 and a half months ago, she is the most pure person I had ever met and showed genuine interest in me, we had similar dreams for family life and wanted to be with each other. That was until 2 weeks ago when she decided we needed to call this off because she has her own mental battles to deal with and needed time to herself. I don't blame her for being selfish for once, it's the last thing I've ever seen her as, but I can't help but feel cast aside like I'm not good enough for her. Honestly I'm not good enough for anybody. Not my friends, not my partners and not even my family. Everything I've ever done that should have been a triumph was turned into a shit storm of "You should have done better". I've never recieved an inch of praise, I've never recieved a hug that I hadn't initiated, I've never recieved true love. Losing this girlfriend after years of being alone confirms to me that I'm worthless. I'm a nobody. A nobody knows that no one else truly cares about them. I've struggled with anxiety and depression since I was 13 or 14 and it's starting to get to me. Almost 21 years of being neglected love and shown zero compassion, as well as 8 to 9 years of feeling like I shouldn't be on this planet and nothing has changed. I wish I was never born, everyone's lives would have been better off without me. I cannot think of 1 instance that I have influenced someone for the better. Every event that I have been a part of would have been better off with someone more competent in my shoes.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to die, I want to live and enjoy life like all the people I see daily. But I have zero motivation, and zero want to really so anything about it. I've been on anti-depressants for a week now and I feel like it's only made things worse. So there, I've tried to make things better but it's not working (I know the effect will take longer that a week) and I'm almost sure I shouldn't bother. I'd I wasn't so much of a puss-bitch I would have railed myself through a telegraph pole while driving and ended myself there and then. Lord knows I came close. If I'd managed to hype myself up and rip the metaphorical bandaid keeping my piece of shit body together I'd've done it. But I couldn't. Regardless I'm sure one of these days I will.

I used to think cutting yourself was dumb, but now having tried it I understand how it helps. It vents anger into myself and helps channel it somewhat so I don't take it out on someone or something. I've had a shit enough impact on people's lives.

I thought about trying something tonight but I don't think I can. I already shredded my leg up with a razer before I climbed into bed to try to calm myself a bit. Typing this out helped me vent a little but it won't help in the long run (obviously) 

I'm not sure how much longer I can hang on.
