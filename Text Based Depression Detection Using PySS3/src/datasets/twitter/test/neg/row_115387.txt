I lost all hope, I can't stop thinking about dying.The government is fake, tv is fake, friends are fake, dreams are fake and everyone around me is a drug addict. I just can't live in this place any longer, I have seen enough and I'm stuck in endless fear and sadness. I just don't want to wake up anymore. I can't talk to anyone anymore, my thoughts are always miles away. I've been struggling for many years and now I'm at the end. I lost everything that made me who I am. I REALLY just want to die.
