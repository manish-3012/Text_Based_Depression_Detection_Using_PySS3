[Long] I need to make money somehow, or im going to kill myselfI moved from the UK around a year ago to another country in europe. Im married and have a toddler to take care of. The main reasons for moving is because we were neck deep in debt, but had a house, so we decided to consolidate and pay off everything, and move to my wife's home country, where it appeared to be a better place to live and bring up a kid. better environments, better school system, affordable kindergartens and so on.

However, i am clinically depressed. i have been diagnosed unipolar depressed, and its been like this since 2014. Soon as i hit the age of 20, around 10 years ago now, i developed chrons disease. I lived with it undiagnosed and untreated for 3 years, in constant agonising pain due to the lack of care of doctors and the NHS in general. After finishing college, and going into adult life, everything turned downhill for me. I lost a great career job, i never managed to stick in the same field due to the financial crisis last decade - or it was because im just shit myself, the whole last 10 to 15 years of my life, and continuing to this day, has been a major drag of pain, regret, resentment, depression, anxiety, remorse, guilt, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

So unfortunately, after getting rid of the debt, and moving, i still brought along with me my depression and anxiety. I thought that having a small amount of money and starting over in a new land, would remove my mental illness. Most certainly not.

Im now back into seeing shrinks, taking meds, feeling miserable everyday, just as shitty as it was before, maybe even worse.

The one thing i feel that consumes me, is the lack of money. My wife works, and i currently dont. I want to work, but ive also been recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Thats the last thing i fucking needed. another disease, another ailment to my current shit body and mind. I cant work. I can barely get out of bed. My legs are in constant pain. It causes me to walk at a snails pace. Going faster to do simple chores or tasks around the house raises anxiety and stress. How the hell could i possibly go and work like this, being around public and coworkers? i cant, im a fucking mess.

&amp;#x200B;

So i decided to try and think of something i can do from home, particularly using my PC, because what else am i gonna do to make money? And guess what, i have no fucking clue what to do or what i am physically able to do?

&amp;#x200B;

Every idea i think of is shit, or would never work properly for me. I thought of youtube, selling stuff on ebay, investing in bitcoin. none of those are good ideas. what person wants to listen to a degenerate miserable fuck on youtube on probably their last legs before commiting suicide? how am i even gonna monetize that!!!!?

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know what to do. I do know that i would rather die than work for a company, a traditional job, where i am being paid to essentially make the owners and shareholders insanely rich, doing 8 hours a day 5 days a week of that miserable soul sucking shit. fuck that. id rather die. ive done that for 15 years. enough is enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas please? What can i realistically do from home, where i use my PC, to make even a small income per month? The only decent idea i thought of would send me to jail. Which is buying weed wholesale for half price online, and selling it locally for a higher price. I cant even realistically do that because i am married and have a kid. If i was single living all alone then maybe? i dunno.

&amp;#x200B;

If i cant figure out a way to at least start somewhere, and get out of this shithole idea of life where you work your ass off forever, to end up with nothing, no savings, a bullshit pension, state provided old peoples home, id rather just abandon my family and go die right now. im not prepared to contuinue this bullshit life anymore. if i was told the truth about adult life when i was a kid, i would have done it then as well.

Humanity and society sucks. Its a system that oppresses 97% of us while the 3% of humans alive live in absolute bliss and luxury with no financial worries, ever.
