Just want it to endI'm constantly suffering all day everyday no rest. The only way out I see is death. I feel so guilty writing this since my family was so worried when I went to the hospital yesterday but I just want to kill myself. 

I just can't stop thinking my brain is thinking all day everyday. I feel so so guilty.
