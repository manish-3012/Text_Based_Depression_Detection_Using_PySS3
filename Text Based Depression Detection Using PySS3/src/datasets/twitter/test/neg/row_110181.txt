Made a deal with myself that I would never kill myself, but it feels like that part of me is broken. Starting to actively plan how to end it.Iâ€™ve had depression since I was maybe 3, diagnosed at 6. Varying severity throughout life, but never ever gone. Iâ€™m 32 now, and itâ€™s only been getting worse in recent years. The last few months have been particularly awful.

Therapy and meds both still ongoing, and Iâ€™m still finding myself crying in the bath, crying in bed, begging for any kind of respite, just any brief reprise from this miserable fucking loneliness. I am exhausted in body and soul, and I donâ€™t trust that it will ever actually get better. 

It feels like Iâ€™m held hostage by my own mind, and by being afraid to hurt my loved ones. A good friend killed herself in 2013, and I saw and felt the pain that just tore through the people around her. I canâ€™t stand the idea of putting them through that, but at the same time, I donâ€™t think I can keep paying the ransom.

If it was decades of cancer and at 32 I said Iâ€™m tired, I canâ€™t keep fighting, they would understand. It would still be sad, but it would be so fucking different. I just want to be done, I want to feel nothing. I want to drive out to the woods after work and exit bag myself right out of this pain and this loneliness. Be done. I donâ€™t even need to feel better, I could just stop feeling anything.
