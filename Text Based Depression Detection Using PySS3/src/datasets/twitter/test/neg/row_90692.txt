How does someone abandon you when youâ€™re suicidal?Really though, how can someone abandon you when youâ€™re suicidal? Why do they get to be happen when youâ€™re drowning in suicidal thoughts daily? Why is it fair? I sometimes just wanna end my life so I can make them feel guilty for making me like this

If anyone else has felt they have been abandoned before while you were suicidal, please can you tell me what got you through it cause Iâ€™m really struggling. I just keep replaying it in my head over and over like a record player. Iâ€™m struggling to cope with the idea that someone I loved and cared for just abandoned me in the worst time of my life, yet it doesnâ€™t seem to phase them
