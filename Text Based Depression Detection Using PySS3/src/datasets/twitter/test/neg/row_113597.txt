Hey friendsI'm going to give myself a little bit of faith and type something that hopefully will make sense when I read it in the morning.

This may be out of place because I'm not suicidal (I have more than I ever wanted, lost more than I could and hate myself... but I am not suicidal).  

I'm certain there will always be something for me, and that's why I'm selfish.   Finding what I want, it turns out, is a lot easier than finding what I need.

Every day I've worked my life around something I don't want to be, things I don't want to do ( but will go through great lengths to accomplish).

Thank you
