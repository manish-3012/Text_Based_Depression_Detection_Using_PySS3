I don't know how to get betterNo oneâ€™s really gonna read this, but yeah.  
Iâ€™m 15 years old and got diagnosed with depression when I was 12. I strongly dislike talking about my â€˜negativeâ€™ feelings, partially because of trauma, partially because Iâ€™m afraid people will look at me differently. When I finally did open up about it, it didnâ€™t really go well and got immediately dragged to a doctor to see â€˜whatâ€™s wrong with meâ€™. Iâ€™m afraid to open up again.  
Once I got into therapy, literally before the second appointment I send the therapist an email saying I feel much better now and donâ€™t need therapy, because I thought it wouldnâ€™t work.  
I know bottling up my emotions isnâ€™t healthy, but itâ€™s all Iâ€™ve been doing my entire life. I do sometimes talk about it online, but thatâ€™s all, and even then, I just feel awkward and like a burden to the people that have to listen to me.   
I got held back last year because â€˜I didnâ€™t feel like goingâ€™ (which is what I told everyone) when I couldnâ€™t get out of bed and tried really hard to not kill myself. I had my second suicide attempt that year. I didnâ€™t want to tell anyone, like my teachers, friends or trusted ones because people know me as happy, bubbly, dumb and annoying, or something like that anyway. I feel like a fucking failure.  
I thought my mindset would change over time, but it never did. This year, Iâ€™m doing a tiny bit better, Iâ€™m less absent, but Iâ€™m still not doing great at school. Itâ€™s not really that itâ€™s hard, I just donâ€™t have any motivation at all. I always thought I wouldnâ€™t make it past 15, or would just end up killing myself anyways so whatâ€™s the point?  
But I want to stay alive for some of my family and friends. So, suicide isnâ€™t an option anymore. What will I do know? I want to live, but I have no motivation at all. Itâ€™s like everythingâ€™s just a big joke. I know I should care, but I donâ€™t.   
Does anyone have any advice?
