some nights I want to kill myself, others...others I pray that my consciousness is merely the result of random particles simulating a brain, hallucinating this very moment in the depth of the universe and that the next second, the particles will have moved and the artificial consciousness that was created won't exist anymore, ever.

With the amount of possible arrangements of particles and the "infinite" time the universe has to try them all, I could have gotten something better, I would of like to be able to just think about how a fluid flows in a 27 dimensions space and see it in my head
