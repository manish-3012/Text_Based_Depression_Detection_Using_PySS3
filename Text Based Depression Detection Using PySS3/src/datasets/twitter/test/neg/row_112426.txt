Done with all of it36 yrs old male, been with my fiancee for 9 yrs. Decided to throw me in jail on trumped up charges and filled a protection order. Effectively stealing everything in my life. A month later I drove by her on the street and she filled more charges for violating protection order.
All was perfect before  she decided to make a swift exit and decided to ruin my life in the legal system. I have lost my job, been thrown in jail and now have to go back on another charge and I just don't think I can handle this anymore. She has taken everything from me, including my freedom. For what? I truly loved her and gave her my all.
Now I'm done, have my plan, charcoal burning in my car and taking seditives to fall asleep during the process. I'm pretty set on doing this before I would have to turn myself into the court.
Only question is, do I leave a note? Does it really matter the reasons why when it's so obvious.
No talking me out of this, I'm doing it tomorrow, and haven't told a soul. When I was in jail the first time all I could think of in those last moments before I was released, was the method of how I would do it and that I'm not going back to jail for things I didn't do.

Do I leave a note?
