Finishing the job after 7 yearsI'm done with life. I tried to take it 7 years ago and didn't have the strength to neither drop it nor go through with it. I forfeited my life 7 years ago by not being able to follow through with any decision and have instead been a parasite, sucking time and resources out of those around me. Time to stop being a burden and finish my job.
