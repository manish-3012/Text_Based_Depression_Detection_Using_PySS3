jesus.People are just so horrible and I canâ€™t connect to anyone anymore. Some are so judgmental and rude and others just donâ€™t give a shit. Im lonely and I need help. Iâ€™ve asked, nobody helps me. Iâ€™m too afraid to be my true self because of what Iâ€™ve been through. I need help, but I canâ€™t rely on anyone. Iâ€™m ugly, and on the chunky side. I donâ€™t want to change myself so I can get help. Others donâ€™t get that. I can sound mean when I donâ€™t intend to be, but I treat others with respect that others do not give to me. I canâ€™t find love, my â€œfriendsâ€ donâ€™t care about me like I do them. I wonâ€™t bother anyone anymore.
