Iâ€™m suicidalIâ€™ve get this fog over my brain for a few months now. I had enjoyed a short period of time where I felt positive. But the negativity has came back. 

I have been considering suicide for the past four days. It keeps popping into my head. Like how to leave all my paperwork so someone can easily organise my affairs when Iâ€™m dead. And writing a letter to the person I want to take my dog because I know my dog will have a better life with that person. 

My head is so fucked up. A close friend was so horrible to me this morning. I feel distant from so many people. I donâ€™t know who I can talk to right now.
