BirthdayToday is my birthday. Mid20's, got laid off a few months back, and I have no friends. I'm spending the night alone like always. Most years I'd go with my folks to some crappy restaurant, but I can't even do that this year. I feel so alone that I'm in tears. I wish I had someone in my life that actually cared for me and that I could care for in return. Someone to hug and to be happy with. But I've been single my whole life and have no chance of ever finding anybody. I want to die. There's no reason for me to be here. Nobody cares; they're just being polite. Words don't mean anything if there's no action to back them up.
