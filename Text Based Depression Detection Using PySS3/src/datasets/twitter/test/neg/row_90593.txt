Is it ok?Is it ok to not have anything to be sad about but still sad? Seriously, everyone has such hard backstories that make them feel sad and depressed; but my life is great and Iâ€™m still sad and I hate myself for not being grateful. I have everything I could ever ask for and then some and I still think about dying all the time.
