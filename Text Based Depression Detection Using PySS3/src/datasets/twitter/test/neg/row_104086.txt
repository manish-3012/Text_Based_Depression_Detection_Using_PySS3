I just need to let this out, Reddit.Okay.. so, basically I'm going through hell right now. My grandfather is dying, my mother is on alcohol and pills (thanks to her abusive boyfriend). She was in the abused womans shelter for awhile, but she had to get out. Her boyfriend said he didnt want her in the house anymore, so she had to get a apartment. My friends all left me, my boyfriend broke up with me for some other girl, and I'm getting bullied pretty badly. I got pushed down the stairs, my hand slammed in the door, I'm told everyday that I am useless and a waste of space. I hear them all talking about me, calling me a  bitch, ugly as hell, etc.. there were even a few notes that said "Die. No one likes you." Theres no point in telling the principal, they're gone for a week then come back, worse than before.Being called an emo bitch everyday.. and I'm sick of it. I live at my grandparents house, so I'm pretty much helpless. Shes an alcoholic and threw a glass cup at my head. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel so helpless. We barely even have money anymore. I feel like such a fuck up, and I don't even know why. Help, someone?
