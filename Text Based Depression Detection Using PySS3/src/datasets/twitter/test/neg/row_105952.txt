2 for 2Moved away from my hometown 3 years ago. Friends basically disowned me, family is either abusive or strangers, nothing left for me there.

The only thing keeping me holding on is that I had people that needed me; my wife, and my boss.

2 weeks ago, my wife left me.

Today I got fired.

I'm 31, have an obscure GED, a spotty work history (this is the only job I've had past 3 months), and can't answer interview questions "correctly". Especially online, where they reword the question and I understand it differently, so I answer differently. 

This is due to a learning disability that affects my comprehension and communication skills. On top of that, I have trouble with tone and ask a lot of questions,  so I come across as defiant. 

I don't have a backup plan, and I'm confident I can't bounce back from this.  Who needs someone with the qualifications of a teenager, but with half the durability?
