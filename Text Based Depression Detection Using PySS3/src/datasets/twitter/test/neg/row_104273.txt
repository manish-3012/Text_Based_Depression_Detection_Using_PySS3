Anyone else find life to much work and just not worth itI'm living for nothing. Don't care about money (only buy food), struggle to make friends, self esteem issues so no gf. Can't get myself to study when I'm living for nothing. Just be easier to end it all but no I can't even do that as it would abousulty destroy my mum. Just cba trying to fix my so many issues
