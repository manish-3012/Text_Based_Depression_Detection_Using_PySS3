I have no more energy for lifeHey, so im 20 year old dude living in lithuania. Life literally sucks to me in all ways. I was planing to kill myself on april but things got better, meditation helped me and everything seemed better. Now i see that nothing is right and im going down. i do nothing, that makes me happy . On days off from studies i drink and other days i do nothing but study. I dont have any more motivation for anything and i dont see how can i change anything and hanging myself i see as a real option. Probably gonna drunk hard and kill myself soon. I really wanna live but i dont think that i can reach success in anything. Im fucking loser im not good in anything and im bad at everything.
