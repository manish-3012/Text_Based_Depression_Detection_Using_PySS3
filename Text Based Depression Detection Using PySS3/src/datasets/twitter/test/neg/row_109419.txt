I don't want to kill myselfI don't want to kill myself, I just want to do something really fucking stupid like drive my car into a tree or trip down a flight of stairs. Just something to take away the suffering of everyday life. I don't want to die, I just want something big to happen, something serious to make myself and everybody else reset the way they think of me. I have ADHD, and it's making my life hell at the moment, especially the trouble with emotional regulation. It's tearing my girlfriend and me apart because I can't remember shit, I don't have any enthusiasm, and the more this happens and the less I remember what she's said the more shit I feel, and the harder it becomes to snap myself out of it. I just wish I could restart my life from a blank slate, no connections, no ties, just live at my own pace, no mental burdens holding me back. I envy those who can meander through life happily, whereas I overthink every single decision I make and I have to deal with constant thoughts and ideas swirling around my head every single second of the day. No matter what decision i make, I'll think to myself it was the wrong one. I cannot be content with my life at the moment, I do nothing but try my best despite having experienced a fair deal of trauma through my life. What's the price to be happy?
