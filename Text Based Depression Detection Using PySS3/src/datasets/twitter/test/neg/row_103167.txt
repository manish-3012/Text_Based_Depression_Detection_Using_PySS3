I'm just fighting for the inevitableLast night I layed in my bed, crying, because I realized one thing, I'm fighting for the inevitable. One day I am either going to end my life or die. I can't see the point in fighting anymore. All day everyday I want to end it and I can't think about anything else. I have friends to talk to who help me alot but I am still in the idea I'm fighting for nothing, fighting the inevitable.
