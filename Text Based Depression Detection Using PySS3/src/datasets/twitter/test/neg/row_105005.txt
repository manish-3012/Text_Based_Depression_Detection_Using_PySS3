There's nothing to live for.I'm not content with anything. Drugs don't help, therapy doesn't help, being admitted doesn't help. Relationships don't help, job doesn't help, school doesn't help. I have nothing. I'm in massive debt, can't finish a degree. I have a shitty job. I'm a terrible girlfriend. I dream what its like to not have to suffer anymore. I've endured so much. From childhood abuse, sexual assault, countlessly being taken advantage of. No matter how hard I try not to play the victim, life just makes me one. 

I desperately wish I could be content. That I could have had a happy life. But I am worthless and disgusting.
