It doesnâ€™t matter to me if I live or dieSo... up until I was 13 I had a pretty good childhood, after that it was difficult. Iâ€™m not going to get into it bc I feel that thereâ€™s no point, but Iâ€™m 22 now. For the past 3 years my life has felt on pause. Like nothing of value has happened. I overcame most of the struggles that I went through 13-17, but sometimes I feel I was supposed to die around 18. Since then, especially the past 2 years my life has felt meaningless. I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m meant to be around anymore, and that doesnâ€™t really scare me. The thought of death doesnâ€™t scare me, to me death is just a refresh button to move onto the next life. Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m supposed to be done. Thereâ€™s a part of me that wonders if thereâ€™s more for me. More to experience. But the future just seems grey and no existent. I was in love. Thatâ€™s the closest thing Iâ€™ve experienced to what felt truly important in life. 
I would never commit suicide, but at the same time I feel apathetic towards living or dying. I live alone. Iâ€™m in college but I donâ€™t have a feeling of realness towards my future career. Things just feel eerie lately. Death is not bad or wrong, but at the same time if I were to die of natural causes (which I believe your eternal self decides onâ€” physical form &amp; higher consiousness) I would never want my family to feel it was their fault or suffer immense pain from it. Which of course they would. 
I just feel like thereâ€™s no real love in my life anymore. What is there anymore to live for. Is what it feels like.
