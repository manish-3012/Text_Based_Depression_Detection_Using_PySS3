My parent's biggest mistake was to give life to meToday I broke my PC for the third time in three months, while my parents are still paying for the new PC, and three days later I will begin computer engeneering on college, how am I gonna study? What is even the point anymore? I am done, I am a failure, a burden, a little shit that brakes everything, my parents have to pay so much money because of my mistakes. I dont have anything left, my PC is the only thing to me, I dont have friends, I am lonely as hell and with many problems, suicide is becoming more desirable as time passes by.
