A vent...fantasizing about suicide due to my pessimistic yet realistic (IMO) views on men. I feel like Iâ€™m delaying the inevitable...Itâ€™s long. If you want to read it, thank you. At least this might make me feel a little better. I want to scream. 

Growing up, like many girls, we have this belief that at some point we will meet a wonderful man and marry and have children. My childhood never wavered from this thought because I saw my parents in love and always have had true and strong values towards love, intimacy, and working as a â€œteamâ€ together to get through the hard times in life. 

In my teens, while I still remained true to these feelings, I believed that I knew Iâ€™d have to kiss some frogs before I found my prince. I knew of cheating men, lies, and actions without compassion, sympathy or empathy. I thought that stuff only happened to those who had troubling childhoods, missing parents, or severe trauma. I knew of these feelings towards men and I had them then, but they are stronger than ever now. Iâ€™ve never been so pessimistic but accepting of this reality than ever. 

Iâ€™ve being cheated on in every relationship (5 of them, ranging from 3 months to 4 years). Iâ€™ve been on the constant receiving end of actions that made me feel like I was never enough for my partner. However, the men Iâ€™m with and also not with, still comment to me about â€œhow Iâ€™m perfectâ€ and blah blah insert any compliment here. But my problem is when they finally have me. I am a firm believer now that any man who loves me will always wander to the other women out there at some point. Not because theyâ€™re better than me, but because itâ€™s another shiny, pretty object they're infatuated with for the moment. They donâ€™t care how it affects me in the long run ever. 

Iâ€™m a young, attractive female with a great body. When I do end up committing suicide, I am positive everyone will say they had no idea because they thought I had the â€œperfect lifeâ€. Iâ€™m educated, a lawyer, beautiful, confident, etc. Let me explain. 

I want to be sexy for someone who deserves it. I feel sexy. I am confident. I feel more confident about myself than ever. I have never felt insecure about my body or that I wasnâ€™t beautiful. When I was with a man though, I was constantly compared to other females. With every other female out there on the menu that is Instagram and Tik-Tok. I feel worthless. I feel less than every single time. Instead of someone paying attention to the beautiful sexy woman they have in front of them, they are constantly wondering what else is out there. Like I need a new trick or something to keep someoneâ€™s attention. Itâ€™s truly sad. And itâ€™s exhausting. And itâ€™s even more exhausting when they continue to come crawling back, begging me for forgiveness and to take them back. I still have two exâ€™s contacting me and sending things to my house to apologize. I havenâ€™t been in a relationship or had sex for two years. Online dating is even more depressing. You can only get so many men asking you if they can cum on your face or suck a fart out of your ass before it starts to effect you. 

Iâ€™m a relationship person to my core. Iâ€™ve never had a one night stand. Now more than ever, at 27, I know how much family means. Family is everything. The only reason I am still here is my family. It is the only reason (other than my cats) that I have not committed suicide. I run the visions through my head of what my parents and sisters reactions would be when they would find me in the garage on the floor with the car on. I canâ€™t bear to put them through that pain. But it keeps me in this pain. 

I fantasize about suicide almost daily now. It differs sometimes, but some days itâ€™s entirely all I think about. Every time I walk into a room, I think about it. The corner of the granite countertop? How nice would it be to hit my head on that so hard that I became unconscious, and if Iâ€™m lucky, hit myself hard enough so I bled and die. It would be nice. I look at my Christmas lights and wonder if they have the strength to hold my body up while I dangle from the ceiling or the staircase railing. While Iâ€™m walking down the stairs, I wonder about if I just stood from the top, took a deep breath, and let myself fall forward down the stairs. Would that be enough? Should I do it falling backwards, so I could hit my head sufficiently? 

I have found that the only thing that matters to me is family. The only thing keeping me on this Earth is family. I need a husband and children. I need a reason to be awake. To live. I love loving someone with everything I have. I love providing for someone. Cleaning for someone. Doing things for someone. But if I canâ€™t have that, because of the way the world is now, I think itâ€™s better for me to remove myself from this world entirely. I will not settle. 

I havenâ€™t decided when that timeline will be. And when it will end. I see no possibility at this point in any of my conclusions about men changing. In fact, the longer Iâ€™m alive, the more evidence I accumulate to solidify my conclusions... there hasnâ€™t been a man yet to prove me otherwise. 

I know. Everyone will tell me to seek therapy. I do. Iâ€™ve been going for the last five years. I see a psychiatrist as well. Itâ€™s hard to be in therapy because the therapist can only tell you so much. I know so much more about myself than she, and I know where my morals lie. She keeps telling me I will find someone, but I just donâ€™t know how much more my mentality can take. Even if itâ€™s just one more man to cheat on me. I simply cannot do it again. 

I will not settle. I will be eaten apart from the inside. And it will ruin the rest of me and make me regret not committing sooner. 

Thanks for reading.
