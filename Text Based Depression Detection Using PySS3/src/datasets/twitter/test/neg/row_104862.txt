AdriftI feel so alone. Surrounded by nothing but sea of my self-degrading thoughts and tears. I just want to sink into it, but some primal instinct drags me back to the surface. I try to call or for help, but my voice is overwhelmed by a tempest of my emotions. I am not strong enough to last. Perhaps, it was always too late to save me. Let the waves and storms and torrents come to wash away this insignificant speck and let the sea be calm.
