Iâ€™m so tired.Tired in a way that is deeper than I can explain. I donâ€™t want to start over again. Midlife and I have nothing now. I did all the right things, but now itâ€™s all gone. From six figures to barely surviving at a retail job. Everything hurts. I want to just sleep forever. I canâ€™t do this cycle again. Iâ€™ve given everything I have and it just keeps happening.
