I have suicidal thoughts all the timeSo Iâ€™m 13 and I have existential crisisâ€™s panic attacks and suicidal thoughts during most of my day. About 2 years ago 2 days before Christmas my mum saw that my dad has been texting another woman(their engaged now) and my mum and dad had a huge argument and my dad left but I had been having more suicidal thoughts before that. Since I was 4 my mum noticed there was something different about me to my siblings and she thought I was autistic so she kept pushing to try and get a diagnosis for me but it was hard since my dad was in the army so we moved around a lot, so when I went to school I was always neglected because everyone thought I was just naughty which is also the reason my dad abused me. So we moved to Northern Ireland and thatâ€™s where I got my autism diagnosis when I was 11, I got bullied at every school until then. Being abused and neglected for most of my life means that I have just wasted all my life and I want to go back to do something else and the thought that I canâ€™t go back and do something with my life just makes me really sad and depressed and my mum wonâ€™t even get me a therapist so I donâ€™t even no what I can do
