Needing SomethingI've been with my GF for 5 years and I moved to her home state to live with her. Last night she said we should break up and she isn't happy. I found out that she secretly went on a date a few days before this so I guess I should have seen this coming. I have no good friends around me I still have a year in college, I live 30 minutes away from my college and my car is breaking down, so I can't just leave. Everything is collapsing around me. I've been drinking but its not working. I don't want to face this.
