How to intervene when a sibling is suicidal.. please please help me.My sister is 19... sheâ€™s always been very different from my three sisters and I and Iâ€™m the oldest. Iâ€™ve watched her grow up and sheâ€™s always been more of a closed book compared. Sheâ€™s very sneaky and very mysterious so sheâ€™s hard for me to figure out and I usually can read people ... Iâ€™m doing something bad by keeping up with the social media that she has blocked and I watched her from an incognito account. She went from being extremely promiscuous , to announcing that her body is â€œjust a bodyâ€ and she act extremely extremely sexual. No judgment .. but she talks about sucking peoples dicks and makes herself such an object but it seems like itâ€™s not because sheâ€™s feeling empowered but in a way to get the wrong attention. She has attempted suicide twice.. her legs have tiger stripes from cuts she put on herself in middle school that I never knew about up until a year ago. My mom told me then I confronted her and she assured me it was because all her friends did it and she was stupid. But sheâ€™s hiding it because I found her tumblr and she glorifies mass killers and people like the theater killer and the Vegas killer. Lots of gore and death quotes and things indicating that she things death is the only solution for people and herself . But sheâ€™s never been a dangerous person ... it seems to be a social media outlet. I also found in her room where she wrote that she will never ever love another person. That she loves money and will do almost anything to get money. She writes that she hates living and breathing and it no longer seems to be a phase. My parents have blinders on and Iâ€™ve let my mom know and nothing is done about it. Iâ€™ve cried and screamed for her to do something and Iâ€™m not quite sure how to intervene without her feeling attacked ... she likes to say â€œyouâ€™re putting more stress on me by doing thisâ€ when trying to confront and help her. She seems very very depressed and sheâ€™s been on medication but stopped taking it that Iâ€™m aware of so she smokes weed.... 
her room is a mess and she has dildos and her shit laid out everywhere ... sheâ€™s stuck. What in the world can I do to help her. I make sure she knows I support her and that Iâ€™m there for her and Iâ€™ve talked with her about seeing a therapist and she said working helps her and she doesnâ€™t have the money or time but I canâ€™t force someone who doesnâ€™t want help... but I feel selfish not doing more I donâ€™t want to lose my little sister but Iâ€™m so prepared to and thatâ€™s so wrong I canâ€™t handle the thought of that but I also push it back while thinking about it everyday. I need advice ... had she been molested or something ? I donâ€™t and probably never will know because sheâ€™s so reserved .. Iâ€™m worried. Iâ€™m sad. Iâ€™m scared . Please someone help me in the right direction. Iâ€™m told the police could take her but then she would just feel crazy and not want the help because I know how these facilities can be..... I just need help from someone who can relate. Please .
