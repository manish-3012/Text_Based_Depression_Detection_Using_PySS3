I hate waking upWhile youâ€™re waking, you have no distractions so reality and all of your pain is able to hit you like a truck. Animals are at their most vulnerable between the transition from sleep to wake, so biologically it makes sense. Waking up is the most painful part of my day. Itâ€™s when I feel the worst. My chest feels heavy and my heart feels like itâ€™s aching. Feelings of being a failure, anxiety, dread, and disappointment is able to fully saturate me from head to toe because I have no shield up to protect me. The realization that Iâ€™m going to have to spend another day in this hell is excruciating in itself. It feels like impending doom.
