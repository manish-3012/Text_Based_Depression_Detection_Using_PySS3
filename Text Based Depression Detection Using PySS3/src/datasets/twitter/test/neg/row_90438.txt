618 days until I check outMy 30th birthday is the end of the line for me. I never asked to be born, I never wanted to be a part of society. I have no guilt whatsoever about anyone I leave behind, no emotional scarring that occurs. I'm not scared, I'm not sad and I'm not worried about what happens after I die. The only thing that keeps me going is the desire for a few new experiences and accomplishments that I can make happens before I leave. It makes me sad seeing all the time, money and effort I wasted on stupid shit, and what a hateful person I've become over the years. It makes me happy to have this layed out, it almost feels freeing. I have a finite amount of time left, I don't have to endure another 50 years of bullshit. As off as it sounds, I want to become a totally new person before i check out. I'm going to loose a bunch of weight. I've been low key obese my entire adult life, It will be neat to get into shape.I'm going to stick to a budget, witch I have never done. I'm going to stop sleeping until noon. I'm going to get up at 6 am every day. I am going to use the time I have left to become the person I always wished I was disciplined enough to become. 

why am I writing all of this out? I don't know, Just want someone to hear it. Comment, ask me questions whatever. I'm going to get a burger and fries.
