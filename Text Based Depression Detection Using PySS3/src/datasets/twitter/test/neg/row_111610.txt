See no point in anything anymoreI can't seem to get anything right, keep fucking up my sobriety which then fucks up my relationships and everything else in my life. I've been suicidal since  around the age of 12 but it's been rapidly getting worse over the past year, nearly jumped infront of a train a year ago but chickened out. I used to see so much joy, colour and love in life, but these days everything seems bleak, cold and pointless. I'm stuck in a rut and can't seem to get out, the only way looks like I should just go.
