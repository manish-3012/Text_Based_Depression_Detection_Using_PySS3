So here is my story and contemplation.....41M, Iâ€™ve recently developed an alcohol addiction. Very rarely drank prior to 6-8 months ago. I suffer from anxiety and insomnia. Iâ€™ve lost a job due to depression and anxiety, and alcohol. Basically being hung over and calling in sick because I feel like crap. I have 2 daughters. 18 &amp;13. Iâ€™m divorced but have a fiancÃ© I love dearly. I feel like Iâ€™m a burden to her. Iâ€™ve told her this. She basically tells me to get over it. Iâ€™ve planned everything out as far as buying the rope. My cousin hung himself a few months ago. I had spine surgery and got behind on support. I spent 3 days in jail because of it. I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t want to die, but I feel like all of my problems would just go away. I just donâ€™t want my children and fiancÃ© going through life thinking they could have done something. Iâ€™ve opened up to my fiancÃ© but I do t think sheâ€™s taken me seriously. I donâ€™t want to die, but I feel like it workdays solve a lot of problems. I canâ€™t bring myself to do the right thing. I spent 5 days in alcohol detox, which cost me my job, I went a week with it under control. Now Iâ€™m using again. Iâ€™ve basically been self medicating. Any advice?
