My emotions are like yoyosYesterday I was feeling okay, fine and today my mood just dips so badly once again. I feel deprived and hopeless, in pain. I am reduced to this case that holds my soul, nothing else. I imagine my death how it would take a lot of money to buy a stupid casket for my dead body but that money if spent on me right now, might buy me some hope, buy me some more days to live. I am tired of worrying, of the present and future. Deep in me, I don't care anymore. I am even tired of expressing my sadness, anger or all the circumstances that befall me in words. I honestly don't care. I wish I could purchase a deadly poison and i would just drink it and off myself. It's been so hopeless and exhausting.
