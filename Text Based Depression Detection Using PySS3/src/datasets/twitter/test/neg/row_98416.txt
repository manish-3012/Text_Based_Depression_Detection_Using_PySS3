So many attempts. Just so fucking tiredI don't know why I keep stopping myself every time. I don't have anything to live for still. I haven't talked to my own family in weeks and I'm not letting that change anytime soon. I've 2 friends left and I can only bring myself to partly tell one of them how bad things are. My ex doesn't even talk to me anymore since my parents apparently pushed her away even more after our breakup. I cant handle this loneliness and being miserable its just too fucking much. The one person I was talking to was someone I met in a game and after I made the mistake of adding them on Snapchat they found out my full name got in touch with my ex and then my parents and told them everything. Anything I was planning, how much I hurt myself and whats going on in my head. I cant trust anyone anymore not that there's anyone left in my life to trust. I've a test in the morning I'm going to fail like the rest of this college year so far. I'm just so tired of life. I don't wanna cry myself to sleep anymore. It isn't worth it waking up the morning after struggling to sleep at all every single night. Wish someone would just put me out of my fucking misery
