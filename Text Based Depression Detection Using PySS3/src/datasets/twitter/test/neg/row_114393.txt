Got cold feetIâ€™m not here for you to tell me that my life is worth living, or that this is just a bump in the road. Itâ€™s not. If itâ€™s not this particular problem it will be something else.

As a preface Iâ€™m autistic. Friendship IRL is impossible and Iâ€™ve just given up. The closet thing I had was a stepsister but puberty happened and screwed that up.

A week ago, a friend of mine left our friend group. They said it was for mental health reasonsâ€” which I should have understood, but it just didnâ€™t click this time.

They blocked me.

I have a lot of twitter alts because I roleplay, and I made a dumb decision and used those to try to talk to them.

I know, I know, I shouldnâ€™t have done that. Rule 1 of the Internet is not to do that.

Despite the fact they blocked me they look on my accounts. I have an account specifically for talking about my feelings and theyâ€™re looking at that one. My friend sent me a screencap of them talking about something I posted.

They said in the post they didnâ€™t want to be friends anymore.

Itâ€™s been going on for a week but it keeps flaring up. I can tell my other friends are getting tired of me being so sad.

My room has a window. Itâ€™s on the second floor and thereâ€™s not safety guards.

It wonâ€™t be long before this friend group leaves me behind like the last one.

Yeah I deserve it because Iâ€™m toxic and all that bullshit. I was going to jump today too, but I didnâ€™t.

I feel like Iâ€™m dying.
