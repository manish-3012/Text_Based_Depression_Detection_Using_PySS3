Due to underlying conditions, I have the choice of death and being isolated foreverI read that under 25's with intellectual disabilities have a 20% rate of death from coronavirus.  It's 6% for very sick over 80's and my 76 year old grandmother is less likely to die than me.

I must kill myself painlessly.  I can't live with the fact that someone 6 years below the average life expectancy is healthier than a YOUTH.  I am petrified.  I've barely started my life and yet I'm less healthy than someone who didn't grow up with a TV due to the fact they were a new invention.

This is not a way to live.  My grandmother wore baby gas masks during WW2 and was most likely born in a blacked out building and yet her family are visiting her without precautions.  The NHS did not exist until after she started attending school and now she is as fit and healthy as a young woman.

I cannot believe I am more likely to die than someone born in a blacked out building to someone born in 1905 wearing a gas mask.
