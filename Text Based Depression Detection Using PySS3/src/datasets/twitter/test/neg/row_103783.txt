Kid needs helpI'm 15. My name is anonymous bc I don't want the police n Shit knowing I'm suicidal. I have had suicidal thoughts all my life. A while ago (about 6 years) I told my mother about the thoughts n she took me to a psychiatrist. That didn't help she just repeated the same questions every week I went. I eventually quit. Recently the thoughts have become worse and I have thought about killing myself. I want to do it but I feel bad for some members of my family. What do I do?
