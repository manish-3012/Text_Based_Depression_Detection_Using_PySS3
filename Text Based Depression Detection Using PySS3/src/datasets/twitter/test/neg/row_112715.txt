You should have seen the smile on the babies face. That video got me thinking that I will never experience that. Ever since I received that video, my urge to kill myself has grown exponentially. Ive been in a state of depression that Iâ€™ve never been in before. Seeing that baby smile and hearing my sister laugh just got to me. Now ALL my thoughts as of recently have just been â€œwhen will i kill myselfâ€. Iâ€™ve already ordered a permit. Now Iâ€™m just waiting to hear back from the Sheriffs office to see if i get approved or not which I likely will. Then itâ€™s off to the gun store from there. 

I have it all planned out. Drive out 7 hours to the city where Iâ€™ve always wanted to live and then just shoot myself. Hopefully the river carries me away and no one finds me.
