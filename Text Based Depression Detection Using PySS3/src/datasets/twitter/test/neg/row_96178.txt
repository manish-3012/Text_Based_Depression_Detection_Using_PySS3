Tried to hang myself under a ceiling fan but failedI've been contemplating suicide for the last 7 years.My mom died when I was 9 years old.I'm 20.

Months ago I had hanged myself under a ceiling fan.I felt unconscious for a few seconds.There were red marks on my neck.
My breathing had almost stopped.Unfortunately, the attempt was unsuccessful as the technique I used was improper.

Tired of putting up with a face everyday, living with a sociopathic dad,i have no friends, never had a girlfriend and I'm short and unattractive.Even if I'm dead people would forget me after few months.
