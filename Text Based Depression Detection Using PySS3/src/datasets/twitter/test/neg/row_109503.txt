Stuck in this pit foreverIâ€™m stuck. Canâ€™t seem to help myself. Wanna die, but canâ€™t either. What the fuck. So Iâ€™m stuck. Really stuck. Honestly donâ€™t even want to get better anymore because Iâ€™ll always fall back in this pit so whatâ€™s the point? Getting accustomed to seeing others lead their lives while I waste mine away, day by day, hour by hour, stuck in this pit...
