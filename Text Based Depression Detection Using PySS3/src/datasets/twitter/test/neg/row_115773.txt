Wonders are killed by the WonderedPeople tell me that they'll be distraught and in disbelief and upset if i where to ever take my life. 
But they're are so many times when I wonder if it is the right thing to do. That sure people will be upset, but what if taking me away from everything would make everyone else so much happier. That it would make their lives easier. 
I feel like all i ever do anyway is mess things up, and ruin people's day. I hate thinking, that maybe everything would be better off without me around. 
And the more i think like this the more people that i end up hurting. 
I hurt someone that i deeply loved and respected as a friend.
And now i just don't know what to do.
