One of these I feel like I'm just going to do it. Like I can't cope. At some point I'll get over my fear of pain and end it.Self Harmed yesterday, starved myself for days because of my anorexia and I've been researching different suicide methods the whole morning.

Too scared to do it because of the possible pain trauma that would occur. Not to mention, If I surivive I'd probably be miserable.

So I'm stuck in this depressed, unproductive state. I feel empty and alone. Forgotten almost. Like I really dont matter to anyone. I'm just a waste of space.
