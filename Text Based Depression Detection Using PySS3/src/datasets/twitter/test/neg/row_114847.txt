What I saw today at Dollar Tree I've been depressed for over 5 years now, but it wasnt until lately that I have suicidal thoughts. I'm unemployed, failed 3 years of college due to anxiety and depression, and now starting over as a community college freshman at the age of 21, and still failing classes right now. All of my former bullies in high school(the reason for my depression) are going places, got into Yale, dating, or studying abroad, while I'm still stuck in my hometown dealing with the trauma everyday. 

It all adds up that the breaking point---last night, OK Ko, a cartoon show I really liked, ended. The final episode talked about growing up, and it really hit me hard. I hated myself for being stuck mentally at 14, still watching kid's cartoons and scared of people. I watched the show over and over for hours today, and for the first time, I planned to kill myself. I was going to wait until my family's asleep tonight, then I'll down my entire bottle of antidepressant and sleeping pills, with a cup of coffre with soy milk. 

A bit afterwards, my mom told me to buy some stuff from the Dollar Tree. I went, and at I saw the cashier's wrist. You know how they say that if you're a cutter, you cut across if you just want attendion, but you cut vertically if you truly want to die. She had like 10 long cuts, and all of them were vertical. Something about that scared me. I couldn't help but picture her being dead for real, and the thought was terrifying. Also, something about seeing someone who might also be going through suicial thought made me feel like I'm not alone.
I decided not to kill myself today.
