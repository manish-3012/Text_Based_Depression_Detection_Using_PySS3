I need help(life is just getting to hard and I am only 14)Backstory is that my sister has Autism so she gets cranky and hits her self and cryâ€™s which hurts me and she canâ€™t talk 

I am falling a little bit behind school work so I am stressed about that but still get arvange grades 

And I have no friends(only fake ones )

I canâ€™t take this anymore
