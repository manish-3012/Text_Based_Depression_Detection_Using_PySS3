Not Doing WellI got denied unemployment. I donâ€™t qualify for the stimulus. I have $50 to my name. The bills are piling up. I canâ€™t stay afloat anymore. My mom is immunocompromised. She said if I am to work I cannot live here anymore. So I will be living out of my car I guess. Iâ€™ve tried multiple times before. I might just leave and down all of my Zoloft in a parking lot four hours away. I canâ€™t do this anymore.
