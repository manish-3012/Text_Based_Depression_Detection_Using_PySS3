I don't see any point to keep on going15(F) I have mdd, sad, and depression from bullying (on the way I look mainly but how stupid I am aswell) since I was 12 and it has all been downhill from there. I live in my head and I don't have anything in common with people at school, my country is small and sports is the main thing where I live, I want to leave school but graduate the teachers all talk to me In a slow patronizing baby voice and some are mean, I fantasize about a nice job with friends who I can talk to and who like me and living in a nice place getting a job I'd like in the entertainment industry like L.A but I'm so fucking insane and stupid and ugly and in my head I'm not gonna be able to do anything or leave my country and my life won't amount to anything so I don't see literally any point in living, I wish I could go back and stop myself from getting bullied then I wouldn't have all this trauma and I'd be normal and not a freak. My mom hates me, she threatens to embarrass me in public cause she knows it triggers a panic attack and she is sick and tired of me. I'm petrified of never having real emotional connection with a real person and I'm so lonely (I live in the country) the only people I've had conversations with more than once in 3 months have been family members. I want to end my suffering, nobody cares
