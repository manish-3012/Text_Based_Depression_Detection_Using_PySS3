How many people here are actually pro-suicide?Whatâ€™s your stance on it? Are you pro-suicide or pro-killingyourself only? If you had the chance to press a button that would directly lead to human extinction would you do it? Why/why not? Are you nihilistic? Do your thoughts on suicide show through in your personality and daily life? No hate, Iâ€™m just curious and would love to see some discussion on this. Sorry if itâ€™s the wrong place for it though.
