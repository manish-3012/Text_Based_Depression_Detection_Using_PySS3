Glad I made itHey guys. Wanted to share this, incase it helps anyone. 

In November of 2015, I attempted suicide. It didn't work. Not even close. I thought it would, and I was totally prepared to die. When it didn't, I felt a mixture of disappointment and relief. 

Cut to: last October 2016. I was better, definitely better, but no where near close to being healed. I was depressed most weeks, and I often thought about suicide. This lasted up until around the beginning of January. Until then, I was still healing, and still trying to just get through life. 

Cut to: March 2017. I'd been feeling so much better. I was enjoying life, and for the first time in ages, I was enjoying getting out and going to class, and even seeing people. That's why I didn't see that Tuesday coming. Out of no where, the feelings hit me, and it was as if they'd never left. I was on campus, looking at everyone around me, feeling completely alone and completely done. I was determined to try again, only this time I wouldn't mess up.  
Only this time, my boyfriend saved me. He talked me through it, helped me through the night, and by the next morning I was on my way to feeling better again. You know how these things go. 

Finally, cut to: the end of March. I decided to begin applying for jobs (I graduate college in May.) I applied, and got denied, to many many places. I was beginning to get distraught, and I felt hopeless. At this point, I didn't know why I was alive. It felt like I had nothing going for me, and I was doomed to be worthless. (This process for me technically started in January, but I focused a lot on it in March.)
A week later a saw a job posting for a position that looked like it would fit me. Not thinking anything of it, or expecting a reply, I sent in my application. The next day I got an interview. That same day I was hired. 

Since then, it's only April. Today is April 22nd, 2017, and I am so thankful I was never successful in ending my life. This job that I thought nothing of, has changed my life. It is the job of my dreams. Each day I walk in to work so excited, and so so incredibly happy. After my first day, the first thing I thought to myself was "thank god I lived." 

Things CAN change. Things CAN turn around. I'm not saying I still don't struggle, or that I won't ever struggle again. Hell most nights are still hard, haha. But because I made it through, I got to experience this incredible opportunity to work for my dream company, doing what I LOVE to do. It only took 2 days for things to get dramatically better. 2 days. It's unfortunate I suffered for so long, and that most people have to, but I just wanted to tell someone my story in case anyone else feels trapped in how their life is going. I think I'll always struggle, but at least now I'm happy most days. 

If anyone needs someone to talk to, I'm here ðŸ˜Š
