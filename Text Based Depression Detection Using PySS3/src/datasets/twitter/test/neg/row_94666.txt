What is the objective value of a human life ?First of all, I don't condone or condemn suicide. I'm asking this from a completely neutral standpoint. What I want is merely a perspective. Let's say in a hypothetical situation where someone who has never had any form of friends and relationships and is waiting for their parents to pass away,  someone who has never contributed to society in any form, someone who will never help another human being, decides to disappear in a manner in which the remains will never be found by someone. What would be the argument against this act ?
