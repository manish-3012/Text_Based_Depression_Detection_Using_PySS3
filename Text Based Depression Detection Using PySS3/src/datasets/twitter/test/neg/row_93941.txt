It doesn't even elicit a strong feeling anymore...I use to get extremely upset when I got to this point. I'd be sobbing and pacing and nervously tugging at my hair. I just don't care anymore. That's what scares me, I've come to this extremely calm emotionless realization that I should just die. I'm lonely, I just want a family, the world feels like it's collapsing around me, and at this point in my life telling myself that it will all get better soon feels like a lie. If I could do my life over there's so many things I would do differently, but I know I can't. My family is a squabbling mess and I find my ability to relate to other people eroded by the day. I feel nothing but betrayal from the people I attempt to care for. 

I live near one of the most popular places in the world to kill yourself. I feel like jumping off of something tall to at least feel the thrill of falling before I die or doing the clean responsible method of ingesting some kind of poison. I find myself looking over ledges and wondering if it's tall enough to do it.

Holy shit, I fucking hate myself.
