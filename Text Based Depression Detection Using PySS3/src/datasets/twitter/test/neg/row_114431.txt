Just need to get this thought out.After a long and difficult conversation with my cruel and abusive mother, I can honestly say I feel more ready than ever. I want to be done. I donâ€™t want to be victim to this kind of hurt anymore. I donâ€™t want to be home to this kind of grief and pain. I want to be at peace. 

Twenty-five years of my family beating me down physically and mentally, and me trying and trying and trying to meet their approval, only to be rejected and disowned. 

The past six years, Iâ€™ve spent with a man I love. But like so many others in my life, he was very cruel for the first 4 years. Reinforced every horrific thing my parents made me feel and believe about myself. Now things are on the mend. We are in therapy together and it feels better. But after last night, all I want to do is as him for a divorce. Not because I want to be divorced from him, but because most days, heâ€™s the only thing keeping me here. I donâ€™t want him to find me. I donâ€™t want him financially burdened with funeral preparations. I donâ€™t want his tears shed over me. I want the last person who would notice my absence to no longer shoulder that responsibility so that I can disappear into oblivion.
