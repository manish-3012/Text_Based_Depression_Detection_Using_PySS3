My big dream literally died just nowHi,

Sorry to keep a brave face all this time, but literally my online reputation is half ruined due to a dumb decision I made as I countered the actions of others.

I don't want to kill myself, but I know that in the next couple weeks, if the problem doesn't solve itself, I'm going to feel really really suicidal and revert back to hold negative habits (self-seclusion, lack of self investment, online shopping, no focus on other things).

How do I keep going on regardless to focus on my goal and develop myself regardless? I just feel so stuck right now, like anything that I'll do is a joke.
