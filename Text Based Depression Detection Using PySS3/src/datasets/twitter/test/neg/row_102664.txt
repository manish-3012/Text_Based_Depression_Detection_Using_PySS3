I don't want to be an artist anymore.Why am I doing this to myself?  I don't ever feel like getting up for class in the mornings anymore.  Sometimes I just sleep through the entire day.  I'll grab my guitar and start writing music or I'll work on my story and for that small amount of time, I'm content with my life.  I hate drawing.  I hate the south.  I want something to change, but my short term goals keep changing.  Sometimes I think I should go into advertisement.  Other times, I feel like I should take up a vocation like welding.

Music is what I enjoy, but I went into art because the rest of my family plays music and they're much better than me.  My little brother is fifteen and has written award winning orchestral pieces!  How do I measure up to that?

My older brother gigs regularly.  He plays the bass and is probably the only person I personally know who really knows how to play it.  I'm just some hack who strums guitar and writes lyrics.  My mommy says I'm good, but that doesn't really mean a whole lot because mothers are supposed to like your music.

I don't like the south.  I'm going to a university here because my parents don't have enough money to send me anywhere else.  They won't let me take out student loans.  But what's worse is that I've spent two years taking art classes and I've finally realized that I don't like drawing or painting.  If I switched to a music major, I would have to be in school for four more years (at least) and my scholarship runs out in two.

A friend of mine walked up to me today.  He's been bothering me for a demo for nearly half a year and I continuously forget to give it to him.  Well, I forget because I have no interest in being related to his label.  But I'm too nice to say that I'm not interested.

My girlfriend decided that she finds sex demeaning.  We had a talk about it and she wants to call it quits because she doesn't think we can be happy together wanting two different things.  Iâ€™m beginning to wonder if she is actually gay.  Or maybe Iâ€™m just not that good in the sack.

After I got back to my room, I threw my tackle box full of charcoal against the door.  I smashed it because the handle kept coming off and I have no mind to fix the problem.

I want to live because I know my little brother is going to make more incredible music that I really, really donâ€™t want to miss out on.

I want to die because the songwriting industry is on itâ€™s way out.  Because I donâ€™t want to watch my girlfriend cry after we break up.  Because I canâ€™t compare to my brothers.  Because I donâ€™t like drawing.  Because I hate my fucking tackle box.  Because my bed is never made (and it bothers me).  

Because people listen to my music and say, â€œoh, thatâ€™s nice,â€.

Because everyone else seems to be getting along fine.

Because I spent three hundred dollars on a computer tablet that I never use, but I donâ€™t want to sell it because maybe Iâ€™ll want it back someday.

Because my friend Alex can say â€œAwesomeâ€ and everybody just thinks itâ€™s the funniest thing.

Because I canâ€™t speak in front of a crowd, but I can sing in front of one.

Because Iâ€™m starting to think that Iâ€™ve wasted the first half of my life doing nothing but drawing soldiers and maps and beating wooden swords over heads.  I used to enjoy playing Starfox late into the night and I never felt bad for it.  There was this one time where I woke up at three in the morning because I was at the end and was excited to finish.

I used to watch Bill Nye all the time.  My mom would pick up the movies from the library.  I fell asleep at a sleep over and some prick decided it would be funny to write, "Nick loves Bill Nye the science guy," all over me.  He was a bully.  I later took karate just to beat his ass to the ground.  I had to apologize to my sensei for misusing it.  But damn, I smiled in the back of my head all the way home after that.

My friends are all successful and happy in their majors.  They win awards all the time.  Our debate coach in high school just *loved* them.  I, on the other hand, was ignored.  Iâ€™ve never received any awards besides the ones from the reading fair.  Oh, and the geography and photography awards in highschool.  I got a little trophy.  But Iâ€™ve never actually been recognized for doing the things that I love.

I want to die because I let life make a bitch out of me and now I donâ€™t have the will or drive to change it.

What I want to do is disappear and never come back.  I don't want anyone to find my body.  It's likely that they'll never know I was gone.
