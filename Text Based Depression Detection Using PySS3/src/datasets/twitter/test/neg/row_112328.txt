Just was informed that last night a father of one of my best friend's in college past away, what is the best way to show my condolences?  Any help would be greatHere's a longer story.

I met him my Sophomore year of college, and throughout the next 4 years we hung out religiously. After graduation, we went our separate ways, but still kept in touch (through Facebook/Text, the occasional get-together). The last time I spent time with him was around a month ago. I found out today that his father committed suicide last night (apparently him and his wife were getting a divorce that was to be finalized yesterday). The wake is Saturday, and of course I already have plans, and won't be able to attend.

Me and a group of friends have prepared to get him flowers, cards, support, etc. We have also planned to have all of us hang out, much like we did in college, that night, in case he needs to just sort of get away from the pain. However I really don't want to wait till then to give him support

Do I send him a text? Call? or do I wait till Saturday to give my condolences? Anyone have any previous experience with this type of situation and care to help me? Thanks Reddit

We do not live close, We live about 5-6 hours apart, however I am real close to his family's home, but I do not know his family.

EDIT: After talking to other friends, I have dropped my plans altogether, and will be attending the wake, as we are going all together to show our support, and plan on giving flowers, monetary value, and having everyone over afterwords for when he is ready to get away from family and have a good time with his friends
