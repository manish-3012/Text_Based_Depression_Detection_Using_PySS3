Feels like I'm not worth anything at allI'm a guy in his late teen years. I just feel numb at everything. Had a few attempts when I was 4-9th grade, it went horrible. I thought that parents give you support, but all they do is to mock me/bully me for what I do and how I look like. I just feel like not trusting anyone, I fucking hate my life so much. It hurts so bad, I just want to end it.

Now I can't even cry for tiny bit because of the negative stereotypes that I get, from being called gay to being yelled at for crying over a stupid thing. I just wanted to release my emotions, only more personal now.

I just feel like my life's spiralling out of control. I told people that I know that I have this shit and that shit, and that I needed a therapist so I can improve. But shit just told me that it's not worth going to any therapists and that I can deal with it myself. Told me to not think about it and it'll all get better.

Life has no meaning anymore. I'm not looking towards my future, it's just dark and small that I don't think I can reach, even with great effort, y'know. I'm not significant, when I die, nothing will change except for he fact that I disappear, but it's not that big of deal.

I wanna feel what love is, but it just gives me a terrible day whenever I feel happy. Constantly being judge by society, I can't cry because I'm a man. I feel shunned by everyone in my area, because i feel "Different" and don't belong to anyone at all.

I'm just tormented by my constant negative thoughts , drowning inside my own mind, trapped inside my own bottled up feelings. But I just don't feel like opening up to anyone. Always have I been hating myself, being isolated with my own insecurities about everything.

Made a few cuts on my arm, and I feel like wanting to do it again. It's the only thing that releases me from the stress I experience. Lost several of my friends due to how I acted. Now I just, Idk anymore. I just feel like jumping off a building, putting a gun to my head, sleeping pills, just anything to end my life forever.

I'm so fucking sorry that I'm such a disappointment to y'all, i just can't take it anymore. I'm sorry. I'm just so sorry. I am a worthless living piece of shit, living life isn't worth it anymore. I just take up so much oxygen when better people need it.

I just feel sorry for the people who are with me. They don't know I'm just a biodegradable piece of shit ready to be thrown out. I'm just really sorry about everything I have done. I tried my best to make things right, but I can't, no matter how hard I try. I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry I keep bottling up my feelings. I know I'm not anything significant, so I'm just gonna take away my life here and there. I won't hesistate, it's not that hard to do, anyways. All it takes is just one click of a trigger, one cup full of pills, one leap off a ledge, and one hang to end it forever.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
