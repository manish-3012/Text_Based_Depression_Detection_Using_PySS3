I haven't felt this bad about being alive in a long time.Hello, you know who I am. Or at least, I hope you don't. It doesn't really fucking matter, does it? I feel like you all know me and hate me anyway.

I've never been here before, but I can never shake the feeling that everyone in the world knows who I am and knows what I've done and wants to punish me for it, I can't stop feeling like I'm being watched. I fucking hate myself, and I feel as if you hate me too.

This isn't just out of my self-hatred, however. For some reason, I just... don't feel emotions. Aside from anger and disarray, I have never felt an emotion in my life. Not even fear, just... emptiness. I don't know what this means. 

It's been almost a whole year since I tried to do it last time, and after that, things started to get better for a while. But it all came crashing down again, like I knew it would. School started to get even harder than it ever had been before, and I know that I'll never become successful as an author. I might as well quit now.

What really tipped me over the edge was the fact that my sister nearly killed herself too. I feel like it was my fault. I get mad at her over stupid stuff sometimes. It must be my fault, just like everything else. If I weren't born, my mother probably wouldn't have gotten the brain tumor that ruined her life.

Anyway, I was just hoping to maybe get some words to convince me that life wasn't so bad. However, I don't think that will be the case. I'm desperate for a way to make the pain go away, though. If killing myself is the only way to do it, then I will.
