I'll die aloneI just finished high school. And I feel very lonely.  It wasnâ€™t the best 4 years of my life. I literaly spent my time with no friends, no one to talk to, daydreaming and crying in the corner.
Being 5'9 female sucks. Especially if youâ€™re unattractive and overweight like me. No one cares about you.
Iâ€™m still a virgin. Iâ€™ve never been asked out. Never had my first kiss. Never been hugged.  Never been in a relationshipâ€¦ Never rejected someone. But instead, I was rejected. Many times. I've always been someone really vulnerable, optimistic, romanticâ€¦When I was 10, I thought Iâ€™ll have many friends and romantic partners. I thought life would be easy, exciting and that everyone would like meâ€¦.I was so wrong. 
Iâ€™m 19 years old and lesbian. I canâ€™t imagine a life without a significant other.
I get avoided for any contact, no one even wants to sit by me on the bus. People avoid eye contact with me, girls only want to talk to my cousin and leave me out of plansâ€¦
People my age had at least 4 girlfriends. 
I realized that many lesbians (where I live) are like men, they like pretty girls, those who are short, with big boobs, and fancy makeup (usually straight girls). They wonâ€™t even look at me because if men donâ€™t find me attractive, it means Iâ€™m too ugly for them as well.
It sucks being discriminated in lesbian community where youâ€™re supposed to feel like at home. Iâ€™ll probably marry a man and be unhappy for the rest of my life (if someone wanted to marry me).
I guess, Iâ€™ll die alone in my parents apartment, in my room, in front of my pc. Thatâ€™s all I have.
I really want to die. I just canâ€™t magically become someone attractive enough to be cared about.
