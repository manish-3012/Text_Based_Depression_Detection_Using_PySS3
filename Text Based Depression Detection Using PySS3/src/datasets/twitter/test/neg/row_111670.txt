I never thought I'd post to this subreddit. But here I am, this may be the night.I'll keep my story short. I've been bullied a lot, fought a lot of depression, rejection, and the feeling of always being alone. I'm 18. Fought through the phase of feeling alone and emotionally unstable but I've realized that the depression never goes away. The feeling of low self-esteem. The feeling of just suicidal thoughts honestly. The only thing I've ever had dear to me is my best friend and I know I never lived up to her expectations. I never was good enough for her and it's falling apart. The one thing I honestly look towards and it's all disappearing. I never really talked about my problems but when I did, I would always feel like shit because I mixed them with one thing that I never wanted to. 

Life has been going down lately. People are growing up, doing what they want and I cant. I feel stuck in the same place, places i don't want to be. And it's ending around me. It has to happen. I've been hurt enough and I don't want to move further. I leave behind so much for that silence. That ever ending silence. I think I'm ready. I've been so afraid but tonight, I think I'm ready. 

I heard sleeping pills are the best method. I'll start on that.
