I really want to commit suicide.My stepdad just pulled the last string that unwound me. 
He's called both me and my mother multiple names, but today he called me a sorry ass lazy fat bitch for putting two dirty dishes in the oven. He continued to call me a sorry bitch until my mom got home, who agreed with him and slapped me (she missed) and my stepdad yelled at her, calling her a bitch, and told her she didn't really care unless I tasted blood in my mouth. The other day, he called me a stupid bitch because my bird's cage was too close to the only ladder of the bunk bed for me to be able to climb it without potentially hurting my baby bird. I love this bird so much that when I was told he'd be sold away if I didn't do well in school, I'd cut myself. I went to the school counsellor who called my mom. My mom just said, "stop doing things just for attention from your friends."  Yeah. I have to do a lot to keep myself from screaming at my stepdad or slapping him. I choked myself gently while I was being called names and my mom almost saw what I was doing. She probably would've slapped me if she saw me. I hate my life because of this... But I probably sound like a spoiled brat. If anybody has some advice, I'd love it. It would really help because I might end up in the hospital sooner or later if I can't stop.
