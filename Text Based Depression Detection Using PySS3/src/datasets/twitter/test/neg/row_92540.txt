I really don't know anymoreHey, new here. I just need to rant a bit about this year. I seem to have lost everything, I was in a relationship that ended badly. Fight after fight. im still fucked up from that relationship, while my Ex is out living his best life im still struggling to cope with our breakup, I know it's not my fault but i somehow find a way to blame myself. I lost my best friend to another group of people that are better than me, I used to come to her for advice and i would tell her about my problems. Now she's moved on and im just alone. Im  a track athlete but i ended up injuring my knee and now i can't run as fast i could. I just feel defeated. I lost everything. I've been self harming to cope with all this but even that doesn't help. I really don't know what to do anymore
