Slightly drunk and not sure whatâ€™s aheadIâ€™m really sorry for any mistakes in typing and grammar but Iâ€™ve a little too much whiskey in me to care. Maybe the length too, not sure how long Iâ€™ll keep going for.  Tonight we celebrated my Dads 50th and I was really unsure how tonight would go as the last few times Iâ€™ve drank Iâ€™ve ended up in an emotional mess with two different groups of people(twice in the one night for a certain group, but both times were family). I have went through quite a lot of shit over Iâ€™d say the last 4 years but for at least the next 4 years I canâ€™t move on properly with my life if that makes any sense. Every day seems like a day to just exist and I just donâ€™t know what to say. Up until about 3 years ago my dad didnâ€™t understand what depression and suicide was until I was going through myself. He said that me going through school was just normal about getting bullied but he just didnâ€™t know the extent until now. The main thing that is keeping me going is the fact that Iâ€™ve finally got a younger brother that Iâ€™ve always dreamed off, yeah heâ€™s around for 10 years but how on earth do you tell him that his older brother would rather commit suicide that stick around in this world. Iâ€™m probably not making much sense but I just needed to throw out what was in my head and Iâ€™m nearly sure my family isnâ€™t on Reddit. Iâ€™m really unsure of whatâ€™s ahead but in the same frame of mind I donâ€™t want to be here
