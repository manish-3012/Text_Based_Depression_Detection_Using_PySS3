I want to die but I don't want to kill myself at the same timeHi,

I read a few posts on here so I went ahead and created an account.

I have horrible panic attacks to the point where I can't breathe, I had one in early hours of today and today morning. I am stressed and anxious and depressed all at the same time.

I feel numb and exhausted both mentally and physically. I don't take care of myself, I cannot even make myself shower most days nor brush my hair. I am in education and working at the same time. I have dreams. Dreams I don't want to give up. When I want to give up, theres this small percent that tells me I should get through it.

I am so physically and mentally exhausted and tired its unreal. I barely have any energy for anything.

I want to die but I don't want to give grief to my mum who has suffered herself all her life and given me the most amount of love and care to me that she could ever give. I am also scared that if I died, this would make her life miserable and there would be no-one to look after her like I will and do.

I need help. I need a routine. I need something. I have lost interests in everything I found interesting - I loved photography, loved poetry. I do not do any self care. Don't exercise. Don't drive. 

I want someone to plan my life and schedule out so I can just follow it. I know this sounds stupid but I just want anything to help me to manage and sort my life. Is it normal to be this mentally and physically exhausted and wake up out of breath frequently.

I am 24, I have completed my 3 year degree for law. I am currently on route to becoming a solicitor. Most times I want to throw it all away.

This is my cry for help.
