Tired and ready to goI have reached a point in my life that there truly is no more joy left. My wife abuses me mentally, my daughter is 26 and has not had a job for 3 years after graduating with a master degree in a field she is not qualified for. My sons are finishing college this year after we have paid over 200,000 for education. My daughter steals money from us so she can live like a Kardasion. My wife gaslights me every day. Too complicated to leave. Iâ€™m tired and ready for the comfort of the Lord Jesus. Will I go to hell if I kill myself. So, so tiered!!
