another Friday another emotional breakdownI should be going out with friends or whatever normal people do on the weekend but instead i'm alone in my room thinking of ways to kill myself. My heart just feels so heavy everything hurts. The only good thing to come from this breakdown was me bleaching my eyebrows off for no reason so at least I look like a cool alien, a depressed cool alien.
