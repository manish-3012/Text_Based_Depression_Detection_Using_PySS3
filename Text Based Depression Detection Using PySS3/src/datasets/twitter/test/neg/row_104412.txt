Do you ever fantasize about how much better the world would be without youI always think about every aspect of the world I have effect on and how it would be improved if I wasn't there. I like to think about every possible case, every person, every little thing, and how it's improved when I'm not a part of it.

My death is a net gain for everybody. Imagining a world without me in it is so exciting. I'm looking forward to creating it.
