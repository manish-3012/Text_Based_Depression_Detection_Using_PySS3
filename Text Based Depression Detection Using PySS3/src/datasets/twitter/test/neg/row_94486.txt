I'm the closest I've ever been. I'm content.Wow, I've surprised myself to be honest. I didn't think I'd be here. I'm truly on the verge. I know for a fact I haven't thought this through. I know I'll be hurting a number of people that I leave behind. But I don't think it matters in the long run. Their hurt will be short and this is better for everyone in the long run.

I am simply content with killing myself. I don't know if I'm actually going to or not. But I have never been this at peace with it.

I'm content with ending my life.
