Itâ€™s my 20th todaySo I thought Iâ€™d post this because Iâ€™m taking a tiny break in order to keep it all down, Iâ€™ve swallowed a bunch of pills and I donâ€™t plan on stopping. 

I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s selfish, whatâ€™s selfish is watching your friend, brother or son go through this when all they do is beg for help.

Iâ€™m not here for pity or for attention from strangers.

Iâ€™m here to vent that last bit of frustration I have.

Iâ€™m here to let you all know that while people preach it gets better, it doesnâ€™t always. 

Peace out guys and happy 20th to me
