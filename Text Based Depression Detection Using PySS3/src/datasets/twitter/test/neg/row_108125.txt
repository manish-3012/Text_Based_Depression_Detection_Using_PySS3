Are anyone elseâ€™s parents like this when you try talking about mental health?It seems all of the few times Iâ€™ve either broken down or gotten the courage to talk to my parents about how Iâ€™ve been feeling mentally, they donâ€™t really seem to take it that serious. They tell me theyâ€™ll find someone for me to go to so I can get help but after about a week they pretend we never spoke about it. They probably just think itâ€™s teenage hormones but come on, when your kid says they think they have depression and anxiety I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s just fucking hormones. But whatever I guess, if one day I commit suicide itâ€™s because I tried to get help but never got it.

Also Iâ€™m not about to talk to my school counselor. School is the last place I want to bring my problems to.
