Where to begin.A brief summary. 

I am an early twenties, Caucasian, male, living in a rented house with my partner and my 3 year old daughter and a 10 year old dog. I am unemployed, and am supposed to be 2 years into a 3 year university degree. I live in a first world nation and have no physical disabilities. 

I have a serious gambling problem. I have sought help, and am being lead towards cognitive behavioural therapy as a solution. I have spent approximately 8-10k of my own money and approximately 6-7k of my family's money. I have also just recently maxed out two low limit credit cards and cannot afford to pay my daughters nursery fees. I am seriously in debt. I haven't told anyone. 

In the autumn of 2014 I agreed to undertake a 3 year course to further my career prospects. In February of 2015 I stopped going and didn't tell anyone. I have no idea why. I was allowed to retake this first year of this course and started in September of last year. I haven't attended a single lecture. I am going to be asked to leave next week and have racked up approximately 30-40k of student loan debt. No one has any idea. 

I have applied for a job at a bank, if I get this things might turn around. If I don't, I have no idea what to do. 

There's more. I'm just struggling to compose all of my thoughts right now. 

I spend everyday waking up filled with sadness. Going to bed filled with sadness. I do almost nothing all day. I have no motivation. No appetite. No desire for anything. 

My partner resents me for some lies I told in the past. We do not have a loving relationship. She has a decent job and has made a good go of herself. I am very proud of her. 

I don't know if I want to be helped. So I don't know why I'm posting on here. I'm so very and completely lost.
