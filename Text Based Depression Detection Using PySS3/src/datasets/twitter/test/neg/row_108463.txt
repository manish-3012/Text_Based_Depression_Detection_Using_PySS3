I triggered my depressionThere is this thing I do that triggers a terrible depression episode every time I do it. But I cannot not do it. It's very important to me. It's happening now and I feel terrible. My mind feels broken and cannot process what is happening in my life.

Now I am snapping out of it a little bit. Writing is helping. I was reading all these articles. They all tell you to seek help. When I seek help there is nothing there. Not even a help line I could call. Nothing. No one to talk to.  Life is in pieces. Too many pieces. Too many broken pieces...
