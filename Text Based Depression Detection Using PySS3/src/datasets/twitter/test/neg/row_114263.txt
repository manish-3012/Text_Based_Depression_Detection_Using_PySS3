I guess some of us get dealt a shitty hand in life.I don't think I'm gonna kill myself, maybe I'm a coward (or maybe I'm too brave?), But I fucked up so much, that everyone in my life, even the people closest to me hate me. I'm utterly alone, I have absolutely no future planned, I spend my days drinking in front of a TV, watching reruns of The Sopranos, and sometimes I have this voice in my head whining (Why me? Why now? What if?) Well boo-fucking-hoo, I made my choice to alienate everyone in my life, to degrade myself to a miserable piece of shit wino. But maybe there is a way from all this. Maybe the voice is right. The day I'm gonna sober up and face reality I'm gonna cry like a little bitch. I don't want to be perfect, I want to better. To feel happy again, to love and feel loved. If I can't crawl from this shithole I'm in, maybe I'm better off dead. I had no choice in becoming mentally ill, I had no choice in being emotionally unstable, and let's be fair, I had no choice in becoming an alcoholic, since this shit runs in my family for 4 generations. I'm just wondering If there are other people who managed to pull themselves from this. All I need is a glimmer of hope to start putting my shit together. We only live once, and I need to be absolutely sure that I fucked up beyond any repair to end it once and for all. I feel trapped. I lost everything because of my habit and my illness, and I'm a young man. I really hope I can find something to live for, maybe a stray cat that I can take in, otherwise I'm gonna hang myself. And what's worse I think it will take a month or two for someone to come looking for me, or the neighbors complain about the smell, by that time I'll be so badly decomposed I'll need a closed casket. And even then I don't think anyone will come to my funeral, and I'll be buried in an unmarked grave. I can't even have some dignity in my death...
