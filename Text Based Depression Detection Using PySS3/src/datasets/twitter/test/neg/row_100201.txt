I'm done, I just wanted to let you guys knowI just can't live with who I am anymore. Everyday I think about this girl, I swear she's amazing. I have been home-schooled for years so I'm very shy and socially awkward. I tried asking her out and she did say yes, but when i ask her when she's free she never is. I asked her about six times so i got the hint, she never wanted to go out with a fucking loser like me. For years I have been alone, sad everyday. I have been diagnosed with dysthymic disorder, grade two spondylolistheis, displastic moles which could turn to melanoma, and lead poisoning. All I want is for someone to care, because I hate myself so much I need something to balance that out. So tonight's the night, I'm done.

Edit: To whomever left me a month of reddit gold. Thank you, seriously. I kinda felt guilty when someone spent $4 on me. Idk I kinda feel bad you spent that on me. I didn't want anyone to throw me anything because i wanted to kill myself. But thank you for doing that.
