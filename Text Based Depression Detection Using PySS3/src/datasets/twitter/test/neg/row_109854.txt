I have a good life. Why do I think about suicide for hours every single day?I won't go into too much detail, but here is a snippet. I have many great things in my life which I appreciate and do not take for granted. However, I think often of suicide. It used to come in spurts, when bad things happened, or anxiety built up. Then, it was one solid day per week where I thought logically about how and why I would do it. Now, no matter how many great things occur in my life, I spend about a quarter of each day thinking about the sweet release of death. Sometimes, it feels like the only comfort I can manage, or at least the strongest one. A couple things I have noticed: anxiety is a huge catalyst- I constantly feel uncomfortable inside my head. Also, hunger and tiredness cause the bad thoughts and anxiety to overwhelm me. It's annoying, as my bad mood makes eating undesireable, and not eating makes my mood worse. I work long hours where eating is forbidden and many times, not even possible. I'm thinking whatever is causing this shit storm no longer matters. I don't even want to fix it at this point. I just want it all to be over. On the bright side, if the trend continues, I will soon be spending every waking moment thinking of suicide, and the desire will surely overcome any reservations I currently have.

Anyway, thanks for listening! Have a good day.
