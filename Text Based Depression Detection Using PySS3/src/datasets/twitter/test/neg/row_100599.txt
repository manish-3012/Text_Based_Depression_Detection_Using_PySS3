Itâ€™s better this way.Iâ€™ve given away, what small things. Iâ€™ve had left, Iâ€™ve checked with my life insurance so my family could have more than enough to bury. Iâ€™ve wrote my last â€œletterâ€. Iâ€™m tired, I felt more at ease overseas, or back when my body wasnâ€™t so fucked up at a young age. I see no future, and an actually at peace. Iâ€™ve already cleaned my area, and had my last Shabang (huh... funny) Iâ€™ve setup my last finances to go to my immunotherapy center and so on, and to give those fighting or wanting to have a nice trip or what not. Sucks.. Iâ€™ll miss out on KH3 after a decade plus of waiting. But Iâ€™m drained, and my Sig is ready. Itâ€™s muthafuck the VA as well...
