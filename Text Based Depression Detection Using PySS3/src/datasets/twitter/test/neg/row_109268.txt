do medical professionals exaggerate the possibilities that couldâ€™ve happened after a failed suicide attempt?
after a suicide attempt, do medical professionals say â€œyou wouldâ€™ve died/gone into a coma etc. have you not gotten medical attention soonerâ€ just so you donâ€™t do it again? 

after my second overdose i was told i couldâ€™ve gone into cardiac arrest or a coma if i didnâ€™t get help when i did. are they serious or are they just saying it so i donâ€™t do it again (you know since it was my second.) I was in v-tach but it didnâ€™t feel like i was dying. i felt very unwell, but not like i was dying. 

also i am absolutely terrible at wording things in an organized way that makes sense so iâ€™m sorry if this seems worded wrong.

does anyone else feel this way?
