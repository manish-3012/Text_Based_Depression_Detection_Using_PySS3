Suicidal Boyfriend and Struggling MyselfLately life has been awful. My boyfriend constantly tells me he wants to take his own life and how sad/stressed he is. I love him to death but I donâ€™t know how to make him any happier. I always try my best when it comes to him, and get him anything he needs. I try my best to support him but when weâ€™re fighting or in a bad spot he wonâ€™t speak with me. I try to help him but Iâ€™m sure he doesnâ€™t want help himself. Nothing good even happens for him, heâ€™s all about negative thoughts. Iâ€™m really not sure what to do at this point. (Heâ€™s recently broken a bone because he became upset with me and took his angry out on a wall.) I feel like everything I do is the opposite he wants or makes things worse. I wish I could talk to him about how I feel but I feel like even that would make it worse. Everything in his life is tragic. What should I do? And please donâ€™t recommend calling 911 or recommend medical help because he hates therapy and ultimately he pushes the help that he gets away. Iâ€™ve been dealing with some medical issues with leave me physically not able to do errands or simple things and I donâ€™t get support from him, or even an are you okay? I do things with him even though I know they arenâ€™t good for my health but I do it because I donâ€™t want him to be lonely. I wish I knew what to do.
