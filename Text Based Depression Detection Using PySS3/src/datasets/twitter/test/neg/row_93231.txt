I feel like I'm being gaslit about my life mattering to others.Everyone says my life matters, I'm more than what I produce (which is nothing really, right now), but all their actions say otherwise. Why am I the one who's wrong when I'm just paying attention, trying to find some reason to keep living but only finding expectations that I can't meet?
