Need help with finding a doctorAlthough I'm not suicidal right now, I have been in the past, but I figured I need to see a doctor now before it gets bad again. Which it does seem to be starting up again: numbness, brain feels numb/fuzzy (sometimes I even feel disconnected from myself) and I'm unable to concentrate, irritated, becoming more reclusive, etc.

The thing is, I don't know how you "find" a doctor, especially after moving. And people have told me different things: go see a psychologist, or a psychiatrist, or a neurologist, etc.

I've been to a psychologist several times throughout my life, but the last time I went to one was back in high school (5 years ago) because of my parents divorce. Of course, I remember lying to the doctor a couple of times because I felt better and figured I didn't need his services.

Another thing is I have trouble explaining stuff to a doctor about the way I feel and that if I did tell them something they wouldn't believe me. I guess that is the reason I don't want to go.

I have insurance so I'm not worried about payments or anything. And I know that I'm not supposed to give out a lot of personal info, but if it helps I am now in the Marietta area of GA.

Thanks, r/sw.
