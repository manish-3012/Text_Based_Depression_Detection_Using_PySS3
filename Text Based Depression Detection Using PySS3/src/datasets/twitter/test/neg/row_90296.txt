I''m giving myself 4 months to get better.For the past 7 years my life has been in shambles. For 2 of those years, I was raped frequently by someone I trusted. For the first 5 years, I had no friends. For all of them I've had unmanageable depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder and psychosis. I have attempted suicide twice. My attendance has been at 70%. Things having been getting better recently but simply put me and this other person drifted out of friendship a few months ago and recently something happened that made me realize that there's no chance of us being friends again. She was the only reason I had momentary happiness and now she's gone forever I see no point in fighting. 
In July, I'm going on a trip to France with her. If things don't get better by the time the trip is over, either we're still not talking or I haven't managed to be happy without her, I'll kill myself. She was the only reason I survived and I promised myself I wouldn't lose her. But now it's all gone and it looks like I have no choice. So I've given myself 4 months, and if nothing happens, it's all over.
