I can't come up with a reason not to do itMy mom was right about me.  I'll never be anything.  I'll never be able to fend for myself.  I'll never be able to hold down my own living.  I'll never be able to be normal.  I'll never be mentally sound again.   I'll never be okay.   I've exhausted every resource and ability.  I'm exhausted, I've never felt a days rest in my life.   I can't relax, I don't know how, and can't create the environment to do so.   I don't know why I shouldn't go home, chug the bottle of sleeping pills, then chug the vodka I have there.   I can't come up with any reason.   My friends will forget me, they'll move on like they have been already.  My parents and family wish I was dead for as long as I can remember.   I hate my job.  I hate being completely self aware of being an autistic retard.   I hate being alive.  Who wants this?  Even if I somehow fixed myself, the planet is utterly fucked anyway.   Nothing I can do about it

I want to do it.   I think I'm going to do it, and that's the most comforting thought I've had my whole life.  I feel peace with the decision to kill myself.   I feel like the weight will soon be taken off my shoulders.   Why shouldn't I do it?  No one would miss me.  I hate me.
