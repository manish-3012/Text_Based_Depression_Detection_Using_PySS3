I donâ€™t really know where to post this but I want to kill myself so I guess it goes hereI really want to die, quite often. I just want to hang myself off the bridge near my house. Everything is difficult right now. I feel like ive changed for the worse as a person. I really think suicide will be how i die in the end, i donâ€™t really see myself living till 30. Im too goddamn sensitive to live, everything hurts me. I feel like such a fuck up and my death will bring everyone peace in the end.
