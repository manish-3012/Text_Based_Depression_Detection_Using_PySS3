I'm done with life. I don't want sympathy but just someone to listen to me and to give some advice.Today has been my worst and lowest point in life. Is my Story worth being suicidal?i know that life can be beautiful but it's not for me. 

Betrayed by colleagues: just recently started at a company, my colleagues are super nice to me and I am so naive to engage in their gossip and poured my heart out enough to tell them everything. They always gossip about the boss to me telling me how psycho the boss is, how much they hate her. And I honestly didn't like the boss either but I thought we had mutual trust so I told her.
Next day things turned real bad, my boss told me everything I told my colleagues they have told her and worse, they even said I backstabbed her while she wasn't here and that my behaviour was unacceptable. If only they knew how much crap was talked about behind her back! After my colleagues and I had so much laughter and secrets shared , it was all fake and a lie. I can't trust no one no more and I'm done. 
Family: told them I was upset and am jobless and they said it was my fault and that I should've just kept my mouth shut and not cause trouble. So much for thinking the only person I could talk to was my family but no they just had to throw some more rocks at my heart. Ended up breaking down and left the house, no call or nothing they don't even give a crap about me.
Money: I am jobless and struggling
Love life: I am not ugly but am a bit chubby due to being stressed and having comfort food. I've lacked self image love for my whole life and hate myself. Every date I've been on the guys won't look beyond my looks and just want skinny girls . I have told I've had a great personality but apparently men are just into hot women these days. I've been single for ages and have no luck. Maybe there's just something wrong with me.
I'm totally done with life and useless. I'm 23 and don't know what to do. As you can see my life is a mess in every aspect. Honest opinion, should I just die?
