Am I just dramatisizing everything?I was diagnosed last year of depression. I didn't take the drugs. I had several panic attacks but so far, okay? I mean, the depression is there, bugging me. But the responsibilities of being adult is keeping me on killing myself. It's not like I like those responsibilities, I just had to do it. 

Then these past few days, I felt it again, and this time, I can't carry it anymore. I didn't go to work in some days. I made up a bullshit excuse. I didn't go to work yesterday. I was planning to kill myself then. But got scared, scared that even on killing myself, I'll fail. The hotline didn't help. Went on my day playing D&amp;D and I felt okay. Woke up today, on my way to work, with dread. I turned back home and saw those 500 mg paracetamol(Can it kill you fast? Different sources say different things). I don't want a painful death but this is what is available.

Reading some posts here, I feel okay. Now, I feel like, I am just creating a drama out of my life.
