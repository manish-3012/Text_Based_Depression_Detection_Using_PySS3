Not importantThis isnâ€™t an important post I guess. But Iâ€™m so sick and tired of being told I donâ€™t do anything when I work over 40 hours a week on overnights at a gas station. It may seem like not much but I do it all I work overnight I work in the kitchen I work days I work doubles I do everything I can to make enough money to support the ones in my life. But itâ€™s never enough. Everyday my boyfriend tells me how worthless I am and how lazy I am. When I try to talk back about it he gets mad and pulls my hair and yells in my ear and tells me Iâ€™m a liar. I always get hit in the head so I constantly have headaches and Iâ€™m always tired because I get yelled at if I sleep during the day. I just donâ€™t know what to do. I do everything he tells me to do but somehow itâ€™s always wrong. I love to sleep because I can escape this whole life and dream of better things. Thatâ€™s why I want to die because then it will all be over. I wonâ€™t have no more pain no more stress no more weight to carry around. I just wish I could change my boyfriend back to the way he was before he started to be like this. I just want to be loved again... I want to feel love again the warmth of someone hugging you tightly when you come home from a long day at work  a kiss thatâ€™s not forced. Someone to just smile at you and say I love you sincerely. Instead I get punched slapped grabbed told how worthless I am and how stupid I am or I hate you you dumb whore. He use to be the best boyfriend now we are coming up on 4 years together and things just keep getting worse. I really want to end it all but my little cousin just tried to kill himself and I see how his mom is I donâ€™t want to do that to my family but then again the only one who would care is my mom and her side of the family my dad and his family could careless so Iâ€™m just feeling like maybe I should just do this one last thing for me so I can be happy finally because nothing else is gunna help. Sorry for such a long post but I have no one to talk to so I turned to this site.
