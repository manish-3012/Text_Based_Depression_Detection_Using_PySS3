I'm scaredI've been wanting to commit suicide for a long time but this morning, while I was thinking about it, I realized that I'm scared as f*ck. Is it normal? Or does it mean that I'm not ready? I feel like I MUST commit suicide at this point because I don't see my life getting any better. How can I beat fear?
