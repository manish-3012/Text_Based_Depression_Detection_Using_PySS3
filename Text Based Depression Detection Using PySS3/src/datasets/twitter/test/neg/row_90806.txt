Iâ€™m gonna try and make this short, but I feel like Iâ€™m gonna commit suicide tomorrow.So my life has been shit recent Iâ€™m honestly in a worse position than ever. Itâ€™s awful my job is in shambles with literally no wage and my love has cheated on me after 1 year. Iâ€™m at an all time low and feel like thereâ€™s no point anymore. I said Iâ€™d keep it short so I wonâ€™t say much more.

Iâ€™m just gonna jump out my office unless something happens that turns me but I think it probably the only way to get through.

Itâ€™s nice to get this out somehow.
Thanks
