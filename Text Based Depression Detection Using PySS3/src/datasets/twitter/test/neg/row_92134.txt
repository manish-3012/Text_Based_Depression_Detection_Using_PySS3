He abused me in every way possible for a year and cheated and lied. I need out.I can't live with or without him. I need this. I don't want to be found in my room as I currently share with my sister. I don't want to kill myself publicly either as that would be embarrassing for my family. I don't know where to go but I know I need to. I don't want to hurt anymore.
