Dont upvote this.This is my first draft, let's all hope I dont make a final draft. I'm currently into the screaming and quietly sobbing segment of crazy depression, and need to write my thoughts down.

I feel weak all the time now. I dont know if it's that everyone else is putting an extra 10% in somewhere, or maybe I'm just not as talented as anyone else. I dont have it in me to be around anymore. That's one thing I do know for sure. My life sucks, it's my fault that it sucks, and the next logical step is to fix it, but I dont have the strength. 

Give everything I've got to my littlest brother, but if any of my other, younger, siblings want anything, they can have first pick. Dad gets to say what's fair. 

I want to reiterate that this isn't anyone else's fault but mine. I've lived my entire life as a paracite, just sucking the marrow off of everyone else's life. Let me at least have this thing as my own. I did this.nobody talked me into it, and nobody is to blame, except me. 

I'm doing this because I'm weak, this world hurts, and I cant take it anymore. I'm tired of being lonely and feeling worthless. I'm tired of being sad. I'm tired of being tired. Honestly, if god walked up to me and said ' you can either die right now or I'll fix your life up's I think I would pick the former. The state of being alive feels unnatural.
