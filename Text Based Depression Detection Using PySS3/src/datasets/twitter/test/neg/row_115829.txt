Dont know how to help a suicidal friendI have a friend. Rape victim. Parents physically fight. Brother gets seizures. In love with an ex who just uses her, she knows he uses her but she can't get over him. It was all manageable while college was going on but now she is locked in with her family due to COVID 19. And its bad. She is contemplating suicide because her family physically abuses her, hurts her emotionally, doesnt provide much support, she just has too much burden, and no apparent solution. She's been dealing with it her whole life. She is about to break.

She says she sees no bright future for her. Is conviced that she can never be happy as in its not written in her life. She is convinced she doesn't deserve happiness. She says she doesnt have a reason to keep living. She was suffering from bipolar depression two years ago, locked herself in her room for about 2 years, came to college, things became better but now due to COVID lockdown she is again locked in her room and she says the symptoms are kicking in. She doesn't feel like doing much. When i talk to her she sounds pale and tired. She doesn't want to continue because she doesn't think anything will be better for her in the future she doesnt wanna fight anymore.

How should I help her ?
