why doesn't any one give a fuck about me?No one gives a fuck about me.  This weekend I sat at home alone and just worked on projects that I had around the house.  No one would respond to anything I sent out.  Facebook or text I wouldn't get a response for anything. 
 
Everyone is out there with their own group of friends and doesn't give a fuck about me.  

The girl I had a bit of a crush on hasn't responded to anything I've sent her and that was over 4 days ago.  My friends haven't responded in a few days.  The guy I'm trying to carpool with out to an out of state event hasn't responded to anything I've said. 

What the fuck?  Why the fuck don't people want anything to do with me?  I'm not a mean guy.  But all this shit is making me so goddamn bitter.  Here I am on a weekend with absolutely nothing to do with anyone.  Do you know how much this fucking sucks?  

It isn't just this weekend either.  This is my entire goddamn life.
