I'm honestly done with life right nowI honestly am done rn with life I have been so stressed out of my mind and I am honestly hate my life. I use to have a friend who would help me with life when it got tough and she has helped me once when I tried to kill myself and now she hates talking to me for no reason. I have no one that can help me with my mental problems and life. I have tried to kill myself multiple times already and no one knows not even my family only two friends. I honestly feel like killing myself because I am done with all of this stress my mental problems and everything. I always feel different because I tell myself that I'm no good for anyone and I just feel different and that no one cares about me like I don't even exist to my family and friends. I'm honestly done with life I'm going to figure out a day when I'm going to kill myself and how I'm gonna do it. I am done.
