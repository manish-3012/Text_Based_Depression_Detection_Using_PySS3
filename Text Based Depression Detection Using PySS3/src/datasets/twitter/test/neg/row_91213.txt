I think I have a plan, and yet I feel OK?I've suffered with this agonizing apathy almost all my life, seldomly able to feel or show emotion, and even then they were very very weak shows of it.

Dealing with this major and apparently long-term depression, only recently getting help and medication and diagnosed, since I actually have a way to pay for it after all these years. 

I still see my therapist and will soon be seeing a psychiatrist, one that isn't prescribed to my via a hospital, to look into all of my problems, which include, in full that even my therapist doesn't know all of:

Depression, apathy, down, hopeless, fatigued, anxiety issues, gender dysphoria, some paranoia and hypervigilance, Alice in Wonderland syndrome (a visual perception issue that has plagued me all my life and is very distracting and debilitating in my life), occasionally hearing knocks or murmurs, sometimes my name in very real, distinguishable sounds. 

By that I mean you know they're not in your head, they sound very external. Yet, you know they kind of are not... I'm having trouble articulating this.

I've had hallucinations of shadowy figures and abstract like beings throughout my childhood, though not as much now. I used to think I was some secret project to turn a baby girl into a baby boy via early stage sex change. My evidence that made me believe I was originally a girl was the line in my taint (I know, TMI) that looked like scarring tissue from surgery or stitches. That, thankfully, makes silly and probably normal human paranoia that people are always talking about you behind your back, talking bad about you, is happening.

I'll give you an example. I took 3,000 mg of Vitamin C for three days straight on orders of a naturopath. That's obviously over the amount you need daily, which this was added onto my already daily amount, because they thought it would help to fight mono. I don't care what you say, I know I overdosed/megadosed on Vitamin C. I don't mean I had a seazure and my heart stopped, but  I had negative effects:

- Diarrhea
- Nausia
- Lightheadedness
- Urges to vomit
- Major headaches
- Bloating
- Cramps

I made sure by doing my google research via CREDIBLE sites, like the MayorClinic and other credible sources before CONSIDERING the ER. When I did, and clearly could tell "Yea, that's from the Vitamin C" I went there. Asked the girl at the desk if there was anything that could be done, embaressed. She simply gave me a damned confused look and keopt saying things like "I don't think you can't" and things like that. 

Of course you don't, you're not a damned nurse.

The nurse comforted me and said its almost impossible to, and if my symptoms continue, which they had for 3 days straight, hence why I went in to try to get it fixed, I was sent out after hearing that girl talk about my "crazy" case and how you "can't overdose on Vitamin C" behind my back in a whisper, like I couldn't hear it. I wanted to hit her so bad! These are the wretched people I'm surrounded with!

I'm not crazy! I did my research. I do research and sourcing for a living. I know how to find information reliably. I'm not Alex fucking Jones!

I feel no hope in continuing. I live in Portland where it's becoming too expensive. I have only a few things to finish, which will take another year in college, before I can transfer to a university.

The only thing I slightly enjoy - Journalism _ is a dying field with no real money. Paper has been dying since radio, more so with TV and now increasingly more with the internet making basically every story free. Studies even show that journalists on average are males, depressed, over-educated and underpaid. Things I don't want, minus the over-educated. 

I just simply no longer have the drive or care. I feel too hollow and unable to see a future. The depression just gets worse and worse, progressively every day. The only person I loved doesn't love me back, anymore at least and more so since he's gay and I'm transitioning. 

I just have no hope. But I don't see death as this bad thing, I see it the same as treating someone with terminal cancer. I'm going to die, I'm currently suffering, why not just end my life? 

I recently came to the conclusion that I'll tell everyone my idea, that I'll finish one last year in school, since I agreed to a year as the Editor-in-Chief for the college paper, and after, I'll end it. Maybe make a fiction book with the story and main character being a caricature of myself.

To spend this last year with anyone I know and or care about and enjoy it and then go to sleep and die peacefully. 

My mother dislikes this, and understandably so, but I'm not religious and so her reasoning falls flat as illogical to me. I'm just tired of living and hate being a hostage in this world that I didn't choose and forced, emotionally pushed or coerced to live because they might be hurt, thus I have to continue suffering.

I've been in the psych ward 2 times in the past three months for suicide planning and actually being on the bridge. My therapist things a more residential setting is best for me.... But that will work until I get out... then what? Life is just a cycle of suffering. Why not just end it? 

I'm just so tired.... So, so tired. 

My plan is just to wait the year, go somewhere nice and enjoy myself for a while before I do it in a painless (as much as possible) way. See something nice. Maybe the highest point in the Rockies?

I'm sorry... I'm just tired, exhausted, and afraid to find I might have other issues or other mental illness just as or more debilitating than what I already have. I just can't handle this anymore and even making the plan to wait a year (really, 9-10 months) really hard. I just can't take it anymore. 

It's bad enough I feel I'm always behind watched with cameras and photos, like they're spying on me. That on top of everything, I just can't take it... I feel like a freak who can't take care of themselves and being told I may need to be in a residential home, which can be, I was told, 6 months to 2 years, I doubt will help.
