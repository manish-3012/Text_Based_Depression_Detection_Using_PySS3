I finally finished my noteMy lack of motivation/energy to do anything made it difficult to work on but I finally finished after about a year or two of pushing the note off. I'm not really sure if it counts as a will but I don't have much to my name either way. I'm not sure when I'm going to do it but at the very least after March 11th. I'll probably plan out on how I'm going to do it now.
