I have failed.I havr failed to become a functioning member of society.

I have failed to overcome my numerous mental illnesses.

I have failed to grow closer to the person of my dreams.

I have failed my own passions and health by slacking.

And now Iith nothing left, I fail to be brave enough to end it. I can't even self harm, my hands won't fucking let me. 

I'm pathetic.
