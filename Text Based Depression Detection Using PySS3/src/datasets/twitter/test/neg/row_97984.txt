Life is a crazy thingI just turned 30 a couple hours ago. Iâ€™m sitting here alone in my room, finishing up my last drink of the night, and hopefully just passing out so I can get some sleep or whatever. I have always made sure to text the people in my inner circle happy birthday right when it turned midnight on their birthday. My inner circle consists of literally my Mom, Dad, Brother, Sister, Grandfather (my Dadâ€™s side) and I guess Step Grandmother (my Momâ€™s side). My Mom has work early in the morning and is raising my sisterâ€™s baby essentially, so I understand why she would not text me at midnight. My brother and sister are both younger and are awake at midnight, even posting stuff and what not well past midnight. My Dad actually did text me happy birthday at about 12:30 which was cool considering we donâ€™t have the best relationship. My Step Grandmother lives in my house and is too busy getting fucked to text, literally. So yeah, one person out of my inner circle said happy birthday to me. I havenâ€™t had friends or a girlfriend for about 9 years now so I donâ€™t really care about that. 

But it just makes me realize, everyone hates me. They view me as a burden and a drain because I have so many fucked up mental conditions and physical conditions that prevent me from working. Even though I support myself for the most part. All I ask of my inner circle is to spend time with them. It was asking for an arm and a leg just to get them to have dinner with me on my birthday. And no, itâ€™s not because of the virus. They go out 24/7 to all kinds of places and work daily, etc. I just wanted a simple little meal with my family for my birthday and it was asking a lot of them it seemed. I love my family more than anything and I wish they loved me back. But I guess thatâ€™s life. 

Iâ€™m basically a failure at life. Just turned 30 and I have no job (like I said, mental and physical conditions that prevent me). I havenâ€™t had a girlfriend since 2012 and even then, she was only pretending to like me for money and my car, same as girls before her. The friends I have had just used me for the same reasons, too. I live in a very small city and you donâ€™t just randomly make friends or get a girlfriend. I donâ€™t care about either, though. I accept that Iâ€™m now 30 and will die young and I just want to spend time with my family as much as I can before I go. 

Some people get lucky in life, some donâ€™t. Iâ€™m one that didnâ€™t get lucky. But Iâ€™ve come to terms with that. I just wish people had more compassion in this world, thatâ€™s all. Love for one another, as humans, for family, etc. Iâ€™m not a bad person. Sure I can be annoying and stuff, but Iâ€™m not evil or anything. My problem is Iâ€™ve always loved too much and trusted too much. 

2020 has really been rough for me. Iâ€™ll keep fighting for another couple of years, but if I see no good results, idk, I might want to just end it. Like I said before, I suffer from mental and physical conditions. I have depression, social anxiety, anxiety in general, possibly bipolar, I suffer from diabetes, gout, skin conditions such as large painful boils, I am 300 pounds at 6â€™1 so Iâ€™m pretty obese, yeah. My life sucks. And I donâ€™t want to try and fix it anymore. Maybe for New Years I will try and drink/eat better. Idk.
