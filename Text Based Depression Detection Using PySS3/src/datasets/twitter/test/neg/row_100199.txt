Death becomes herI've never posted here so I'm not sure if any of this will even make sense. I wish I would die. Genuinely. I literally have zero hope and just dont care anymore. I just go through the motions of each day and look forward to sleeping, if I even do sleep. I dont have any family. I do have one friend who is really an amazing person and she helps me through a lot. But I just dont want to keep going. What life I had left just exploded in my face a few days ago. I keep fighting through these emotions of saying fuck this, I'm a beautiful woman, many men want me (I'm not being arrogant just honest here), I am only 33. But I am a mother. That's the one single thing that has held me back from eating a bullet. I could never do that to my two sons, that would fuck their heads up more than anything else ever would and I could never be so selfish to them. I love them too much. But I fantasize about my death, thinking about it makes me feel better. My mom is dead, she was my best friend. She died very unexpectedly and my life has not been the same since. I cant help but to realize if she were here, my life would be so very different. She always fixed everything. So here I am.. with one friend, no mother, no father, no family, my spouse of 10 years is a piece of shit. I just caught him trying to fuck his own best friends (22) daughter. I tried to get past it, I even was going to marry the mother fucker.. but I dont think I can get around it. I truly believe I would've been able to had he just helped me a little, but he still refuses to put his phone down, he refuses to speak to me unless he wants to fuck or he is mad bc I changed his passwords. I wanted my little family. But he clearly doesnt which is fine I guess. I mean, he is not the only person on this earth.. I know I can be happy with someone else. I just... dont really want to be. I came a millisecond from blowing my brains to pieces yesterday. I researched how to hit the brain stem.. but I knew I wouldnt do it. I cant do that to my sons but it damn sure made me feel better thinking I was going to. I fantasize about me being in an accident so it wouldnt be my fault. I hope one day I can really be happy bc right now I'm miserable. I'm not going to take my life.... I'm definitely not. So all I can do is hope things get better for me in my head. My kids have no idea, i just laugh, play, homework, gymnastics, practice, school, work and do it all over again. They deserve a happy mother.. or at least a fake one. They deserve everything. Anyway i realize none of this makes sense.. it certainly did help to write my random thoughts out though. I hope everyone else here can find peace and happiness. We all deserve it.
