maybe you can give me a different perspectiveokay. i'm depressed. i think about suicide a lot. like an hour a day or more, but it's not necessarily my suicide i think about. i find the whole subject fascinating. i have not yet decided if i want to commit suicide or not. i guess i'm just examining my reasons to live. i haven't come up with any yet, at least, none that are purely for me only. that doesn't mean i have to kill myself, even if i never come up with a reason, but i want to and that makes it so much harder to not. my main question is am i really doing that badly? yes, i want to kill myself, but no i won't for the time being. yes, i have a plan and yes, i'm going to start acquiring what i need, but i still do not have the intention of killing myself. i have plenty of ways i could do with just household items. pills? check. razor blades? check. belt/rope? check. gun? check. sometime i hold the gun to my head/ in my mouth. yes, it's loaded, but the safety is on and the chamber is empty, and when i do i have no intention of killing myself, although, it is tempting. i just want to see what it feels like i guess. to be that close to death maybe. i feel like although i might be horribly depressed and feel like i would like to kill myself but know that i won't i need some outside perspective. am i really doing that badly? i go to therapy, of course i haven't mentioned anything aside from simple suicide ideation, but i can't exactly say this sort of thing to a mental health professional.
