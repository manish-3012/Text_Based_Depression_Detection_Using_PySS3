How do you talk yourself out?I've been struggling off and on for the past few months. I nearly attempted in October, but I was planning to go out in the garage and the guilt over the thought of ruining my fiance's car for him to deal with on top of funeral preparations was the only thing that stopped me.

I'm struggling today, really badly. When I have thoughts like this the only way I can pull out of it is essentially guilting myself. My fiance is so close to graduating after 6 years, but he needs to finish a couple months of classes now. If I leave he wouldnt be able to finish those classes because he'd be distracted and then he has to push back graduation another year. My cat is on a special diet that is a pain in the ass to make, and I'm the only one who knows how to make it. I don't want anyone else to have to do that. I don't want to inconvenience anyone. But I don't want to be here. I don't want to do this. But I don't want to disappoint anyone else more than I already have. On days like this I'm only alive because of some weird sense of duty. But I'm tired. And I don't want to do this anymore. And I need advice for different ways to talk myself out of this because I'm just becoming numb to the guilt.
