Thoughts of suicide becoming ever more prevalent.I've been moderately depressed for a long while now (probably 7-8 years). Normally it really isn't all too bad. But as of late my lows have become much more devastating and my highs less frequent to where I feel like I'm constantly fighting an uphill battle. 

I maintained a 4.0 for my first three and a half years of college but now I can barely even bring myself to open my textbook to do my homework. I've started questioning whether I actually care about anything. I can't really see myself enjoying the life I have planned for myself, or any other life for that matter. 

I've also started neglecting my health. Since last summer I had gotten incredibly healthy and lost somewhere around 80-85lbs of fat and put on a significant amount of muscle. But as of late I've returned to eating shitty food and making self-destructive choices. I've started playing around with doses of the different pharmaceuticals that I normally take without much concern to what I am probably doing to my body. Last night I consumed probably 5oz. of everclear and 75mg of ephedrine sulfate just to see what would happen. I've never done anything like that before...I don't know what the hell is going on with me.
