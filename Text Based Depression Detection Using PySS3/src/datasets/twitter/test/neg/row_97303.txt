Need advice from people who had beaten depression[Male 26 years old, South American (sorry for my english, I can read and hear it, but I suck at writing)]

  I had tried to kill myself long time ago and promised to myself that I'll will never do that again. Im ready to accept that I'll never be happy, but at least I can try to be a normal person. Im trying to keep my promise for my family and friends.

  The problem is I can't avoid feeling depressed most of the time. I has feeling depression repeatedly for years, my actual hole has lasted more that 4 years. It's been more than a year since I make that last attempt and I can't reach and equilibrium, can't stop hating myself every night I go to sleep.

  The worse (and new) thing is that im becoming cynical and fell rejection to people who is happy. I want to live so the people that care for me dont get sad, but Im afraid my actitude, my hate will start hurting them (sentimentally and psychologically)

  Can you tell me what things worked on you that help you overcome a LONG time depression

PD: I have tried get professional help (psychologist from my university) an it didn't help.
