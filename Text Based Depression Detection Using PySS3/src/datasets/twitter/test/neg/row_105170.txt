Just asking for advice plus a small vent.Iâ€™ve been in  and out of mental wards my whole life and have just started to hide my emotions, almost no one can ever tell if I really want to cry or if Iâ€™m super chill. Kids at school rely on me to be the mature one and help settle arguments. I DONT WANNA BE THAT PERSON. But of course Iâ€™ve built up this whole impression of being that kid who helps everyone when inside Iâ€™m crying and alone. I always put others first even when actively trying not to and usually this puts me in a worse situation. 

How do I establish a healthy relationship with helping others and helping myself?

I am proud of how far I have come. I used to be suicidal with 3 Suicide attempts. Iâ€™ve solved (ish) most of my issues but I always put others ahead of my mental health.
