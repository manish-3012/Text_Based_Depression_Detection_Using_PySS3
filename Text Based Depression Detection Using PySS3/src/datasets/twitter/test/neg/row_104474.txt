I'm alive. I failed my suicide attempt 2 days ago R/suicidewatchI don't know what to say, but oh wow, I am here. I just came home from the ER, and I actually failed my attempt. fuck man. I am here. At least my neighbor actually cares, as they found me outside just laying there not responding to shit, so they took me to the ER and I blacked out before that, I don't know what happened. my mom is screaming at me and yelling at me, but I guess that's just something I'll have to live with. oh well, I am here, that's all that matters. I feel my mom changed a bit, yes she'll still hit me etc, I just feel like she doesn't yell at me as much, this will probably change in less than a week though. the "laptop keyboard?" is fully covered with tears, I can't even look myself in the mirror anymore, although I have to (because of my mom) because I feel so fucking empty. It really sucks, but one side tells me to be thankful that I am alive. I just want to get the fuck out of here, start working, earn money and move out. there's one guy that I speak to and he lives in europe, I want to have a future with him. but how can I do that when I can't accomplish any fucking goal.. I know life is hard, but fuuuuck when I'm in my toughest times i really need it to at least be a little bit easy, not just constantly put me down.. I am not talented or anything, so how the fuck would I get to meet him?
