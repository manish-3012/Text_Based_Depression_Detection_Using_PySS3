Well this something that I wrote about how I feel and also about how some suicidal people, not necessarily all of youSuicide it catches your attention huh? If catches everyones attention, but honestly people don't care until it's too late. Bullshit? Nah think again, have you had a friend who you've lost to suicide? Was that person close to you? Well maybe you haven't lost anyone to it. 

You don't realize that it hurt until you lost her. You've never realized how much you missed her until she's gone. And when she's gone it's to late.

We honestly don't care, because we know that we'd be replaced soon, and soon you'd forget. :)

I really wanna talk to someone, but who? It's either they don't care or they try to pretend like they do. 

We're all gonna die anyways, so why not now?

It all starts somewhere, and everything ends. Not everything has a happily ever after, if you think about it deep life never has a happily ever after. It's either you die sick (not happily ever after) die of old age ( fuck when your old you never enjoy life) then there is die in an accident (you never thought that you would die) and then suicide. It's very rare that you die a happy man. 

Sometimes you just wanna disappear, not die just disappear . Sleep is the closest think to disappearing, but it's either you can't sleep because all your thoughts they just consume you, they don't let you do anything, sleep paralysis another issue with me, I wake up in the middle of night, suffocating I can't breathe those dreams are not dreams it's reality. And what's a dream when you can't sleep? Even if you do sleep waking up in the morning is very hard, you don't wanna wake up you're living a nightmare. Its a dream you can't wake up from. sleep is like death but withoutÂ  commitment. 

People don't kill themselves for no reason at all, to you it may seem like they want attention. But you give them the attention when they're gone, when we don't want the attention, but when we wanted someone to notice us and reach out to us, you did nothing. I don't know if you noticed or not maybe you did but just didn't care, I don't know and I don't know why you decided to ignore the problem, but that was your decision and not my story to tell. you   tried to ask for help, but couldn't get any, your problem couldn't be solved. I understand that you don't want me to get upset or worry about you or anything. but you raised so many questions in my head, was it because of me?

the more people we meet the more they hurt us, sometimes they bring smiles, but its hard to find those. no one wants us they just pretend as if they care, when we go they sometimes realize how much we were to them. you never realize how much she was to you until you let her go, right? well thats the case for some of us. 

suicide doesn't kill people its the pain and sadness of life that kills us. we need that reason to live, just one strong enough reason that's all we need. But that's what we don't have, that motivation, that person to put a smile on our faces. It's just something to keep you from jumping in front of a train. 

Cutting, a lot of us do it, but why? What do we get from cutting? Nothing you think it takes away the pain but no it doesn't, it just harms you more. I don't cut. If you slit your wrists it's attention that you're looking for. I would understand why you cut if when after you cut your problems go away, but no they don't just because you're suicidal doesn't mean you cut. Get that in your heads people cutting gives you nothing. All it does is give you more things to worry about. It doesn't take your emotional pain away, it only gives you more pain emotional and physical. And also the unwanted attention, maybe you do want attention I don't know.

"Will anyone stop me?" Four simple words with really deep meaning, four simple words that speak so loud. what do these words mean? Those four words it shows the desperation and pleading of someone who needs something needs that one thing, we just want someone to hear us out, to see us. We can't hide what's inside us, we're tired holding the trigger and not pulling it, tired of everything. We've lost ourselves. Is anyone gonna watch us? Hate runs through our veins. There is a side inside a darker sod that no one should know know about, this side can't get out, ever. 

The voices inside they're killing me, when your thoughts become your enemy, your trapped inside this world of thoughts which is your mind. All that's left is rage now, you regret everything the good things and the bad. I'm living in hell, living in a nightmare, I'm not scared of going into the real hell now, I feel like I'm prepared and nothing could be worse than this right? Home doesn't feel like home anymore. Stay alive for what? I keep telling myself that it gets better and I can survive and suicide is only for the weak ones, but now I doubt that. It's not for the weak it's for the ones that have it really bad. I know a lot of people have it worse than me and some are gone already. My fears control everything, I don't wanna go back home. I keep telling myself that I can survive this god-forsaken place. 

I don't have anyone to stay alive for.
This is my life, and how I feel.:)
