i've hurt a lot of people in my short life, and i'm going to pay at some point.a lot of self reflection has happened over the past few months. i've lived my entire teen-adult life as a piece of shit. lying, very selfish, and not caring about the wake of destruction behind me. i know i'm mentally ill, but it's no excuse. nothing can excuse the things i've done. 

i've been thinking about all the relationships i've destroyed and all the people i've hurt. 

last year i became more and more controlling over my "partner", solely because of my inferiority complex and selfish needs. it led to a huge fight with him leaving. 

after that, i cheated on my next partner. i tried backing out and ended up being sexually assaulted by the person i was cheating with. karma i guess. i don't know why i did it. the only explanation is because i'm a massive piece of shit. he forgave me and we tried to continue on as normal, but i ended up breaking up with him because i could tell i was only going to get worse and didn't want to hurt him more. 

next i hurt my parents, betraying their trust and basically saying "fuck you" to all the support they had given me through the years. swallowed an entire bottle of pills, hooked up with someone and drank a lot of alcohol. could have overdosed, i really wish i had. 

there's more that i can list but... what does it matter. i might kill myself, i might not. who knows. i think death is too merciful though. in my current state, living is suffering, so i think a fitting punishment would be to stay alive. eventually i'll end up drinking myself to death or overdosing or some bullshit like that, but it'll be a slow painful demise. i'll never forgive myself for the things i have done.
