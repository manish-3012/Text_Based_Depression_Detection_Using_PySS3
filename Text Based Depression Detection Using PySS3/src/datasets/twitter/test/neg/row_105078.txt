My friend is currently suicidalHe has been having suicidal thoughts every time him and his girlfriend break up. Albeit, they always get back together, it's the downtime that brings out his depression. We have gotten our friends to try to talk to him and show him that we greatly care about him but he recently replied that he feels nothing now. His actions while in a non-suicidal state suggests that he seeks attention constantly, and he messages everyone he can to say that he was suicidal or was going to hurt himself, then does not respond for a while, then comes back and says he is fine. We have major concerns about his well being. On top of that, his girlfriend is completely apathetic about this entire ordeal and it is believed that if they break up, he will escalate his attempts. 

EDIT: he said that he saw a psychiatrist about it, however, he still feels depressed. I've also tried calling a suicide prevention hotline but they didn't give any advice.
