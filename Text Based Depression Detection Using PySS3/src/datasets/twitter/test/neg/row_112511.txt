I've given up .It's been a long year now and it's not even finished . Being stressed of feeling lonely from working in a dead end job and not seeing my partner and kids, I ended up having an affair but with the wrong person that ended up very badly. She ended up feeling bad over her partner and reported me for something that I never done.  I took an failed overdose taking to many paracetamol after the stress I had over it all. Now it's going more to the charging side that I just can't sleep and dream of stupid ways to end things. I've still have the other items in my car from what I was planning to end my life with. Everyday from getting up I look at ways to not think of ending it all like my kids but losing hope takes over.
