Tonight is the night.I've planned this for four years. 

The culmination of loneliness, anxiety, depression, and frustration ends with suicide. 

I already felt like I was alone and that everyone hated me, but now I've lost another friend - and with that my will to live.

It's not worth it to put this fight up anymore. 

I've tried for 18 years to be happy. I can't do it anymore. 

A shotgun will blow my head off and end my life.
