Can't really put up with anymore.I haven't been happy for a long long time now. Thinking back, the last time I was happy was around 1999. I'm just tired of being miserable all of the time. I'm pretty good at pretending like I am doing fine, I've had a lot of practice.

Really, I am just trying to think of things I could include in a letter to my family to lessen any negative feelings toward my death. I know there probably isn't much one could say to achieve that, but I need to at least put something to that effect. 

I don't have any money to leave any of them, but my car could be sold to pay for cremation or something.

I will be getting my tax return soon (I hope) and I am going to build my younger brother a computer. He has had to go without more than myself or my other siblings, and I at least want to do something for him before I go. 

I may try acid, I've wanted to for a while but didn't want to risk the consequences of being caught with it.

If you read this, thanks I guess. It isn't really intended for an audience, however, this is the appropriate sub I'm assuming.
