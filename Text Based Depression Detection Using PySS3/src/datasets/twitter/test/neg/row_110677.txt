Whatever I do isn't good enough. I'm 19 years old and I'm constantly under the feeling of never meeting anyone's expectations. Everyone always wants more from me. Even when I do everything possible in my power to do something to the best of my ability it's always "Oh well it's good but this is wrong, or do this differently." 

Throughout school I coasted the whole way. I was always told I was incredibly smart or gifted but I never tried except when it came it computers. I've loved computers since I started using them. They were my escape from the real world. 

Before I turned 18 my mom and stepfather were always incredibly restrictive with my usage of electronics. They always wanted less and I always wanted to get away from the life that I hated so much. 

I never really had a stable home. When I was 10 my parents got divorced. My mom remarried and is still married to the biggest asshole I've ever met in my life and my sad remarried twice and is single now. 

I've never really had a stable home. Ever since my parents got divorced I've moved around a lot and even before then. I kept a count. I went to 15 different schools in my 12 years of regular schooling. As a result I never made any friends. 

I feel worthless. I only have a job because my dad successfully started his own company. And I'm told by my grandfather who also works there that I underperform at everything I ever do and I need to get away from all the electronics and do something productive with my time. 


I just don't see the point in going on anymore. I feel like no one cares about what I do and only focuses on what I do wrong or how I don't live life to their standards. 

This whole thought process stemmed from an argument with my grandfather (who I live with temporarily) after he basically tried to run me over with his car while I was walking home. 

His reasoning was that he was trying to teach me a lesson because I couldn't hear what was going on around me because I was listening to music at the time.
