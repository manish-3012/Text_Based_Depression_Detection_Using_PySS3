I'm confused with why I'm feeling suicidal.I just don't understand being suicidal. I just feel like killing myself would actually make me good. I just don't want to place the burden on the living, I've never attempted suicide because there is no fixing what would be done. I've looked for help through two psychologists, one psychiatrist, and one social workers. I don't feel any difference from them. I've been on paxil and I think it just makes everything worse. I guess what I'm kinda feeling now is wishing I had someone I can tell this to. It doesn't feel like I could talk to my friends, girlfriends, family about this issues. I want to keep my options open.
