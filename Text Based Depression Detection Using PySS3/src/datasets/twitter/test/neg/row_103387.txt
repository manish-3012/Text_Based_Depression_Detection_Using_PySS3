I don't think there's a path.Part of this is petty, part of this is very much not. On the petty side, I've never been a pleasant person. Even when I make a conscious effort not to be a jerk, I slip. One in ten times, maybe, I find myself unable to stop myself from saying something I know will make people mad. Most often it's my honest opinion. I'm not trolling people. I'm not TRYING to be a jerk. I'm not making a conscious effort to be the kind of person people dread the presence of. It just happens.  And even when the dust clears I usually don't feel like I'm wrong. The only reason I 'know' I am is because by the end nobody likes me. It's flared up particularly hard lately and I know it's mostly my fault even though I don't *feel* like it is.   Even people I thought were my friends, I come to find out, have found me pretty vile the entire time. 

I'm fundamentally broken as a person. I feel like I just have an aura of decay.  Everything I buy or use breaks. Electronics, whatever else. I just make them worse by being around them.  Things need to be replaced sooner than they should. Maybe I'm just unknowingly careless with everything around me. I just feel Like I'm a rotten person to my core and that's affecting things.

Friendships are the same. Communities. Whatever. Anything I'm a part of, my part in it falls apart. I make people stop liking me. And whenever I make a conscious effort to change it either doesn't last or it makes things worse. 

And that's the petty part. The more pressing part is this. I have no future. I live with my sister's family and have for a few years now. I'm going to be thirty this year. I'm a drain on everything I touch.  She wants me gone. 

I have only an associates degree, I have no skills, I'm in poor physical shape, I have no money, I have no car and live in an area where using public transport to get anywhere isn't really feasible. I'm in too poor shape to walk to get places and even a fit person would struggle to because i live in an area with the steepest hills in the country. I've been applying for jobs anyway, but I don't have the employment history, skills, or education to get hired for anything. Even McDonalds and K-Mart are rejecting me. There is no chance I will ever get a job that will give me enough money that I can support myself and have a real life. I have no chance in the world. 

The only reason i haven't killed myself is I'm afraid of pain and more and more I find I think to myself that knowing all the negative that I bring into this world is more painful than whatever happens when I die. 

I'm home alone now. I have no friends. I have nobody to be with me right now and even if I did I don't think I could open up to them. If I died nobody would even know for at least a week, maybe two. I make no positive difference in this world.

I don't see a path out, and I don't see a reason to keep going.
