I feel like I cant be fixed, there's no point for me anymoreHi guys, this is my first ever reddit post, but Ive lurked around quite a bit because I have nothing to do with my useless life. So if I do something wrong, I apologize beforehand.

For the past couple of years my life has gone from being a downward spiral, a never-ending nightmare. I've lost all my interests, I've become an absolute abysmal failure that cant do anything right and everything I've tried to fix this, has backfired horrifically in my face. I just want someone to talk too, I feel so lost. I have nowhere left to turn too, and everyone I've ever loved is dead, or turned their backs on me. Im terrible at writing things like this, and its much easier for me to open up, if I get asked about something directly. I just want to feel less alone
