These are the lyrics to a song I've always loved, but now I feel a strange joy from themGotta pack my bags  
Leave my world, behind  
Take a different road  
I know, it's my time  
To open up my heart, for another crowd  
Play it strong and sing it loud  
There's empty places in my life and I need to breathe  
There's empty spaces on the map, waiting there, for me  
I'll take the last exit, to freedom  
The last chance, to be free  
And the first sight of tomorrow  
Feels like freedom, to me  
Oh, there's hope, out on the horizon  
And a light, only I can see

Oh, there's hope, out on the horizon  
And a light, only I can see  
It's the last exit, to freedom  
The last chance, to be ---- free
