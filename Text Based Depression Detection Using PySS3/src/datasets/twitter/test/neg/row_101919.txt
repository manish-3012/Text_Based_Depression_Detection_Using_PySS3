i would switch lives with a dying person if i could.sometimes i wish i could have been born with a deadly disease and replace someone who actually has it.
it probably sounds insane and stupid.
i just wish i could give my life to someone else who would actually want it and appreciate it more than me. iâ€™m just a waste of space. i would switch lives with someone who is dying if i could. they would be able to live a â€œnormalâ€ life, get the education they might not have been able to get..

i feel like an ungrateful piece of shit. i have privileges and am blessed with no diseases or problems(physically).. i donâ€™t deserve it. this life isnâ€™t for me. someone else should be able to have it instead. i feel awful for feeling this way but its how i really feel
