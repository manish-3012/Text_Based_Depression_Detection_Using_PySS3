My hatred for certain people keeps me alive.I used to live with four other housemates. It turns out they never wanted me to live there in the first place, though I did not realize that fact until much later. They never said "We don't want you here," they only became crueler and crueler towards me. I think their goal was to torture me out of the house. They ended up torturing me out of college and into isolation. From the very beginning, they constantly talked shit about me within hearing range. They looked at me as if I was truly, disgustingly pathetic, as if I was sub-human at best. It's true that I am pathetic, but I didn't think it bothered them so much. This kind of behavior I could mostly tolerate because I had been treated like that for the majority of my life, but it got worse. 

They put itch powder on my bed and I'm pretty sure they put laxatives in my food. They spread rumors about me. They pressured me into drinking and then took advantage of my drunken state of mind. I have faint memories. I remember one guy saying "Strip her," and "It works. I've done it before," when he was in a room adjacent to mine. I remember being naked surrounded by a group of guys, not knowing how I got there and not wanting to be there. Every once in a while, I look up my name to check if they put a video of me on the internet. Maybe they spiked my drink, maybe they didn't. Either way, I hate them and I wish great harm on all of them. I don't wish death on them - no, that would mean the end of their suffering. I have imagined every gruesome way of physically and psychologically torturing them while keeping them alive. At the same time, I have imagined the fastest and most painless ways to take my life, but then I think *I won't get to see them in agony. I'll only be giving them more pleasure from my pain. They'll find a new life to ruin.* Even when I feel like ending my life, I remember I loathe them all. I stay alive just to spite them. I know they hate seeing me happy, so I pretend I am and then shove it in their faces. 

I don't have any plans to end my life, but I did make a list of people forbidden from attending my funeral and the reasons why. The cherry on top is no one - not even my parents or my close friends - believes me about any of this. The only exception is my therapist and she doesn't know everything. There's no evidence of what happened. I can't prove anything. At times I think maybe they'll believe me if I died and left a note detailing everything that happened, but I would never see the end result if I was dead.
