Going to hang myselfHi everyone, not looking to be talked down. I'm going hang myself but i want it to be as stress-free for me as possible bc i don't want to cause myself pain. I just want the pain caused by others to stop.

Can anyone give advice on how to keep myself calm while suffocating if the fall doesn't break my neck

Please
