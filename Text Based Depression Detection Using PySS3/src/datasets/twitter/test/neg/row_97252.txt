Why is today so hardI donâ€™t even know why it feels so dark.  On paper nothing went wrong but it feels like everything is so fucking off. Iâ€™m sitting on the edge of my bed, I have a god damn noose I made from a belt in my hand, but I canâ€™t do it because my dog is looking at me. 

So here I am crying my fucking eyes out wishing I was dead thinking posting this will help me reflect by looking back on it later. 

I guess I donâ€™t really want to die, but I sure as hell donâ€™t want to live. Weak men like me are of no use to this world.
