What happens to people who commit suicide?I'm not sure if I believe in a higher power or life after death, but I'm also not wholly sure that I'm ready to "meet the maker" if there is one, especially if I were to take my own life.

I guess what I'm asking is: Do people who commit suicide get a free pass in whatever afterlife there may be? Do you think TPTB understands that sometimes we fight for so long and we just don't have it in us to keep going, like victims of illness or horrific tragedies? What makes our illness different? If we take our own life, are we doomed to the same pain and suffering for all of eternity?

Does it ever get better?

(Also, this is my first Reddit post. I'm not sure I'm doing this right. I just wanted someplace to ask.)
