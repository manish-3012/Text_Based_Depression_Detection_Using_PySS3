Getting affairs in orderI cant kill myself because insurance wont pay out so Im going to just wait for my death. I will just do normal things then lie in bed til I pass away in my sleep. Ive always been like this since I was a kid. My bf was always my go to person when I feel so low and I cant share to my mother since she is also very sensitive and I love her so I dont want her to suffer. I just want to be gone but not actively.

Im giving myself a couple of months hoping that my end is near. But in the meantime, Im going to sell some of my stuff, make a list of instructions, have to figure out how to come up with money for cremation. I also have to assign guardians to our beloved bunnies. Ill also compile some pictures, memories and videos from this day until the day I die so that my mom and brother can watch it. What else did I miss? What do you think could I include in the list?
