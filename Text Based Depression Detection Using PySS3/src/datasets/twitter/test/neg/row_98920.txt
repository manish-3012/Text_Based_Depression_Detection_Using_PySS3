Last PostI think it's time to go through with my suicide plan. I'm currently 20, and I've felt suicidal everyday ever since I was 15. I know going through with my plan will cause me a lot of pain before death, but it's really the only thing I can get away with without alerting other people. If I end up living, the only thing I will think about is suicide, so it's best if I do it today. It's the only thing I want right now. 

Edit: I've decided to at last a little longer, but I'm going through so much right that I feel like this is the only option. Your comments have helped, but if I feel like if I talk about what's wrong with be, to myself, others will think I'm being melodramatic and dumb.
