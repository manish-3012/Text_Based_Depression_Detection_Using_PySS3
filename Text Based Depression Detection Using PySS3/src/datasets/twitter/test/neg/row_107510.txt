tonight might finally be the nightiâ€™ve been a ticking time bomb for three days now and i think tonight might finally be the night. 

iâ€™m a perfect recipe for disaster: iâ€™m drunk, iâ€™ve got notes drafted, iâ€™ve got the means to. 

iâ€™m done of those close to me not caring and not listening. iâ€™m done with their only advice ever being â€œgo get help!â€ or them completely ignoring me altogether. iâ€™m just *done*.

i hope to god this is the night.
