Suicidal thoughts, but not suicidal?This is going to sound absolutely insane, but I have a lot of suicidal thoughts. I think about killing myself a lot when I am in a horrible environment - which is mostly when I return home, where my parents stay (I work in an advertising agency and don't always come back home). My parents are emotionally and sometimes physically abusive to the point of denial.

My point is, I know I don't want to die. However, I can't stop thinking about how good it would feel if I just did kill myself.
I know I have the option of moving out, but I'm not sure I will be able to support myself; I'm scared.

I just..had to say this out loud to someone. Thanks for listening.
