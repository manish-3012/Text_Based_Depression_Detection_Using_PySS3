I think about suicide everydayI think about suicide or just dying in general everyday. Even when Iâ€™m happy, it lingers. I donâ€™t want to die, necessarily, but Iâ€™m tired of feeling this way. I feel like over the past year I have gained so much control over my life/emotions/etc., but as soon as one negative or bad thing happens itâ€™s like a bomb has gone off in my head and all I can think about is killing myself. I feel weak and alone.
