Why does Is still hurts?? Wtf Is suicide really going to be my only option to get rid of the chemical imbalance in my brain?Seriously I just found the cutest guy, we just started dating everything Is good. I have clothes, makeup, friends, a large family... But its still shit there is nothing inside me anymore, my happiest memories hurt me sooooo much i canâ€™t feel what i used to feel. I have the ?means? To do It but the only reason I would do It is because Iâ€™ve been agonizing in complete deep suffocating pain a shit long time. Donâ€™t know what to think anymore I already have 3 failed attempts maybe i just want to see what happens next but the pain is so fucking strong, depression is a bitch. Please do not comment some shit like: everything will be okay or you still have much to live. No just no, living can be nice and all but im basically convinced that Is just not for me... If i could just feel good though doesnâ€™t matter what im still miserable.
