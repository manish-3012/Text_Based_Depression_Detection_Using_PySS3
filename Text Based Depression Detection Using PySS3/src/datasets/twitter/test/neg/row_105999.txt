Waking up at 5:30am again to go to my shit job...Im still half drunk from last night (and this mornings hair of the dog). I can see it in my own eyes, i gotta get some eye drops on my way to work. Im 27 and hate every second of being alive. I make $10.50 an hour, i work 7 days a week. I paid rent yesterday and my bank account is -$410. The only reason im still alive is because my mom lives with me and i cant abandon her and my dog, my life does not belong to me. Shes 72 and only gets $760 a month from SSI. Our rent is $1300 and everything else is on me. We moved to florida almost a year ago and i cant find a decent job. Ive applied to over 180 "good" jobs on indeed since we got here.... My uninsured car is up for repo, its broken and i havent driven it in months, im a car guy and its my favorite thing, im bootlegging internet, and my bills are a month behind. On top of all of that im a virgin. The only one who fucks me is life. Living with my mom is a bad look but no one else will take care of her. Even if i met a girl who was cool with me living with my mom i cant afford food let alone a date....

I dont want to be alive anymore. I have no hope for the future. I just want my suffering to be over. I cant remember the last time i was happy.
