maybe i never should have stopped medicationI'm 24. I got into therapy more than 3 years ago, severely suicidal, a month in my therapist suggested taking medicine. I started and SSRI, things were slowly improving. I had more energy, I dealt with a lot of shit. 

I slowly weaned off of them at the end of July with the approval of my psychiatrist. 

When I got to the few last remaining pills, at the same week, max grandfather died (we never had a connection) and I had to attend his funeral, where I got into a big fight with my father and he told me he wants to disown me. Earlier that week the man I loved (still do) broke it off. 

I have a job, which I like. I'm kind of good at it. I'm doing my masters, and I'm kind of good at that too. These are very stressful to manage, but alright. I have friends. I lead an active lifestyle - not in the sense that I excercise a lot (I do that occasionally), but I have a lot to do. I live in a vibrant city and I can kind of support myself financially. Tho I have no real chance at a great relationship this time in my life, I think maybe in a few years it could happen (?). I go to therapy almost every week. 

I still want to die. I have wanted for at least a month now - I couldn't enjoy my birthday, either. My mood can lift, but I end up at the same place almost every day. Nothing matters. I don't really enjoy things. I do my work and study, drink and meet up, but time passes me by and I feel like an outsider. Most nights I feel I cannot breathe without the man I love. I cannot soothe myself and I can't let others soothe me. I feel so, so alone, even when people tell me they care about me. I started harming myself again, sometimes cutting (mostly without the intention of suicide, but sometimes with that in mind), but I like hitting myself better. I hit my body with empty bottles of wine - the smoking and drinking have started getting out of hand, so I have plenty of bottles lying around. The biggest bruise I have is on my shoulder and it looks like a galaxy.

The dread of living can only stop for a small amount of time. The feeling of wishing death on myself is less consuming than it was when I was 21, but it is still there, again. Every day. I can have some fun, then walk home and feel like stepping in front of a car. Days are meaningless and long, filled with anxiety, and nights are terrifying if I'm not drunk. I look at my wrist and imagine blood slowly spilling. A few days ago I had my nails done and through it all I was thinking was why? Why am I doing something so irrelevant? Who cares how my nails look? On the way home I slowly started calculating what kind of medicine I have at home and how many, and how much I could take to stop it all. At least with freshly done nails, my dead body would look pretty. I didn't have any dangerous medicine, just a bunch of painkillers and allergy medicine, but if I took all of it and drank a shitload of wine, that could maybe work? 

I feel like I am this walking corpse, only choosing to live because if I killed myself, my mom would be really sad, my friends would be really sad and they would have trouble managing shifts without me at work, so I cannot do this to others. Also, my housemates would be in shock finding my body. 

But I remember that it started like this three years ago, until no mundane thing or loving people mattered anymore, I was just too much of a coward to really do it. I'm still too cowardly. But my heart and head hurts too much to continue it. I know I might have a future, but I just don't want it. 

My therapist suggested starting meds again and asked for the phone numbers of my closest friends, making sort of a notification line in case I do something. It is biology, she said. 

Then it is biology telling me to end it all. I don't know. All I know is that I want to annihilate myself.
