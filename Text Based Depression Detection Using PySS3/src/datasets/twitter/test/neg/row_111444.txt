The Knocking Keeps Getting LouderThe torment is unreal. Everything I see gets bluer and blander and the people start to disappear. Nobody wants to talk to me even when I text first. I sit and observe and become attached to people and then get let down because I make expectations for myself. Nobody tries to understand but rather pushes me away because Iâ€™m edgy because I enjoy metal but nobody listens when I say I like jazz or lo fi or rap. People see me as a serial number, a label, and donâ€™t even bother to pick me up. I remember within a two week span 2 years ago I tried to kill myself twice and failed, obviously. Iâ€™ve been trying and trying and trying so damn hard to redeem myself for what Iâ€™m worth and every time I get somewhere Iâ€™m comfortable Iâ€™m knocked down again and again and again because nobody wants me there. Iâ€™m â€œScaryâ€ or Iâ€™m â€œQuietâ€ or Iâ€™m â€œEdgy.â€ and nobody wants those things in me. My family has stopped caring about my schooling and Iâ€™ve been doing drugs for months now but they donâ€™t care. Death keeps knocking on my door and it gets louder and louder every time. My end is soon, very soon but I donâ€™t know how I should go about it. Save your â€œcowardâ€ bullshit for another brain dead sheep. Iâ€™m fucking over it.
