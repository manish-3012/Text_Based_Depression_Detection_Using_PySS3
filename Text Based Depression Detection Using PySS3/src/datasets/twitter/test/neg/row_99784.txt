Help Getting SuicideWhy would someone want to kill their self by jumping off a bridge I'm not thinking of doing it but why would someone want to jump off a bridge of all ways to die. Also what are the chances of living from different heights and how can I get someone to stop thinking about suicide. My girl is talking about when she turns 80 she wants to jump off a bridge because she never wants to be old what would be the reasons for her feeling like this? I refuse to call suicide hotline or anything on her she's not suicidal she just talks about this a lot.
Thanks anyone who helps
