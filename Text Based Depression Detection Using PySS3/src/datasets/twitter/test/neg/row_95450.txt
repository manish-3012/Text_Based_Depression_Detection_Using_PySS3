Three funerals for suicide victims and I'm only 20We lost another wonderful person to suicide yesterday morning. This will be my third, over half of all the people I knew who've passed on have been by suicide. I'm not scared for myself (I'm bipolar) but I'm scared for others. I've been there before and it kills me to know that others are in that much pain, especially since all the ones I knew where kids. I wish there was something more I could do
