My mind doesn't stop.My life isn't that bad. I got a girlfriend that loves me. I got no financial problems. But I still have this urge inside me to end it.

I have been depressed for a couple of years now. I've always been alone. I try to avoid other people. In my mind friends and social stuff is just a waste of time. I gain nothing from it. 

I was close to killing myself last year, I had it all planned out. But 2 days before that I met my now girlfriend. She gave me new hope.

But now the voice in my head gets stronger again. I have never been truely happy in my life. There is nothing I enjoy. Nothing that makes me happy. I have no goals in life. Nothing matters to me. I have no motivation to do anything. All I want is to die. Without bothering anyone. Just gonna find work to earn money so my parents don't have to worry about the funeral costs.

I don't know if this is the right sub. I don't know of any of this makes sense. My head never shuts up.
