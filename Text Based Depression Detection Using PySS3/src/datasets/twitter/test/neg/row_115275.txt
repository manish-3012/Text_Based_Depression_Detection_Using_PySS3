Iâ€™ve pushed away everyone who makes life worth living20/F. I yelled and cursed at my mom. I kicked my boyfriend out of the house and blew off plans for the millionth time because I canâ€™t bear to be around other people. Iâ€™m alone in my room feeling like swallowing all the pills in my nightstand is the smoothest way out. Right now I hate myself more than I love my family. Iâ€™ve worked my ass off for three years in college and have no idea whatâ€™s next. Semester starts on Monday and every time I think about the pile of work ahead of me I get sick to my stomach. Nothing makes me excited, everything makes me anxious. Fucking everything. Biochem? Yup. Buying bandaids at CVS? Yup. Every single thing I do feels like a battle. Iâ€™m so so exhausted. I donâ€™t want to go on.
