I...Lived??Living after trying to kill yourself is such a weird feeling. I tried to kill myself again yesterday and failed completely but during the time before I attempted, I was so certain that I wasn't going to live past that day. And yet... here I am? It feels so wrong to be alive? Like even though I didn't die I still feel strangely dead. I even planned everything out and now that the plan didn't end up with me being dead I'm in this weird state of "....now what?" I don't really know what to do anymore.
