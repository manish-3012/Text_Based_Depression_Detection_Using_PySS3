Happy Valentine's day! - my message to you:To the fighters out there that have had the courage to post on this sub-reddit for help, you are **wonderful**. And I as well as many others want you to *live*. No matter what you've been through or what you're going through - and I know this sounds cheesy but it's true - we will always be here. And we are proud of you for trusting us.

To the amazing people that have been so kind as to aid others on this subreddit that haven't been feeling their best lately, I commend you for being awesome human beings. **Don't ever change** !! You guys may not know it, but your comments actually make a significant difference to one's life. 

And to the people, like me, who occasionally visit this subreddit just to see how others are doing..but not necessarily knowing what to say in reply to some of the posts, it's okay. Not everyone knows what to do when their friend is depressed. 

I know it's hard to believe a random stranger on the internet when they say this, but believe me when I say no matter how bad or good your life is going at the moment, I love each and every one of you.

And even if I may not know who you are, I know that you exist...and that is honestly enough for me.
