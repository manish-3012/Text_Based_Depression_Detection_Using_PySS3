Little rat-I have seen several posts of people saying they want to kill themselves over a videogame, loosing a game from a sport, not being able to get what they want, etc. To the people who do that, it is not funny. You are making yourself look stupid. There are people suffering from mental illnesses contemplating life, and families/friends of people who have committed suicide grieving. And here you are, basically mocking suicidal people, and making the community look bad. Please think twice about posting something like that again.
