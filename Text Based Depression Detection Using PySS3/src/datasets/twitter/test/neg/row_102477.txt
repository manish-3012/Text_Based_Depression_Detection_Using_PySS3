I feel like it's just overSo I'm only 12 years old and I know for a fact that if I just ask for help then I would get it but some part of me doesn't want help some part of me wants to actually die and I already have a plan I'm not sad or scared I'm just disappointed in myself I'm giving up and yes I know I would have a huge life ahead not me but idk some part of me wants me to fail and wants me to just , like go. 
Idk what's after death but and if I'm being honest and this might sound heartless and cold but I'm excited to finally leave this life. I love everyone but this life just isn't for me â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸â™¥ï¸
