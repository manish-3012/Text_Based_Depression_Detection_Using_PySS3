Attempted SuicideLast week I decided to take 5000mg (5 Grams) of Zoloft and 20mg of Klonopin. When I took them all, I wasn't hesitant and I found that weird because my last time of attempting suicide I was very hesitant and scared. However, this time I was calm and not scared. I was surprised to wake up and find myself alive because I thought such a dosage could kill me, but it did not. I have read that people have overdose and died with less than what I took. 

I don't know.. I use to think I cannot commit suicide. That I will attempt it, but will always back down, but I was proven wrong this time and I am a bit scared of myself because that fear is what kept me alive and now with that fear gone; it feels like I can take my life any movement without hesitation.

Also, no I didn't go to the ER or anything. I ended up vomiting everything while I was sleeping and I didn't even recall myself vomiting while sleeping. And I have no side effects from overdosing other than the vomiting the day I took it while sleeping.
