My life is so fucking pointless...I'm currently sitting in a decently powerful car...wondering if it would hurt to plow this beauty into a guardrail or something...

The only thing that stops me is that I can't be 100% sure that i wouldn't hurt someone else in the process. As in, something flying off my car and getting someone else in trouble or pain.

My husband would move on. He's an amazing man. My baby (a cat) would just be confused for a while. I'm sure he'd be okay.

I don't know what to do.
