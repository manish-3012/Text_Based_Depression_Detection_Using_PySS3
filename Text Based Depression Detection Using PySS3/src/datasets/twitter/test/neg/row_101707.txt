Another thank you.I rip on police officers and law enforcement because it's part of both my music and political scenes. But I really appreciate the times when officers reach out to people who are suicidal.

I doubt either of the officers who helped me today in rural Iowa are Redditors, but I want to offer a sincere thank-you to them and all police officers who have tried to help people like me.

Thank you.
