I honestly hate myself
You know the feeling when you feel nothing when you wake up? I always feel that, I cry every night over personal things or online things, I know that nobody will wanna support me especially since Iâ€™m 13 years old (turning 14) I feel bad for everyone around me, having to experience me being sad. I look at everyone else and wonder why they are happy...

I usually try to hide my emotions because Iâ€™m afraid of getting called a pathetic child for being sad, Iâ€™m forced to look happy. I hate it, it feels like Iâ€™m wearing a fucking mask. Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts and had plans to do these things, Iâ€™ve self harmed in many ways, like cutting, scratching, punching and even slamming myself against the fucking wall from time to time...

I sometimes feel lonely, like I have friends but they are slowly disappearing, I guess itâ€™s because I keep venting without me even knowing it. My brothers friend recently took his life, I have a bad relationship with my father, and I feel pathetic...

Therapy doesnâ€™t do shit to me, all it does is make my fucking life worse... I donâ€™t know what to do anymore, my life is worthless...

I always think negatively about myself, I hate myself. I just want to stop this pain.
