What does someone have to do in order to have full control of their death ceremony?How does one legally establish parameters for their own death? What branch of service do I need to contact in order to specify the process?

Like, can someone say exactly what they want to happen? such as, "I do not want a funeral" or, "Do not allow such-and-such at my service."
