My first instinct is to resort to suicidal thoughts.I feel like Iâ€™m going to kill myself eventually and Iâ€™m just putting it off. I still have the paper I wrote in 2nd grade on how I wanted to kill myself cause I was dealing with too much abuse. 

I want a big change but I know thatâ€™s not always the solution. Therapy is helping a lot tho. I havenâ€™t been able to go lately cause of the virus. 

I get frustrated a lot. I take it out on myself and the first thought is always picturing killing myself. Itâ€™s so clear. 

Iâ€™m not gonna kill myself any time soon but damn I feel like I need a break bro. I wanted to vent. Thank you.
