I don't actually want to kill myselfBut it's kinda fucked up that I feel like I have to before anyone will take me seriously. I am messed, I am so deeply hurt by what I have experienced in my short (?) life. I don't think I can handle this feeling of shame anymore, this feeling that my existence is WRONG, that I am WRONG, that I am not enough.

One day I will do it, not because I wanted to but because there simply was nothing else left to do.

Edit:

Since no one's here, maybe if I just write I can be my own safety person. Maybe if I just write it out, it will make things better. I am too scared to ask for help not because I don't want to but because the last time I did, I saw just how awful the mental health care system is. This part is too difficult to write out, it needs explanation and I am reliving things and that's not what I want to deal with right now. Fuck everything about my life is too difficult to write out. There's too much. I just wish someone could get it. I wish someone could take a walk through my head for a little bit and know why I am the way that I am. I just wish I didn't feel so terribly lonely right now.

Could someone please, please, just hear me? Please, this is really hard to deal with I really feel like I'm running out of options.
