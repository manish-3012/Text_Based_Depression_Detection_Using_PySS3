The monetary system makes me want to end itI'm 31. I've had so many different jobs since I started working at 16. Now I feel extremely burned out and exhausted. I've felt this way for over a year. I just can't make myself work anymore. I have PTS from my last job, and although my depression seems to be improving for the most part, I have trouble with motivation.

The idea that I will be working for the rest of my life until I die just doesn't appeal to me on any level. I feel trapped within this system, and it feels like there is a gun being pointed at my head with a voice saying, "Make money, or die." Well, lately, I think I'd rather die than continue to have to make money. I wish we weren't all enslaved within this monetary system. When will it end? I am so exhausted all the time. I try to cope by "escaping" into my own little world, but then reality brings me right back down again. I just have no motivation whatsoever to live in this world filled with corruption and lies. A world that is consumed with consumerism. I wish I could retire, but I am 31 and broke. Ever since I saw the movie "Zeitgeist", my feelings about the world and the money system were forever changed. 

It's not that I have a problem with work itself. But I do have a problem with working for some company for pitiful wages and feeling like I'm a rat spinning endlessly on a hamster wheel. I am sick and tired of the extreme wealth inequalities on this planet that are only getting worse and worse. I am tired of paying taxes to a government that is corrupt. The thought of death is comforting to me, until I remember the death tax. But I'll be gone, so fuck it. I just hope I don't reincarnate back into this system again.

Anyone else relate to this? :(
