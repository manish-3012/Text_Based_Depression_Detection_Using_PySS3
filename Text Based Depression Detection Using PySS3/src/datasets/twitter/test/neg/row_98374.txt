Help!? How do I get out of this feeling??Iâ€™ve had some form of depression for at least the last 7-8 years but I seem to have high functioning depression. My boyfriend broke up with me three weeks ago now. He said I love you first, he brought up moving in and marriage and kids first and he brought it up even a month before we broke up. He wasnâ€™t cheating technically but when he broke up with me he said that he never loved me and that he didnâ€™t care he was hurting me when he texted his ex once. (Long story but I know he was being honest when he said he only texted her once). Iâ€™m afraid of my reaction now. Its been 3 weeks since the initial breakup and Iâ€™m still having very vivid suicidal thoughts. Iâ€™ve looked up methods 24/7, Iâ€™ve tried journaling my feelings before I noticed I was just ruminating, Iâ€™ve tried going outside and talking with my family, Iâ€™ve seen my therapist 3x a week since it happened and sheâ€™s recommending hospitalization. This canâ€™t be a normal reaction to a breakup. Yes, this is the first breakup where I was fully in the relationship and genuinely thought I was going to be with him for the rest of my life but how is it that heâ€™s gone now and I donâ€™t give a single care in the world about the rest of my life. I try to hard to write down things I should be living for but I donâ€™t care about any of them. Iâ€™ve removed him from my social media because it just hurts but even that hasnâ€™t stopped me from thinking about him. Day and night itâ€™s all I do. Iâ€™m either googling how to kill myself and sometimes googling how to feel better before feeling like itâ€™s impossible and go back to finding ways to kill myself or Iâ€™m googling why he did this. Heâ€™s a decent guy from a decent family and for the most part heâ€™s been a good ex. Thatâ€™s why this breakup is so hard for me to accept. We were a good team! We would have disagreements but we never fought or purposely said hurtful things to one another, we would always talk it out. He treated me very well and would always be there for me. I look at these things online saying itâ€™s better to be broken up if the relationship was bad for me but it doesnâ€™t apply because this relationship was the best one Iâ€™ve ever had in my life and I donâ€™t understand why itâ€™s over. I canâ€™t take care of myself. I canâ€™t work and took this week off, I canâ€™t sleep for more than 3 hours consecutively, I canâ€™t eat or drink (118lbs to 110 this past week. I met with my primary doctor to get antidepressants and weighed 118 just last Wednesday and now Iâ€™m 110). Iâ€™ve talked to the national suicide hotline a bunch of times and when I talk itâ€™s like they arenâ€™t even listening to what Iâ€™m saying. Someone please help me. I feel like Iâ€™ve tried all the standard â€œget betterâ€ things and nothing is helping and Iâ€™ve gotten to the point where the only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fear that it wonâ€™t be successful and Iâ€™ll live life as a vegetable.
