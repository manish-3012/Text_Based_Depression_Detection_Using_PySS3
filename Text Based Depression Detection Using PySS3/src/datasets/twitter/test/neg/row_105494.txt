Is it possible to tread water for another 9 years?She constantly cheats and lies like I am stupid, she is out doing it again right now as I type this. She has taken everything I enjoy out of my life. I have no friends she moved us hundreds of miles away from anyone I know and leaves me trapped at home. I work 80+ hours a week just to escape when I can. I used to play games but all the hardware gets pawned when she needs money to go out I have just quit replacing it. I dump everything I earn into the debt she runs up so we don't get sued and lose what we do have. The last time I tried to leave "someone" made an anonymous phone call saying I attacked our son. Only the fact I had security cameras and my neighbor happened to be at their window at the time saved my bacon. I spent a week in jail, lost my job, and it was seven months before I was cleared and I could see or contact my son. She told me next time she would leave the country and I would never see him again. 

Only the thought of leaving my son with her is stopping me but when it is still night at theend of the tunnel it feels pretty bleak. 

I try to tell myself it will be better once he is an adult and moves out but then I will have nothing. I don't even know if I can remember how to socialize with people anymore and I will just be old and have next to nothing, she will even end up with half of my retirement accounts of she can't think of a way to drain that as well.
