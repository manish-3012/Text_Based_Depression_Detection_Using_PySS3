Empty, readyI recently went to an inpatient facility following an attempt on my own life. 

I got out a week ago when they deemed that i want at risk anymore.  They've given me antidepressants and something to help handle anxiety which worked really well in the facility.

But now that I'm out, I'm not sleeping (10 hours in the last week) and i feel more miserable than before i went in.

I'm in the same mindset as I was before I went in, and i have more intent than before.  I want to die and i don't know that I want to get better.

I live an empty life, with no friends and no family.  I have so much self hate that goes back to my childhood and I'm just so over fighting myself this much just to get through a single day.  I've been crying myself to sleep for the last week.

I don't know why I'm posting here.  I'm resigned to the fact I'm going to kill myself.  I just hate feeling so invisible.
