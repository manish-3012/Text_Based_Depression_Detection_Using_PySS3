I had it all.I had it all. In junior high, I talked to everyone. I knew everyone. I was one of the most popular kids in school. Girls asked me out. I was dating girls. I never got below 90% in any of my courses in an academic challenge program. I talked to my parents. I talked to my brother. I was happy all the time. I was the guy who smiled all the time. I was the guy who you'd talk to to make your day better. I had ambitions to become a Lawyer. I had ambitions to make money. I had ambitions to get married and have a family. I had ambitions to become a successful. Looking back it seems like a fucking fantasy. 

Then something happened. I don't know how. 

Now it's high school. I talk to a select few people, most of which don't even like me. I am barely known by anyone. Haven't talked to a girl in years. Barely passing any of my courses. Late for every morning class. Intentionally dropped two classes so I don't have to deal with people as much. I fucking hate school. We learn the stupidest stuff about short story essays that I can't write and other nonsensicsl crap. Paranoid all the time whether I smell bad or not. Almost claw at my skin with soap every day in the shower. People hold their hands on their nose all the time and move away from me in school. Don't even know how to talk to people. Don't have my Learner's Permit. Constant disapproval from my Mom. I don't even know how to talk to my OWN MOTHER, all conversations are just super awkward. I have no ambitions now. Lawyer? Grades aren't good enough. Make money? Barely getting 60%, so much for that. Married and Kids? Waste of money and time. I'm now the guy who you don't want to talk to, but feel bad and do it anyway. Only watching sports, working out, gaming, listening to music and going to work are the only things I enjoy doing. Anything by myself. Anything where I'm just alone. Free from judgment, free from the routine that we've set for ourselves in society. Just free to do as I please. 

I'm pretty resilient, but looking back and knowing I have the potential to do stuff is what is the worst. I know I'm smart. I've done really good on units this year I somehow got motivated to do. I just can't motivate myself every unit. I know I can talk to people. I've had good conversations with people. I just don't want to. It's not even me being lazy, the moment I wanted to get into fitness I did. I just don't see a purpose in life at all. We follow a stupid routine for what? Why? What's the purpose? 

I have every symptom of a Stage 0 cancer at 17 years old and I don't want to go to the doctor. Let it develop to stage 4 and die slowly, that way I don't create a scene with suicide. It's not like anyone is gonna go to my funeral anyway. 

I've never even had suicidal thoughts until now. Life is a joke.
