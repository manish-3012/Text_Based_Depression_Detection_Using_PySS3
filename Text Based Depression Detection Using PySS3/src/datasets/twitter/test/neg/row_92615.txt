If not today...someday.I want to die more than anything in the world. I want to cease to exist so I can stop feeling the shame and self-loathing that has brought me to this point countless times over the years.. But I can't. Not because I have some epiphany that opens my eyes, or because of some new sense of purpose. Im just too much of a coward to do something about it. So I just sit here, day in and day out. Crying and waiting for that day when I can finally find the courage I need to overcome the last obstacle standing between me and peace..myself.
