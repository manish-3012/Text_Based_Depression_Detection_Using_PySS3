(might sound stupid) i'm turning 20 tomorrow &amp; i want to die before that happens\*i'm drunk btw\* 

it's obv not the only reason i want to die lol, like i have a few mental illnesses &amp; a lot of problems in my life and i already wanted to die but rn i'm litterally at the end of my teen years and i really don't want to enter my 20's bc i litterally have peter pan syndrome and i don't want to become an adult. and i'm thinking about doing it tonight or tomorrow morning before i turn 20. 

i'm not really asking for help, ig just asking if you think 20 is like adulthood or some shit. like am i not a "teen" anymore at 20? do i need to stop being immature &amp; young and have to grow up? 

like i want to die alright but i want to do it well, don't want to be in a psych ward for the 100th time  bc of a failed attempt. 

be honest though, like don't lie to me to make me feel better
