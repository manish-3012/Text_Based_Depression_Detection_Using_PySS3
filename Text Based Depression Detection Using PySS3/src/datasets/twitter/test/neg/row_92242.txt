I feel trapped and pathetici can't go by a single day without feeling stupid and disgusting . i don't deserve anything or anyone. i'm a horrible person and i feel like such a burden to everyone around me. there's nothing i'm good at and depression made me indifferent to everything. when i was younger i used to like reading but now i cant even concentrate on reading a single chapter. whenever someone asks what my hobby is i never know how to answer. because reality is that i either sit in the dark feeling horrible or i watch youtube videos to distract myself. what kind of hobby is that. i'm not particularly good at school either. it's so hard to study with depression because i can't fucking focus and my motivation is non existent. i've tried to make myself feel better through venting in ways such as drawing, writing it down and self harming but nothing makes me feel any better.
