I think itâ€™s my time    I think Iâ€™m at peace now, if not a little tearful.  I have decided to kill myself on the first and Iâ€™m preparing a will and testament.   I never thought i would post on one of these but like a good soldier I seek the input on those around me.  
    I canâ€™t keep going, after iraq and Afghanistan I have degenerated into slow state of degeneration.   I sleepwalk every night and drink myself to sleep every day.  I focus on on people I see as a threat to the extent I am going to trial for stalking a former boss at John morrells.
     I have failed my squad, unit, , family and friends.  I have just decided that those people deserve a lot better than I can provide and I canâ€™t imagine disgracing them with having a jail bird as an associate.
