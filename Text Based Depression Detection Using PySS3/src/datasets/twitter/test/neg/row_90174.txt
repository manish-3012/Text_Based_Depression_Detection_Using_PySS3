I feel suicidal for the wrong reasonsA lot of posts I've read typically state the point that "nobody will care that I'm gone" or "nobody will miss me." Yes that's depressing but I've never thought that way. Perhaps it's probably because I have a supportive family (and I wish I didn't) so I can't really convince myself that nobody will miss me. My family and a few friends will clearly miss me.

However, that doesn't change the fact that I want to kill myself. I don't want to get help because I just don't want to live. I don't see the appeal in living. I don't work much but it's practically expected that I have a full time job when I grow up. I don't have a family (never been in a relationship) but that's also expected of me. On paper, I don't have a problem with this. The "ideal" life typically revolves around having a family and being financially secure. It just doesn't appeal to me. I feel like I've lived too long but I've only lived 20 years and I just don't care to get better.

I don't know if it's depression since I laugh quite a lot and still have "happy days" where I forget about my suicidal tendencies. I certainly don't feel guilty when I am happy. But at the end of the day I prefer nothing over happiness. I don't know how to get other people to understand. It's not that I hate my life, it's that I just hate living. I get extremely envious of the people who post here saying they're about to take their life. I am extremely envious of the people who had the balls to kill themselves.

When I think rationally about suicide, it sort of goes both ways. On one hand I have it good. I don't live in poverty, I have a loving family, and I'm not monstrously ugly (I'd say maybe a 3.5/10). I'm pretty smart and have a decent amount of friends. On the other hand: I don't care about graduating, I don't care or want to get a career, I don't want to have kids. The girls I like look too good for them to like me back so getting in a relationship I actually want to be in is very improbable. When I write it out it makes me sound like I'm just a lazy kid but I just have absolutely no motivation or care to live. I don't want to contribute to society, I don't want to help the poor, I don't want to really do anything. If I'm not going to reproduce or contribute to society, there's hardly a point in existing. I'm not a great person, I'm lazy, unmotivated, ugly, and apathetic towards almost everything. I'm not an awful person either. I'm typically nice, caring, and in the right company pretty funny so it's not like I deserve to die. It's just that, I don't give a shit about living.

I made a deadline to kill myself when I turn 22, I feel like my life has been over for a while now but I haven't been able to, well, kill myself. I've had 2 attempts in the past, but that was before my rationality fully kicked in and I started thinking about how my family would be affected. At 22, I'm probably just going to get drunk one night (which hopefully clouds my ability to think about my family) and just drive off a cliff or hang myself or something.

Does anyone just feel apathetic and suicidal not necessarily due to sadness but just because?
