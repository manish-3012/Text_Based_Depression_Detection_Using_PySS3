I just hung myself but I caught myselfI tonight I was hanging off a hook in the garage. 
I was tightening the dressing gown tie when I slipped and fell off a table I was standing on, as I was hanging I accidentally caught myself as there was a box near me which I didn't realise I could stand on. I completely panicked because the garage light was on and anyone from the street would have been able to see in. I was freaked out in case I didn't just die and just broke my neck or went into a coma. 
I'm confused because before I went to hang myself I had this overwhelming feeling of euphoria and happiness. Like I was vibrating on another level. I was so happy to die. 
Why did I stop myself? 
I'm so sorry I don't know where else to post. 
Sorry for bothering you all
