I have an assignment due in less than 24hrs, that I need to do, that is of course if I don't kill myself tonight.I can't do any of this anymore, I feel like the world is closing in on me and nobody cares and nobody would even notice. 

Nobody has noticed that I'm depressed, or stockpiling painkillers.  I just can't take it anymore.  I tried to explain this to a teacher they said it would be stupid to drop out with only 3 months of high school left.

I don't want to drop out, I want to die.
