I don't see the point anymore, yet can't even succeed in killing myself...These day I've been wishing I could just go  to sleep and not wake up. Can't even succeed at ending my own life. Pass few days...honestly...tried, but was like some stupid force was preventing me. Sat there for like 20-30 minutes, trying to not think of anything and hopefully pass out, then my darn cat comes in, sniffing and licking my arm, and involuntarily felt myself take a deep breath, kind of like how a person gasps for air after surfacing from water after being under too long. Ugh...miserable honestly. Course mother doesn't understand, so can't talk to her. She has everyone fooled, but they don't know how she really is as a parent.

I'm honestly not seeing the point in a lot of things lately. Don't see the point of going to work when paycheck barely covers rent. Running out of time till remainder of rent is due (20th), can't do anymore partial payments, November is right around the corner and rent is due again by the 5th. 

Might be getting wages garnished from a bill that I can't pay..my liabilities exceed my income.

 Can't even end my own life though if I wanted to. Failed so many times over the years. Tried cutting twice, the 2nd time got to the point I could see the fatty tissue in my arm,and just ended up with a hole in my arm and scar as a reminder.

Tried overdosing on my thyroid medicine, but it only made me dizzy, lightheaded, headache, and nauseous, but didn't throw up. Nothing happened to me other than diarrhea the next day too.

Tried hanging myself several times over the years, but either just gave myself a massive headache and never passed out, or body started freaking out and clawing at the sheet or belt to get out of the noose.

I tried hanging myself again the last two days, as stated in the beginning of my text. But once again, only ended up with a headache, dry mouth, and a sore throat. Plus, face has freckles of red patches all over it.

I can't even kill myself correctly, and the fact is making me more frustrated. Thought of taking 50+ pills again of my thryoid medicine, or as many as I can before I can't swallow any more like before, but a part of me is scared to try that method again a 2nd time.

I don't have a gun to make it a faster exit, don't even know how to go about obtaining one. Only option really i hanging, ODing, maybe electrocution (probably not possible due to safety switch thing installed on all outlets in apartments these day). I dont have that many options, and the hanging has yet to be any success.

The only thing closely close to working is making myself pass out by hyperventilating in a crouched position, then standing up. Yet, don't want to mess up and end up hurting myself versus my intention of killing myself.
