SorryIm sorry. I know people on this sub have bigger issues than me but i just want to scream. 
My parents are sometimes so awful to me. My mum fat-shames me all the time. She isnâ€™t a fucking model. Like who tf is she to tell me that Iâ€™m ugly and unattractive to men. That my face is ugly and fat and sheâ€™s always punching my belly. I hate it. And Iâ€™m on the pill because some problems with my uterus so I just have so much anxiety to eat and im always hungry so i just want to throw up and vomit everything but i also dont want to waste food because i know people are starving and im lucky but like thats the only way i get to eat and still stay skinny. 
Again. Sorry. Fuck. I hate this
