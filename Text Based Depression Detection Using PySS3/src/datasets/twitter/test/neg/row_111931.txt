My job's sucking the life out of me and I've finally hit my breaking point.I've been crying my eyes out for last 2 and a half hours because of how much I hate this shitty retail place.
These assholes expect so much from me yet pay me so little, I fucking went with it for two miserable years but I'm so tired. I give them so much but they just talk down at me because I can't give them anymore. I'm done. I'm done caring about this place. I'm done caring about these coworkers. I'm done caring about my shitty managers who don't even see me as a human at this point. I'm just a cog in the machine they can easily replace with someone else. I can't even quit since I don't have anything else lined up yet.
My depression and anxiety has gotten so bad I can barely even pay the bills without feeling overwhelmed. All I can do to even think of surviving through the days is just playign video games when I'm not working or sleeping to just try to find any kind of enjoyment in this bitter life.
I just want to cut myself so much until I bleed nothing. I barely want to live but I don't have the fucking guts to end it.

I don't have anything to console me anymore. I don't have any friends, I live with my mom but she jsut judges me when I get like this. I only had my cat to help me but he died in April so I have nothing. I'm alone. There's no one to help me through this anymore.

I've already cut myself 4 times, I've gnawed on my hands and arms to stop these thoughts, I've scratched at myself to distract it, but nothings helping. It won't stop. I finally can't distract myself anymore. I'm stuck wallowing in this self-pity with no way out. I don't know what to do anymore.
