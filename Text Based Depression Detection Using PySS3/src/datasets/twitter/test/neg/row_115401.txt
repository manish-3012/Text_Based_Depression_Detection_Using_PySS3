Unsure if I should enjoy life while I can, or just go for the jump.I was not a good person throughout highschool. In my private time, I spent time simply making many derogatory, offensive, and just overall nasty jokes about any and all races, creeds, etc among friends I had made online. A good number of these were over facebook, and I was horrified to had rediscover them recently while searching through my messages.   
I am more or less convinced that these will come to light sooner or later,be it 10, 20, 30 years into the future, and I do not believe I am able to redeem myself, as anything I do to "make up for it" would only come off as hypocritical and, truthfully, selfish, because there is at least one small part that has me wanting to do good in the world is just to give me peace of mind, or to "vilify" me of these horrid things. Wrought with anxiety about \*when\* these messages come out, I am now in the predicament of either doing as much as I can with my life now before it all comes to shit, or just rather end it here and now, seeing as building up a life would be pointless if it would be torn down.  
Is there genuinely hope for me here? I'm truthfully just so frightened of both living on and also the prospect of dying, but I just can't take the guilt and fear anymore.
