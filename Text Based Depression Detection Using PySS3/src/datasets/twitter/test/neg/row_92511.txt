People say it will get better but theyâ€™re fucking liarsThey donâ€™t know if it will get better, they just want you to pretend like it is so they can be comfortable and donâ€™t have to deal with your problems. People donâ€™t want to deal with your problems, so they give you a false sense of hope with out actually doing anything. It give them an ego boost with no effort. If you say this will get better, then actually try fucking helping me.
