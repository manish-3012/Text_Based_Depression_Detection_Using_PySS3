Sixteen years old, would like some help.Hey. So I've been diagnosed with depression since last January when my mom found out that I was about to kill myself with Tylenol. I've been on Celexa ever since but lately it's been harder and harder to hide my depression. 

I think about it at least once every ten minutes. It's such an easy way out and sometimes I just feel so alone. I didn't make any friends until I was in the fifth grade and I still have very few. 

I have one friend I can talk to about this and she's so amazing. But I have feelings for her and I don't know what to do. I told her how beautiful I thought she looked yesterday. Our friendship is mostly texting, although she's in my school and was in my class two years ago.

I know that there's more important people on here, but I planned attempts every day for the past two weeks and I just want to get this information out there. 

Thanks, guys.
