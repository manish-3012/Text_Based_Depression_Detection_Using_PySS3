The only reason Iâ€™m alive is because Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll disappoint the people in my lifeI have no regard for my wellbeing

I havenâ€™t properly showered in 4 days and the only reason I showered 4 days ago is because my â€œboyfriendâ€ asked me to get in with him and he physically washed my body himself.

I havenâ€™t had enough to eat or water to drink if about 3 days because itâ€™s easier to slowly starve than it is to put the effort into cooking

I genuinely hate myself in every way. I love not a single aspect about myself and I canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s just my mood disorder or if I am justified for feeling this way.

I want to do it tonight. Iâ€™ve thought about it so much today. But the only method I have is extremely scary and would then force a family member to find me.

I donâ€™t want to disappoint anyone anymore. Iâ€™m so tired of constantly letting everyone down. And I feel like if I went through with anything it would just be more anger and disappointment directed towards me.

I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t know where to go. I donâ€™t know how to get off this fucking ride but Iâ€™m goddamned motion sick and this carousel needs new music you know?
