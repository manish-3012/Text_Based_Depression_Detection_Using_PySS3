I hate myself so muchwhenever I look at myself Iâ€™m literally so disgusted, especially the specific parts of me I canâ€™t change. I feel like my body is just abnormal and everyone elseâ€™s is normal like my friends. When I hyper focus on my body it puts me into a depressive episode for a week where I really plan on how to kill my self and think everything in my life is worthless. no ones gunna love me and will also be disgusted by my body. I wanna just restart on life with a new shell. Iâ€™m in one of those episodes now and my mind is really going into a dangerous place and Im struggling to stop it.I think a big part of me based how well my life is going on how well my relationships (romantic and platonic) are going and at the moment I donâ€™t have many friends that really care for me. Iâ€™m only 16 but I feel like my life has just been going on a downward spiral as Iâ€™ve gotten older. Like thereâ€™s obviously been good time periods but I always end up getting to this mindset I have now. Especially recently with how I see myself and body , I feel sick at the thought of anyone looking at it
