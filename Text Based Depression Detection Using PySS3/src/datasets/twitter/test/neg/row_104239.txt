Iâ€™ve had enough, I want to dieThrow away for obvious reasons.

Iâ€™m ready. Iâ€™ve had suicidal ideation for years now. I have reached out for help so many times And no one cares. Their response is either along the lines of â€œI feel youâ€ or â€œthen change your lifeâ€. Oh ok. Since itâ€™s so easy. Iâ€™m just done. I donâ€™t give a shit about anyone or anything anymore. The doctors just want to drown me in mind numbing pills which numb everything but the thought of how much I hate my life. Iâ€™m done being stuck in a life I donâ€™t want, with people who donâ€™t want me. I havenâ€™t decided if Iâ€™m going or overdose on every single pill I have or What. Hopefully itâ€™ll happen quickly so I can leave this god forbidden place.
