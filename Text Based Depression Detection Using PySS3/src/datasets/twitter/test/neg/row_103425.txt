wubba lubba dub dubi miss my life, when i was happy. i almost don't really sleep anymore, perhaps twice a week. i have been pushing myself constantly for over a year and i am still stuck.
i miss my ex. i still hallucinate. i get really upset when my hallucinations are about her. it reminds me of how i lost what is most important to me. i drove her away. if not, why did she leave.
i am in great pain, almost every night. i have new medication which i cant really take, as it doesnt allow me to function well and go to work.
i am literally working to earn money to seek help for my illness. it is really a bad cycle.
i do hope the past year had at least held some worth.
i am in great pain and i need help. i cant call the mental hospital because i dont want to be captured anymore. i want to be free ya know?
i am still trying to chase my dreams. keeping myself alive for it and that she told me if i were to leave, it would break her. how much pain could i cause her after driving her away.
i am in great pain, please help me.
