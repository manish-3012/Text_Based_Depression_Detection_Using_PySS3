I'd rather be dead than alone. Can't hurt when I'm dead.So sick of being alone. All I ever do is be alone with no one to talk to, no one to socially interact with or anything. I was born with a disability in my ankles so it's really hard for me to go anywhere on foot. "Friends" never visit, message, call or anything. I lie around all day with my phone in my hand hoping I get the chance to not feel so alone for a little bit, but it never happens. Recently lost the last person that would actually talk to me because they said I was using them after they told me I could vent. In my entire 18 years if life I've never, not once had any type of intimate interaction with a woman, either. Not once. No kiss, hand holding, cuddling or anything. I wanna feel loved and cared about so, so, so bad. It's all I want from life. That's it. And I'm fully convinced I will not, ever have that in any shape or form. Life is cruel. I wish I could just push a button and die.
