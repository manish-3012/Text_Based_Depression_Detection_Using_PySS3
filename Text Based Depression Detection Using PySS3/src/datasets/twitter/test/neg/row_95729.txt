My parents love my brother more than me. Are they going to feel happy if I die?Hi, I am 15 years old and I feel like I'm always second best if that, I feel like my parents regret having me.Â I have been struggling with depression for about a year and a half now and it isn't helping that my older brother is so obviously more favored than me. I try so hard to just please my parents but nothing I ever do is good enough and it really hurts. I do my absolute best in school even if it means little to no sleep, I ask for very little, I pay for my own wants.Â Whenever I bring up an idea that I would like to pursue I am immediately shot down.Â 
My father is a very abusive man, verbally and often threatens me physically. Like if my 19 year old brother does something to me like hit me or strangle me i get punished and he gets off with nothing. My dad and mum always tell me to shut up and they don't accept that I am not Christian like them, I can't believe in a god that allows this to happen to his people, I tried praying to him for so long and nothing changed, I lost faith that I can't ever get back.Â 
My brother didn't do well on school, he never did anything for himself, he still makes my mum iron his clothes everyday, he can't cook ANYTHING, he is pure lazy.Â 
My mum slaps me and my dad always threatens to hit me, once he got right up in my face (remember this is a tall, large man threatening a short 15 year old girl) and put his hands around my neck.Â 
Honestly I just want to die, I feel like no one would even care in my family if I did.
