I give up on being someone i know i'll never beI use to buy to the things will get better crap, but I know someone like me will never deserve happiness, sound pathetic I know. But i've lived my whole life denying what I truly am, using what was done to me as an excuse. 

 I fucking hate that i'm to scarred to end it, I'm a disgusting piece of shit even thought i've never done what was done to me I was close to hurting people. I abused animals physically and small cousin he looked up to me and follwed me around for some reason. I never sexually abused him like I was but I came close but I did grope someone when I was 11. I just can't take it anymore, even thought I will never lay a hand on anyone, I know i've wanted to and i'm tired of pretending I was ever a good man who just had a shitty childhood. 

I hate that i'm this way, I hate that apart me is capable of doing henious shit. And apart of me wants a sense of belonging, being with someone and all that pathetic bullshit. But I know this ends with a bullet inside my head, not sure if will be tommorow or years from now but I can't keep going on like this, lying to myself thinking that I will have someone whose going to save me.
