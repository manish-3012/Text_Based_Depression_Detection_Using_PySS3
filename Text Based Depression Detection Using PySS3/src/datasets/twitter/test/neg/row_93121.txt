I'm ScaredI feel like I'm just a burden on everyone around me. If I talk about suicidal thoughts or self-harm, I just upset my family. They tell me I'm just looking for attention or playing a game. My partner moved away from me because the stress of my depression was hurting him. I feel like I just ruin the lives of everyone around me. Despite trying to be mentally healthy, I feel completely alone. It feels like if I talk to anyone, it just leads to anger or them deciding to leave me. I just want someone to understand. I wonder how I will keep doing this. I can't be honest about the moments when I'm ready to give up. I'm scared about where my mind is right now. I try to pretend that everything is fine but moments like this, I can't. I'm scared.
