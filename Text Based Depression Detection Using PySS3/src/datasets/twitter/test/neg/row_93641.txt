Another nightAnother hopeless night. I come to Reddit seeking comfort in the words of strangers after ruining my life and losing everything.

I have nights where I hope I go to sleep and donâ€™t wake up. There comes a point when you experience so much pain that you stop believing you can rebuild. How toxic does life have to be? Why are some people stronger than others? Why do we judge those who want to give up? I sleep as much as I can to avoid living.

I feel such a void and I feel consumed by it.

I want out so badly and the things that I thought would keep me here have stopped outweighing the pain. One day Iâ€™m going to let go and be brave enough to free myself from this pain.
