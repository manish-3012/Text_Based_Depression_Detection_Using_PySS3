I'm terrifiedI want to kill myself so much, it's all I think about now. That may sound over exaggerated, but no matter what I'm doing, my mind will wander back to questions like "How would I do it?" "What would my parents do" "Will it hurt?" and I can't put any of those out of my mind. 

The truth is, I would do it if I wasn't so scared of messing up. What if I tried to hang myself and couldn't break my neck properly? I mean, sure, I'd die, but it would be slow and horrible. Or what if I tried to shoot myself and hit the wrong spot? I'd have to live with a chunk of my brain missing, and it's not like I could just go back and finish the job after that. What about if I tried to overdose? My parents or someone might find me, and then I'll have to go to the hospital and get my stomach pumped. I'd never be allowed freedom again. Or what about hopping in front of a train? What if it didn't kill me? I'd be left on the tracks in immense pain, not to mention how horrible the conductor would feel. 

That's the kind of thing I can't help but think of, and it terrifies me. Even the thought of failing to kill myself makes me shake, and I can't get the images out of my mind.
