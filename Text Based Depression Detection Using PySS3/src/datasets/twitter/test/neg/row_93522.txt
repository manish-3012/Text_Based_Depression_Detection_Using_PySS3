Not doing so well...Only friend I trusted out of my small group of friends doesn't believe me anymore, she's being fed lies by everyone else who hates me

Sitting here with a razor pricking myself in the arm. I have nobody left, and anybody that I did have left doesn't believe me anymore. I have nothing.
