I need friendsI have one, but we don't talk often. I am currently trying to beat a very long lasting depression and I'm in a dire need of support and human interaction. No matter how good I am doing its still much harder when I'm alone for prolonged periods of time. For the past week I've talked to someone other than cashiers once. I just need someone who I could text about some nonsense once in a while, who would help me progress and sort things out.
