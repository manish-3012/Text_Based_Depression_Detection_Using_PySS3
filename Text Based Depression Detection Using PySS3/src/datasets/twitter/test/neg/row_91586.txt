I'm so miserable. I hate myself more every day.Sorry guys. I know I come here pretty often to complain, but I don't feel like I can talk to anyone else without them looking on me with annoyance or pity.

I hate myself so much. I am awful at everything I try. I never get good at anything because I quit everything. I just get so frustrated and angry at whatever new hobby I pick up and I just can't progress because it stops being fun. I am unhygenic, my teeth are bad, I smell bad, and I try to do better with that shit, I try to make better habits, but it all falls apart. I can't start good habits to save my life. Every aspect of my personality is loathsome. I think about suicide daily, idly. I fantasize about ending everything so I don't have to see another day.

Some days are better than others. Some days I'm distracted by some new pursuit, or so caught up in looking at pornography that I don't think about much else. The only time I am happy is when I'm fapping, and that's always got an undercurrent of self loathing.

I just want to die. I never want to look in a mirror again. I wish I was someone better. I can't even trust myself to improve myself.
