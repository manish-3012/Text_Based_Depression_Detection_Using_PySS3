at the end of my ropeMy entire life revolves around how I look and it is almost debilitating. I spend money I don't have to try to be beautiful (so $ on clothes, makeup, facial fillers, skincare creams, etc.). The worst part is that I just hate everything about myself and barely leave the house because I'm worried someone will see how awful/disgusting I look and comment on it. Even simple things like grocery shopping make me so nervous and anxious. I am so tired and just want to be free from this all.
