Can't enjoy my life because I can't do hobbies I enjoy due to my circumstances, what is the point of living?I don't have a house or car are the circumstances that prevent me from doing the hobbies I enjoy. I want to do gardening, build and maintain a pond, and go fishing. I live in an apartment and can't afford a house. I can't afford a car because I am in college and am poor as a result.
