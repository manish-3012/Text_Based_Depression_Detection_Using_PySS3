Am suicidalI'm very depressed I have to kids sometimes I feel like killing myself and my two kids and all my  problems will end. What should I do who should I talk to. I tried to commit suicide three times but all failed. This time the thought of me committing suicide is very strong and I don't know what to do, the fear of me leaving my children behind scares me a lot, but I can't control myself ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢
