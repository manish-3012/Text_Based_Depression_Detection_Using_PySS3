23 years ago23 years ago this month my brother took his own life, and I have thought everyday for the last 23 years that I wished it would have been me that had died and not him. And so I have decided this is the end for me. In these 23 years I have been showed everyday how insignificant, unwanted and unloved I really am, not only from my so called family, but from the world as well. One day after I am gone you will finally love me.
