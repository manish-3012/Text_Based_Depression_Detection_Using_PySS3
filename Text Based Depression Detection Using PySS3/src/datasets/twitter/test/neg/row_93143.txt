is it supposed to hurt?honest question: sometimes when I'm feeling depressed, the center of my chest feels "panicky" kind of like the feeling of when you are spontaneously asked to go up front and speak publicly. is that how depression feels or am I feeling something else? usually when that feeling occurs, I become 10x depressed for a few moments. perhaps it's supposed to be a feeling of joy but my body has been conditioned to respond as being even more depressed? i dont know what I'm saying, sorry...
