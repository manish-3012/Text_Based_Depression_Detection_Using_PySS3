Everything I touch turns to shitI can't do anything right, and I seriously mean that. No matter what it is, I find some way to fuck it up. Just the way I look and talk and present myself is abysmal. My roommate can't stand me anymore and I don't blame her. Every week I fuck up so bad that I either seriously affect her day or even her work life. 

Yesterday my dog ate raisins (which cause kidney failure) and I had to rush her to the vet, but I called the emergency clinic first thinking that's what I needed to do. It was twenty minutes away and I don't have a car. There were several options in this situation that worked (Uber, especially), but for some reason because I'm an idiot I decide to call my roommate to come home from work (and I offer to pay her for the hours she'd miss). Turns out that I could have taken my dog to the vet for the same procedure, which is walking distance. My roommate was pretty pissed and understandably so. 

I realize this is one thing but it happens on a daily basis. My roommate afterwards said "your panic affects other people". I don't know how to turn it off. It's just part of me and it always will be. I was born wrong and I always will be a fucking idiot. I might as not exist because then I wouldn't be hurting or inconveniencing other people.
