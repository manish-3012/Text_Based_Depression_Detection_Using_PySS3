My friends see this as jokeTBH I feel like I am the only one that can be serious sometimes, whenever I say something about killing myself my friends laugh knowing that I won't. I think its nearly at the point where I want to and am just thinking about it. I know I'm never gonna do it because of course I have family and happiness somewhere in my life and was sord of curious to know if this was a normal thing that happens?
