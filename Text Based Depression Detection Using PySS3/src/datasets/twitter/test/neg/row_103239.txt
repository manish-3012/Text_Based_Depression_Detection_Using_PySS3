As long as he doesn't care it really doesn't matter.I am a 16 year old girl desperately in love with a 22 year old man.
And it sounds ridiculous and I know what you're thinking ("Love? It isn't love, it's lust/hormones/stupid 16 year old girl.")
I wish those thoughts were accurate.
He's my poetry coach and has been for around 6 months. At first I just crushed on him and imagined what it might be like if we hooked up, but it was just a silly fantasy. After sharing poetry though I guess you tend to get to know the deepest parts of someone and slowly I started really liking him as a person.
And then I guess I just fell in love.
Obviously he doesn't feel the same way and even if he did it's illegal where I live (USA). 
I guess I want to die because as long as he doesn't care it doesn't matter. It wouldn't matter if all 7 billion people on this planet cared about me as long as he didn't love me - I'd still want to die.
I don't know where to go from here. I don't know where to find the will to live. I just don't know anymore. And so I think I'm just done.
