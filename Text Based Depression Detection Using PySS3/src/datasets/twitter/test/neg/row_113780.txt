Whatâ€™s the quickest and least scary way to do this?I swear I canâ€™t go on and feel this pain for another minute. Nothing means anything to me, and Iâ€™ve lost all hope. I mean I donâ€™t have even an ounce of it any more. I feel so alone and so rejected. I feel things for someone who feels nothing for me. I thought this was the only person that knew me inside and out and loved me for those things. I thought this was someone who truly cherished me the way I cherished them
I was terribly wrong and everything Iâ€™ve done in the past decade was a complete waste of time and emotions. Itâ€™s all a lie. 

Itâ€™s not even just that. My good friend passed away. Someone in the family has stage 4 pancreatic cancer. My dog is getting old and senile very very quickly. Iâ€™m involved in so many weddings and I canâ€™t handle watching everyone be happy anymore while I die inside all day every day. I canâ€™t handle doing anything anymore because thereâ€™s a void in me no matter where I go or who Iâ€™m with.

Iâ€™m fat, Iâ€™m ugly, Iâ€™m old and old looking, I have no talent, I just have nothing. I feel completely empty and completely alone. No one is here for me the way I need. No one is ever going to understand.

I donâ€™t have the strength to heal. I have tried so hard, but I just donâ€™t have it in me anymore. 

God.

Iâ€™m so broken and Iâ€™ve never felt this urgent need to die like I do right now.
