Well this is great. I go to seek out help and they put me on suicide watch. Now I have a fucking case or some shit and they're gonna call me regularly to keep a check on me. That's such nonsense. Everyone should leave me the fuck alone. I wish everybody fucking hated me because that would make me killing myself much much easier. I could enjoy it more and do it slowly. They changed my antidepressants because zoloft didn't suit me and made me kill myself even more. And they gave me xanax for my fucking panic attacks that got worse when I was on zoloft. I also think I have a drinking problem even though I've only been drunk like 4 or 5 times. I can't control myself. I have promised myself never to drink again because alcohol won't make my problems go away. Fuck this shit. I bite my lips when I get anxious. Last time I did that I had swollen lips for 2 weeks because I literally chewed off the skin on the lips and it was taking ages to heal. I did that again today and I'm worried that my lips are going to be swollen tomorrow. I've made plans to go out even though I don't want to. The longer I'm alone, the more time I get to think about killing myself. I don't know what to do any more. I'm sucking on lollipops to stop myself from biting my lips and fucking chewing the skin off. 

I don't know why I'm posting this. Nobody needs to worry about me. Just needed to vent and know that it's out there and *someone* is reading this and knowing I'm not feeling good at all right now.
