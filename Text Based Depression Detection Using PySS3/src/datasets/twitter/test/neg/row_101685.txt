Hospital discharged me while I was still suicidal...I admitted myself to hospital yesterday to the advice of a crisis worker. I was very suicidal, with a plan that I openly shared.

After getting to hospital, I spoke with a worker and let them know I was scheduled for ECT later that day, and that I didn't want to miss a session since it is a core part of my depression treatment.

I went to my session and when I woke up I was informed that I was discharged from the hospital. I would have strolled right out and to the location of my suicide if it hadn't been for a couple of friends arriving and putting me back through emergency.

I am still blown away that psych emerg was just going to let me go kill myself without doing a thing to stop it. I thought I was more important than that....

So now here I sit in hospital waiting for a psychiatrist. I have a feeling I won't get taken seriously here....
