I am so tiredToday is the day everyone is getting their university degree. I'm not. I can't open my socials without seeing their happy faces and their dresses and their cakes and wines... 
And I'm still here, 1 exam left and sick and tired. 
They are in their amazing luxurious houses while I'm working ever since day one of uni so that I could afford studying. 
My family keeps fighting over anything, it's almost impossible to go to sleep and wake up without some of them screaming. 
I had sex for the first time with the boy I'm in love with, now he's distant and keeps ignoring me. 
My best friends are in love and since they kept fighting, they used me as the capro espiatorio so that hating me they could team and blame me for their problems. 
I have no one. 
I am nothing. 
I won't do anything. 
Even breathing hurts now. 
I can't live like this anymore but any time things start to get better I ruin everything. 
I'm so so sorry. 
I didn't want to became like this.
