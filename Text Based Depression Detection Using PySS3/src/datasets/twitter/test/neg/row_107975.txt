I'm really not okay.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am a 15-year-old male suffering from anxiety, depression and a dissociation disorder.    
I am failing in my sophomore year of school and my only friends I am not very close to,    
I am also not close to my family either. Only my friends know about my depression but    
they do not know about the anxiety or the dissociation disorder. I am not a very social    
person as I just usually keep to myself. I have not talked to any counselors or therapists    
about my mental health. I do not trust any of my friends to tell them more because with    
the information they do know they exploit it and bring me down. I've been in a couple    
relationships, they were either very short or emotionally abusive. I have only done    
something similar to this once on an anonymous chatline, it was not much help at all.    
I really don't know what kind of help I could get without having my parents involved in    
the situation because my relationship with them is horrible. I know I require help but I    
just don't have any idea as to what to do.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am not sure why I am even here, I don't know why I am bothering to type all this    
out. Maybe I just need to vent and just get this off my chest. I know one thing for sure    
and it is that I am sick and tired of having to wake up every day, drag myself out of bed    
and fake a smile. Every day is a living hell, whether it's going to school all day with horrible   
 friends or the weekends of trying my best to stay away from my toxic family. Ever since I    
started dissociating I have been thinking really deep into what our/my existence and    
reality really is. After spending every day being confused as to what my ever-changing    
perception of reality means, I lost all my reasons to live and try anymore. What happens    
after death could be anything, there are infinite possibilities, and just the curiosity of that    
alone makes me want to kill myself. Life is just so hard, and over time its only been    getting   
 worse. Sometimes I start to lose the fact that I am a person who has feelings and emotions,    
so I resort to self-harm. Self-harming is something that I'm ashamed of and hide, but at    
the same time, I struggle to stop as it is the only thing that will remind me that I am still    
human. Every day I am giving it my all to hold back the tears and hold up a smile and a    
positive attitude. But the reality of it is, there is no reality for me. I'm lost from reality    
and there is no coming back because there is no cure. If I'm stuck like this for life then    
I might as well end it all because it's only downhill from here. With my grades, I will be    
lucky if I even escape high school. It is just so exhausting to maintain composure and    
continue with my life when I'd rather be dead. I am really stuck with killing myself or    
turning to drugs. I'm near the end of my rope and I can only go for a few more weeks    
at most. I'm probably just rambling on now but my mind is just so fucked I am having    
trouble concentrating. It's just too much, there isn't any hope for me
