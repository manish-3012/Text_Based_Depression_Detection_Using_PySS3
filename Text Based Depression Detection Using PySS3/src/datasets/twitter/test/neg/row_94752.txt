I'm like a broken record with this shit latelyi'm depressed, i end up snapping at the people i care about, i lose friends in droves. Nobody understands. I'd rather cry than do almost anything. It's been this bad for so long and I don't even know who i was before depression started probably just a kid or something i dunno. i'm trying to lose weight and can't even do that obviously because i've been at the same weight for a month now with no changes.

there isn't a day i don't think about dying, albeit passively, sometimes it's strong, times like now it's loud and clear. offing myself is all i can think about lately
