Last time, I posted here that my dog saved me from doing it, and now he is lostI posted last time here that I was about to do it, but my dog is the reason why Iâ€™m still here and didnâ€™t do it that time. 4 days ago, me and Bay (my dog) were chilling in my backyard like we used to. My backyard was an open area with no fence so he can freely play in a large open field and play with the goats and shit. Our usual routine was me chilling and having a beer and he is running the shit out of his stamina in our backyard. I usually go inside first and then he will just bark in front of our backyardâ€™s door to let me know that he is done playing. At that time, I was wondering why it was taking so long for him to come back and when I checked my backyard, he is gone. I donâ€™t know where he went, and Iâ€™ve been finding him for 4 days in our area. I donâ€™t know if someone got him or what. I donâ€™t know if he is still alive or not. Bay, please come home. Youâ€™re the only one that makes me alive, if youâ€™re not there anymore then maybe I will come with you too. I am so pissed of myself since it is my fault. I let him play outside without a leash. Iâ€™m sorry Bay. I hope you come back soon. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
