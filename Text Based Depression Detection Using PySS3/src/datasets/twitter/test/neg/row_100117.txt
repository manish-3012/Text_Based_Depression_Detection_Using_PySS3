I just wanna tell everybody Iâ€™m gonna kill myself soon.My home life has always been super stressful.

I had a dream last night that my parents got in a fight, and my dad started hitting my mom over and over and over until finally she died. She wasnâ€™t bleeding or anything, but was dead and it was so scary, it was the most real dream and I can hardly even see my screen rn with all my tears. Last week was the only week in months that was good. I went to school every day, parents didnâ€™t fight, and got good grades. After having that dream I woke up just feeling super terrible. To sum it up, my mom always flips out on me (she goes insane) and then I end up flipping out and then I absolutely canâ€™t go to school bc Iâ€™m a mess. Today it felt different though. I ran to the bathroom and I felt like I was going to be killed (my parents are both great people they wouldnâ€™t kill me). My mom was talking to me outside the bathroom door and I remember leaning a little bc I genuinely felt for a second she had a gun to the door and was gonna shoot me if I said I wasnâ€™t coming out.

I was in my bathroom basement where it is very â€œundoneâ€. It has no shower, just a toilet in a tiny room with cinder block walls and a sliding wooden door. I looked around and could imagine me chopped up on the floor dead or something.

I ended up sleeping after my mom finally stopped going absolutely insane on me and then my dad. I would like to add, I usually never freak out until she does. I had full intentions on going to school, but then she made stuff so much worse by going insane on me.

Iâ€™ve always had â€œsuicide thoughtsâ€ but I think everybody sometimes thinks to themselves â€œgod I would rather be dead rnâ€ but that always goes away and they would never kill themselves. Today, once my mom left I went up in my room and made it as dark as I could to relax. 

I started thinking, â€œif I killed myself an hour ago, by now it would be done, I would be gone, I wouldnâ€™t even feel the pain anymoreâ€. This way of looking at death is a way I can look at it where I could be alright with killing myself. The whole time Iâ€™m dying, even if itâ€™s painful, I can just keep telling myself â€œitâ€™s almost done itâ€™s almost doneâ€ and it will be.

I remember laying down telling God â€œIf you let me die rn when I sleep I wonâ€™t mindâ€ and looking back, if I died a few hours ago, no, I donâ€™t mind.

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll kill myself today or maybe even soon. But I could any time I want now. 

Tomorrow is my birthday and itâ€™ll also be a Snow Day. I wonâ€™t have my phone or anything, so I canâ€™t make plans with any friends. With that said, Iâ€™m planning on waking up, laying on my floor, not eating, going to my weekly Wednesday therapy appointment, and then just continue to lay down. 

I just wanted to get everything out there. Iâ€™m probably crazy too now. Iâ€™m probably just a mentally insane person.
