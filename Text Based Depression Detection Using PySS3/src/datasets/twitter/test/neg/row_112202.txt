Nowhere to fucking goI'm 15, a female, and I'm just about ready to fucking die. I "live" with my eternally PMSing mom and my middle-school-dropout crackhead sister, who I'm pretty sure wants to kill me. Every fucking time I come home I'm reminded how much my sister wishes I would just get on with it and kill myself, and my mom's never fucking around. I can bare being home for a little bit - probably three hours at most. 

Needless to say, I never want to be there. I hop from one friends house to the other, and everyone is fucking done with me. One of my friends loves me and so does her family, but I had been there for two weeks straight and I could tell they wanted a break. So, I ventured to my other friends house where I've been for about six hours. Six fucking hours. I've already managed to break one of her sisters toys and annoy the hell out of everyone, to the point that my friend was repeatedly telling me that I was a fucking waste of space and she doesn't want me here. I know she was just angry because she had to fix the stupid toy, but god did it hurt. 

Now I'm hiding in a back room, my heart beating a fucking million times a minute, and I so want to fucking not exist. 

I have nowhere else to fucking go. Nowhere. I've been contemplating trying to remove myself from my mother's care, because she does jack shit for me, but then I realized no one else would take me in. Even if I did manage to get away from her, I'd probably be stuck with another one of my crackhead relatives or put in the care system. 

I just don't know what to fucking do anymore. Right now, killing myself would just seem like the best thing to do for all these poor people I'm leeching off of. I hate to burden people. 

God, this is longer than I thought it would be. Sorry. 

I have no where to fucking go, hell, I couldn't even figure out where to post my stupid fucking sob story. 

I'm sorry to whoever read this far. I'm a waste of your fucking time.
