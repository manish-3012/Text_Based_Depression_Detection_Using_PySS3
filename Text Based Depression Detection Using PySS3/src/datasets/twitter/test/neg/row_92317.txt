I need to end it, I'm suffering unbearablyPeople tell me to stay because they know it gets better (guess what? They don't and they don't know what I feel all the time), or because committing suicide is selfish or cowardly ([it's not cowardly](https://ibb.co/b1vLjcV)). It doesn't make me feel better, I just want it to end and I've honestly tried everything that would make me better that involved living, nothing worked. I just want to die now. I need to die. I don't deserve to suffer so much.
