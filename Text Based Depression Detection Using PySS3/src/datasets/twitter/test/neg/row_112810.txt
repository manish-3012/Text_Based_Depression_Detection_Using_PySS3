I dont belong anywhereIm 19 years old and ive been unemployed for 4 months. I quit my super shitty less than part time job for a full time job at a big corporation and i quit after 1 week. Spent the next 6 weeks preparing for community college and did a week of that till I quit followed by  a suicide attempt. Spent the next 7 weeks doing nothing until just recently. Ive applied for jobs and the interviews have been going horrible because im a very shy, introverted, awkward person. Every time I quit or fail at something, I take a blow to the little confidence i have and it makes it that much harder to pick myself up and put myself back out there. I just want to give up. I feel like i dont belong anywhere. Every thing that I do or try to do is just so I can tell my family that im doing something so I don't look like a pathetic deadbeat. My girlfriend says my place in this world is with her but I feel like it isnt enough. I should be contributing but everytime i try, I freak out and get suicidal and quit. I just dont have a place in this society and on this planet and I want to give up because that is the only way I'll be able to find peace.
