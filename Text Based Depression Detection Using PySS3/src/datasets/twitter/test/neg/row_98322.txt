I don't think life is for meI can never escape the negativity and constant self hate that goes on in my brain. I have terrible anxiety and depression and I can't enjoy life at all because of it. I can't. I've been on increasing anti depressants for 5 years and I'm at the point where I don't care about anything, more than I don't every other day of my life, but I'm in a weird mood - pathetic fallacy that I can only describe as the sound a video game makes when the character dies and everywhere in real life it is humid and rainy and too relaxing. 
I don't want to take my life out of fear of embarrassment of my friends finding me, my family and everything else I'm a burden on the world as it is and I can't have my death make theirs even worse.
