I cant do itI can't fucking do it anymore

I'm sorry for it all but I can't do this, I've doesn't therapy, I take drugs, everything but I just can't do this anymore, o hate waking up, I hate facing work, I lost my closest friend, my girlfriend stepped away for a while and I'm really losing my mind, I just wanna drill into my skull till I can't feel it anymore, I can't focusing do this I'm 7000$ in debt, credit card and loans from parents, my car is broken, I dropped out of school, I can't fucking do it, the pills don't do a god damn thing, FUCK everything hurts so god damn bad! I'm sobbing but I know i won't do it because I'm a fucking pussy, I can't even cut, I can do 110 down the road in the rain but I can't cut my damn wrists GOD FUCKING DAMN WHY AM I EVEN HERE FUCKKK! 

I can't do this guys...I can't. I miss her so bad but we swore not to text, all my friends are busy and I don't want to bother the suicide hotline with my dumb idiotic problems, I should just go pull the trigger in the bathtub so it's a easy clean up, I don't care anymore. It just hurts.  I can't make it to the end of the day.
