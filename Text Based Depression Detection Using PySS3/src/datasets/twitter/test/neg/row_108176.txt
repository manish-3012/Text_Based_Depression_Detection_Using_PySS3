So if i can just man up enough to kill myself and not hurt anyoneHey so 21f here. I'm pre-med and depressed and in therapy and on meds. And in a relationship with an amazing guy. 

So. I met my bf's (22m) best friend and its kinda just brought up some thoughts. My bf is one of those people whos found his purpose in life and is amazing and kind to all those he teaches. And just. I wish I could take myself out of his life. Bc I feel like I'm a grenade. 

I've had suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember I'm working on it but recently my brains getting good at finding better ways to off myself. I just want to leave my apartment and walk into oncoming traffic so no one can definitely say it was suicide and my bf can find an amazing gf who can support him whole heartedly and not have to go away for med school without feeling torn. Someone who can do best for him. 

I don't want to worry anyone. I hate being a burden on anyone which is why I'm so incredibly bad at reaching out when I'm like this. I just want to stop feeling like I'm an inconvenience go everyone. Like if I just removed myself, it would be the best for everyone even if they were sad at first.
