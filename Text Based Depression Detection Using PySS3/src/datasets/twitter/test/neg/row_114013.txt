I feel so hopelessI can't be happy if I'm not in a relationship and all of my relationships end almost right away resulting so much pain that it wasn't worth it.

 I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone because nobody stays.

 Most of the time I'm daydreaming of blowing my brains out.

I just want out. 

I feel like I'm trapped here in my life.

I feel so hopeless.
