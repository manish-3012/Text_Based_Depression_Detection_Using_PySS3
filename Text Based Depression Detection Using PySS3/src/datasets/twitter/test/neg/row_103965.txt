Can't think of a title. Just someone respond please. Anyone. Fuck.I just want to be good at something. I just want to have a friendship. I'm so clingy that it drives everyone out. I'm miserable. Even when I cry to others for help they just dismiss me. I can't find any activity that I don't get bored with almost instantly. I'm sick of this uphill battle. What is it all for anyways? I'm going to die one day. I might as well make it today to end the suffering.
