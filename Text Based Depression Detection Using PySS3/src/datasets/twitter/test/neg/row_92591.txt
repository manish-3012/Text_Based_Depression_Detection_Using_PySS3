I think I may have sexually harassed someone and itâ€™s killing me.Iâ€™m 23, gay and I had hocd (intrusive thoughts ocd) about a year ago. There is something I did that is defeating me at the moment and itâ€™s getting me really anxious. Last year I was suicidal and hocd was driving me completely insane. I was seeking reassurance if I was really gay. I needed to put this obsessions to rest (it was killing me) and looking back, I asked someone I trusted a very innapropriate question. At the time, I had no one to talk to and this was the closest person I had who I trusted. I must stress that This obsession was killing me and I needed an answer. I sought reassurance and I asked my then 16 year old cousin this:
Does jerking off to thoughts of men mean Iâ€™m gay?
What do you think about when you masturbate? Woman?
What do I do? This anxiety is making me suicidal.
He was quiet and didnâ€™t answer. Then I said thinking of men isnâ€™t normal, huh? He said no. I asked if I should go to therapy. He said yes. After he left, I went online to find a doctor. Now a year later, I feel stupid for doing that. It causes me anxiety thinking about it. I let hocd make me look like a fool. Worse, it problaby freaked my nephew out. We still talk from time to time. What are your thoughts on this situation? What should I do?
