I feel like I'm suffocating. It's hard to breathe.My anxiety attacks are getting worse. Im drained every day. Nobody talks to me. Im alone. Nobody cares. I want a hug. To be held by someone. But all I feel is emptiness. Stress. I cant breathe. The anxiety attack is smothering me. I want it all to stop.
