Iâ€™ve staved off the darkness for another night, but iâ€™m not sure if I can keep doing itHi,
Iâ€™ve been dealing with anxiety and depression for some years now (the depression comes and goes, but the anxiety has been a near constant). Its recently gotten almost unbearable due to me being sexually assaulted earlier this year and with me growing to hate my old major (iâ€™m a 20 year old guy in college rn). I tried to kill myself back in April but thankfully managed to snap out of it and call my dad and after awhile felt that I was on the up and up. But for some reason I started feeling worse again. I just canâ€™t stop feeling that Iâ€™m just a burden on those whom I love and care for. I feel like if I try and open up again, theyâ€™ll start thinking that iâ€™m doing it for attention and maybe theyâ€™ll grow distant. I want to tell someone but I donâ€™t want them to shoulder my issues.

I hit rock bottom again a couple hours ago, but managed to once again drag myself out of it. But I donâ€™t think I can keep doing this.

Please help
