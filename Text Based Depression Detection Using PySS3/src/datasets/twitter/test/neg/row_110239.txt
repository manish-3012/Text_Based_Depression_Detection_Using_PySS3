Sigh....I confronted (LDR) girlfriend... Again. Started crying and denying.. 
She hung up and said she couldn't do this tonight. 
From a good/decent day/night, communicating, talking, to this. Why do I love this damn girl so much? I hate her. 
*Sigh*
I'm so heartbroken, depressed, sad. I can't sleep anymore... ðŸ˜”
I don't know what to do.. I feel so trapped. So empty. So dead...
