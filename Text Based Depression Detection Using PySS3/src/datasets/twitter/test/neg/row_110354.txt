Better yet worseFor once I actually have a couple of things to look forward to and to keep my occupied.
The first thing I look forward to is an english contest I qualified for.It is really refreshing to be able to focus on something I'm good at while all my other grades collapse around me(I only passed math because my teacher had mercy).The stuff I do while I prep for the next step in the contest keeps me occupied.

The second thing I look forward is the guy I like talking more and more often to me.To outside eyes this just seems like stupid teenage crushes but it means a lot to me since I'm a guy as well and living in a homofobic place.I'm not sure whether he is just trying to be friendly or actually interested but talking to him is allways nice.

The third I look forward to is a possible vacation at the sea which will help with my lung problems.
Also I no longer have that much trouble sleeping so that's nice.

Now for the bad stuff

I had planned my suicide to be yesterday but somehow I completly forgot about it.I don't understand how.I thought about it all day but as soon as I had the moment I forgot.I remeverd about it in the dead of night when sleep was allready creeping it.I intentionaly didn't take notes at school thinking that it wouldn't matter by this time and now I'm behind.I tried writing a suicide letter but I couldn't put a word on the blank page.I find myself not being able to be honest not even when I'm about to die.
This isn't all about yesterday tho, the suicidal thoughts are creeping up on me all the time now.I fantazized about it all day, I just wish that I could see other persons reactions.
I can't be honest in person about how I am suicidal so I'm thinking of repeting an accident intentionaly to tell my english teacher.She's amzing and I think she could maybe help me somehiw.That accident went like this: I was writing something on a piece snd she saw the title(which was "Letters from the past") and insisted that she's will see what I wrote despite never going to far.All I have to do is change "Letters from the past" to "Suicide Letter"
