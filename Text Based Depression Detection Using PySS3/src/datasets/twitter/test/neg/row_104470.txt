How do you force everyone out of work and still make them pay bills?That $1200 hasnâ€™t even come yet and itâ€™s already gone. I have no fucking money and now I have no income. And nowhere is fucking hiring. Iâ€™m so sick of everything. Every time I solve one problem in my life several more arise and I canâ€™t fucking so it anymore
