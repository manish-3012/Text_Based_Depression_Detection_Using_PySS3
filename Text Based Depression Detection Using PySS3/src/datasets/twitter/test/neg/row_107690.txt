My Best Friend is Killing Me6 years, I've known this girl for six years and I've trusted her with everything. I've told her so much and she's always been with me and besides me and supported me. She started dating someone new, some fucker who thinks she's an honest to god alien and has been brainwashing my friend and now it's like she's a totally different person... she doesn't talk like a normal person, she can't function in society but she keeps getting applauded online and keeps acting out because it gets people's attention... The girlfriend (alien?) wants me dead. She honestly thinks I deserve to die. Now my best friend of 6 years who always told me the world isn't black and white, and that no one deserves to be tarred and feathered for simply existing, now she wants me dead too. She's planning to take away my business and I'm afraid I'll lose all my friends. I'll have nothing left. But I don't care about that, I just feel so betrayed. I let her stay in my house on multiple occasions, paid for her air fare, paid for her food and other treats.... We spent $350 on this damn girl in january when I caught the flu, just to keep her safe from catching it.... There's nothing left for me, I think I'm a bad person, and I don't see a future for myself especially now. If 6 years of friendship, considering her FAMILY meant nothing, then how can I mean anyone to anything? I've always wanted the most good for the most people, I wanted to study social work to help victims of human trafficking... I'm too fucked up though, im just no good and can't do a thing for anyone.
