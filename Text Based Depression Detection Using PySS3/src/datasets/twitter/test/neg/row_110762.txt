Ah, here came my old friend, depression.Iâ€™m feeling relatively calm right now. But thereâ€™s a few things Iâ€™d like to get off my chest.

My family is aware of my mental state, but they usually avoid talking about it. When I was living on my own, although itâ€™s more alone, I can express my feelings however I like. At home, I dare not to cry, because every time I do, my parents scorn me for being weak or emotional.

But thatâ€™s not the hardest part.

The hardest part is that, I believe Iâ€™ve been sexually abused when I was a kid. But I canâ€™t tell anyone about it.

I was barely 10, I think. And I live with my grandparents, my uncle and aunt for summer holidays, because my parents were too busy working. One morning, I woke up, and I felt something against my genitals, I thought it was a fist, and that itâ€™s accidental, so I went back to sleep. But now I know better, so this weird feeling wonâ€™t go away. Obviously I canâ€™t prove anything, but the guilty party is already in jail (for other reasons).

And thereâ€™s my cousin, I was also about that age. I think he asked for a hand job or something, in exchange, he bought me some snacks. He currently is having a huge debt for gambling. His mom wonâ€™t stop coming to our house and ask us for more and more money.

These horrible memories just wonâ€™t go away. Please help if you can.
