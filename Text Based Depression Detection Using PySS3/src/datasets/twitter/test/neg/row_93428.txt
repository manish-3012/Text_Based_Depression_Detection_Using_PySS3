I foreal am about to go insane...I was a fuxking good boy back then. All i want is this dream/non existent job instead of school, or this childhood feeling. 

I really actually want this job, without that is why i am heavily depressed now. I wish instead of school i could've just... "Go spearfish with a few other adult spearfishermen in the open on a boat, and catch big fish with 1 breath underwater." I trained for a whole year for a dam waste. Now i already have plans to...  in few months by (electrocution.
I hate this shit-hole we live in. I feel like we are supposed to die at 15 years old, because everything that was fun and intresting is dead now. I heard at the age of 40 is when you start to decay.
