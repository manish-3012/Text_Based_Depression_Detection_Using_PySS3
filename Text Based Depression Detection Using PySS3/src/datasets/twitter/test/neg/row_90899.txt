Hospitalization and disability/wheelchair?Hi. 
I have disabilities. CFS/ME (chronic fatigue), POTs (postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome), and others. 
I use a powered wheelchair because I can't stand up/walk around without passing out, and my cfs makes me too exhausted to be able to use a manual chair. I own my own chair. If I were to be hospitalized could I keep my chair? I don't want to me unable to get around on my own... That would just make the feeling of being a burden and being helpless that much worse...
