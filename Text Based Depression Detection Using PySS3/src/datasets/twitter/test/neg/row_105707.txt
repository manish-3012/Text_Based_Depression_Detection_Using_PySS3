What is the point of this?I'm nearly 40yrs old. Worked meaningless jobs for over 20yrs now. What is the point of all this? Why survive? What am I waiting for? old age? more health problems? Is it my personality? I feel disconnected from everyone, dont' enjoy small talks or regular conversations. I guess I'm all alone in this world.
