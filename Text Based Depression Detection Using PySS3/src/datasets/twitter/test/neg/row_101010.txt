got referred to mental health servicesa while ago my mum found my self harm and took me to the doctor who referred me to mental health services and I finally got to see someone about it and I lied and said I wasn't thinking of suicide or anything when really I think about it every day and I have a plan and I'm so close to going through with it

sorry just needed to rant
