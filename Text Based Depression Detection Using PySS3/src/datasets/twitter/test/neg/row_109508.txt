please i'm begging help me anyone please i just don't know what to do anymorei don't know what to anymore.. i've made countless posts here before, i know, but i'm all out of options and a single step away from death.

i'm fourteen and i've pretty much been done with life for a long time now. it's just not worth it to me, in any way. even as a kid, a future just never appealed to me and it still doesn't. i've felt trapped all of my life.

i'm horrendously deep in my eating disorder and self harm, i've been homeschooled all my life so i have no real life friends.. i geniunely can't bring myself to leave my bed, i can't study or retain information. i lack the ability to be happy - i really do.

i've been planning this particular suicide for years now, i know exactly what i'm going to do and how i'm going to it. i'm acting on it this saturday, and i'm just so fucking relieved that i will finally be able to leave this wretched place.

i don't want to call the police or a hotline, or tell a family member. i just.. i don't know anymore. i shouldn't be posting in here. i just want to give life one last final chance. i'm so so sorry for everything, i wish i could have been better than this but i'm a failure.
