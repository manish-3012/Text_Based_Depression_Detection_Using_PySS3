Head-injury suicidality is worse than all else. If you donâ€™t have it, count yourself lucky.Iâ€™ve experienced â€˜degreesâ€™ of suicidal ideation over my lifetime â€”- this one is the worst. If you have a biochemical type instead, thereâ€™s still hope for you. Iâ€™d pay money to have my former depression back. At least it was treatable.
