I'm dead inside, my depression won.please forgive the metaphors. I've been in this hell for like 8 years now, and every step trying to get up brought me down and down this dark abyss. I've tried to seek help....nothing worked; friends who say they be there but vanish when you most need anybody, or say "I only meant that at the time" or " sorry didn't realized you were this fuck up" or my favorite "just be happy". therapy was always out of reach and even if i got it......it never helped, i'm mean i've had to call suicide helpline three times now.  family, yeah they won't care. point is i tried and killed every shred of humanity in the process of trying to get better, basically I'm broken, defected or now obsolete. my pain is constant, sharp and ever growing. I'd go into detail...but i don't think it matters anymore. 
So I made my choice, I'm already dead in the inside. lets finish the job. I'm mean I did what i could, there's no point in going on. it be like killing a fatally wounded animal, lets face it I'm not human anymore. I can't feel anything positive anymore. so I made my choice. death is my only way out now. I not looking for help, I've learned my lesson. and I'm not looking sympathy or pity. if  any thing think of some horrible monster you hate and would delight to see suffer writing this. I just want to, i don't know; just say something i guess. and no i won't be killing myself right now, but it will be soon. so please don't be sad for me.
My depression won. it beat me. so i guess this is most likely a goodbye or later if you believe in that whole afterlife stuff.
