will things ever get better for me?it gets better right?? please tell me it gets better miraculously somehow.. i just want to feel happy about something. i want to feel like i can have something that won't get ripped away the second i start to think all the pain is over. I'm stuck with abusive family at 15 so i can't get a job to move away from them, and i have no friends to even give me a small bit of freedom. I'll do anything to get away from here, even if it means dying. maybe I'll stop disappointing everyone when I'm dead..
