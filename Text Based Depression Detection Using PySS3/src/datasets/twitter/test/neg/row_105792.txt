I feel like my life is over.I haven't posted here before, but I'm desperate for an outside opinion.  I feel like my life is over.  My husband, who I've been with for 10 years and with whom I have two children, has realized he wants to be with men, seemingly out of the blue.  He's moved into to our basement and made an apartment down there, and is actively dating.  I am more devastated than I've ever been.  I gave up finishing my college degree to have a family with him.  I have no money, no job experience (I've spent the last 7 years as a stay-at-home mom), no education.  We can barely make ends meet as it is, which is why we are  still living under the same roof.  I love my husband so very much, and I feel incredibly alone and desperately sad.  I cry all day long.  I can't think about eating or sleeping.  I gave up the best years of my life for a relationship that has disintegrated into nothing.  To add insult to injury, he doesn't seem to be mourning our breakup at all, but rather giddily dating and discovering new things.  To make matters worse, I have started thinking I might be bipolar.  I have episodes where I feel invincible, my mind races and my emotions cycle rapidly, and I feel like I could stop a train.  When it's over I'm exhausted and cry for hours on end.  I can't confide in my family, who are fundamentalist Christians and would freak out about my husband's new-found homosexuality rather than focus on the actual problem at hand, and would probably find a way to blame me for it.  I am so horribly alone and frightened, and I don't feel the need to go on.  I don't even feel like grocery shopping, much less trying to get back into the world and meet new people.  None of it seems  worth it anymore. I can't imagine anyone ever loving me again, or ever feeling happy or content again.  I am tired of being.
