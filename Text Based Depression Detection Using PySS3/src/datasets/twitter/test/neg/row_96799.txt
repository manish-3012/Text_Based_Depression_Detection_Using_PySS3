[15/M] Giving myself two weeksI've had enough. I want to die. I'm failing 2/4 of my classes and i don't see it getting any better. My mom has told me countless times she doesn't care where i end up in life, and i think today was the last straw. She told me that i am worthless and i need to go. So, i guess this is it. i'll be checking back here periodically but if i don't pull myself out of this shit hole, i'll be gone in two weeks. Thank you reddit community (on my main you guys are so nice) but this is my goodbye letter.
