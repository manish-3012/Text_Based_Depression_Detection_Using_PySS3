I can't take it anymore.Apologies for poor grammar or half-thought out ideas. Obligatory throwaway.

I can't take it anymore. I've tried everything to be happy. I've worked my fucking ass off for the last 6 years. I obtained a job many would consider lucky, or ideal. I live in a city that many would be jealous of making the money that I make, and I've done things that many envy me for. 

And how do I feel? Absolute shit. I can't be happy no matter what I try, no matter what I accomplish. It feels like I'm trapped in a vicious cycle of attempting to outdo myself and ending up in a pit of even deeper sadness.

The last time I tried to end it all was back when I was diagnosed with severe depression, 4 years ago. I graduated college, I obtained a good job, and I have plenty of friends around me. Why does nothing ever feel like it's enough to keep me alive? 

The only thoughts in my mind are ways to end it all, but the only thoughts keeping me alive are knowing I'm drunk.

I know this is confusing and cryptic. I just don't know how to sleep tonight.
