BullyingI can totally understand why and how bullying would drive a person to take their own life. It's cowardly. I'm lucky because I'm at a place in my life where it doesn't make me want to kill myself. Still, I am being bullied and it has driven me to tears and broken me down to the point where I can feel the cracks in my armor and I'm ready to just admit that I'll never be who I want to be...that what this bully is saying about me is correct.
