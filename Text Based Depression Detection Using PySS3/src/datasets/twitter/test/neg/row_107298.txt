Life fucks me every single fucking day.All I want is to die. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore, Iâ€™ve felt like this all of my adult life and my mind has never changed, not for a single day. 

I donâ€™t treat my diabetes hoping it will kill me, and Iâ€™m unlucky enough to not suffer from any other illnesses, I donâ€™t even get colds. 

Iâ€™m currently sat on the high wall of a pier right now, in pjs as I didnâ€™t have time to prepare. Iâ€™m going to do it tonight, but I just wanted to share how much life and â€˜fateâ€™ laughs in my face. 

I managed to pay for my last pack of cigs in the garage closest to the seafront by combining payment from my two credit cards as my bank account is seriously overdrawn lol... as I walked in â€˜East 17 - Stay Another Dayâ€™ began playing on the radio. LOL. It felt like someone somewhere was fucking laughing at me man. I hope itâ€™s my Da/Godmother somewhere waiting for me to join them. 

Also, the woman in the garage didnâ€™t meet my eye. Not once. She completely solidified my hatred of people and our entire race. Thereâ€™s no humanity, no compassion. She probably will never even realise she was the last person I ever spoke to or looked at. 

So yeah... itâ€™s tonight. Iâ€™m not the strongest swimmer so I wonâ€™t be able to fight against the current, and the North Sea will be cold enough to succumb to before I drown (I hope). 

Peace. x
