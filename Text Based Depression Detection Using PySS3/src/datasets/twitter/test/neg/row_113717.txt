Please help me, I want to die so bad right now, but I am a coward, I just need help. I have been suicidal and depressed for 10 years. I am a senior in high school, just a young girl still. I have a great future lined up for me at a college I will hopefully love. But I have fucked up my last friendship, and I can't handle myself. I have been in therapy for years, but it has ruined my life by putting me into a psych ward and keeping me from ever joining the military. So I have nothing right now, no one. And I am just having so much trouble holding onto myself right now. I have been on this subreddit for a long time, have posted frequently telling people why they shouldn't do it. But here I am, just like the rest. Begging for a reason to stay.
