A secret revealed and now I am even closer to the edge.I posted on the ask Reddit thread "What secret if revealed could ruin your life?" (Or something to that effect.) This is what I posted....

"I am back with my abuser. Last November I ran away from my boyfriend and took our infant son (known here on out as "Charlie") with me. We were in a homeless shelter for a month and a half. I had gotten a temporary restraining order against him and he sued for custody of Charlie. During the restraining order hearing the hearing master gave him visitation for Charlie. Now the word visitation is flawed. He got 3 1/2 days a week, basically the person who was only supposed to decide on if the restraining order would continue did more than he was supposed to. Unfortunately this meant when the child custody case was heard there was already a precedence for 50/50 custody and my home state really changes their stance. 

I was so lonely one night and I wanted my son. I called and asked to come over. He said yes. I began staying over at his house more and more on the days I didn't have Charlie. And then I started to stay over on the days that I did have him. I am living a double life. My parents have been paying my rent so I can get a part time job and take care of Charlie without worrying. I am betraying them. I know I am. I also know that staying with Charlie's father is a bad idea. The man has a temper and never thinks he can be wrong. He hasn't hit me since I came back but it is always in the back of my mind. He says he loves me... and I have stupidly said it back because I can't stand the guilt trip moping thing he does. I can't keep this up for much longer and I am scared. My parents would hate me for lying to them if they ever found out and I wouldn't blame them. But I feel there is no safe way out without Charlie's father telling them just to spite me. I know that I am suicidal and that the only thing keeping going is my baby. 

This entire post is a mess and I honestly don't feel like correcting it. My apologies."

The reason for that post was because Charlie's paternal grandmother had sent a letter to my parents, alluding that we were seeing each other. My parents laughed at it then they grew serious and said that if I had gotten back together with Charlie's father they would have ripped their clothes and declared me dead to them. (I can't stop shaking right now.)

Today a fake Facebook account contacted my parents and showed them pictures that Charlie's father swears he deleted off his phone. Pictures containing me and him. This account claimed they hacked his phone. The man must think I am an idiot. I am so angry and at the same time I am just done with my life. I want to just go to sleep and never wake up again. My parents now don't believe me and who could blame them? I was always a problem child. They didn't do anything to deserve the heartbreak I give them.
