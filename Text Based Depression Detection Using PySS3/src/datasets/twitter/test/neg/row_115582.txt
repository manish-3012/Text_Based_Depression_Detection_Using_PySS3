Cleaning my personal shit before I goI want to clean my computer and get rid of my notebooks and sketchbooks. Wipe my phone and only leave minor things behind. Itâ€™s so daunting, and I have no motivation. I just hate the thought of someone going through my things after Iâ€™m gone. Iâ€™ve already deleted my Facebook and Instagram. I need to delete my Xbox and other gaming profiles next. These things are exhausting but I honestly just want to disappear. 

Iâ€™ve been raped, abused, used, lied to, and treated like trash. That barely scratches the surface. honestly donâ€™t see how leaving anything behind for anyone could be a good thing. Fuck everyone.
