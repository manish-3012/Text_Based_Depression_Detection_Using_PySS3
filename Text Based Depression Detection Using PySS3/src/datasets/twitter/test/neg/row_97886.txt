planning an unexpected break..I have had a lot of suicide contemplation recently, so i came up with a way to escape the system and loop of everyday life for 2 weeks,
My parents go out on weekends often and so after weeks preparing, in that moment of loneliness i will head 2 miles with around 30 bottles of water and a lot of food to the disused quarry(with a tent). and i will stay there for 2 weeks, during the day i will go out walking, running, working out and writing my latest book. when will i do this? i'm not sure.it's definitely  going to happen. Maybe ill go in 2 weeks on our school break or in july either way i'm going there and staying i'll leave a note so they know i haven't committed suicide or been murdered or something. The reason for doing this? it gets you away from the suffering of modern society and that endless loop of misery and brings you into the natural world away from modern horrors, something i seek even for a short amount of time. i will post after i go and explain how it went.
