Worthless. Want to end it right now, but I never end up going through with itI want to end it right now, but I feel like I'm going to miss out on things like seeing my few close friends. I feel worthless socially and school wise and I feel like life is just going to get worse from here. I don't see myself living a good life and I don't want to live anymore. Suicide is all I think about and it's all I've been thinking about for the past two years. Life has gotten worse and worse and I'm done. I want to end my life. I don't feel ready to die but I can't live like this
