Nothing left.I don't have anything keeping me alive at this point except for the fact that I'm too scared to do it. If I was given a painless opportunity I'd do it now. If I was given an opportunity to help someone I care about by dying somehow I'd also do it, regardless of the pain. 

There's not really many things to live for. I like playing video games with my friends, that calms me down for a while. But I haven't done that in at least a month. I'd also love to be with my friends more often but I can't do that either. I also love coding but of course, never allowed to. My parents restrict me from anything that makes me feel meaningful or happy. 

I'm in pain every day. I want someone to care for me. It would be nice to end it now.
