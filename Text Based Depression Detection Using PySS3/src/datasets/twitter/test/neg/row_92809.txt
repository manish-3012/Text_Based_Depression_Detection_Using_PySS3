Vent post //So, iâ€™m 19. Iâ€™m an introvert &amp; very shy. Because of this I did pretty horrible in school. Too shy to get a job. Doing horrible in college. I donâ€™t even have friends. Only a boyfriend. I feel like I am just taking up space in earth. My parents are just wasting money on me. I feel like my family would be better off without me. Iâ€™m a waste of money &amp; space. Iâ€™m useless. I know I sound like a lazy spoiled brat, but I promise thatâ€™s not it. I get so nervous around people, my hands sweat, &amp; I canâ€™t speak up. I wish I could just be normal.
