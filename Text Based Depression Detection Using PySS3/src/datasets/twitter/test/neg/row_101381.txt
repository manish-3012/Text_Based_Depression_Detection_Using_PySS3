CrossroadsI'm teetering on the edge between 'keep going, you don't know what's round the corner' and 'get it over and done with'. I can't imagine living till I finish studying, and get some shitty, kiss ass job. I want to die. I'm ready to die. Is it worth breaking my parents like that? I know they'd both blame themselves, but they'd be some of the most oblivious people to my problem. 
Even if I wanted to kill myself, I don't have access to a gun, and there's no where I could actually hang myself from. A knife? I reckon it would take too long, I'd get scared and want to take it back, but I'd regret it if I did. 
Through my eyes, life isn't worth living, it hasn't been for a long time. I don't want to live my life half fuckin cooked on drugs, and I know I can't live my life like this. 

I don't fuckin know.
