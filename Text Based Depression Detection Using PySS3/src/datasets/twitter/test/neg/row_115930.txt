I think I'm done.I can't fucking do this anymore. No matter what I try to do, no matter how little, I fail. I'm fat and ugly, no one in this world will ever have the slightest interest in me, I'm going to die alone, and every single day and night I have a panic attack, a complete mental breakdown.

And before you say it, I don't trust professionals after how my last attempt at treatment ended and I'm convinced antidepressants are just placebo.

Just earlier, I finally worked up the courage to make a post in r/amiugly to hear from other people. I've never had an imgur before, so I made one specifically for this post. Within minutes of posting pictures, before I even started making the reddit post, 6 people commented hate.

I can't fucking do this anymore. I can't fight anymore, I can't hold on anymore, I can't go on like this anymore. I need it all to be over right fucking now and I just need to *be* better. And the only way that can happen is if I die. I can't fucking do this. No one loves me, no one ever has. I've never even heard the words 'I love you' not even from my own family. I can't fucking do this.
