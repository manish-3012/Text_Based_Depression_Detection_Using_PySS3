It's the only way to escape you monsters.Have you listened to the kind of crap you forced life people say? You belittle me, tell me my thoughts aren't my own, tell me my deepest, most sincere beliefs are an aberration that needs to be forcibly medicated, and then have the audacity to claim the moral high ground; that you're doing me a damn favour.

Well fuck you. If killing myself is the only way to get away from you, I'll fucking take it.
