Please put me out my misery!I'm in endless pain.  Pain I've caused myself,  by cheating on my wife because I'm bi.  Endless pain because I'm bi and can't explore that side.  Just an existence that seems like I'm alone even though I have her but it's not enough.  I'm not enough,  I've finally burst through to my true self,  because I didn't have the strength to when I was younger,  due to fear of my parents and brother.  I am now closer yo who I am but still sad!  Please end my existence!
