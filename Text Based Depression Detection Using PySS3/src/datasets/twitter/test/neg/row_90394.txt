Canâ€™t even be happy todayToday marked a huge checkpoint in my career. It marked that my dream job is finally happening. But instead of being excited and happy, Iâ€™m sitting in a gross motel room, sobbing my eyes out, feeling utterly alone in this world.
Why canâ€™t I just be happy? This was supposed to be everything I wanted. Yet Iâ€™m at the point where my ED is the worst itâ€™s ever been, I think of relapsing multiple times per day, I feel abandoned by someone I love, and I want to just make it all stop. Itâ€™s so loud and I just want quiet. But it wonâ€™t happen. 
At what point do I say â€œI give upâ€?
