Been 5 yeas since last suicide attemptSo as the title says itâ€™s been 5 years since I last tried to kill myself, now I live a happy life with a wife and 2 kids. Let me just say there is hope for you all, I was in the terrible place you all are in, and there is hope for you all, you just have to reach out and get help, it might seem hard but it was the best choice I ever made. Best of luck to u all and I love u all :)
