I don't feel any different than the last time I attemptedHello. So, on Wednesday. I overdosed and went to the hospital. I didn't tell anyone I was in the hospital until 3 days afterwards.


People were worried and stuff, obviously but I didn't want to tell them because I didn't want them to care/worry.

My uncle called me a day after. Said I wouldn't get any sympathy from him but he said if I ever need help, I can call him and if there's *anything* I need, he'll give it to me.

Next day, I order [some](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-After-Death-Elisabeth-Kubler-Ross/dp/1587613182/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430784584&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=on+life+after+death) [books](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Depression-Workbook-Guide-Living-Second/dp/157224268X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1430784465&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+depression+workbook) from Amazon. I told my uncle that I bought some books and I would like reading more.

He said "You should get off the computer, get some life experience and find a job instead.."

So, not gonna lie, I'm a bit disheartened by the amount of belittlement and obviously sometimes, life can be a struggle but for me, I just feel like I've had enough. I was thinking of overdosing again because I still have some pills I used from the other day but I just don't know anymore.. I feel like crying.
