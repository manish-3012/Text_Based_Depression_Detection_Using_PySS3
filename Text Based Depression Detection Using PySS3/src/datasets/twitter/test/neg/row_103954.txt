The darkness is finally lifting. Thank you everyone who ever lent a kind wordI made a post here a while ago from my old account explaining why I was thinking of calling it quits. I was honestly on the brink and was grasping for any semblance of hope. I owed about 3,000 in fines/tickets and was unable to renew my license so I was unable to work and being in such a pit financially was honestly killing me so I lent my plight to this sub and so many people were sympathetic to what I was going through, and many had even been through similar things in life and let me know that even though it does take time it _definitely_ gets better. I put my head down and just focused on what I could do and with that and some financial help from my grandma I was able to pay off ALL my fines AND get my license back!
For the first time in 3 years I can drive again! It feels incredible to be on the other side of such a dark place. It may seem a trivial problem to some but to me it was one of the hardest times of my life. 

Even if my problem is in no way similar to yours, Iâ€™m sure our outcomes will be the same if you hold on and keep believing a change will come. 6 months ago I wouldnâ€™t have ever thought I would say this but 

_IT GETS BETTER_
