I'm a fucking failure.I will not make it long. And yes this is my throwaway account.

You know there's this thing with me. Every time I want something bad I try to get it. I fail. And I fail badly.

I wanted to be Indian army officer. And I failed.
I joined engineering college. I have failed 2 years already.
I'm such an asshole I didn't even tell my parents that I failed. 
Not only a failure but a liar.
I want to be a YouTuber. I'm trying my hardest. But my Indian accent and my qualities won't take me anywhere.
I like this girl. She's really nice. I know I will fall for her. But she won't. I don't have anything that will make her fall for me. I'm a dick. 
I'm a fucking failure. 
Why do I even try ? Fuck my life
