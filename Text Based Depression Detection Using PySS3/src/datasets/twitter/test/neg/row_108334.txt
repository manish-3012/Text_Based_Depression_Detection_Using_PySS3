Every night I need to play video games until I canâ€™t keep my eyes open anymore and fall asleep. When I donâ€™t, suicide and plenty other shitty thoughts swarm my head.I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve tried therapy but every time I try to talk I just canâ€™t. Itâ€™s like if when I am about to talk Iâ€™m absolutely fine, like if my depression was stealthy as hell. I really need help. I feel like the only way I could is talking to someone who will never ever meet me or my family, so no one ever knows this.
