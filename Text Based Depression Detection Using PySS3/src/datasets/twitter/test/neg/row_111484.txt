Iâ€™m so close just ending it allIâ€™m struggling so much these days and I canâ€™t do it anymore. It wonâ€™t take much to push me over the edge. I canâ€™t focus on any work. I have barely eaten in two days now because itâ€™s just such bother. I donâ€™t know what else there is but to kill myself. I thought Iâ€™d last longer but I think this is as far as I go. Iâ€™ll probably be dead by the end of the year.

Iâ€™m sorry mum and dad that could wait until you were dead.
