NumbI've been depressed since circa 2011. Got help for it in 2013 because it got dangerous. Felt better. Now, have a fantastic job and, on a daily basis, love life like never before. But that usually just extends to working. I still have a hole in my life that I can't seem to fill with alone time, spending time with friends, family, learning, volunteer work, anything. I'm just numb.
