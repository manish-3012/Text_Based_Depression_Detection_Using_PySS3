No reason to liveI have been living with my parents, who have abused me, sexually, physically, and psychologically my entire life.

I am 26.5 and haven't been in a relationship--ever, despite my desire to have a family.

I only have a part-time job while going to school, both of which have taken me nowhere.

I don't have any friends.

I just want to walk in front of a train and let go....
