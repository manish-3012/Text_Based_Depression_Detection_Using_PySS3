I hate my familyI know in earlier posts, I said I'm only living for my family, but that had changed more than a while back. I hate them, they're relentless. I could ask my mom for some sort of support when I'm having a break down, and she just gets mad. She gets bad when I show any emotion.

I know its just that she doesn't know what to do, but yelling at me while I'm having an anxiety attack is fucking worse. I don't feel like living around her. Seeing her, my brothers, my step dad makes me realize they're the reason I haven't gotten any better.

I absolutely am sick of them an blame them for my deadly, reckless behavior. If I die tomorrow, I would have no problem with leaving them heart broken because they have been absolute shit towards me and deserve the years of heart break to finally fucking realize what they lost. I have no one to live for, I don't care about living for myself, I fucking hate myself. I don't have any friends, they all left because they're exactly like my fucking family, and I ran out of hope for new friends.

I'm going in the army and I hope there is a war, at least then I'll die in action, and trying to save lives. At least THEN I'll feel like I have meaning unlike my fucking shit hole of a family.
