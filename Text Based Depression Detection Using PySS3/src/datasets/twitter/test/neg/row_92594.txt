About that time I confessed my plan to kill myself by the time I turn 30, to my mother..."ugh, who is going to take the of *my severely mentally and physically disabled sister* then?"

I'm never going to forget you saying that. I tell you something that's important and troubling to me and that's your first response? At least I know what your priorities are now.

I am so tired of everything.
