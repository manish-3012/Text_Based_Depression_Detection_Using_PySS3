Rather kill myselfI honestly don't see the point to continue anymore. I'm not worth existing or breathing or eating. All my friends go hey Ronan don't kill yourself. I don't care everything is shit when I was told it's gonna be great or you got this. People go on to say that's just life. Life? So I have to deal with everything getting worse and worse and I have to feel hurt from having depression and anxiety and PTSD and self harm. Just someone make it end. I'm begging you.
