no ideaI've never really seen myself alive past the age of 27.

 When I was in young my dad would sometimes come home and scream and yell at me on how I was going to be a fat lonely kid that had no friends. Those words really dug into me. Really lowered my self esteem but I eventually said that I was better than that and I tried my best to be the friendliest/fittest person possible and I think I did that in high school. But I would still sometimes relapse to that helpless lonely fat kid. I just constantly try to fight the idea that I'm not worthless but it's like I'm constantly reminded that I am. I dated this girl in HS who ended up cheating on me with 3 other people. And I just feel like the universe has to constantly remind me that I am never going to be good enough.
I'm always trying to be there for people and just be someone they can lean on but I feel like I have no one I can go to when I'm feeling really down. On some days when I'm hanging out with my friends I still feel really empty and that I don't belong even when I get along with everyone I just have this fake smile I put on because I just don't want to open up with anyone anymore. I'm just living one day at a time and setting small goals for myself.  
One small goal I set for myself up for was that I would keep studying computer Science until I could take Artificial Intelligence because that seemed really cool. I got to that point excited wondering if it was finally going to be that thing that gave me passion and hope. I was utterly devastated with how the teacher taught the course and the insane amount of work he gave us. I ended up dropping the course which pushed me to keep trying. 
Now I feel like I have no purpose like I'm only staying alive for the sake of not dissapointing my parents. I just don't want to try anymore. I feel like I've already tried everything and I'm just never going to achieve anything with my life. I don't want to study anymore, I don't find myself wanting to do all the hobbies that I enjoyed doing. 
I just have no idea of what I want to do with myself anymore. And I just wish I could fade away. 

 If you made it this far thank you. I really appreciate you
