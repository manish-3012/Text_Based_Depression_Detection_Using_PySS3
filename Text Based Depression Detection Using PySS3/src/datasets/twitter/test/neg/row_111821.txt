The only thing stopping me from killing myself is how ugly and untalented I am, and I don't even care anymoreI constantly fantasize about suicide, but I usually imagine it in a few years when I'm skinny, have longer hair, made a couple albums, am good at piano etc, but it's been a few years and my standards for myself keep getting higher as I get older, and at this point, I'm not sure it's even worth it. Sure, it would be nice to die young, pretty and talented, but the only reason I want that is so I'm not remembered as the worthless fat ugly slut who didn't do anything with her life. No one will know I even existed in a few generations anyway, so why should I care who I die as? I've lived as a disappointment, I might as well die as one too.
