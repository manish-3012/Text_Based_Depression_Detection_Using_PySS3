Iâ€™m tired of the fucking heartbreakThis girl from my old job took a liking to me and we started dating and Iâ€™ve never been happier in my whole fucking life and for the past three months I havenâ€™t seen her and I have to fight tooth and nail just to hold a brief conversation with her and she said she wanted to be friends but I feel like Iâ€™m constantly being lied to and she keeps giving me a little hope just to take it back and laugh and say Iâ€™m trippin, Iâ€™m 19 and donâ€™t have any friends, donâ€™t talk to any of the people from school, my mom is in a fantasy land of alcohol and being blind to her other baby daddy (he literally just lives here no more no less) being fucking worthless and ruining her life and we constantly argue but thatâ€™s just a cherry on top, every day gets harder and harder and I donâ€™t feel like looking for someone else just to be broken again, yeah yeah I know someone better is out there but everything was just so perfect with her and every day I put an unloaded gun to my head and dry fire it over and over wishing there was ammo in the house.. when will the fucking pain end I have goals I want to join the marines and get a job thatâ€™ll transfer to the civilian world but no will to achieve them because money doesnâ€™t make me happy, loves does and apparently Iâ€™m not fucking allowed to be happy. All I dreamed about was taking her out of her situation and living happily ever after and I got broken tf down for it. Someone please say some magic fucking sentence to put me in a different state of mind or some shit cause Iâ€™m depressed as fuck and death seems so much easier and maybe itâ€™ll make everyone who did me wrong feel shitty if theyâ€™ll even care
