I don't want to be human anymoreIt's not worth it. All the feelings, the flaws. It's all not worth it. I'd rather be a rock, a tornado, or a river. I fucked up an amazing relationship because I couldn't control my mental health. I fucked it up to a point where I'll probably never see her again.

I don't want to feel love, or pain, or sadness. I don't want to feel fear or anxiety. I want to take a knife and dissect my brain, removing my anygdala or hypothalamus.

I despise the imperfections in humans. I can't deal with being one anymore. I want someone to set me on fire to take off my skin or to put my in a wood chipper.

No more love. No more humans.
