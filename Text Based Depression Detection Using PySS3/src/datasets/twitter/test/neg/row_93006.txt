Thinking about suicide, not really that sad just hard to see a point in life.I've read alot of the posts on here and alot of ppl are struggeling much more than me. I have a girl i'm meeting, i have family that loves me and i have alot of friends that care about me. I just have a hard time seeing a point in life. It's really just endless suffering. Like what's the point in the end? I go to school to get a degree, then get a job, then work and blalbalblalbal idk. I just don't see a point to all of it. At the end of the day we wake up and deal with the same bullshit.

I have hobbies and shit but i still don't see that as a reason to live. I have so much i wanna do i theory but none of it will ever happen. The easiest way out of this puzzle seems to be suicide. All the pain and suffering goes way. And sure i do get small amounts of joy from hanging out with friends or just random shit for dopamine kicks, but i don't see it being worth all the suffering that there is. If i kill myself i'll just do something that works 100%, jumping infront of a moving train.
