What is the point of my existenceIâ€™ve almost never had a positive look on things. A pessimist if you will.

I have a shitty 3.8 GPA in high school

I had to take the ACT test today but I read the time wrong and they didnâ€™t let me take it.

I probably have the brain capacity of a goldfish.

I just had 2 tests in school and both were under 65%

I have an A in nothing but AP calculus

Iâ€™m overweight and have no motivation to work out.

With these shitty grades, no positive outlook on life, and irresponsibility, whatâ€™s the point of my existence?

I just want to end it all but I have very supportive parents and I canâ€™t imagine what they will feel. I know people have much worse situations than me, and if you tell me to kill myself in the comments, I wouldnâ€™t be surprised. I just wanted to write it somewhere.
