I only have one reason to live and if she is gone then I don't know what I would do.My grandma is the only person I have felt like has genuinely loved me, she got cancer and it ended up returning and as a result of her treatment, she is not very strong. The only thing stopping me from killing myself is that I worry that the stress would make her very sick. If she died I genuinely feel like I would happily kill myself.
