I was in *doubt* my whole life (22yrs) that life could get better. I sought *practical solutions* so hard. And it never worked. So I *tried* having *faith/believing* that it could get better and it did for me ðŸ˜¯ 1 week ago! After SO MUCH suffering!
You donâ€™t have to read any of this or all of this. Itâ€™s always **your choice*^ what you do

2 Timothy 3:15). Faith and salvation are primary themes of the Bible. The Scriptures are to **show us the way to our ultimate destiny**, not to answer every question about where life came from

I can easily *tell* you that god exists. But you need to *decide for yourself if he does.* Itâ€™s always been up to you. Because no one likes to be *forced* thatâ€™s why Christianity gives *guidance* instead

God is not hiding anything from us. We just donâ€™t need to get caught up in trivial details to be happy, safe and loved and saved. Many people are already so confused by an overload of information. The bible is not a textbook.

Life truly is a **Journey** and we will always be learning

The Virgin Mary went on a long journey, following a bright star from GOD, and then Jesus was born. People went on long journeys to physically see Jesus. But sin continued. Jesus died for our sins so that we donâ€™t have to. We can all live on after our physical bodies die. So now, people use their hearts and faith to follow Jesus, itâ€™s a long journey, but people are getting there 

Jesus is our saviour, the SON of GOD and our brightest star. The Sun in the sky is not our brightest star. The Sun in the sky does not show us Jesus. Thatâ€™s why you havenâ€™t yet **seen for yourself**  that God exists.

So, you may find it easier to try viewing the bible as a **guide.** instead of a *textbook* â¤ï¸
