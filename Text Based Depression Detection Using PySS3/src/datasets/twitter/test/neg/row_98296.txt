I feel like I'm out of optionsI really don't know what to do anymore. So much has happened, I couldn't possibly explain the problems that I do have, although every authority figure in my life is oblivious. I feel like I've used up all of my options. I feel like I can either waste my life away or kill myself. Generally, I'm pretty well off, but I can't stop thinking about suicide for some reason. I feel like I'm suffering, but can't put my finger on what physically hurts.
