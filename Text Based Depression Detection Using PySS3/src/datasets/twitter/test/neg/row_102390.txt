I'm trapped. I don't know what else to do.I've been living my whole life in fear of my father. I'm 17, and I feel like after years of relentless lectures/beatings/harassment, I'm at my breaking point. I'm only 135 pounds and he's over 250 and looks like a human pitbull. He's yelled at kids in my neighborhood and made them cry, and has essentially ostracized me from everyone else, never letting me leave the house.

He freaks out over the most minor things. My room has to be CLEAN, and I mean like making sure that my shirts are perpendicular to the inside of the drawers and my shoes are laid down in a nice little pattern. Yeah, that kind of stupid, pointless shit. One little thing is off and he freaks out like I just murdered the family dog. 

His only solution is to hit me on the back of the head extremely hard, to where it almost feels like he's giving me a concussion. And he does this nearly every day, along with screaming in my face and telling me I'm a piece of shit. 

After he gets done yelling at me, I'll obviously be distressed (like any normal human being), and he'll say something like, "get out of bitch mode or I'll hit you harder." Then he's right back to being "nice", the same way he acts around co-workers and other adults. I like to call it "fake". 

Today my mother was sleeping in the other room sick, and I was sitting at my computer bored. I decided to play some music to break the silence, and I had it on (I swear) like 20% volume. Next thing I know my narcissist father comes barging in out of nowhere and claims that I was "blasting" my music, and tells me that I'm a self-centered asshole, blah blah, the whole nine yards. 

This is where it gets fucked up. He's noticed that over the past two years I've grown significantly quieter (which is me becoming depressed from all this bullshit) so he starts to use THAT against me. He starts telling me that he'll "drive me to a bridge so that I can jump off of it" and asked me if he needed to "buy me razorblades" so I could cut myself. I started crying, naturally, because what the flying fuck. He said "you're a selfish prick, you probably want to kill yourself because that's what pussies do."  

Whenever I complain about these things to people in real life, they always pass it off with "oh, you'll be out of there before you know it." They don't understand at all. When people meet my father, he goes into fake-mode, so I can't complain about him to people he's met before, because they go "oh he's so nice," which makes me want to jab a screwdriver into my forehead.

All I know is that this is getting ridiculous, and my depression is at an all time high right now. I was staring at the ground for 2 hours not doing anything before I decided to type this, because I just want to feel like somebody actually gives a shit.  

edit: oh, and I also have no friends due to the complete lack of social skills I have. If I ran away, I'd be living on the streets.
