I can't keep going in a world like this one.I'm starting to create an actual suicide plan. I have a lot of strong sedative/heartrate medicines and I'm just going to end it someday soon. There really is no reason to keep going when nobody will help you or listen to your problems. When the systems in place to try to keep people healthy are turning them down. I'm going to take all of the medicine I can tonight and go to sleep forever.
