Lied to my psychiatristPTSD, severe depression. My psych at the VA asked me if Iâ€™ve had thoughts of suicide. I told him no. That was a lie. Iâ€™ve been scratching myself with sharp objects until I bleed and I see no reason to stop. Why should I? My psychâ€™s idea of treatment is to increase my dosage. Sure, Iâ€™ll increase it. Iâ€™ll take the whole fucking bottle. Plus these other bottles you have me on. That should cure me, one way or another.
