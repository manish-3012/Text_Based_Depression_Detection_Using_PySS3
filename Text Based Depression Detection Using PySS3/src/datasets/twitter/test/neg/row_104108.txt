Today 7th July 2020 is my last day on earth 

It's been a great journey guys. I am 15 years old but i just don't want to continue myself anymore. I have my birthday next month 2nd august but i know it won't be anything special. My dad rarely wishes me and beats me every other week. My mother is even more violent and beats me like a punching bag because i am not good in academics. I don't have any siblings or REAL friends so I feel lonely most of the time. My addictions rule my life and I have no motivation to work hard anymore. I just don't understand the point of life. We work hard in school, get into a college, work in a shitty 9-5 job, get married, have kids, just to die one day. This human life is full of suffering and i have had enough of it

Goodbye everyone I will be committing suicide tonight
