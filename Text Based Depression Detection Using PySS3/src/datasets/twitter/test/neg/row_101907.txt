Gonna try to hang myself today again, can you guys help me get some peace of mind with accepting death?I'm gonna try again. And this time I think i'm gonna succeed. I have a pretty good plan in place to stop my survival instinct, which has been my biggest hindrance in all my attempts thus far.

Now... the only hurdle I have to get over is accepting death and not letting the fear of whatever is after stop me from doing this. Could you guys help me with that? What do you think happens? 

I really don't wanna get talked out of it. My life sucks, alot. My brain sucks, alot. It's not worth it to keep going on. I wish i could be happy, but it won't happen. And i'd rather just exit this world... in the most peaceful way possible
