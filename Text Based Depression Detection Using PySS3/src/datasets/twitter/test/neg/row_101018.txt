Triggered towards suicidal feelings by the happiness of othersIt has gone far beyond jealousy at this point.

Anything I see that to me is a measure of happiness or basically anything positive in someone else's life instantly causes a physiological reaction in my body that involves blurring vision, memory loss, and joint pain. The only thought I have during these episodes is to kill myself. When I become more lucid from these episodes, I do not feel better, though, because then I reflect on the fact that my pain is caused by the happiness of others. Sometimes I feel like a jerk, sometimes I am ashamed at my jealousy, sometimes I am afraid I will never be able to experience joy because the things that bring everyone else joy have such a powerful negative association.

I am now on significantly over 72 hours straight of suicidal fixation. The longest I have ever gone. I literally cannot stop.
