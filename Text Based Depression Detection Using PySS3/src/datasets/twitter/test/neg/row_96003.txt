All of your suffering comes from believing you have/had control of your lifeNONE of it has ever been in your control. All your life youâ€™ve never had control of any of it. You didnâ€™t even choose life before you were in it. Once you surrender to the illusion of control and know that you donâ€™t have any control over your life, all your suffering ends. When you believe that you have control and you fail (which you will inevitably fail because you will die) you get angry,sad, depressed, miserable. You see that when you lose the illusion of control all the suffering, anger, anxiety and fear seize to exist. Because you never had/have any control of anything. Itâ€™s still going to feel like you are making decisions but deep down you will know you arenâ€™t. And once you realize that then you can just flow with your  life experience without any fear, anxiety, and suffering because you arenâ€™t in control of what happens anyways
