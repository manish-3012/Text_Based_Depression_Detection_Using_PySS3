Spending another day alone.I heard about SW a while ago. And after today I thought I'd check it out. I feel lonely, to the point of suicide. In a constant thing, and I'm getting fed up. I'm not asking for friends, or for help really. I don't know what I'm doing here.  I know "it gets better", but I don't think I have the patience to wait for it any more. I don't know what to do. I don't have the confidence to go out and meet people, and when I do they don't talk to me for very long. 

I apologize for the disorderly rambling. I'm not sure what I'm looking for here.
