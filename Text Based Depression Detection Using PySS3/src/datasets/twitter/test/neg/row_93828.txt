my boyfriend told me he wants to kill himself then said heâ€™d be back.i donâ€™t know if what he said was a joke, but i feel terrible. these past few days ive been crying a lot and getting sad super fucking easily, i feel like me being sad all the time has gotten him this way. i hate knowing at some point in our relationship heâ€™s going to be in the same position i am because all i do is bring him down with it. i dont want to leave him, but i feel like heâ€™d be better off without me.
