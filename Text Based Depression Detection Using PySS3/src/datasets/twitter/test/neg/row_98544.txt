Life just doesnâ€™t seem worth it anymore.Iâ€™m so tired of everything.

Every few days I have a terrible breakdown that leaves me wanting to kill myself. I spend the next few days slowly but surely reassuring myself. Then thereâ€™s only one good day and it happens again. And again. And again.

School is physically and mentally draining. I want to cry. All I want to do is cry. I want to make myself bleed or jump off a bridge.

Itâ€™s been five years. It gets worse for me each year. Iâ€™m at the point where Iâ€™m so done with life I donâ€™t feel like anything can be fixed at this point. 

Yes. I have friends that care. I have a loving family that also care. Thatâ€™s the only thing thatâ€™s stopping me from killing myself. I already have two therapists and have switched antidepressants too many times. 

Iâ€™m done. I donâ€™t know why I keep living like this. Everyone tells me itâ€™s going to get better but it hasnâ€™t. Iâ€™m not going to spend my whole life for a handful of good days. Thatâ€™s not living. 

I canâ€™t focus at all when Iâ€™m at school. I didnâ€™t know anything on my math test and completely failed. I canâ€™t talk to anyone because I get aggravated too easily with them. I wish they just knew what Iâ€™m thinking. 

It was hard enough telling my parents I had depression the first time. I canâ€™t tell them Iâ€™m thinking about suicide. I donâ€™t know what to do. Life is too horrible to keep on living, but at the same time, thereâ€™s people who care.
