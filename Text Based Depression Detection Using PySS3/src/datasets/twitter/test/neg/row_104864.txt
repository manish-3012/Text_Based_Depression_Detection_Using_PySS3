I am so tired(I suck at putting my thoughts into writing so sorry about the formatting and the awkward pacing and all that) 

I don't know how else to put it. I'm tired of failing at everything I try.
I'm tired of watching my friends rush through life from accomplishment to accomplishment while I'm stuck in the mud.
I'm tired of trying my best when my best is never good enough and all I get is shit in return.
I'm tired of being so useless.
And I am so so tired of being tired.
I have no reason to get out of bed in the morning and would much rather sleep than face the day.
Still, I'm trying to put up some sort of facade of happiness or at least normalcy for my mom's sake but I don't know how long I can fake it. It's exhausting to play pretend everything's all fine and dandy. 

My dad has also made it very clear that I don't mean jack shit to him. He has a new wife and new better kids. He doesn't need me. Can't blame him, really. Doesn't mean it don't hurt though.

In July I was, like all Finnish men of age are, drafted into the Finnish Defence Force. I lasted just under 2 months before they kicked me out for seriously considering putting the business end of my RK 62 to my own head. It's not like they lost much in me though. A soldier who can't shoot straight or run for a minute straight without puking his guts out is more of a liability than an asset anyway.

I'm just so tired of hating everything about myself.
