Talk to meIâ€™m gonna post mostly what I posted to r/depression the other day, but with the added effect of wanting my miserable life to end. This is one of the most annoying symptoms Iâ€™ve got right now, I really really would love to die 

Idk if this is a symptom of depression or of anxiety or whatever, but itâ€™s something I wanna talk about. I always like to think of something that makes me feel someone happy, I feel like it gives me meaning, and itâ€™s really prominent like thereâ€™s a massive noticeable change in my mood when Iâ€™m thinking of it. And thereâ€™s always something, whether im thinking about the gym and seeing gains, or whether itâ€™s a job Iâ€™ve applied for, Iâ€™m always thinking of it to keep me happy. But more often than not, I forget it, and itâ€™s weird because itâ€™s literally all I think about when Iâ€™m not trying to remember what it actually is. But when I forget what it is, I feel completely lost like I have no meaning and right now I really canâ€™t think of something thatâ€™s giving me meaning, and itâ€™s really pissing me off and annoying me. 

Sorry for walk of text that probably makes no sense whatsoever, hereâ€™s to hoping someone understands what I mean, idk I wanna die lol
