I just want to die for no apparent reasonWell my life is shitty. Everything about it sucks. I suck at studying. I have parents who don't care about me. I am in a relationship I feel is suffocating the life out of me. I have nothing to look forward to.. I have aimbitions which I know my mediocrity will not let me achieve. I am not going to be better. 
Nothing ever changed about my life. I feel so dejected all the fucking time. I do not feel motivated enough to wash my face or make my bed. 
I don't feel any emotions too, I don't feel happy, I don't feel angry, I don't even feel sad. I just feel burdened by my existence. I don't know what to do from here on.
