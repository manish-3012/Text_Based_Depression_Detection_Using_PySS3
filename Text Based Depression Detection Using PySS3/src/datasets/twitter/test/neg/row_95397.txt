Hard to sleepItâ€™s so hard to sleep peacefully. I wake up everyday with my heart heavy and strained. I wake up several times a night filled with anxiety. 

Throughout the day, this happens too. My chest closes in and itâ€™s just too heavy to bare. 

Sorry, Iâ€™m not trying to complain. I hold it in a lot of the time, but it was so hard to sleep tonight. I woke up every hour of the night with anxiety and my heart literally feeling like itâ€™s popping out of my chest. Iâ€™m very unhappy with my position, but Iâ€™m literally doing it to make ends meet. No amount of benefits is worth this. I had so much potential and I denied other opportunities because I wasnâ€™t encouraged enough to pursue something else. Iâ€™m regretful and bitter.
