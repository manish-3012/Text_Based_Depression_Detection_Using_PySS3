I don't want to go onIt's coming up on the anniversary of my mum's death, 7 years ago. I was 10.

She was the only one I really had, I trusted her 100% even to this day I still do things as if she'll just turn up, knock on my door, give me a hug and then we'll go watch TV or something. 

I remember absolutely everything about that day, waking up at 0825, like usual; getting dressed and leaving for school.

As I left the house, the last words I ever heard her say, "Love you, see you at 3" in her usual voice as she hugged and then I walked off to school. Everything seemed normal, untill the head teacher walked into the classroom, pulls me out of class, and as we're walking to her office, she says that my dad is here for me, that's when I knew something was actually wrong. 

As the head teacher and I walk into her office, I see my step dad and my dad sitting together, both clearly upset. I'm directed to sit down and my dad tells me

"your mum's been in an accident... She didn't make it"

All I really remember from there is crying my eyes out and screaming at the top of my lungs while clutching onto my dad, we go back to my mums to collect my stuff, we gather my stuff, clothes etc and my dad drops me off at my grans. 

Later that night I'm laying in bed and on comes the midnight news and she's first on the news, name and all and I'm balling my eyes out again. 


Every day since then, i've felt numb, nothing has really excited me or piqued my attention. All i want is to have my mum back. I remember being in high school and we were given an assignment for English, to write an essay on your dreams, and all I could think of writing was "I want my mum back" so that's what I put down and handed in the essay 10 min later and asked to be excused from the class, I walked as calmly as I could to the back of the school where nobody ever goes, and i just sat and cried silently to myself for the rest of the day. 

So, here I am, about to turn 18 soon and the most important person to me isn't going to be there to share it with. She's never going to see me get a degree, turn 21, nothing. 

My life is essentially one big joke at my expense and I want out
