I Feel So Alone.My parents don't understand me. They say my sister is rude to me because we're sisters. She acts so kind to me in front of my parents but when we get alone she goes back to her normal self and starts yelling at me. Most of the time when I complain to my parents they either don't believe me or they just say "That's how sisters work." I feel like I have nobody. My friends never Face Time or call me. My parents think I'm joking when I say I'm sad and I feel like they hate me. I just can't do this anymore.
