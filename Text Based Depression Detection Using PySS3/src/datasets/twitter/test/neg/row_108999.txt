I don't know what to say hereI want nothing more right now than to just die. I'm done. I go between numbness and this kind of grief that leaves me crying and gasping, and I never know when the other is going to come on. I'm in a house with two parents who don't care unless it's convenient for them to care at the time, and a sibling I'd die for but I don't even know if she likes me. I have friends that care but despite being an adult, my mother does her utmost to limit the time I get to talk to them, and says she has every right because I live in her house. I can't find a job that will allow me to move out because I'm trying to get my degree and that takes up so much of my time, so any wages I can get aren't enough to allow me to move out without starving.

I'm so tired of all of this. I have been trying to dig myself out of whatever kind of hole this is but it just getting deeper, and it's been eight years. I can't keep this up. My mental health and stability are hanging on by a thread. I can feel myself getting angrier and angrier at everything, myself included, by the day and I hate it. If this is the trend my life will follow, I don't want to be around for any more of it. 

The only reason I'm still here is because there's been some kind of hope for the future the whole way up. The longer I stay alive, the dimmer that looks and I don't want to be around to see it disappear altogether. So I'm lying in bed crying my eyes out, trying to think of all the good things in my life with little luck, with enough paracetamol to overdose on the bedside table and I'm arguing with myself for the fourth night in a row about whether it'd be easier some other way, or if I should wait just a little longer, but I can't keep doing this. I wish this wasn't the only way I can see my life going, but I just want it to be done with.
