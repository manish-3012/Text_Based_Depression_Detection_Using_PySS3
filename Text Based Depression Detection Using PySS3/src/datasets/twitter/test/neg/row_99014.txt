I'm going to do it.In march, I almost successfully killed myself. This is grim but the feeling I felt when my body was shutting down was like a relief compared to how I'd been feeling prior. 

I want everything to end, I've tried to hard to express to the mental health services that I'm a liability to myself and yet I'm STILL forced to wait. I can't wait any more, I think I need to do this. 

This year has been beyond cruel to me, I lost all my friends, my longtime partner and now am being accused of accusations I don't even want to mention. Being demonized beyond any reconciliation is just... too much. 

I tried, so hard. I pushed through all these months in hopes things would improve, it didn't. I've never been so alone, it just shows I truly have no place here. 

And it doesn't stop, it's one thing after another that just breaks me down over and over again... I just want to sleep, forever.
My life is going no where, my efforts are wasted and I lack the ability to form strong bonds with people.

I'm going to die alone, how fucking pathetic. This is nonsensical rambling but I just need to get it out either as my subconsciousness trying to seek help or just... leave something  behind. I don't know any more. Sorry for this mess of a post, I'm not well.
