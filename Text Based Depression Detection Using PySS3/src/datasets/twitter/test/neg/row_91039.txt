Need Psychiatric Help But No Money. What do?Hey. Right now, I'm in a racing thoughts kind of swing and I need some cool and collected insight. I have no money to get myself admitted to the white pris-- I mean, hospital. I figure loony-bin would be far more preferrable than making the news in South Florida.

I have a very cheap health insurance that covers shit and perhaps a pack of bandaids.

Suggestions? I dislike hotlines. They have no answers or helpful advice whatsoever.
