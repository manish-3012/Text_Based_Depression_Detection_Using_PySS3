Best friend was murdered. Therapist told me ill be â€œover itâ€ in a few monthsI barely feel like getting out of bed or lifting my arm to grab food to eat. I think about suicide daily now and the only things keeping me here are knowing that she would NOT want me to go through with it and that after the horror of seeing her mangled face in the hospital I cant risk fucking up and making the people I love see me in one of those awful ICU beds. The image of her in the bed pops into my head at random hours and I cant help but replay the events of that night even though I wasnâ€™t even there. Iâ€™m so fucking miserable and even my therapist basically told me to suck it up because time is the only thing that will help. She should be here instead of me and I donâ€™t know how the fuck Iâ€™m supposed to handle the rage and pain and anxiety and apathy while still functioning like a normal human who smiles and laughs at things.
