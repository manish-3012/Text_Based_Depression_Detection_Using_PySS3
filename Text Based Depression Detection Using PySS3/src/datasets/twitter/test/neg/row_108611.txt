please help me. I need encouragement.short post because i know I want to kill myself.
This past year I have been in jail, acquired 8 misdemeanors, and you'd never know it. I'm the girl next door and I had everything going for me. I lost it all and have fallen into a depression I can't recover from. I've been suicidal before and I've exhausted the resources I thought I knew how to use. I accidentally burned my boyfriend by spilling hot coffee on him yesterday and it was a day after we got into a fight. I can't live with myself anymore. I have been kicked out of every school I was accepted into. My future career is burned. My current job is in jeopardy. My boyfriend is now holding this above me like an assault charge. If he reports me I will go back to jail for a long time. If he doesn't I'm living under his thumb until his burns heal at the very least. I told my mom what happened and I can't tell anyone else in fear of losing what little I have. I have no one to turn to. I have no where to go. I have already lost my future due to my own actions and even the bullshit present I live in isn't worth being blackmailed for. I don't know where else to turn. Please help me. I can't do this anymore.
