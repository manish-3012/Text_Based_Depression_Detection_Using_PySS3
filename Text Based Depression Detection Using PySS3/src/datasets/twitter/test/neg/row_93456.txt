Someone I used to go to school with said that he thinks Iâ€™m lying about my depression and it makes me want to prove him wrong(Self harm tw) This happened last year and I still canâ€™t get it out of my head. He has mental health issues of his own and he doesnâ€™t think that Iâ€™m depressed because my self harm is on my thighs rather than my arms so itâ€™s not visible and Iâ€™m able to laugh and joke with my friends. I think about this especially when I cut or am contemplating suicide and it makes me angry and makes me want to just prove to him and myself that Iâ€™m not lying and I feel like the only way to do so is to just end it.
