What is the point of this all?I feel like I have been screwed over so much in this life and I am not sure if it is worth it. I am ugly (body and face), I am slow, my dad is sick all the time, I can never think of what to say, my brain always feels so blank, I feel like all I am doing is just existing and there is barely anything going on in my mind... like maybe there is something wrong up there (brain damage or something? Is that possible?) I have always been slow but not this slow... it frustrates me so much.. if I have to live with a brain like this I think I rather just off myself right now... You don't know how frustrating it is not to be able to communicate with people when I want because I am so goddamn slow... I just can't fucking think of anything... honestly how the fuck can a person live like this? I always see people think of stuff that I don't think of there must be something wrong with me.., this guy I love he breaks my heart, no friends, and I have this other problem.... that I cant seem to deal with because I know how much it would break my families hearts and I rather get rid of myself and disappear than face it and cause my family that pain...and I lie a lot I don't know why but it is annoying I wish I didn't lie why cant I be one of those good people who are inherently honest and don't ever lie? It just feels like everything is working against me... cant I at least have one good thing about me to work from? If I have to be ugly why can't I be funny or smart or something? Why can't I have one thing? Why? What is the point of this? All it really is is just suffering .. It would be easier to die.
