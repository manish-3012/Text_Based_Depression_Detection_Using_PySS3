I want to write my goodbye letters just to see if anyone actually cares.I know thatâ€™s fucked up. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for some time now, and I keep feeling drawn to writing the notes. I know Iâ€™m too much of a baby to actually do it, though. I keep seeing the pills on my bedside table and imagining myself swallowing them all. 

I know Iâ€™m too much of a wuss to follow through. But I donâ€™t want to be here. I feel fucked up beyond repair. These men have taken everything from me, violated me, taken away my ability to live a normal life. Marred my childhood with filth. Made me dirty. 

I want to write to everyone I care about, tell them how sorry I am, how much I appreciate them. Just so they know, just in case. Just to see if anyone sees how much Iâ€™m suffering. I feel like no one is seeing me right now. I know my reality is skewed by my mental illness, this is all irrational. I just feel so horrible right now.
