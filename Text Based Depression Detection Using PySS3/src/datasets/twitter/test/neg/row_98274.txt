I've started my bucket list and tying up loose ends.I've started my bucket list mostly because I've started tying up loose ends. I got to see my brother jump for joy for Christmas because i bought him a Nintendo switch, I've started training my replacement at work so I don't have to worry about work. I broke up with my best friend (because our friendship had been deteriorating for a while) so that he doesn't miss me as much or think its his fault. I don't feel I belong in my family and i doubt they would miss me much. Or if they did, I know that they will never heal fully or be the same after words but they will learn to get along and live without me. The hardest thing right now is leaving my dog. I know she would never understand... and I don't want to think about her sitting outside my room crying to get in or waiting for me to come home when I never will. That's the only guilt i live with at the moment. And currently the only thing keeping me alive.
