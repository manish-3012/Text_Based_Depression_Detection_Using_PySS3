We all waste ourselvesI thought for sure, at 27, I would matter to someone by now. Like honestly matter, deeply, not just that superficial mattering where I do things for them and they appreciate it, like their laundry or work for them or whatever. I thought I would matter by now. My IQ is 161+, Iâ€™ve been in therapy 4 years, surely long enough to recover from an ugly past, Iâ€™ve been working on my undergrad for 7 long years, and still... nothing. I canâ€™t accomplish anything bc everything is tainted with a horrible taste at the back of my tongue that I should have never made it out of NICU from my umbilical cord strangling me til I was blue. That my suicide attempt at 16 would have been the perfect time to go. That Iâ€™m just not supposed to be here. Everything aches every day. And to think, I had so much potential. 

I guess we all just waste ourselves.
