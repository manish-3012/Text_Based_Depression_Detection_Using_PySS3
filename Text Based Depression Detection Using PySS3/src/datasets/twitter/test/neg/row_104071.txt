The FutureI always think of the future when I'm not struggling with depression. I think of what others will think of me, what I'll be remembered as, and all the opportunities I will have missed. I am still young so of course there are lots of things to do. But, when I am depressed its like I forget all that. Is that normal? That I just forget all my hopes and dreams and cry under the covers of my bed? Im not sure what to think. Its just so difficult sometimes, trying to survive in this cruel unforgiving world. My friends and family want me to succeed. But I don't even know if I want myself to.
