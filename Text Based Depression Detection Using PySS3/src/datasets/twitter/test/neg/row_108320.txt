This is it i guess..Everything is just wrong and i don't know what to do... I just cut myself again.. everything is just fucked up... i called my drug dealer and asked if he had pain killers or something similar so i could od and just die and he dose i ordered about 16 or 20 pills how many do i take so ill die as fast as possible? I'm at the end of the road i see no future for myself.. once he shows up i'm just gonna message my friends goodbye or something and just end it.. I can't live like this anymore...
I care for all of them, i love my girlfriend to deatg  i hope they continue living their lives normally i hope they don't even show up to my funeral.. i don't deserve that.. i don't deserve anything... 
I'm fucking not in my 20s yet and am already addicted to drugs and alcohol..
