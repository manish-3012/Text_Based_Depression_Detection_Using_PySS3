Not the first time I've thought about it.So, a lot of people in my community have died recently. No one I was close to, but still four people die in a week, and it kinda sets a somber mood for everyone. Two of those people killed them selves. 

I've been struggling with the reality that my life is completely devoid of meaning. I don't believe in God or an after life. I kind of want to. It would make just living easier. But it seems so absurd. I just can't believe in it. 

I'm 18 years old. A senior in high school. I'm also a border line alcoholic. I'm a quiet kid at school. I don't have a ton of friends. My best friend and his (our I guess) whole "group" has started smoking a lot of weed. They also don't see anything wrong with drinking. I haven't smoked in a while. But I think I might have a dependency on alcohol.

I went to them first for help. They thought I was joking. I asked them to help me quit drinking. They lit up a bowl and suggested moderation. I left after that. It's been two weeks, and I haven't hung out or had a conversation with any of them since. Basically. I haven't had any quality interaction with another person in two weeks. It made me realize that this group I only marginally like, are my only friends.

I'm lonely. 

Every time I think that, I just hate my self. How pathetic is that right? Being lonely. That's not a real problem. I feel like if there was just someone who could be my friend I could turn everything around. 

I tried reaching out to people. And no one was mean. No one will be mean when a depressed guy opens up to them. The said some nice things, they said they cared and liked me and whatever. None of them really followed up. They were just saying what they said. It feels like they didn't mean it. 

I know I'm going to get the "You're young. I promise it gets better." shit. Come on. It's my senior year. It's supposed to be one of the best years of my life. 

I'm thinking I don't want my family to waste money on collage. I know they've already spent a ton on me. I know kids aren't cheap. I don't like my family though. 

As long as I can remember my mother and I have not ever had a conversation that didn't end with us yelling at each other and/or calling each other idiots.  It started when I was about 8.

My sister... she's a bitch. She's better than me at everything, and she loves to remind me of it. She got the looks, the book smarts, and the social skills. She didn't like like the idea of going to a public school. She's pretentious like that. She's your stereotypical 'princess' mindset. She expects people to do what she wants. She won't clean up after herself, and will have the audacity to give you shit when her messes aren't clean. Worse still, my parents usually back her up.  I frequently wish she would just disappear.

My dad's not as bad as the others. He's very stoic. He will sometimes try to put my sister in her place, but only when my mother isn't around. He's really critical too. And has expectations. I feel like I can't live up to what he wants. 

I'm hopeful that the future might have something better, but if it's going to be anything like my life has been so far, I really don't see any reason to keep going.
