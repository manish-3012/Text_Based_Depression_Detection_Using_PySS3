I have been suicidal since I was eight years old (I am now 21) and I cannot figure out a way to get out of this mindset.A little background: I was diagnosed with dysthymia and generalized anxiety disorder at a young age (~8 years old) and I have various autistic traits (but am not autistic).  

I fantasize about how I could kill myself literally every day and the fantasies have become more and more elaborate as I get closer to graduating from college (I graduate in May). I feel like there's nothing left to look forward to and I'm going to disappoint everyone around me because I'm not sure I'll be able to find a job. How can I get out of this funk (or at least lessen the severity of my self-loathing)?

Btw, I do have a psychiatrist. I see him ~every 10 weeks. I've seen him since I was little and he has been of no help to me. He just makes fun of me and prescribes me more and more meds.
