Cried for the first time in years. Now I'm definitely going to kill myself.I woke up from a dream where I still had... her. The girl of my dreams. And then it's all just gone. Poof.

I cried for the first time in a long time. I'm too numb to cry but the pain has transcended numbness. 

Is it wrong to want to be loved? Is it wrong to have someone by your side through thick and thin? Idk, it probably is for a piece of shit like me. I know I'll never experience the pleasure of being loved. Being wanted. Having someone by my side. Of getting married. Having sex. Idk.

I've had this rifle for the longest time, probably good to put it to use soon.
