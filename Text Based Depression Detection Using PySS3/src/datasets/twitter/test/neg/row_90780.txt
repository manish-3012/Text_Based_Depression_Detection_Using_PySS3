Wife is cheating on me don't have anywhere to go.My wife is cheating on me and wants to leave. I don't have proof but shes cheated on me before with online people. But now it's with old friends.
I moved to ohio leaving behind friends and family for here. 8 years gone. 3 of those up here. She has the money, our electric is about to get shut off. I dont have gas in the car. I don't have anywhere to go to even if I did. I burnt all my bridges. And weighing my options it seems like suicide is the best option. What can I do. I have nothing..
