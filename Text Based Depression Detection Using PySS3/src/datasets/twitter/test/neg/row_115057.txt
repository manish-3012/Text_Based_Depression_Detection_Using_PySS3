My death was stolen from me, and I want it back.I was ready to die. I was at peace with it. I was happy. And it was taken from me. My family found my other reddit, my main reddit, and found my plans to die before I was able to carry it out. I was an idiot for writing it all down, especially on that reddit. I was forced into a mental institution by them, and I suppose it worked...

But the issue is it only partially worked. Cus now I don't want to die anymore, but I also still don't want to live anymore. I'm so miserable but have no way to get out of this situation. Everything I was worried about before going to the hospital is coming true. My best friend is leaving me, my fiance no longer trusts me, and the world is going ape shit cus of the virus.

If I had just died, I wouldn't have had to deal with any of this. I would have died knowing my best friend and fiance still loved me, and not living with the problems faced by the pandemic. I wish they never found my Reddit. But now there's nothing I can do about it. My life is falling apart and I don't even want to end it anymore. My death was stolen from me and I'll just have to live in mysery until I die a long, painful, drawn-out death from old age, not the quick and easy death that I was looking forward to a month ago.
