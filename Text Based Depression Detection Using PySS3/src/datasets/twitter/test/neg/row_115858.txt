Just need to get some stuff off my mindHe there reddit. Iposted here before, so if you wanna know my story, just look at my last post. Anyways, I just got rejected again by a girl that Ihave known for a long time. I always act happy in front of my friends, but she was different. She actually made me smile and gave me a reason to get up in the morning. When she rejected me, she told me that she saw me as a brother and that she had feelings for another guy. A guy she never talks to. All because she thinks he's attractive. Its all I can think about, and I really don't see a point to living anymore. All I want is to be loved. I just want someone to cuddle with and share my feelings with, but I know now that it won't ever happen. Please don't give me the "personality" talk. If a girl meets a guy with a great personality but an unattractive face, then they will be friends. Nothing more. Trust me, it has happened to me many times. I feel worthless, and that nobody is there for me. Why can't I ever be happy? I spent my whole life trying to make everybody else feel good and make them feel like they are worth something, because I don't want anybody else to ever have to feel like I do every day. Nobody deserves this. I'm too weak to live like this anymore and there seems to only be one solution left for me. That girl is the only person I felt like I had a real chance with, but I guess she would rather be with an attractive guy who has the personality of a brick wall, and I know that it will be like that with every girl I meet
