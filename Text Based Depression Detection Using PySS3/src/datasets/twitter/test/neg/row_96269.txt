Afraid of MyselfI'm 26, and I've been struggling with depression since my late teens.  When it got really bad the first time, I smoked a lot of pot.  I spent years in a haze before moving back home.  A couple years after moving back, I finally got on drugs that worked, and attempted to go back to University.  Things were great until I experienced something called an "SSRI poopout".  My drugs stopped working.

It's been a few months now, and the first new drug I tried only made me feel worse.  I'm waiting for the second new one to kick in now, but my hope is minimal.

When I'm thinking clearly, suicide is far from an option.  Logically, I know that I'm going to find another drug that works and things will get better.

Lately though, I haven't been thinking clearly.  I'm so tired of being depressed.  I'm tired of not being able to function in society without medication.  I'm tired of being tired.  Worst of all, since the drugs stopped working once, it can happen again.  It's hard to have hope knowing that I may have to face this struggle again and again and again.

When I'm feeling logical, suicide is never an option.

Lately, though, my mind wanders to such terrifying thoughts, and in the moment...

My mother is concerned, she knows someone who recently, when changing depression meds, killed himself seemingly out of nowhere.  I told her I would never, but her concern reminded me of moments... scary moments.

The last time it felt like a real option I frightened myself out of those thoughts, but what if next time there's less fear and more exhaustion?

I should tell my therapist or my psychiatrist, but in the clear light of day it seems silly.  Why would I do that?  I fear death more than anything.  But then I have these thoughts and...  sometimes...  I'm afraid of what I might do.

I keep telling myself that it's silly, that I would never go through with it, and yet...

I don't know.
