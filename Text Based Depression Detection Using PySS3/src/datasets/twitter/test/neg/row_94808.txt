I suck at everything including ending my life.I've always been not good enough but i never thought I wouldn't be able to properly end my life.

I've had 5 attempts and since then I've always kept a box of sleeping pills incase but I had to throw them away. Suicide was always my back up plan but now, i can't even end my fucking life.

My loved ones have their own struggles so why should I tell them? I'll just cause more stress. 

Cutting doesn't even help me cope anymore. 

I just want to end my life, I just want to cause pain to myself but I know that I would make a few people sad. 

Im so weak that I can't handle my own mind. 

I've already wrote my letter but I just can't bring myself to do it. 

No matter how many times I tell myself to do it, I'm too much of a pussy.

Please help me do it I don't want to live.
