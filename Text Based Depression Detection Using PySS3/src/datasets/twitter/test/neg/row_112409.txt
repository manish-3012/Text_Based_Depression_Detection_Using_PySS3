Since apparently im invincible...Decided to run an experiment tonight to see what will happen. If I die or not isn't a big deal to me, especially because I survive things that would kill 99.9% (read past posts for more information).

So tonight I've started taking an abundance of Prozac, Baclofen, Adderall, Welbutrin, Lexapro, Ranitidine (so I don't get sick or nauseous while I do this), and another one I can't remember, Datura seeds, and all the while drinking Tito's and Red Bull. 

Began a few hours ago and currently feel %100 fine. I've been documenting it all so if this doesn't end up killing me (somehow it won't -_- I just know it) then I'll update everyone in the morning.
