life is empty no hope for the future i have nothingwhy should i live in a world that only brings pain to me. i have no friends, no one cares about me, i'm a worthless useless waste of human existence that would be better of decomposing in a pile of filth than stay one more second on this wretched planet. i just want friends. i just want love. i just want to be happy. but i hate everything. i hate everyone. i hate being alive. i hate waking up. i hate living in a hell where no one acknowledges me and i spend every nanosecond in agonizing pain. life is torment and i want an escape from this endless nightmare.
