Successful and endlessly troubled.I am in the military, serving as a special operator. 8 years of my life. Traveled to many countries, seen many things good, bad, and ugly. I've been promoted before peers. I have a wife and a 7 yr old daughter. My daughter is the one thing I cherish most. I grew up poor in a rural area in NC. Drunk/abusive father, miserable mother, 5 siblings. I've been drinking a lot the past few years, my wife has been cheating on me and I've recently found out it was happening while I was deployed. I was witnessing stacks and stacks of bodies as my wife is fucking around. I confront her and she says she's depressed and wants to die because her Dad, who she only met 3 times, died.  Guilt tripping me into staying. But I'm separated from her, trying to get custody of my daughter. Because my wife is a shitty and useless parent.
But....suicidal ideations have been creeping on me for years. Now...I have selected the Black Forest to drown myself in a lake. My daughter gets everything. How can I have a decent life and all these horrible ideations? Drinking myself to death is something else I'm concerned with before I do that. I fucking hate myself. My main concern is that my useless wife will be the main influence in my daughter's life. Which I don't want. So much anger and disappointment. I'm close to ending it.
