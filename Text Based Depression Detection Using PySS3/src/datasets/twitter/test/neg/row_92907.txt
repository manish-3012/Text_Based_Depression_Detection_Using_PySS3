Between a rock and a hard placeI can't seem to reconcile this. I've spent most of the 40 years of my life as an outsider; wanting to connect but never feeling like I could. A crappy relationship when I was preparing to go off into a monastery led to me becoming a single father. I know that I can't off myself simply for the sake of my son who I love more than anything else but I just can't stop thinking about it. I am utterly miserable and there is no one to talk to seemingly who wouldn't judge me or put me in to the category of "that guy's fucked up." Ironically, I am a yoga and meditation teacher with a vast intellectual knowledge of the practices and most of my students seem to think that I am some sort of enlightened master. In order to have students, I feel like I must keep up this facade and I can fake it pretty well but I just feel so empty. The thought of suicide makes me feel relieved but I don't want my son to suffer. He does have a good mother and step father but I don't want him to have to face this world without me but I just don't seem to ever get better. I'm addicted to pot and tobacco and sexual fantasies and sometimes I think that my son will be better off without my influence. I feel like I'm stuck in the past. I grew up as the most unpopular kid all throughout school from kindergarten to high school and I was abused sexually at a very young age as well as physically and emotionally. I sometimes feel like I am at a point of no return. That I've wasted my life and any hopes and dreams which I had once held are now dead. I wake up every morning and think of ways to make it look like an accident and then eventually I break down when I think of the suffering which this would cause my son. I don't want to fucking do this anymore. I want to fucking drop fucking dead already but I don't want my son to suffer. He has a chance; he's encouraged and loved and he isn't subject to the abuse which I knew all too well by his age. People who know what I am going through offer me all sorts of bullshit cliche advice or they insinuate that suicide is cowardly and I wish for them to know of this so called cowardice within themselves before they say it because it's not cowardly. I'm fucking miserable and I want out of this life so fucking badly. I don't know how to let go of the past and I don't know how to move forward. Meds don't seem to work and I see religion as complete and utter bullshit. I feel at my best in those quiet moments of solitude in nature or around the rare being who happens into my life from time to time who I can trust. These days though I have no one like that. My last two friends have betrayed me and have become no better than acquaintances. Sometimes I just think that the world would be a happier place if I weren't in it. I don't know if there is any solution to any of this, but I just needed to write it down and have it be seen by someone who doesn't know me.
