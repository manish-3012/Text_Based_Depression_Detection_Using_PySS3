My greatest wish is to die in my sleep.What is the point of living with a disease that makes you wish you were dead? The world is a very cold place. My parents are my only warmth. They hurt so much seeing me like this. Their baby grew up to become suicidal. I hurt so much seeing them hurt. I hurt so much seeing them grow old. 

A little background. I am a 25-year-old university student that blames himself every semester for being 3 years behind my curriculum and for holding my parents back. My parents pay my tuition fees. I cannot focus when studying because I live in a perpetual state of anhedonia and suicidal thoughts, and day and night I keep thinking about how much of a burden I am for my parents. I always get the shittiest teachers because my grades are mediocre. Good teachers = good education = good professional = good chances of landing a good job and support my parents. Shitty teachers = shitty education = shitty profesional = less chances of getting hired.

My parents keep telling me that they don't care about how long I take to graduate. They keep telling me they love me unconditionally. They keep telling me that my happiness is their happiness. But when I see how cold this world is, I simply cannot be happy. Classmates shun me because to be fair nobody likes to be friends with gloomy people. Nobody tries to reach out and understand me. I end up feeling isolated, and imagine how my parents would feel if they saw that their baby grew up to become a social reject.

I have a huge sense of justice. Whenever I see classmates taking advantage of certain situations, I speak out loud and try to reveal what they did to the rest of my classmates, but nobody believes me and I end up getting even more hated by everyone. It really angers me when people abuse their power to their advantage. This anger eventually becomes impotence, and impotence becomes suicidal thoughts. The greatest paradox is that my suicide will hurt my parents like nothing else would. But at least I wouldn't be there to see them hurt anymore.

Every night before going to sleep, from the bottom of my heart I wish I never woke up ever again.
