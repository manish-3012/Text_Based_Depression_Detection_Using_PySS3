Hi I'm 28 year old mentally ill male that's suicidal AMAWas recommended this community by a friend. Well let's get started. I have visual hallucinations and audiotory as well. I'm on disability but can't even afford to buy food. I barely sleep and have tried to off my self three times. I've overdosed twice on purpose. And tried to hang my self once. But after I passed I guess the screws I used in the ceiling were not in the stud so they ripped out of it. 

I have only maybe two friends. On is from Reddit and lives on the other side of the world I only met a week ago. And my other friend is from online as well but I only talk the them once or twice a week. I've been in the psych ward numerous times and frankly idk wtf do besides just wanting to die.
