Has anyone overcome depression? Or can give advice it may not help but I'm at breaking point.

Hello,

Firstly I'm not looking for sympathy or attention I am doing it over red italso as I can remain unknown.

With a long relationship ending what I thought would be my future wife and a mother to kids one day ended. My mum going through cancer and just feeling like I dont belong anywhere really.

At this moment in time I will be ending it at some point if I cant feel happy.

I'm asking if anyone can give advice or their story of they have overcome it. I'm on anti depressants and aire some days are easier but I still feel how I feel inside and still hide it from others.

I have attempted it once but was found and and an ambulance was called and I was taken to hospital etc.

When I woke up I cried because I was alive. I know it can hurt others but everyone's mind is different and I cant help how I feel
