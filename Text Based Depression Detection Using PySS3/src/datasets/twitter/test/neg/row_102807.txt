Guilt and relationship problemsI cheated on my boyfriend of almost a year last week, and came clean about it immediately. But now the guilt is eating me up inside as he says he wants to still be together but he is finding it still so difficult to reconcile himself with what happened. On top of this, he has severe depression and this has only served to make it worse.


We're being very open with each other about our feelings etc and I'm trying to give him some space right now but seeing his misery is hurting me so much and the guilt is making me just want to disappear and end everything.
