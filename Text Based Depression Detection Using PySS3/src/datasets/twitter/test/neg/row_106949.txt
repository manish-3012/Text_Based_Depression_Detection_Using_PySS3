How can I talk to my friends about suicide?I just found out that another one of my friends tried committing suicide. That makes 2 attempted, 1 accidental, and 3 successful suicides of my friends. I just don't know what to do anymore. I want my friends to be happy; I want all of this to stop. I can't go to another funeral and face my friends grieving parents. What more can I do? I just feel like everything I've done for these friends has just been so futile.
