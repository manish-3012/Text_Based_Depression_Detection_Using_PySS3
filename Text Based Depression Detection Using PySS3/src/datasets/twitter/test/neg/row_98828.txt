So I called a hotline eventually.Hello everyone, 

Yesterday was a low point for me mentally, and for the first time, I called a suicide hotline to help me. This time I knew that if I didn't do that, I would actually take action on my thoughts. For some background, I got myself out of a 3-year depression without telling anyone, until I was out of it. This year was a relatively smooth one, but isolation really drove me to a new territory. My anxiety made me have to take meds to calm me down and thoughts of death really being persistent. 

I don't know why I'm even doing a post but to those who need it, it really comforts you, knowing that there is someone that cares at that moment of time. The person who I spoke to was so kind and understanding. I encourage you to do the same and talk to someone, if it wasn't for her, I would've gone through with my plans.
