What do you do when you've basically lost all hope?Title says it all really, have pretty much come to a point where I've lost all hope for the future, I find it fruitless continuing living and have not been able to shake this feeling since I was 16 years old, I'm 23 now and just can't shake this feeling, has anyone else found such a lack of hope in life and feel that ending it would be a better solution?
