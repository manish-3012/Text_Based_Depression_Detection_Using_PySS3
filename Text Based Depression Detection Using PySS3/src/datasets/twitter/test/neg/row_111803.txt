There's no point but I'm stuckI just don't really see the point anymore. I have my boyfriend, my parents, and my sister - outside of that, I've moved too much and been too uninterested to make friends who would care. My teeth are absolutely destroyed and it will cost thousands just to get them fixed and normal; my car is fucked and a new one is thousands after I spent 6x its worth fixing it already; I've been trying to move out of my parent's place since having to leave my ex and being confined to a room is wearing on me; I have student loans I've been paying for years but I don't even have a degree; I'm 120 pounds overweight and can't seem to lose anything.

 In the past couple months, my car was infested by bugs despite having no food in it, several fillings in my top front teeth fell out and I have to cement them back in every few days with temporary filling shit because my insurance from work hasn't sent me shit so I could actually go, I've spent $3,000 at the mechanic on a car from 2003, and I gained 60 of those 120 pounds. I make double minimum wage, yet I can't afford a fucking thing because of these loans everyone said were "the good ones that don't screw you over" and ended up being *exactly the kind that screw you over* and the *constant* $1,000 bills that come up at random. 

It's just an endless cycle and I can't see any point when I'll be able to have all of this taken care of finally. 

Literally the only reason I don't do anything about life is that my family and boyfriend would be sad. My parents don't deserve that shit. So I'm just stuck here wanting to die but not having the balls to do a fucking thing about it.
