Iâ€™m in my 40s, starting completely overI have nothing. Not one friend. No family. I have kids but I mean in terms of people I can rely on. They just need me. And I donâ€™t have much left to give. I lost my job. On disability for bipolar. Lost my nursing license due to not working enough. I donâ€™t have enough money to get by. My kids are leaving for uni next year. I have nothing. Just an expensive apartment thatâ€™s not mine that I need to give up once the kids are gone because I canâ€™t afford it. Itâ€™s not even nice. Just a lot of money. 

Here I am trying so damn hard to figure out how to start again from nothing. With no support system. No financial help. No motivation. Nothing in my favour. But Iâ€™m looking into school. Possibilities. But it all comes back to the same thing. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™ve been fighting these demons for years without any improvement. I donâ€™t even think I could successfully go back to school. Or work. I see no meaning in life. Even through my kids. 

No one cares. I trudge through each day with no one checking in. No one wondering how I am. People stopped caring a long time ago. Family and friends. My family is really toxic and awful. 

Iâ€™m suffocating. But I keep telling myself I gotta keep trying. I gotta prove them wrong (my abusive ex, my parents who suck, everyone who left me because of my illness) but honestly....I am sick!!! And trying to muster up willpower for whatever good reason isnâ€™t working. I sit at my computer with a million great ideas and hopes and each and every day in the back of my mind are the thoughts â€œI just want to die. I need this to be over. This isnâ€™t worth it anymoreâ€. My mood is so low no matter what I do. I try to walk, get sunshine, blah blah blah. I could be in Disney World (my favourite place) with my kids and I would be thinking of death. 

Iâ€™ve been researching, planning, putting it on hold, coming back to it. Iâ€™m so fucking sad. Completely alone (kids donâ€™t count- donâ€™t say they do- when youâ€™re depressed they suck you dry- I love them but I feel numb and like Iâ€™m forcing my smiles and interest in them ). Iâ€™m so lonely!!! Iâ€™ve burned every bridge imaginable. I look to be a fairly normal educated person. But when you see my empty life that has gone no where despite having an education and a past with lots of friends and a family .....Iâ€™m a complete loser. Iâ€™ve lost my husband (not the abusive one), my career, the home I worked so hard to own, every single friend and family member. 

I canâ€™t sit here one more day with tears in the back of my eyes fighting to come out. The feeling like Iâ€™m falling off a cliff into darkness with nothing to grasp onto. The way depression makes my body ache. My body feels heavy. I donâ€™t want to move. 

Itâ€™s been about 9 years of this fairly consistently with barely any relief in between. Hospitalized 4 times. Electric Shock Therapy. Every med imaginable. Iâ€™ve lost track. Iâ€™m still as depressed as before. Manic too and not the fun kind. The kind that makes you want to tear your hair out. 

Right now Iâ€™ve got my new binder open in front of me, with new pens and my lap top. Researching schools. But I know that I canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™d be lucky to be motivated enough to apply. Youâ€™d think I was crazy if I told you that Ive been doing this exact same thing for probably 4 years now. My mind gets confused easily now and I donâ€™t know if I could learn. I donâ€™t have any financial  way to do it either. In all of the mess of my life I have filed bankruptcy TWICE. itâ€™s a fucking joke. I see no way out people, other than death. It scares me how completely normal suicide feels to me now. What the hell do I do??? Iâ€™m hoping this post doesnâ€™t go unnoticed because then Iâ€™ll know no one cares for sure.
