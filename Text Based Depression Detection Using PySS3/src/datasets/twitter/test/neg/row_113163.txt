I donâ€™t get it man, Iâ€™ve gotten out of my month long depressive episode but the suicidal thoughts are still here... fuck anxietyLife has stated looking up for me, starting Uni and a few days, my relationship with my friends has improved, going back to the gym, started looking for a partime job and  Iâ€™m just feeling better overall, quite optimistic. Iâ€™m no longer properly depressed, no more lying in bed for weeks at a time. February 2020 was my worst month ever 

Yet I still have that bitch anxiety, Iâ€™d take anxiety over depression definitely but I still fucking canâ€™t take it sometimes. Like everything is okay in my life, I know itâ€™s going to be okay... but I got this little fucking voice telling me that Iâ€™ll loose all my friends, that Iâ€™m boring and unlikable and Iâ€™ll be alone forever and Iâ€™ll fail uni and wonâ€™t find a job and be a poor fat moneyless loser with no one 

Itâ€™s so much, my head is constantly thinking about shit and I just wanna fucking drown the thoughts with liquor and relax for 5 minutes honestly. Like I guess itâ€™s better than actually being in that deep depressive state where I donâ€™t even get out of bed to eat and I literally donâ€™t do anything for weeks. But itâ€™s still giving me suicidal thoughts because itâ€™s a lot to fucking think about every second of every day

Fuck you anxiety, you are making it hard to relax, enjoy life, focus and get things done
