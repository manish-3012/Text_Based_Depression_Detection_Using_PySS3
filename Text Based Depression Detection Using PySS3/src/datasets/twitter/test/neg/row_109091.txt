I have those thoughtsIt comes randomly. Thoughts of hurting myself comes in a wave. For a good hour or 2 I feel like I'm paralyzed stuck with my thoughts. With everyone I know I have a front of a fake self. It's not that others cant understand but that others dont even know. It's hard writing this and explaining properly because I've never done anything like this, saying these thoughts genuinely come to me. I know my life is not as hard as others which is honestly pushing me further because I know my life is better then others which makes my sadness seem trivial compared to what others have to go though which then makes it worse. I wanted somewhere to vent but I dont feel comfortable sharing this with anyone else
