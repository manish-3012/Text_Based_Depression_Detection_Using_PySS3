All throughout childhood and adolescence, I was told that things would get easier after I turned 18. I'm 20 now and nothing's getting better. I wanna give up on things changing.I can't handle being at home with parents. I feel like I'm constantly scared and have no where I can feel safe. Even getting high constantly isn't doing it anymore. I'm constantly tense and never know how long until my parents start cursing at me or calling me disgusting. They've been telling me to leave for a while now, and agreed to give me 10k as long as I swear to never come into contact with them ever again, but it's starting to seem like they just want me to leave with nothing. I don't know what to do. I was supposed to take professional exams this year but I'm having trouble completing basic assignments because of pretending to be asleep 20+ hours a day.
