I need help..I'm bipolar, having a really fucking rough time. And psych where I live doesnt have "time" for me untill the end of July.. I don't think i'll last that long.. i've been going ontop of a mountain to stop myself from going to the train tracks. I don't want to die.. I'm so scared but when night time comes, I know that my thoughts lf suicide come with it.. I'm so fucking scared...
