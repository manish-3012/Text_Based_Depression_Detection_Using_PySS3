I can't fight the loneliness and the pain anymoreIn the past year I've

1) Been cheated on by the only girl i've had a relationship with. And the only girl who has ever been interested in me. When I found out she decided I wasn't even worth any remorse.

2) Got a painful incurable disease that made me borderline bedridden for months. I'm currently managing the symptoms but I'm dealing with pain every day.

3) Had all of my college friends/acquaintances drift away from me as a result of 2.

I haven't had a real conversation with someone in 3 months. I can't make new friends, no one wants to date me, and I don't have the will to fight anymore. I'm sick of being judged, sick of people wanting to exploit me, sick of watching everyone else be happy, and sick of every pathetic thing I do in my life. I can't take any more of this and I just want it to end. I think about my death every day and how little everyone will be affected. The only thing I had stopping me was not wanting to vindicate my ex's decision to throw me away like trash, but at this point that loses out against wanting a release from this nonstop barrage of shit I can't escape.
