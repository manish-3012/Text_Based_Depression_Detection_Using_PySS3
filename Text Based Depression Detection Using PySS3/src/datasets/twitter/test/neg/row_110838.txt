Recent eventThis feels strange to do come but I think itâ€™s a good outlet the people need to take for themselves. We shouldnâ€™t let anyone take away our ability to communicate and grieve with one another, to encourage one another, and to fulfill needs that we have that are constructive and wholesome. We canâ€™t let cancel culture or silence or passiveness rule our lives.

This morning I found out my young cousin who had just had a child within days of her sister jumped off the balcony. I had no idea that she was suffering from postpartum depression. Everyone around the two new mothers was so happy and only a few people Close to her knew what difficult time she was having. 

Her husband and father were thoughtful of the symptoms and were tasked with watching her.  They insisted she come out of professional care. I donâ€™t know all the details but I am angry. Their loss and pain is greater than mine Iâ€™m sure, but Iâ€™m still angry. I knew this little girl growing up and watched her from a distance as she grew. The world lost a good kid today.

We have to listen to people when they ask for help. We have to listen. Take the time to reach out. Take the time to connect. Take the time to be a part of your community and your family. Take hold and never let go.
