I just snappedthe neighbor upstairs continually just kept stomping like he was in a marching band and he put his shoes on intentionally to do it.. he keeps following me everywhere I go.. I go into the kitchen, he follows me, and he stands there. he listens to me go to the bathroom. he listens to me watch tv. he listens to masturbate. he listens to me clean the apartment. he listens to me sing. he listens to me type. he listens to the TV. and he does this all day, every day. sometimes he pauses his music when I switch rooms and then he'll listen to me. Mother just makes excuses and says he's just walking around his apartment.. Sure, he is.. He's always walking around.. in the same spot as me at the same time every day.. Just the other day, I walked too fast for him and I sat on the couch and he wasn't quiet enough so I heard him slowly walking across the floor upstairs as if he was trying to be quiet so I couldn't hear him.. He tries to quietly follow me and then he stomps his foot to try to scare me.. And right now I just slammed doors, threw my chair all over the place and tapped the ceiling with a K'nex tower that I built.

From January through July and then September through October of last year I could hardly sleep because he played his music loud almost every night.. Mother won't do anything about it.. He's a huge reason that I'm going to commit suicide soon..

Also, what is actual love? Being screamed at me, being told so many conflicting things you question your heart, your mind, your body.. Like there are so many different things going on with my body right now.. I don't know if I'm getting sick or what.. But I just can't care.. I can't afford to care.. and even if I did, I'll just have another smug doctor look at me like I'm an idiot because I worried about myself.. Am I not supposed to worry about myself? I'll state the obvious.. Guys aren't supposed to care about themselves, right? Fine, I won't.. Here's to neglecting myself... Fuck everything in my life.. I'm sick of explaining.. Because nobody's ever going to understand.. You should do this.. You should do that.. Well, guess what.. A bullet in my fucking mind is the best fucking option.. Besides, we need to rid the world of my types, right? The smart ones.. Oh, maybe I'm not smart because people don't fucking teach me anything.. They just call me an idiot, neglect me, abuse me, and then leave or try to control my vulnerable state.. I'm not incompetent.. I know I'm vulnerable.. But I can't get help.. Because I try to say something and then people are like.. So "you're ____" as if they're going to try to fix me instead of all of the people who fuck with my head and my heart.

So fuck it.. Once I get that money.. BAM BAM BAM
