The only thing I want for Christmas is deathPeople keep asking me what gifts I would want for Christmas when honestly thereâ€™s nothing I really want except death. I donâ€™t want to waste peopleâ€™s money on gifts if Iâ€™m not planning to be around for long. The only thing I want is a gun so that I could shoot myself and be done with this.
