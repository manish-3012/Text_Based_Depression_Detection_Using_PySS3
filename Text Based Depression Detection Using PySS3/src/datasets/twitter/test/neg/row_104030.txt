Anyone else wish someone would do the deed for them?I'm very sorry for the recent shooting at the synagogue, but part of me wishes that I were there. Or somewhere where there's a shooting so that some lunatic would shoot me, a lunatic who wants to die. That way, the people around me (mostly my parents) won't feel guilty since my death would be from a shooting instead of a suicide. 

I'm ready to go and I don't want to stay here longer than I should be.
