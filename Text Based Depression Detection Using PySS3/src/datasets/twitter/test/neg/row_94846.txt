life is no goodim bullied at school by both the students and the teachers. they think its funny to act like im retarded and mock me. my home life isnt any better. i sit around on my fat ass on the stupid internet being depressed about people having friends and being the people they want to be. im at lunch right now (i go home because of bullies) and i would seriously rather die than go back to school because its that torturous. before today i thought i would never kill myself but now im actually starting to warm up to the idea that this world is meant to enslave and milk the life out of us. everyday is the exact same as the next and the one before it and every other day. i get up so tired im hallucinating, go eat shitty breakfast and go to school, get threatened by the teachers who say they want to beat me, get treated retarded by everybody. not get talked to by anybody. and then go home and be depressed on facebook while i watch as everyone has a good time with friends, then i go to bed at 12:00 AM - 1:00 AM and repeat. there is no good in my life. besides, its not like anyone will care
