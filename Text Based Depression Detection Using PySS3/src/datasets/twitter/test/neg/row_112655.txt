how to keep any sense of hope when it feels like there's no future [just venting]almost every experience I have is just another example of how messed up I am and how hopeless my future is, I haven't had friends for years or a partner or a proper long term job ever, I struggle with the most basic things that everyone else breezes through. I'm just too messed up. theres no point in living if I'm always going to be alone. like its always been in the back of my mind im just a lost cause.
