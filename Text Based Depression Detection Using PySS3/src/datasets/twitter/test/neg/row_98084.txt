Perpetually LonelyRecently I've been thinking about death and suicide a lot more. I feel completely alone even though I have two great friends who happen to be dating each other now, but no matter what they say or anything I always feel like they don't actually want me as their friend. They never hang out together unless I'm there, but I still feel like they secretly hate me. Every time I drive anywhere I have the urge to just go into the other lane of traffic or go straight into a telephone pole or tree. I want to die so bad but I can't bring myself to do it. Every night one of them is on their prescription pills and after the effects kick in she doesn't remember anything, but in that state she also talks a lot of emotions and stuff. Every night we both talk and I tell her everything that has happened to me and how much I want to die and the next day she doesn't remember a thing. I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. My parents know I've tried to kill myself multiple times in the past but still don't see the need for me to get help or anything, I feel like they just don't care about me. I don't know if I'm going to pass this year of school, and my mother always points out how my cousin is graduating early. I just feel completely alone and don't know how to change that. I think I'm just going to be perpetually lonely and the only solution is death, but I just can't do it.
