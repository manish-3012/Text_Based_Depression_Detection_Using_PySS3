I really want to goHi. I kind of made my decision to die and end all this. I'm not proud of anything i've ever did, and my whole life I've felt this way. I just don't think I fit anywhere, I feel like I can't trust anyone and I don't think anyone really cares. I've done therapy 2 times in the past and now it's been six months since I got back at  it. Everything kind of always felt really weird and I'm not ever really comfortable with anything. Also, I found out my best friend does not really care about me at all and I broke up with my boyfriend, who is the person I love the most, because he just didn't wanna be with me. So, kind of hard not to think that I am a pain in the ass and am not guilty for all the shit that I get and always got. 
Under no circumstance I will do this over a failed relationship. But I just think this is one more proof that I suck at everything that I try to do.
I feel really deluded. Because all my life when I started to be okay with something later on I would find out that I was completely wrong
Nothing ever fills my heart anymore so that is it.
