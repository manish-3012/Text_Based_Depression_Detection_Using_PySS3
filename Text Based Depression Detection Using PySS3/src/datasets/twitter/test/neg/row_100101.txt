Hanging by a knob...Itâ€™s been a while. I visited this sub regularly a couple/few years ago. I helped a few. Voiced my thoughts. Now Iâ€™m hear on the other side. The grass isnâ€™t always greener. Tonight the grass has shadows cast upon the tips of the blade. Iâ€™ve made my bed. Iâ€™ve faked happiness and laughed to keep from crying for so long. Iâ€™m not hear to say Iâ€™m going to end it tonight... I need encouragement. Help to keep going. An outlet to plug into.  A smile to smile back at.
