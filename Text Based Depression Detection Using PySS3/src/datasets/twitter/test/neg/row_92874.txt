UpdateSo I'm still alive, well existing at least.
I'm slowly getting through people telling them that I plan on ending it, and its surprising seeing how people react to the situation and today I told someone and talking to this person is the first time I have felt almost a little sad, I'm not even sure if sad is the right word I just felt something that wasn't the content emptiness that I live with everyday about killing myself. 
I'm pretty much finished with my letters saying goodbye to people apart from a couple that I just can't seem to finish but in sure I'll find a way to do it soon. 
Only 522 hours left and even then it seems to long.
I'll update again soon
Thanks for listening 
Just in case I'm not here for another update stay strong be safe, come out the other side and fuck shit up âœŒ
