Becoming "properly" suicidal more and more oftenI've been depressed for a long time and I've been thinking about suicide increasingly but just sort of accepting it as a possibility. I always assumed that I'd be the "type" to at least attempt at some point.

But today I've been forcing myself to really think about it as a real and imminent thing, as real as going to the loo or making a coffee. Just... doing it. And then that's it. And I'm panicking.

Paradoxically i find myself thinking about how everyone who'd ultimately be better off without me but then I'll force myself to think about how it would fuck up the lives of people around me - THEN i feel like a total narcissist for thinking that way and that i have far too high an opinion of myself and don't deserve to put off suicide just for that reason, especially when so many others who have done far better things in their lives do it all the time. It gets particularly bad if i hear about someone famous or who i admire has done it, it makes the voice even stronger that demands to know what my excuse is for hanging on.

In short my mind is fucked at the moment. I don't want to burden any one with these thoughts when I'm most likely going to wuss out of it anyway and then I'll have put everyone through worry for nothing, and also what if this is an ongoing thing? 

I can't speak to a professional, I'm already registered with a mental health service and they are utterly useless and the last ones I'd want to turn to while feeling this way. Because I have aspergers they think I just need to go along to special social groups and learn small talk (I learned how to do it long before they showed up but the problem isn't not knowing it's that it's so hard especially when depressed all the time) and are apparently blocking any form of therapy until I do so. I've told them about feeling suicidal before and they did literally nothing, not even asking me any further questions or anything. Because of this glib attitude they've eroded any willingness to show them any vulnerability. I have no friends and an overprotective yet often emotionally distant family with plenty of problems of their own.

In fact I couldn't exactly say to them that their problems are a significant contributor to my feeling like this, useless and unable to help with anything, along with the likelihood (a sentiment they keep reinforcing) that life is only going to get worse.

I don't know what to do.
