dunno how to progressprocessing emotional information internally is trying to rationalize the irrational.
iâ€™m slipping again into my downward spiral.
should i pull the trigger i ask myself? will this broken heart of mine mend itself in time or would i rather skip the process? Iâ€™ve tried ending this version of my soul three times. will four attempts be enough? calling the line is a cesspool of empathy that is nonexistent. therapy? been doing that for 20 years.... medication? on a strong cocktail currently, tried every one for my Bipolar. this rabbit-hole doesnâ€™t seem deep, quite shallow actually. iâ€™m still breathing but the success rate of a hole through the temple doesnâ€™t seem appealing, wishing there was an alternative. is this my note iâ€™ll leave? who cares, iâ€™m incapable of self-love; telling my reflection iâ€™m valid and that this 24 year old body isnâ€™t ugly, which i then return to nothingness. so iâ€™ll just sit here. waiting. for the inevitable.
