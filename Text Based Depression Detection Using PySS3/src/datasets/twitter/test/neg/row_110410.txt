My life is overI thought I could get past everything that's been fucking up in my life. I was even happy for a few days but it was so brief I almost can't remember it anymore.
I miscarried the baby. They're gone. Now I really have nothing to live for anymore.
I've successfully made my partner hate me and once I give him back his things and money I owe him, I can get on with my plan.
Trying to return to work after being off with depression for a long time hasn't worked... I dunno what I'm doing anymore.

It's gonna be for the best for everyone that I go. And I can't handle the pain anymore. Can't handle anything anymore.

I just wasn't meant to be.

Thanks reddit for giving me the odd chuckle here and there. Some people just aren't meant to be though.
