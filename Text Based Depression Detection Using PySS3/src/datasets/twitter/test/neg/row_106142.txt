HELP MEI've got a problem, and there's really nowhere to ask for help with this kind of problem, so I'll post it here. It seems fitting enough anyway... I have these urges, and I want to fulfill them, but I know that what dies will stay dead, that there are consequences for my actions, and that I'm not thinking clearly. However, I have been losing touch with reality to the point where life doesn't phase me anymore. I've been desensitised, and my thought proccesses clearly reveal thhat logic. I have been evaluated by psychiatrists on multiple occasions and was always found to be of great mental health, so why do I want to do this so badly? How does one deal with these types of urges when they happen? (which seems to be more and more often) What do I do to stay out of trouble? Why am I thinking like this if I am "healthy?"
