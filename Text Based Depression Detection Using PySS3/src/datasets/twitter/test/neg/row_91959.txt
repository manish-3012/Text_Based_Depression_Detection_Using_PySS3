Am I really suicidal if Iâ€™m afraid to die?Hi. Iâ€™m pathetic. Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for almost a decade now. Iâ€™ve tried the works- therapy, medication, mediation, fitness, burying myself in hobbies, socializing. Iâ€™ve also attempted suicide before, but it was half-assed and unsurprisingly failed. So Iâ€™m still here, feeling like this. And whenever I try to talk about how I feel with the people I trust in my life, they never seem to take me seriously. I think that they acknowledge my mental illness(es), but they truly donâ€™t believe that Iâ€™ll ever commit suicide. And maybe theyâ€™re right. I havenâ€™t been able to in the past. And I suppose the thought of death still scares me when it comes down to it. Does that mean I donâ€™t really want to die? 

Because I hate being alive. I feel disgusting. I feel like the future is so bleak, and the thought of continuing on like this for years and years to come is suffocating. Like swimming through a sea of tar. I made a noose and sat there with it around my neck and I just couldnâ€™t do it. And now Iâ€™m sitting here feeling so defeated and pathetic. Why am I like this? Too fucking weak to fucking try harder to have a better life, but also donâ€™t have the courage to just end it. 

Iâ€™m terrified that Iâ€™ve become one of those people who cry suicide but have no intention to follow through. I hate people who act as though suicide is a threat. Iâ€™ve always felt they made a mockery of mental health and detracted from the experiences of those who truly suffered. Is that what I am? Because as much as Iâ€™m afraid of dying, the idea of death fills me with such a sense of peace. So why am I so fucking scared?
