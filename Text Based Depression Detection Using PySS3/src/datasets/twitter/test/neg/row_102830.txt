.I don't wanna do it. But there's not even a point anymore. My life is pointless. And I'm worthless. I always fuck every single thing I do up. And I haven't even been able to build a life. I wanna do it tonight. I'm scared it won't work though. My life is pointless at this point. I try as hard as I can and still everything I touch I fuck up or can't manage. The only thing holding me back is hurting my family, at this point. I have nothing else left aside from that. It's hardly enough to hold me back anymore though. I'm so tired of life... And they'd get over it eventually. I'm scared right now. And I have no body to turn to. Part of me doesn't even know why I'm posting this. Because I don't want help anymore. I'm so done..... I cry every single night, multiple times a day. I have nothing to live for. And nothing to look forward to. I have nearly no friends. And literally the only thing holding me back is my family. I'm just so done.........
