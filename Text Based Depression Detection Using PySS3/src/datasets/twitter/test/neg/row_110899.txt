Please help me.I have so many things wrong with me. Anorexia, dyslexia, major depression and more. Every single day I cut because I need relief. Itâ€™s not school related itâ€™s my family. They treat me like such shit and itâ€™s awful. My mother just cares about me staying thin and healthy and making sure I eat nothing unhealthy. Iâ€™m in the hospital right now because I cut into a nerve in my arm and I might never be able to use my arm again. Iâ€™m just balling my eyes out and realising what Iâ€™ve done to myself. I think of suicide so much but Iâ€™m always too afraid that I wonâ€™t be successful and Iâ€™ll end up in a hospital forever.
