Iâ€™m a horrible child...My mom is gonna be giving birth soon and I probably wonâ€™t be there to see my sibling be born or give support to her after the fact because my depression keeps me from having the energy to do anything but sit and waste away... I havenâ€™t had the energy to get up and bathe in days, and I have no money for groceries because I lost my job a few weeks ago...Iâ€™d be better off gone. I donâ€™t want to be a leech off anyone, especially not my family and friends...I just wanna jump off my apartmentâ€™s balcony and end it.
