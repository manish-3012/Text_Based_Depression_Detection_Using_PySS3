No girl ever sees me beyond a friendI donâ€™t know what I do wrong. I think Iâ€™m nice and attractive but I think Iâ€™m just better off as a friend than a romantic partner. When I text girls it seems very obvious they are either not interested or they just see me as a friend. Iâ€™m too young to online date so Iâ€™m going to be alone for a long time. I donâ€™t want to deal with that so Iâ€™m just going to kill myself. Or find a way to destroy my sex drive so I never have to be attracted to anyone ever again
