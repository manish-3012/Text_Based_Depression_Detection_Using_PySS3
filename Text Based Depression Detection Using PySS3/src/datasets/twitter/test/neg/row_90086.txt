The last two days have been awfulNot really sure why, but I wokr up on Tuesday with zero desire to be around my family or anyone for that matter  
  
I spent two days sleeping, feeling awful about myself and sustaining my body on three litres of homemade lemon ice tea filled with as much sugar as possible so I wouldn't have to leave my room to get food.  
  
I hope this doesn't become a common problem.
