She is unstable and I fear for her health.Hello SW, I am wondering if you could help me or maybe give me some advice. My girlfriend is suffering from constant rumor spreading and texts of harassment. I myself have never had a problem with this for I am able to let those things go, but her not so easily. I fear for her own safety because she has contemplated suicide and even attempted it before. I am infinitely grateful it failed and am looking for ways and advice to change her perception on what people think of her. I really need your help with this Reddit so we can both get back to being joyful and happy again. Thank you.
Before anybody asks: We are both 15 years of age, and the harassing by the other douchbags and whores is revolting.
