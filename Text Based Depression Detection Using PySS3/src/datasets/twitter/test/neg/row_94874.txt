If you sometimes have suicidal thoughtsIs it safe to tell a therapist without being thrown into a mental institute? I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever do it, but sometimes life just sucks so much. Every inch forward leads to a ten foot knock back. Iâ€™m taking care of my aging mother so Iâ€™d never actually do something like this, but the thought does cross my mind every now me then. 

Iâ€™d love to see a therapist, but Iâ€™m afraid of being â€œput away.â€ How possible is this?

Thanks in advance. Discovered this subreddit tonight and I have to say, you are all really wonderful people.
