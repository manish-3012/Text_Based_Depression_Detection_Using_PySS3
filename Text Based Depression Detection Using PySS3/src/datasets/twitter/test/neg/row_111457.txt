Change?Change?
What is change? What is time? What is life? Simply we cannot answer those questions exactly. I have been at the lowest you can go. And currently I am at the lowest point at the moment, I have these times when I know I want to make a change, to be better. Yet my own self contradicts me. I am my own enemy. I am my own guard. I donâ€™t know why my mind is so against happiness, like ive said tons of times before happiness doesnâ€™t want me. Simply I think how does one become happy? How do they....? I notice that I myself know Iâ€™m gonna die at a young age. Itâ€™s so sad to think like this but simply when someone says â€œthereâ€™s much more to life you have to have hopeâ€ those are meaningless words now....there is no hope. There isnâ€™t much to life... I see that I am a negative person I wish to be someone very different. But I am stuck with this weight on my shoulders. I cry so hard bc Iâ€™m sad. Iâ€™m emotional. Maybe too much, but I cry so hard knowing that I want to be happy. That I want to feel important maybe itâ€™s too much to ask. But I simply donâ€™t get how people say they are so happy. I donâ€™t wanna kill myself bc Iâ€™m simply too much of a coward. There had been moments that I wished nothing but death. I wanted to feel something. I guess at the end of the day itâ€™s just a sad day. And this is all the time. I read this quote you see â€œsleep will never be enough if itâ€™s your soul thatâ€™s tiredâ€ and I simply see the truth in this. You see no matter how much I sleep in and lay down. Iâ€™m constantly craving sleep. To be at rest for a bit. Getting through the day is hell but when Iâ€™m asleep I feel so loved and free. The world is sad. Iâ€™m sad. I feel Iâ€™m just not enough. Iâ€™m a problem. Simply put it that way. Iâ€™m dying slowly. Painfully slowly. -xx this just shows a small bit of my brain. Thank you.
