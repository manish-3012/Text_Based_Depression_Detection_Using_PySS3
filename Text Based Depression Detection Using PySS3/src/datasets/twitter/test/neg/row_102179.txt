Seriously want to do it.On mobile
Reddit, I'm not even making a throw away. What's the fucking point. I guess I have an okay life. 2 friends, a hobby. But my mother makes my life a living hell, every day in degraded to a piece of shit, I used to think about suicide and how I wouldn't do it but I wouldn't mind dying, the only things that's stopping me is how my dog would be sad forever, and my twin sister would Surely grieve for days on end, my mother or father wouldn't care much. I'll probably write blame on her in the note. 
I'm 15, know how to firearm. I have a gun not 10 meters away from me. Loaded.
95% leaning towards just blowing my head off tonight.
