POST ACID CONCUSSIONBADLY BROKEN IN MANY WAYS
SO MUCH WORSE YET STILL THE SAME
MAN I MISS MY FUCKING BRAIN
BROKEN GLASS I SEVERED A TENDON
BLED WHITEÂ  WHY DID THEY SAVE ME
I WAS TRYING TO FUCKING END IT
BLOOD ON THE FLOORS
BLOOD ON THE WALLS
AFTERMATH OF A PSYCHEDLIC FALL
VISUALS THAT AREN'T THERE
SEEING PATTERNS I JUST STARE
TRY TO PRETEND THAT I DON'T CARE
REALITY IS I'M ALL ALONE 
AND I'M THE ONE THAT DUG THIS HOLE
