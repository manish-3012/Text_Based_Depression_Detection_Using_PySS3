What should I do?I wanted to commit suicide since I was 16 I am 19 now.

I'm just too pussy, because I want it to be painless. I'm so much of a failure I can't even off myself.

I don't think any of my friends would miss me, I'm so far from all them, literally and mentally. I am planning on isolating myself for a year or two so even if I do grow the balls to do it, they would never really know. So they wouldn't have to miss me or grieve. 

I made two painful suicide attempts, I was 17 jumping off a 15 foot high tree, I meant to do it head first to break my neck but I realized what I was doing, and only sprained my ankle bad. 

Then at 18 I slashed my right hand and left wrist, I just sat for hours painfully bleeding waiting to pass out and not wake up.

Myabe I could drown myself? Is it painful?
