I have no friends :(Iâ€™ve been stuck inside for 6 months while watching everyone around me move on. I broke up with my ex months ago but havenâ€™t stopped talking to him until today. Seeing someone you care about on grindr saying that â€œheâ€™s super tight and wants to get fuckedâ€. Sucks to lose your best and only friend thinking you were nothing more than a convenience. All I do is lay in bed day after day. I have no job and still live with my parents. I donâ€™t see my life doing anything but staying stagnant. I just wish something would happen to me. Something to just take all of my sadness and loneliness away. This is why I never get into romantic relationships. Some people just arenâ€™t meant to be happy. I have so much I have to offer in this world but nobody to take it. If Iâ€™m not contributing anything then Iâ€™m only depriving of the world. Seems wasteful, doesnâ€™t it? I hope you all have a better head on your shoulders than I do.
