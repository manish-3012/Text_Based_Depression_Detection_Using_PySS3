I tried to drown myself twice today but then stoppedI was taking a bath and dunked my head underwater with no air in my lungs but eventually decided it was too much pain. I kinda want to kill my self. Life is so worthless and dying sounds better. Eventually I just cut my arm with scissors and a razor blade. Please help.
