Fucking up without tryingIâ€™m a horrible ass person. I donâ€™t know how to be a nice person. I donâ€™t even know how to interact with people. I have tried to have a better relationship with the people (I think) I care about but I canâ€™t. The only person I talk to, the only person who truly cares about me... I treat him like shit. I donâ€™t know how to be a normal ass person. I have my head so far up my ass that I fail at everything I do. I grew up quiet and reserved. Mid fucking twenties and I ainâ€™t shit. No money, no job, no car (not even a fucking drivers license), no place of my own, no family. Iâ€™m currently in college but I just donâ€™t comprehend shit and I canâ€™t interact with people. Iâ€™m already fucking all of that up. I find myself here time and time again. I need to just leave already.
