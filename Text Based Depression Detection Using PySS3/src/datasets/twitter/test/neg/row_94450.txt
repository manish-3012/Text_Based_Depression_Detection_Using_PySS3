Has anyone had success with suicide lines? (I havenâ€™t)I get so sick of seeing Suicide Hotlines linked everywhere suicide is mentioned. Do they help anyone? 

Iâ€™ve tried 4 times and the people were so bored, apathetic, and unknowledgeable that they were reduced to â€œum, yeahâ€ or â€œum, I donâ€™t knowâ€ or â€œum, I canâ€™t sayâ€. They seemed to want to know if I had an immediate (as in that night) plan for suicide, and when I said I didnâ€™t (I donâ€™t want to be involuntarily committed, which one said they can do), they said â€œok, we need to wrap this upâ€. It was like talking to a dumber version of myself.

So, did anyone speak with someone who said anything useful? Or do you know of anyone with a positive experience with suicide helplines? I donâ€™t know why people volunteer for this if they really donâ€™t care anything about mental health. The closest to caring Iâ€™ve gotten was a bored guy saying, â€œyeah, I see why that sucksâ€.

Iâ€™d like to call more to see if the ones I spoke with were a representative sample, but that would be wasting the time of someone that might be helped by them. Iâ€™d love to hear about experiences from others, good and bad.

This isnâ€™t relevant to the topic, but If anyoneâ€™s curious, Iâ€™m suicidal due to chronic widespread pain and finding it nearly impossible to work without anyone catching me crying. They fire people here for crying in public.  Plus my doctors just want to treat the depression (thatâ€™s due to the pain) and not the source of the pain. SSRIs and Tylenol are their recommendations. Tylenol is too weak and bad for the liver and SSRIs just do nothing or make me fat. (I keep a food diary to show the meds arenâ€™t making me eat more to show doctors.)Iâ€™ve tried 6 over the years, plus tricyclics.  Aleve seems to help the most, but it barely works.
