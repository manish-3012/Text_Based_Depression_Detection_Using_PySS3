I need someone to hear meMy mother and father were brutal alcoholics. 
My mother kept me out of school until I was 7, my father said she did this because she especially loved her lastborn child, her only son after 3 girls.
He would go to work at around 2pm and get home sometime after midnight Monday - Friday. 
My mother would wake up every morning and cook breakfast then take my sister's to school then take me to my grandmas house. Shed pick me up around 6pm, I only remmeber this because Sonic The Hedgehog aired on WB just before she pulled up. We'd go home and my older sisters would pick on me as normal. I truly believe they hated me, so I didn't really know how to talk to them so they called me wierd, gay, retarded, etc. After dinner mom would would pull a big brown bottle with a rooster on it. (I'm an adult now and I still don't know the brand name)
She'd get wasted almost every night, I remember one night she was casually drinking and doing her hair. She had this big heavy iron comb sitting on the stove, while she was tending to the stove reading a magazine I thought I'd sneak in a sip or 2 of her drink sitting on the coffe table in the living room. I assumed it was gonna be like soda because she'd always have a coke next to the glass cup. I didn't even think about it so I threw it back. The burn hit my tounge and nostrils at the same time I thought it was liquid fire, I hated it. I coughed and choked so loud she already knew what I did. She walked in the room and saw me with the cup and told me to drink it, I said "It burns I can't do it." She said "Drink it or I'll burn you with this hot comb!" So I poured it in my mouth and held it in my cheeks then swallowed because spitting it out meant I'd get burned I knew she would do it because she did it to my sister the night before for an unrelated reason. After I drank it I got dizzy and sat down on the floor I couldn't feel my face. This cup had to be the equivalent of about 3 shots and I downed it. She laughed and refilled the cup with no soda added to it and drinks it all then immediately refills it. She goes to turn off the stove and dips the comb in water.. 

K this is harder than I thought it'll be I can't go in to detail because I don't want to remember this night or the following nights. This incident started her pattern of abusing me every night after dinner. Sexual, Physical, Emotional. She still burned me that night. The scar healed but I have a spot on my cheek that cannot grow hair so if I grow a beard it'll be parted.  The abuse went on until the following year. I started kindergarten at 7 years old, No one ever told me that I was late to starting school. I was always the oldest kid in class, everyone always thought I was held back a year or two. 15 years old in 8th grade, dropped out of high school at 17 got my GED and started working at Wendy's. Now I'm 23 I'm a department head at a retail sporting goods store . I hate when I see people walking with there families totally normal and truly happy. I hate that my mind thinks this way involuntarily, I'm a 23 year old kissles virgin. I make up stories whenever Im stuck in a convo about ex gfs or sex. My mom had a stoke and ended up paralyzed and demented she's 54, my dad died last year from alcohol induced pancreatitis I'm taking care of my mother. She can't walk anymore. I wake up every morning hearing my name being screamed then I'd cook her food and empty her bedside pot. She had this stroke in 08 I was 14 at the time. I've been doing this almost everyday since. I know something Is wrong with my mind I don't even hate my mother for the horrid things she did to me. I hate myself more than anything. I'm at the point where I'm downing a 5th every night after work and polishing my mask so it looks nice and normal for the next day. I don't see a point in trying to live a normal life anymore for years I wanted to be like the other kids in my class I remember from school I never wanted to draw attention to myself so I did not talk to anyone I always sat in the back an hoped No one would notice me I guess I've achieved that. The loneliness is crippling I've tried everything my mind allows me to do, the anxiety holds me back from being noticed by the world. I signed for an apartment and im picking up the keys in the morning if I can't make a significant change in the way I view the world I Will end my life. It's not logical to continue existing like this. My sister is taking my mom in to live with her family. My sister's are all in there 30s and I see they are worried about me but we don't really talk like siblings should. 
Please help me. Anyone, I'm desperate to begin anew.
