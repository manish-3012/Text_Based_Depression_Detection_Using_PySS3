I read an interesting article on notesI started writing notes, just for the sake of it. It started around 2015 for some reason, and without thinking about it very much I often found myself writing another one. Sometimes the classical types, like blaming myself, sometimes forgiving everything and everyone, sometimes with a nonsensical poem or drawing. 

I always fantasize the reaction people would have, and for some experience in life I discovered that it is always an overestimate of reality. I remember struggling to communicate about depression a lot, always thinking I didn't have to because I was showing signs, that everybody noticed and it was just an untold agreement that they knew and I didn't have to say anything... Until fairly recently, when I talked about it (in my own way) to a very important person to me and her reaction was... kind of bland. Kind of confused. Apparently no "signs" existed so far, it was all in my head.

And I thought about it as I started, blindly, to write another note. For me it wouldn't be a surprise to anyone, just a thing that happened. Nothing out of the ordinary. And the note would be a chance to express something with the most impact to others... so it had to be meaningful, with impact... 

And then I stumble with [this paper right here](https://docslide.net/documents/the-effect-of-the-content-of-suicide-notes-on-grief-reactions.html), from 1987. The effect of the content of suicide notes on grief reactions.

It divides the victims, which are the people who commit suicide, and the survivors, which are the ones that were affected by the suicide.

It says that although the majority does not leave a note (~20%),  those who do usually write something that is repeated throughout all the notes. They usually express the wish to kill, be killed or die and relate this to other people, groups or institutions.

And the theme falls in some predictive categories, all of each has a certain negative impact on the survivors. Mainly guilty. The feeling of guilty of those who are suicide survivals and read the content of a suicide note has a higher probability to be increased. Depending on the content, there is a high chance of the survivor start having suicidal tendencies themselves. 

One of the most strong theme that affect others is self blame and forgiveness. As it serves, pragmatically, as a harmful and manipulative way to blame someone else in an indirect way, because it states that something was to blame and the victim absorbed it, prohibiting the other part to communicate or process it before it is too late.

I don't know... I found it interesting. It got me thinking that all the fantasies on my head does not at all resemble the natural and real reaction other people would have.
