I donâ€™t know how or why I got this wayIâ€™m as charismatic as a brick I suppose. At least thatâ€™s what I read from people. I just feel that Iâ€™m the worst when it comes to first impressions. 

I donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m so unlikable and long for the day that someone who knows me will just pull me to the side and be upfront about it. The thing is Iâ€™m not sure whether or not Iâ€™d trust or value their opinion. It seems like people just want to attack me; they view me as some easy target or something. 

I have a firm belief that whether a person views you in a negative way or positive way is for the most part up to them, not you. It makes total sense to me, and honestly brings me some peace once I finally understood/accepted that some people will like me and some wonâ€™t. 

The worst part of all, is that my family love me, especially my mom. I love my mom, man. Sheâ€™s the best. I love my dad too and my sister is cool sometimes. I wish that was enough for me to feel full, because it is. But I canâ€™t. 

I do have many close friends who are awesome and invite me out and actually talk to me. Iâ€™ve become so bitter when it comes to any kind of affection. I donâ€™t think I can ever tell someone that I love them without forcing it out. Whenever someone compliments me or shows me love I freak out as if death is coming my way.

Iâ€™m always the wrong one but nobody ever listens to me; Iâ€™m always the stupid one but I make good money and graduated with a good degree; Iâ€™m always the awkward one but nobody really talks to me; I donâ€™t get it. 

I want to think that Iâ€™m doing something wrong. I want to. Because then I can change my actions and become better. 

I just hope itâ€™s the way I look. Iâ€™ve been going to the gym consistently for 1 month now. I think Iâ€™ll need like a year. By the end of it Iâ€™m gonna whiten my teeth and get a tan. If that doesnâ€™t change things, I wonâ€™t have any hope left
