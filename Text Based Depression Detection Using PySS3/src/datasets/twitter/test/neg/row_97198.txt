Spiraling outI have nearly constant suicidal ideation. In the average day I will spend hours ruminating on killing myself. After I go through this I canâ€™t stop feeling guilt that I would put my family through this and it just reinforces my resolve. After work today I called my wife and told her I wasnâ€™t coming home. Ended up sitting in a park alone for an hour drinking on a bench. Idk how long I can keep holding out.
