I have a job to do first.I posted here a while back. One of the managers at the store I work at even found it and it is completely possible he will find this as well, but right now I donâ€™t care, this post is for me. It is a reminder for myself. I said I had no reason to feel suicidal. But, that I do anyway.

Things have only gotten worse. To the point I now have my reason.

My gf and I broke up. A while ago, but itâ€™s only just starting to dawn on me. She was my last line of defense. The last thing keeping the tower from falling apart. Ironic, given how sheâ€™s emotionally and mentally abused me for the past 3.5 years.

Tomorrow I will see her for the last time. She is returning my property and then we will go our separate ways.

Itâ€™s time to throw in the towel. I feel thereâ€™s no other way. But I start work at an annual seasonal job, that I always enjoyed, very soon, so I will stay till the end of that. I also have to properly put my two weeks in to my actual job as well so they have time to find my replacement before the holidays.

I have already made my resolve. She doesnâ€™t care, nor does anybody else. Iâ€™m nothing and if I keep existing, I will simply continue to be nothing.

I am unloved, unwanted, unneeded. Oddly enough, my utter desire to feel appreciated and wanted has me working on a project to draw all my coworkers and give them the pictures as a goodbye. But they do not know that last part, nor do they need to. 

I hate myself. And the world will be so much brighter for those I care about once Iâ€™m no longer bothering them. Tonight marks the day of resolve.

I will pretend to be my usual, bubbly self at work, because honestly thatâ€™s all that matters. It doesnâ€™t matter how I feel. It never did. All that matters is getting my work done. Properly.

I am ready to die; and only a miracle can save my life. But this is reality, I believe, and miracles donâ€™t happen in real life.
