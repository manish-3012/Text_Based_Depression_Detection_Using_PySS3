I've caused too much painI broke up with my girlfriend of 8 years because the relationship became toxic. But I miss her every second of every day. I can't focus. I can't think. I have so much overwhelming pain. I've drank 5 tranquilizers and I still feel the pain so I'm going to drink the two boxes of oxy I have, and make this pain go away permanently.
