I almost committed suicide last summerI was 14 and was really depressed at the time. So I'm at my uncle's house for the summer doing yard work for him and was making some good money. He lives in a 2 story house with a balcony. The 2nd story was the guest room with a bathroom and a door onto the balcony. I was sleeping upstairs when one day,I woke up and i was home alone. Everyone was at work and I was left at home to do the yard work. But I was feeling like shit and was tired of my life. So I went out onto the balcony,stood up on the frame,and almost fell forward to my death. I ended up falling backwards and I got like this feeling of being sense smacked into me. I asked my self,why am I out here? What caused me to come out here? I ran inside,cried for what seemed like forever,and never went back onto the balcony. Here I am now,I'm still 14 turning 15 next month,I feel somewhat better,hopefully going to seek out for help sometime soon,I've been making better and closer friends,I have a loving boyfriend,and I'm doing really good in school. But I will never forget the day that I almost took my life.
