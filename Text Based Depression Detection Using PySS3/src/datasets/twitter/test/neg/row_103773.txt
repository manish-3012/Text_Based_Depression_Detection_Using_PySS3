Just General StressWelp, Iâ€™m not exactly suicidal yet, but Iâ€™ve thought abt it a couple times. 
Iâ€™m about 14, and Iâ€™m always stressed. I had to switch schools because the administrators pushed me so hard. Iâ€™d be doing pre-calc freshman year. Iâ€™m not as stressed about school now, but Iâ€™m stressed socially. I weigh around 102 lbs and I feel fat. I feel like Iâ€™m repulsive and annoying. I feel wimpy because Iâ€™m terrible at sports. I just feel like giving up on everything.
