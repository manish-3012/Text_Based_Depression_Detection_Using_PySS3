This summer.I donâ€™t want everyone to constantly look after me, and spend time with me. These people, who I couldnâ€™t imagine the world without, are being dragged down by me. All my friends could have great friendships with other people, and not have to give a damn about someone so insignificant as myself. My parents could stop spending money on a burden like me. When summer comes, a little after I see my family in Michigan, Iâ€™m going to do it. I can finally say goodbye on a good note. So late July or early September is when itâ€™s gonna happen. Plus, thereâ€™s not even a valid reason to stay alive. Humans need other humans, and nobody will want me with my self harm scars. If I donâ€™t end it soon, itâ€™ll be hell later on. Thatâ€™s that.
