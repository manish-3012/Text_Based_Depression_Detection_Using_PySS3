I'm fucked upI beat suicidal thoughts many times now and every time I feel better and want to live something inside me tells me to be suicidal again so I can fit in or some fucked up shit like that. It's almost like I like being suicidal and it's fucked up. I want to live but I subconsciously want to be suicidal everyday and I'm fucking done with this feeling. It feels like I'm with people that understand me when I'm like this. I don't want to die because I feel like it's an insult to my mom, she had two miscarriages before me. I want to die so I don't feel like a fucking failure piece of shit. But I want to live. I fucking hate myself. Fuck these feelings man.
