I'm simply tired of tryingI'm so fucking tired. Tired of being in pain. Tired of crying uncontrollably. Tired of asking for help and not getting it. Tired of being kicked while I am down only to be kicked again. Sometimes life likes to spice things up and add a sucker punch. So yeah,  I can't anymore. I only find peace and resolution in my plans to die. I havenâ€™t worked out the details well, shit, I haven't worked out even the major things, but the only thing that helps is feeling like I may get a break. A never-ending break from people and pain. God, can you imagine? No more? Just quiet, stillness or even nothing. I don't know. But I do know that I just want to go. 
I won't go in the next few hours, or days. I want to be sure to be successful. When my older sister once tried to kill herself and she ended up calling 911 after taking a shit load of drugs, legal and illegal, my mom called me to tell me about it. She assured me in a voice filled with disgust that my sister wasn't serious about killing herself, she just wanted attention since she called emergency services. 
I got the message: if you ever want to kill yourself, make sure you are successful. Wouldn't want to disappoint mother, now would we? 
Ugh. No wonder I am a fucking mess. But hey, not for long, right? Right.
