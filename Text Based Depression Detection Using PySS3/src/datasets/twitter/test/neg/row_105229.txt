Scared of what I might do...I need to just get this out. Before I start, let me just say Iâ€™m 19F who has struggled with s*lf h*rm, anxiety disorder, depression, &amp; suicide attempts for about 8 years now..

If I had the chance to end my life, I know I would. Knowing I would scares me so bad, but I canâ€™t tell my therapist. I have basically lost all my friends, Iâ€™m in an extremely toxic/abusive relationship, I cannot get my life together, basically have no family, and have panic attacks almost daily.. I cannot function due to my anxiety, and I truly mean that. My s*lf h*rm &amp; suicidal thoughts are at an all time high.

I feel so scared and alone in this world. I know I need to go back to the mental hospital but Iâ€™m taking college classes right now, and donâ€™t want to fall behind, again. I just want to be able to breathe, I want to be able to get out of my bed and have an amazing day. What do I do..?
