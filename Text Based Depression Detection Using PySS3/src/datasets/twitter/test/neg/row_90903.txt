FuckJust fuck everything. 

I wish I could explain myself properly. But I can't. Of course I can't.

Why is everything I do so *cringy*? Why am I such a fool?

Why am I still doing this? Still going? It's been 10 years. Surely that's enough? I know that this isn't working. I'm getting worse not better. It doesn't matter what I do, slowly but surely I always get worse. And now I'm completely cut off from the rest of humanity.

Sometimes I try and figure out the exact time where I passed the point of no return. Could I still have recovered 5 years ago? If I'd been quicker to tell people about my depression? What about 10 years ago, when my anxiety became depression and I watched as the colours drained out of the world? Was it already too late even back then?

It doesn't really matter. It's too late now.

Fuck it. I'll be dead within a month I reckon.
