I have my belongings packed, cleaned and organized. I have notes to everyone in my life with instructions on how to deal with the things left over. What things that heavily effect people in the event of a suicide am I missing?There's nothing that can deter me except for myself at this point. This is something that I have been heavily contemplating for a year now. 

I just want to make sure that there's nothing that I'm overlooking before the inevitable.
