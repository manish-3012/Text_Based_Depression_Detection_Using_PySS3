I want it to be the end.I am having a very difficult time.  I see my speck of a life in the scheme of the universe and I see how small it is.  My pain, my happiness, my relationships with others, their relationships with me, their pain if I were to commit suicide?  All so small in the scheme of things.  My suicide porn?  Pictures of the universe.   I look at a night sky and don't feel wonder, I feel small.  

It takes so much effort to do anything.  I am *tired*.  I've always been tired.  I'm tired, folks.  I think it may be time to lay down and sleep for good.  

Edit: I just want to make it clear, I'm not depressed in the traditional sense.  I have a great relationship with my boyfriend.  I function well around friends and family.  I meditate semi-regularly.  I'm just bone-fucking-weary and I can't get around this feeling of being so small, so lacking in importance.  I feel the same about *all lives*, not just mine.
