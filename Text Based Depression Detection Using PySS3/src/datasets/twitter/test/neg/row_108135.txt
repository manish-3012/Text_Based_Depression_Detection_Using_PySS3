This place is important to me. Thank you all.Iâ€™m very messed up just like many others. And stuff I canâ€™t tell to my friends (I donâ€™t want to burden them, I want to be a good part of their lives, because one thing asking help likeâ€™ man, Iâ€™m low in cashâ€™ or â€˜can you help me my car wonâ€™t startâ€™, and  itâ€™s one completely different thing saying â€˜I donâ€™t wanna live, Iâ€™ll probably kill myself until the end of the yearâ€™) same with parents and family in general (especially mine being very religious). I stopped going to therapy, it wasnâ€™t bad, I liked my therapist, but just waste of money for me (for my personality I guess), and also could never be 100% truthful, I would probably say I was depressed, but never suicidal, I tried twice and didnâ€™t warn her on neither occasions. 

So, yeah, this subreddit is an unique place, itâ€™s an important outlet, somewhat anonymous and I came here many times before in times of desperation. I still maintain that I probably wonâ€™t be alive until the end of year, but here is the only place I say it. 

I read many posts here, most I donâ€™t answer because Iâ€™m afraid that all I would be doing would be encouraging people to suicide, I will never do that, I do believe very much in freedom, thatâ€™s all. Wish you all the best. 
This was just a Sunday night rambling.
