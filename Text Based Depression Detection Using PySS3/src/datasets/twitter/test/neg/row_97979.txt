Hey...so i tried to off myself 2 days ago, and didn't succeed.. now what?okay, so i've been on and off with my mental health since i was 16 (i'm 22 now) and me and my boyfriend and i recently broke up. and i already dont' think i'm capable of making good decisions. when someone tells me they need space, i don't knwo how to give it to them, and i end up raging. like i kidnapped him in my car for 2 hours and then once i got home i tried to kill myself. i landed in the hospital for like a day and now i'm back home...and what have i been thinking of? my ex and how all i want to do is be with him again, and i know this whole thing (suicide as well) has hurt him and he needs time to heal from all that. and i don't know how to stop being so insecure with my relationships. and  how to not be so clingy... it's just so hard to. i feel like if i don't cling they will leave me. and now all it's done is push the one person i cared about so much so far away. i just want to rewind everything. any advice??
