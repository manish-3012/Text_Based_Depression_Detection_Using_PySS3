i just need somebody to talk to.ive never posted on reddit before, but im having a particularly bad day and i have nobody to talk to about it. i have really bad depression to the point that i consider suicide all the time, and recently with school, parents, and  having lost almost everybody important to me i feel lost. i want help so badly but nothing works, not therapy or anything seems to bring me out of this crippling depressive episode. my parents absolutely dont help, especially since they refuse to accept that the biggest problem has always been them. i know pretty much nobody gonna read this, and i understand its almost impossible to really care about a person whos a complete stranger to you.
