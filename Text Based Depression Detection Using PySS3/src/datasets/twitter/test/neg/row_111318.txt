Yesterday was supposed to be the day, but I hesitated. Tried seeking help but they don't listen.Yesterday was supposed to be the day I ended myself. In between the two weeks one of my friends got in contact with my ex saying "you should talk to him before it's too late, he hasn't been the same since the breakup". My ex was honest with me saying, she did indeed cheat on me and said she simply lost interest. She told me you have a lot ahead of me in the future, and maybe when I get out of my dark place we can talk again. She adds me on Facebook again, but puts me on her restricted list so I'm essentially unfriended again. I put her on my restricted list because she was making fun of my statuses behind my back I found out.

However a few days later she unfriends me saying "her boyfriend is skeptical that we're facebook friends again". But a friend...sends me a screenshot of a facebook group chat. The whole time she was just shit talking me saying I'm a failure and a psycho. She's such a mean spirited person...why do I miss her? I gave her so much benefit of the doubt because I knew she was hurt before we dated, but she's just so cruel. I still have feelings for her.

I was of course devestated, I went to two different therapists this week. One of them didn't seem to fucking understand my problems. The first one just gave me resources for AA, I said I don't drink multiple times. The second one I showed the text transcripts of her being emotionally and verbally abusive over 3 months, and he just goes "Oh that's not so bad" and I stormed out.

Yesterday, I was going to jump but I hesitated. I went the hospital saying I had an anxiety attack from a suicide attempt, and for some reason they just discharged me and I overheard the ER staff saying "I was just there looking for meds". If the motherfuckers saw my records the last time I came to that hospital was for suicidal ideation almost 15 years ago.

  
My family no longer is supportive and just brushes me off, my friends are at a loss what to do with me, and the healthcare field has totally failed me. I'm back to thinking I need to end it all again. Most of my final business has been dealt with but I never mailed out the notes because I didn't execute. I keep wavering on carrying out my plan, but I feel no future. Just pain and emptiness.
