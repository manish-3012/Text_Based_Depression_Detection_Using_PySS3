it's getting pretty badi don't have anything of meaning to say. i can't string words together prettily or convey my feelings with coherence, so i suppose this is just going to be a mess

i was stuck here for 20 minutes trying to write something else. i went blank. why can't i even write things down? i can't think straight, and when i try to translate my already incoherent thoughts to written words, i crumble. i have no way of letting things out

why am i alive? i feel so ungrateful for wishing i wasn't. i'd do anything if it meant somehow removing my existence from the memories of others
