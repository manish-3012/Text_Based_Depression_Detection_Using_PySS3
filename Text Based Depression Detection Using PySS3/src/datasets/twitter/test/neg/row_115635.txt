Everyday I wake up i feel empty inside.When ever i wake up i feel empty, when ever i do something i feel empty. My girlfriend kicked me out after 2.5 years, i'm forced to live in a basement, i was forced to move away from everybody i know to live with my dad. I have no life here, i have nothing. And i feel like there isn't any hope. Sometimes i think about jumping of bridges, or tall buildings, the wind might create something that would shine trough the emptyness? everytime i try to contact anybody about doing anything at all, they either can't or they cancel in the last second. This is happening so much so, that it just can't be coincidental anymore. I feel like bursting out in tears, but nothing. I've tried seeking help at the doctors, but that didn't do anything. I sometimes wonder if i just don't fit in, in this world. If there is a possiblity that i was born out of my time, or that my brain/soul whatever you wanna call it, just isn't. the same.. Like i truly feel like i don't belong here. Deep inside, i can feel everybody moving further and further away from me. slowly the lonelyness will be the only thing left in my life. The only time i ever have a tiny break from these thoughts is when im doing drugs. And even then, the euforia can't overturn the thought of not being right for this world.
