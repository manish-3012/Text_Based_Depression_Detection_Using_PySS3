I don't knowI'm just exhausted in every sense of the word. I'm a burden on everyone in my life. I have no friends to talk to about how I'm feeling (except my boyfriend bless his heart for trying but he can only do so much) and even if I did I couldn't because I just feel like I'm bothering people with my shit. I just want to end everything but I know it would hurt my boyfriend, my grandparents, my brother, and my mom. So then I feel guilty and punish myself in one way or another whether it's conscious or not. I feel guilty for everything. I feel guilty for existing. And I feel guilty for not wanting to exist. I'm so stuck.
