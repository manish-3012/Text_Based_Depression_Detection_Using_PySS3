I personally don't really care that much anymore. (Long read kinda)I'm thinking about actually making an attempt or at the very least I'm entertaining the idea. I'm not sure how to go about it though.

Do I jump off a bridge? Or jump into traffic? Hanging sounds too long. And I don't want to cut my wrists. I actually never thought about how, because I never thought that I'd actually do it. But personally I don't much care anymore. 

I guess it's really no one's fault, maybe it's just me. Maybe it's always been me. But regardless of who is at fault it doesn't really matter. I'm just done.
For some reason it reminds me of that movie from the 80s, "the only way to win, is not to play" lol war games reference. 

There's just nothing for me. Any joy I may have gotten from my interests or hobbies are gone. I play less video games and I even have to sometimes power through them even if I think that the games cool. I haven't read any poetry in years and if so extremely little. I no longer read or do any research on science, art, philosophy, history and so on and so on. I don't like TV anymore. Even shows I use to like just don't really hold me anymore. The people I know in my life, even the ones I like, either show up too little or just disappear for long periods of time. So our "friendship" is purely superficial and shallow at best. I just don't really care about them anymore but I don't hate them either.

I could go on and blah blah blah but it honestly doesn't matter in any way shape or form. I'm a little crazy anyway so it's whatever at this point. 

What ever I may have done to interest me or keep my attention or whatever lies people have told me and the lies I told myself just doesn't matter when you think about. Give me about a few decades and everyone will forget and move on and my "friends" and aquintences will move on as if nothing happened. 

Maybe a week or so they may talk about it for a little bit and gossip at work about it but after about a month or so...POOF.....like it never happened. 

I expect my family to mourn of course. My child will be too young to remember me. And later on down the road she'll see me in a picture or something and she'll know that I'm her father because someone told her. But everything I was will be stories or rose colored depictions. Or maybe not. Either way her life will be what it will be. With or without me.

It's kinda sad. But it's OK I guess. It really doesn't matter. Like at all.

I'm done. I'm tired. I'm disillusioned. I'm bored. I'm done fighting.  And I personally hate everything. 

I just want to rest. At least I'll finally get some sleep. The sun is too bright and New York is too loud.

Anyway. Thats my two cents. Pro tips are appreciated. 

Stay cool.
