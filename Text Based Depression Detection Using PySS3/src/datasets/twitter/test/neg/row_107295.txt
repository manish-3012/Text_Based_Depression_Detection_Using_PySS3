Requesting all counselorsThis isn't even a throwaway account but I have all the typical suicidal thoughts etc. One thing that frequently triggers them are jobs. Getting the same old "well you aren't going to like everyone you work with" or "work is work, its part of the real world" all that bullshit. I hate it, I don't want to put any effort in to living a pointless life but, I have a skill in wording. CONVINCING CHICKS FOR NUDES HMU. I thought about it and counselors get some decent pay. Not trying to be a dick but counselling isn't that hard. I find giving advice easy and I find talking one on one about a sensitive topic to be easy also. I reckon after a little bit of learning the right wording techniques I'd be pretty damn good at it. Should I pursue it? 

**TL;DR:** I have had my fair share of anxiety, suicidal thoughts etc, perhaps a job as a counselor is a possibility..?
