Text messaging/cellsMy co-worker constantly has his cell vibrating and ringing at work. 

He said to me " Nobody calls me when I'm not at work, they always call WHEN I'm at work."

I wish I was important enough to somebody to JUSTIFY owning a cell phone, let alone get to the point where I complain about them.
