Anyone ever feel completely unvalued?I've never had a single person in my life that every made me feel valuable. I genuinely feel like no one gives a fuck if I'm around or not. I don't know what to do at this point. No one sticks around long enough to become a friend that cares about me. I don't feel like there's a solution. I'm just tired of trying and getting the same results every time. Fuck. Is there any way to move forward?
