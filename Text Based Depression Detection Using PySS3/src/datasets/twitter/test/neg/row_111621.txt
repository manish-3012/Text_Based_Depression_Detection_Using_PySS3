I just stood with a ceramic knife in my hand thinking about how sharp it was. Thinking how little it'd hurt. But ended up stabbing the closest other thing which happened to be a carton of orange juice.I don't know how I am going to get to my goal of living till 21 like just under 3 years is a long tine to me. My medication isn't working and it would just be so easy to go. The knife would make a mess and would be traumatic for whoever found me but would this be a problem since I suddenly wouldn't have any responsibilities. I'm in two minds I just hope I don't literally become two minds; however that would be difficult because of the skull plus would die before getting all the way through. I'm fucked. My brain is fucked. The graphic imagery is all that can explain how I feel. I need to die!
