I (27M) finally felt the warm embrace of contentment wash over me.I was miserable for the past decade and a half; nothing in my life was ever a result of my choices, someone else decided who/what I am suppose to be. I never had any agency until now. THIS MOMENT RIGHT HERE. It lead me here to this moment, the moment I finally set the end into motion. 

I wish it didnâ€™t have to go this way; Iâ€™d much rather somehow erase myself from existence and not leave a corpse behind. My family inflicted a great deal of pain upon me, but I donâ€™t think that pain will compare to what Iâ€™m about to do to them. Iâ€™ve done my best to insure they donâ€™t find me but I guess it will be out of my hands once the deed is done. I donâ€™t want my parents to suffer, I just want them to forget I was ever here.

I have no one. No friends, no romantic interests, no one to miss me outside those whom I share blood with. Iâ€™ve never loved anyone, that feeling always eluded me. I had happy moments so it wasnâ€™t all bad. Iâ€™m grateful for the fleeting happiness I was able to capture as a child but I just donâ€™t see any on the horizon. 

I think Iâ€™ll binge some of my favorite movies, buy a few days worth of good food. Iâ€™ll probably try to break some ice with my parents, maybe get a general apology in for the completely shit disappointment I turned out to be. I feel pretty clear headed now so I should be able to say my peace without starting a fight. No more self-preservation or arguing to protect my ego. If they want to tear me to shreds one last time, so be it. After all that is done, itâ€™s curtain call for me.
