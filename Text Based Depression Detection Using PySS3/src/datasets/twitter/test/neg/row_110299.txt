Is there any adult here to talk to?I am a 22 yo guy who has a bad case of anxiety, and it is getting really hard to live due to 100 thoughts a day of impending doom. It is hard man, fighting those battles every day, because they put you down every time and many times you think you should just give up. I can't do this alone and therefore I am seeking help to get me through this, someone to talk to on a regular basis with whom I can open up to, since with regular friends I just can't. 

Help.
