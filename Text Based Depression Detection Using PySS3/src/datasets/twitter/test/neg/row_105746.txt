Pretty sure I'm going to hang myself.Listen, I'm not going to pretend like I'm a good person, so it's not like it's a big deal that I'm checking out anyway. I'm not going to pretend like I'm entirely alone either; I've got a few family members that I love and who love me back and I sure as hell hope they'll miss me, but I absolutely can't talk to any of them. Not about anything like this at least, but that really isn't their fault. And besides, I'd rather not drag any of them into more of my shit. I do that too much anyway. I know how much better off they'd be without me. I hate thinking about that, but its the fucking truth. I'm just an awful excuse for a human being and I'm tired of it. I've been wishing for a very long time that someone or something would just up and kill me.. And its taken me years to work up the courage to finally end it properly. I can't mess it up this time. I can't fail at anything else. No more lies coming out of my mouth either. No, none of that. I originally was gonna hold off until October 26th, but I don't think I can. I got my note written up on my phone, just need to make some minor tweaks and I'm good. Got to say goodbye to everyone then peace. I don't know why the fuck I wrote this all out. Maybe a sad attempt of a cry for help or just my last chance to finally be heard. I don't fucking know. Thanks for listening I guess.
