I don't know what to do I'm so overwhelmed I want it all to stop.....I don't know how much longer I can hang on.I am 49 I'm heavy in debt I have no money no food to last me more than a week. I am bipolar suffer anxiety and the covid19 has destroyed me financially I truly hope I get this virus and die from this so I don't have to take 100 xanaxs and 100 valium..mixed with a few others....it's 845am and all I can think about is wanting this over as quickly as possible....Not sure if I'm just scared of the eternal shame or just scared of the eternal abyss of what is ahead of me.
