Feelings, or lack thereof.I saw my doctor this morning. 
After quite a lengthy detailed chat, he asked if I could call my mother in (he saw us in the carpark outside when he pulled up).

He blindsided me.
He (with my "I have too much anxiety to say no" permission) essentially put me on suicide watch with my mother.
He told her all the details of the local hospital there &amp; gave her all the mental health help lines phone numbers. 

The long and short of it all.....

I can't continue taking any anti-depressants as they let me feel, and when I feel, I feel the hate and cannot handle the feelings. Which in turn causes me to hurt myself and want to die.

I've been off the pills for 3 days, and I'm supposed to go and see him again on Monday. 
He wants to do a mental health plan, and find me a psychologist immediately.

I'm 20FUCKING5, I live by myself and I'm on some sort of fucking real life suicide watch with my mother who's a narcissistic cunt.

So here I am again, begging internet strangers for a little love while I lay in bed bleeding, just to distract me enough from all the intrusive thoughts about how many ways I could kill myself in this house right now.

At what point is it okay to give up and just go, because there has to be one.
