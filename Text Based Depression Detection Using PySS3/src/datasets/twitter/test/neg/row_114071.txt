I sat on the tracks last night and it was the calmest feeling Iâ€™ve had in a very long timeLast night around 4am I decided to take my usual drives around for no particular reason other than just to escape my house. I parked my car at the park and wandered to the railroad tracks and stood there for awhile looking out over the river and cloudy moon lit sky.. I eventually just sat down and a few minutes later heard a train coming. Something in me had no desire to move, the vibration of the tracks and the oncoming distant horn was almost calming. I decided the get up and move shortly before it came around the bend and realized it could be that easy.. I only got out of the way because I feel like I wasnâ€™t ready to leave my family just yet, I need to have a proper good bye.
