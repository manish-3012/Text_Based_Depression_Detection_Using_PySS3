Need to get this outI don't feel good about myself. I feel stupid, less than, like I'm not good enough for anybody. Nothing I do will ever be good enough.  I feel like everything I do is being judged. I feel so awkward. I don't deserve to be happy. 

I'm so stressed...I can feel it in my shoulders and neck. I constantly am on the verge of tears. If anybody looks at me, I want to fight. I want to scream. 

I thought about killing myself again. It's been more frequent than ever. Just chugging all my prescriptions and waiting...it's tempting. But I know I would be called attention seeking. I don't want to hurt my family- especially my dad and sister. But it's so tempting. One of these days maybe the urge will be stronger than my want to protect my family from pain. 

Im used to these feelings...but I've always been able to dissociate. Always been able to go numb. Always been able to lose myself in my head- away from feelings. I don't know how to handle these constant invasive feelings. I know I will keep on going, I just wish it didn't suck so much. I want to go back to being numb. 


I know this is stupid...it just feels better to let it out. I don't have anyone to talk to.
