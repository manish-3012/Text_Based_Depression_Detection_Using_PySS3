60 day ruleThere is a 60 day rule at school. You can't cause trouble, get suspensions, etc.
What the 60 day rule means to me is that I have 60 days more or less to live. 

I've always knew I had to kill myself before graduation. There are many reasons:

- Waste time after high school

- No college because I don't know what to do

- Waste money and time at college costing thousands of dollars in debt

- get yelled at constantly for not doing anything with my life and mooch off my family to keep living

- I see no future in myself, at all.


No college, no job, no dream, nothing. It's not just because of my depression, I just don't see myself after high school.

I decided to kill myself before my high school graduation so that I feel like I haven't wasted 4 years or longer trying to survive for nothing. If I were to live on, living for a meaningless piece of paper with my name on it does nothing for me. Crossing that stage is like commitment, even though I know it's not. It's like taking a step into another direction. I don't want to put my foot in.
