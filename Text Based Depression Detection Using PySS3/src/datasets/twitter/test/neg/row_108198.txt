Iâ€™m seriously thinking about suicideIâ€™ve been broken hearted too many times. Iâ€™ve been abandoned, rejected, and non approved. This was the closest Iâ€™ve ever been to getting a girlfriend. Sheâ€™s so beautiful and sweet and she really likes me. Her mom recently discovered that I smoke weed and she thinks that Iâ€™m just some stoner loser teenager. She doesnâ€™t want me dating here daughter. Also I just found out that my long time best friend doesnâ€™t care about me anymore and that he just ignores me now. Itâ€™s my senior year and itâ€™s supposed to be great and fun, but itâ€™s been the most depressing year of my life. All of my real friends have left me and I feel that I shouldnâ€™t expand friend groups anymore. People just hurt me and disappoint me now. I canâ€™t handle this pain anymore, this is becoming too much. Itâ€™s about time that died. People donâ€™t need me and Iâ€™m better off not existing.
