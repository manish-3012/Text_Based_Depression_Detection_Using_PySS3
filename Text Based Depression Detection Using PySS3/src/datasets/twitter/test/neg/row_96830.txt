I'm a cop. I shouldn't want to end it.Every day I go to work feeling like it might be my last.

Not because of the dangers other people present, but because of my own insecurities.

I don't think it's only depression, though that is certainly a factor.

Some days I think it'd be better if I ended it all off-duty, with my personal firearm. I think about it far too often.

It's funny, isn't it? For years I have helped other people solve their life-or-death problems, but I'm powerless against my own.
