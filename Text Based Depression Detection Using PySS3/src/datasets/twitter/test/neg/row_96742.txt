ramblings from purgatoryI donâ€™t know if I will pursue medical treatment anymore for my physical conditions. Itâ€™s too frustrating for me to deal with. Iâ€™m not sure the 3 months I gave myself will change much of anything, and no point in wasting limited resources just to have them end up in the crematorium. I think I have already killed my self. I have distant and faint memories of the person I should have been, Iâ€™ve been killing that honestly joyful person, and I think I finished the job in my late teens or early twenties. So itâ€™s not suicide as I see it, but retribution for the slow death of an innocent kid.
