Keeping it inI can't help but not tell anyone what I feel. I detest nearly every single aspect of my life except my kids and ironically they are partially the reason I'm so close to ending my life. I'm so terrified of messing them up. I have no clue of how to do right by them and I'm terrified they'll end up like me and trust me, there no one I fucking hate more than myself. I have no one other than them in this world. I'm in a dead marriage with someone 7 years older than me and I have no other family. I have but a single friend but I hate unloading all this shit on him. He's already struggling himself, and I don't want make it worse. So far I'm doing a fairly decent job at hiding how I really feel but I'm scared of leaving people confused when I actually end it. I have just gone out and bought everything I need to go through with it. Gonna go with burning charcoal and letting the carbon monoxide do its job. I don't plan on doing it today or even next week but I feel like even going for 3 weeks is pushing it.
