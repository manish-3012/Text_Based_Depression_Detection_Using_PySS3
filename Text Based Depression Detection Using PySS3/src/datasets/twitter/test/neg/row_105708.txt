I need to dieGrandma is dying soon, I haven't wanted to live for 2 years now and now I don't actually want things to be better, I just want to fucking die. Fuck the future. Nothing will ever be enough to make me want to stay. Fuck living decades longer, every time I realize I'll potentially have to live for 70 or 80 more years I feel extremely suicidal and feel like killing myself or self harming. I wish the US had medically assisted suicide. If I can't kill myself then I'll self harm until I get brain damage or hurt myself so bad that I will die from it. My life will be constant self harm if I can't die. Why do they choose to keep my internal and external hell going when the best option is to put me down like a dying animal
