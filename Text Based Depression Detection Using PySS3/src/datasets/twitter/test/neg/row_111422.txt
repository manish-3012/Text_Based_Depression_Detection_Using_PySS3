Rational suicidei dont want to be here anymore. I just need the courage to do it. 

Edit: i feel very suicidal right now. I brought a rope to my room in case i wanted not to be here anymore. I have always been suicidal. It feels bad. I texted my ex-bf and told him i am at the end of my rope. No reply. I wont end my life to get back at him. He always was nice to me. I am just so hopeless right now.
