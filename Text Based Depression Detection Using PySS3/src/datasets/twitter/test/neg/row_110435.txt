The people who know me dont know meI would love for someone who knows me to ask if I'm alright and actually mean it.

So much of my energy is spent making sure other people are ok. I think it's because I know how I feel every single day, I wouldnt want anyone to feel this empty.

Everyone thinks I'm the happy go-lucky kinda guy,  I'm not. Everyday is filled with crushing depression, anxiety and lonelyness. I just hide it.
