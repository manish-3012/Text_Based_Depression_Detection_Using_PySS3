So, I did try to commit suicide.I waited till it was late, around 1:30 am. I grabbed the hose from the utility vac in the garage and some ducted tape. I parked my car in a wooded lane not far from from my house. I took a some blankets pillows, sleeping pills, dope, whiskey and good tunes. I sealed the the hose to the exhaust and ran the other end through the passenger window. I sealed all the the the the windows and vents. I got in and started the car. I kicked back at got to drinking and smoking. I must have passed out, but at some point I woke up. I have very little memory of these events. I remember a great journourney through forest, mountains and rivers on my hands and knees. I woke up in my bed with cops pounding at my door. I was taken into custody and driven to the hospital. There I was interviewed by several doctors and a psychiatrists, while vials of my blood were taken and tested. I was stripped of my clothing and belongings and put on oxygen. I was told I had ben certified and would be keep involuntarily in psychiatric ward for an undisclosed amount of time of time. I was keep there there for a week before I was release. So, beware of the consequences.
