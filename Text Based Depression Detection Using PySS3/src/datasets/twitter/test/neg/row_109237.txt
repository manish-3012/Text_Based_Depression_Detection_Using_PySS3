Euphemistic way of saying 'suicidal thoughts'?I kind of feel like I should mention how suicidal thoughts have been impairing my ability to concentrate so my tutor at college knows how depressed I've been and that I'm not just malingering or whatever when I say I need extensions, but I don't want to actually say suicidal thoughts cos that sounds heavy. What can I say instead? Thoughts of harming myself? Please help.
