I would never actually do it but...But I think about it every day. No matter how much I want to. No matter how much I try to convince myself that nothing matters and everyone is just atoms, machines and feelings are just an illusion. No matter how much I try to push people away or get close to people. No matter how good or bad of a person I think I am. No matter how depressed or apathetic I am. In the end, I won't be able to kill myself because I don't want to hurt my friends. 

I've already given up hope at long term happiness... I'm only 18 and I've already wasted my entire life. I put all my hopes in the navy, disillusioning myself that I was okay. Rationalizing to believe that I was never depressed, to try and think I was just trying to manipulate people and the things I did weren't out of pain. But when that same pain back I couldn't keep telling myself that everyone feels this bad at times. I couldn't keep telling myself that inviting death was normal. And it finally hit me that I would no longer be able to pass a polygraph test. I would live a life of extreme stress from both the lifestyle and the lie. So I gave up on free college, after having thrown all my other options out. 

Why bother trying to be happy? Happiness and hope lead to disappointment and pain. The best I can hope for is long term apathy. Drugs, counselors, friends, work, vacation... it's all the same, and nothing will bring lasting happiness. I am not one of the people who can truly conquer depression. For me, I can only truly ever cope. I have been haunted by depression every year of my life for at least the past seven years, and have had very bad anxiety about as long as I can remember, which has only gotten worse with time. 

I don't even know why Im writing this because I can't envision any reply really helping the situation.
