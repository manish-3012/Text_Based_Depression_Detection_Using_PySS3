kinda dont wanna be alive anymorei am undiagnosed with mental illness but iâ€™m pretty sure i have borderline and maybe other stuff (anxiety, childhood trauma, yknow) and i cant afford a therapist. iâ€™m also petrified of death and the idea of killing myself makes me really nervous but i am so fucking suicidal. i have breakdowns every few days and literally anything can set me off. i cut myself and hit myself and slam my head into the wall and cry for hours and it sucks and i have no one i can talk to. mh boyfriend says i can talk to him but all he says is â€œiâ€™m sorryâ€ whoch is fine because heâ€™s not my therapist but goddamn it hurts to be like â€œiâ€™m having a really hard time right now i am close to committing suicideâ€ and then having that person say â€œiâ€™m sorryâ€ like yea. i get it there isnt a good way to respond to that but every single time iâ€™m upset in any way itâ€™s always â€œiâ€™m sorryâ€ and goddamn does that hurt. i want to stay alive for the sake of my siblings and boyfriend and dog but i hate being alive so much and i am so stressed because iâ€™m about to basically be a parent for my siblings and i have to continue my semester at college from home and iâ€™m suicidal like every 3 days and the pressure is already getting to me. hell, when i was at school without all these extra stressors i was having huge freakouts about once per week. iâ€™m so drastically up and down its scary and iâ€™m becoming more and more violent with myself that iâ€™m scared of what iâ€™ll do. but god i sure know that i don't want to be alive anymore. i have people who say that they can listen to me but i donâ€™t even have anything to say and iâ€™m so fucking scared iâ€™m being abusive and guilt trippy and im so scared everyone is going to leave me and i canâ€™t afford therapy and iâ€™m scared iâ€™m gonna be hospitalized and also the suicide hotline fucking blows. the last time i tried to use it i told the lady what was wrong and she was like â€œwow.. that sucksâ€ yea i know it really sucks that absolutely did not help me at all. therapy has been awful for me too because when i was 16 i went to this shitty therapist who told me nothing was wrong with me even though i self harm and am suicidal and have intense reactions to minor things and severe rejection sensitivity and yea. God i want to be dead so bad but iâ€™m so scared to kill myself and basically? iâ€™m very depressed
