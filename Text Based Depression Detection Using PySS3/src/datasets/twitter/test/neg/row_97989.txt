I just can't anymoreI don't know what to do, at this point I'm just drowning. I have a bright future ahead of me and all I need to do is perservere being in my hometown for a few months but that's damn near impossible when being in my childhood home and every corner of this entire town reminds me of something terrible that's happened.

I have the love and support of many, something I never had before and I'm still struggling to continue forward. 

I always say the sun shines tomorrow but I really don't know if it does.
