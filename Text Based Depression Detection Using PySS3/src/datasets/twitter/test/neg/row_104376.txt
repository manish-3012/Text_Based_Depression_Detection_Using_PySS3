I'm not a regular here anymore, I just want to say a few words (not suicidal)My family has been persecuted by the communist party. I went through 2 famines. My parents have went through even more. Not to mention my grandparents, who were of farmer families and suffered greatly during Stalin's rapid industrialization, and their whole life has been one big famine. I've went through through three digit inflations... two times. And looking at the front page of this subreddit, none of that is impressive. I've never lost a family member, always had a roof over my head and a warm (relatively :/) bed.

I've read through the front page posts for an hour now, and I was reminded as to why I stopped being a regular here anymore. It's because it can simply crush the good day you're having, beat up the little happiness and satisfaction you have left, and flush all your values, all your goals, all your purposes down the drain. It's not that I don't want to help anyone, but whenever I start reading this subreddit, I feel like shit - as if my life is spiraling downwards, each turn tighter than the last one. Makes me feel as if someone tied me up on a car on a highway, making my face scrape the asphalt.

Thus, I want to thank all the mods and the regulars for this subreddit. I've never been good with words, so it's rather hard to express myself, but I assure you - the amount of work and the good you do is greatly appreciated. I'm happy there are people out there that have a robust enough spirit not to be put down by all of this. I'd love to be one of them, but alas ...

And this is exactly the point of this post. I do not mean to steal the airtime from the people that need help here, but the people putting energy and effort into this subreddit should definitely be acknowledged and praised. Toast to you, champs.

And to the ones that are here to be helped out - stay strong.
