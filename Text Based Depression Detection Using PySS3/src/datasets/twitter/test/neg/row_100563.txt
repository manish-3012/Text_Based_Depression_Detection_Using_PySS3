To everyone who has helped someone here on SW, thank you.This is the third or fourth time I've stumbled into your subreddit, and I feel that the work you guys do is the greatest thing you can possibly do for another human being.

By now you guys have not only saved countless lives, but have also put people on the road to living life to it's fullest.

The patience, support and understanding you provide to people, no matter how frustrated, exhausted or scared you become with the varying needs and particulars of every single person who comes to you in their hour of need is something each and every one of you should take pride in.

With every ounce of my being I commend both the individual and combined efforts of everybody who is part of the [/r/SuicideWatch](/r/SuicideWatch) subreddit. For many people,  you are a light in times of darkness, and a beacon of hope in an otherwise bleak sea of dysphoria.

I wish I could shake the hand of each and every one of you individually and tell you, leaving not even the most miniscule shred of doubt, that you have done something truly, truly incredible, rekindling the drive that had petered out of the hearts and minds of those in need.

To everyone who has ever ventured into this glowing example of unwavering benevolence, I plead that true happiness will come your way.

**Thank you**
