Been going through tough things for a while and lurked here for a hour. I wanted to say thanks.Been depressed and suicidal for around ten years. had a rough night tonight, was suicidal, and found this place. read a few posts and comments and felt better. while the things i read don't specifically apply to my circumstances it felt good to read them and made me hopeful. thanks for being here.
