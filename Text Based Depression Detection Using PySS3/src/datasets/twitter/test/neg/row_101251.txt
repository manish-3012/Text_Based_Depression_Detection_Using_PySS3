I've spent so long hurting people, all I want to do is hurt myselfFor the last few months I've been a shut in for various reasons. Mainly confidence and paranoia. I've been living with my girlfriend who I deeply love and would never want to harm in anyway. She has to deal with all my shit and in hindsight I hate myself for what I've put her through. She recently left me and although she's been great since I can't help but feel I've ruined the best thing that's ever happened to me. I don't expect her to come back to me and she's that amazing a person I could not expect her to do anything but go on to live an amazing life. I just feel that my life is never going to be as good as the best times with her. I just want to go out peacefully without anyone hurting anymore.
