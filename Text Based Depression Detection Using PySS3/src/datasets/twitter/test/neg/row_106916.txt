Bombed my finals because I'm stupid and useless.I needed a 75 or so to pass one class and I'm almost certain that I didn't get it. Another class I straight up had no chance to pass. The third one I did poorly on and I don't know if I will pass that class either. The fourth final is tomorrow but I know very little of the material so I'm probably going to fail that one too. Guess it's time to kill myself. If I fail out of school, I will 100% commit suicide. This is my only option. If I fail, then I become a menial laborer like my parents and I'm doomed to continue failing. Honestly I might just do it now to save everyone the tuition money next semester.
