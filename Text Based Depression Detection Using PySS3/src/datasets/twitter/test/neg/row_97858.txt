Think my relationship is ending and cannot see any future after itOld, obese man.  Partner is working in health care, losing her mind, trying to take classes, and, oh, yeah, her best friend is dying of Huntington's with no money to pay for a care facility.  

Which leave zero margin of error for me to live in.  And our house is a horror show.

I got nothing left.  Pills for the mess; firearms for efficacy?
