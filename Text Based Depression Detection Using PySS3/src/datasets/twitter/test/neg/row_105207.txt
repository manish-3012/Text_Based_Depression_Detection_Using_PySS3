Suicidal SonI have an emotionally disturbed son who has been living with me for 10 moths.  He has not been able to get a job because he has terrible mood swings.  The other day he sent me a picture from a very high building hinting that he wanted to jump.  He did not jump, however when he came home we had a talk.  

I should also state that I have a girlfriend who has told me that I should kick him out.  I am in my 70's and my son is in his 40's, and I want to enjoy the rest of my life with my girlfriend rather than worry about whether or not my son is going to kill himself.  I feel that he is old enough to take care of himself by now.

My girlfriend, who is a recovering alcoholic, says that my sons's mood swings and depressions will drive her to drink, and I don't want that to happen.  The last time she was an alcoholic, I had to kick her out because of her violent behavior.  

I have threatened to kick my son out twice, but after discussions have decided to let him stay.  His last hinted suicide attempt was two days ago.  Tonight, I wanted to be alone with my girlfriend, so I told him that he cannot come to dinner with us.  I would like nothing more than to live my life with my girlfriend without the baggage of my son.

What should I do about his behavior?
