I donâ€™t know what memories are real and what memories are fake and itâ€™s driving me to suicideI think I have ocd and I suffer from one type called false memory ocd, itâ€™s basically your brain telling you that you did stuff that you didnâ€™t do, I donâ€™t know what actually happened and what my brain is making up. If I actually did some of these unspeakable things then I should probably just go kill myself because I donâ€™t deserve to live
