VentIâ€™ve had a lot of stress and fear lately. I feel like I wonâ€™t be validated by my friends and family, family specially. If friends donâ€™t accept me for who I am, then I can just call the friendship quits. If your family doesnâ€™t accept you, you canâ€™t just end a family, you are stuck with them forever. I feel like nobody in my life will validate me and Iâ€™ve started self harming again. This is not okie dokie. I need help, but I hate talking about how I feel, because the way I see it, if me hurting hurts you, why even talk about anything at all? I know that this isnâ€™t a good mindset, but thatâ€™s the way I see it, Iâ€™ve always hated asking people for help, â€œI can do this on my ownâ€ I always think, â€œIf I ask for help, I will be nothing but a burden on them, me and me alone.â€ Thatâ€™s just the way Iâ€™ve always seen things, and Iâ€™ve tried therapy, and I despise it. I know itâ€™s supposed to make you â€˜feel betterâ€™ and â€˜itâ€™s the best for youâ€™ but I donâ€™t care. I hate talking about how I feel, and thatâ€™s it. Most days, I feel like Iâ€™d be better off dead, no one being bothered by my stupid shit, a waste of space on this planet. Iâ€™m fat and I know it. My mother tries to convince me that Iâ€™m not, but I know sheâ€™s just trying to make me feel better. Iâ€™ve decided that Iâ€™d I eat a lot less, then it will help and will be the main helper in the weight loss process.
