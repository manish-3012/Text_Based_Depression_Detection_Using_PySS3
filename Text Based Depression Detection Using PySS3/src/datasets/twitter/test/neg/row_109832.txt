My mom and my dog are the only reasons I'm still here.I just need to vent because my mom will have a panic attack if I tell her I'm gonna kill myself.

I was abused as a child. My father was a piece of shit and I'm gonna leave it at that. I developed depression and anxiety because of it. I've been depressed and anxious since middle school. Had very few meaningful relationships and the only friends I made were because I did drugs with them. Before drugs I literally spent all of my time playing video games. Still no meaningful relationships and no girlfriend so I was very lonely.

I went to a decent engineering college but my anxiety worsened and so did my depression. Almost got a girlfriend but sabotaged it like usual. My first suicide attempt I called my mom and she talked me out of jumping off my 17 story dorm building. I dropped out of school and got help. Finally lost my virginity at 20 and started feeling better about myself. Went back to school, worked my ass off,got a dog, got a girlfriend, got a job at an animal hospital, and then my life collapsed again. Dropped out and moved back home. 

Worked at the family restaurant and fucking hated myself. I was still taking antidepressants but decided to try therapy too. Couldn't stand any of the counselors I went to so I gave up. Second suicide attempt I downed a bottle of whiskey and a bottle of pills but I freaked out halfway through and made myself throw everything up. I made some friends and started going out and drinking/doing coke with them. Sent me into another depressive episode. Spent my 24th birthday sitting alone on the beach at night with a razor blade in one hand and a bottle of whiskey in the other. Reached out to my ex to see if she would take my dog after I was dead and she talked me out of it.

I moved to Atl in hopes of going back to school but discovered that my dad withdrew one of the student loans he took out for me without telling me, the payment defaulted, and now I owe the school $20,000 if I ever want to go back to school. It's a long story but everything he did was legal so he just fucked me because I was stupid enough to trust him at the time. Now I'm thousands of dollars in debt, I just got fired from my job because I was so miserable, I have -$200 in my bank account and my car payment is coming up. I doubt I'll even be able to pay for my meds this month. I'm hungry and I just want to fucking die.

I can't find the strength to kill myself though. I've started looking for people to take my dog so he has a home after I'm dead but the thought of losing him outweighs any thought of suicide. It would break my mom's heart too. She helped me through this and cares about me. But I wake up every morning wanting to die. I'm numb. My world is grey. I'm trying to get a job so I can fucking eat again but I'm struggling and I don't know what to do.

I don't care if nobody reads this, I just needed to get it off my chest.
