History repeats itself. And makes me wanna shoot back pills and call ot there.(On mobile)

Life just feels like its on repeat. Like nothing matters. Whats the fucking point. 

A year ago my life came crashing down. I broke up with a long term girlfriend. Told her so much bad shit all cause i was scared to stay close to her and see her with someone else. We broke up cause i moved away. 

I started talking to a girl i had known for years. She was basically my childhood friend/first love kinda person. We distanced when i moved away but since i had just moved back we got close again. We ended up confessing some really deep feelings for each other. How we had both loved eachother for so long but tried to forget eachother by dating others. It worked for the most part. But the moment we saw eachother feelings came back. We ended up having sex. Both our first time. It all seemed to be going well, then the next day she hit me with.

 "You are just a one night stand, you're never gonna be anything else to anyone else."

That fucked me up, i felt like i could never trust someone as much as i did her ever again. The same day the girl i broke up with attempted suicide. I had blamed myself for so long tbat it was all my fault. Next day 3 people who i thought were close friends said they never liked me and just wanted to make me feel special. 

3 things like that back to back. Fucks with your head permanently. I was starting grade 11. Dropped out within 2 weeks. And isolated from everything. I only talked to the 2 friends i managed to keep around. But even they never initiate conversations nowadays, always me. I took a what was meant to be 8 week therapy program for troubled youth. 

Covid made it about 3 months longer, which i thought was for the best. And it was. I finished it in june. Feeling relatively stable. But the past 2 months have been hell. Even though i stopped blaming myself for my exs suicide attempt. Those thoughts of being a terrible person stayed around. The thought of ill never be loved by someone like i loved the girl from last year stayed. And i still never get talked too. No one wants to engage with me. Ive tried putting myself out there.

3 weeks ago i fucked up again tho. I had sex with another girl. A friend of my sisters this time. All seemed to be going well. 

We talked alot after, saying how we always felt tense around eachother. Like we felt connected in a way. We have been talking for a good while but then she hit me with. "Im moving away to (city) to be with the person i like." She had literally just met this guy. And already moved on, like i never existed. I love this girl tho, she hangs with the wrong crowd and it scares me. She is gonna get hurt really bad at some point. And i cant bear to see  that.

She didnt say it, but she indirectly reiterated that im always gonna be nothing more than a cheap hookup who is gonna be forgotten.

I have nothing, no job, friends who wanna talk to me, stable family. Nothing. I have been planning my suicide for 2 weeks now. And after what this girl just told me tonight, id say there is about 2 days till i snap. Either walking too the bridge nearby or overdosing on my adhd meds.
