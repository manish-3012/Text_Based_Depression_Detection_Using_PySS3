I think it is finally time to goI have been struggling for so long with my family life, keeping stable friendships, my self esteem, school and my mind which seems like a big chaotic mess. I try so hard and yet everyday it seems to get worse and I get better at hiding it. I tried to kill myself before by overdosing but I think subconsciously I backed out. Im smart and I knew how much I needed to take to have fatal effects and yet I only took half and only made superficial cuts- yes they were all the way up my arms, getting deeper and deeper but they werenâ€™t fatal. Itâ€™s hard for me to make a decision without feeling a pit of anxiety so I donâ€™t know if this is the best choice but no one seems to hear me when i feel like i am screaming for help. I am going to get high as fuck and jump off a cliff. I live by the seaside so I guess its a nice way to go when all this place has done is cause me trauma and depression. I know a lot of people say this but No One Understands. I cannot explain my mind and the shit it goes through everyday and I can see that logically if i take my life i will stop feeling pain. I know i may miss out on my birthday and christmas and new years but if i stay and im let down it would hurt even more. Its obvious to me that i have lost everyone who gave a shit due to my own actions and I have to take accountability and I know the only way i can make any of this better is by dying.
