My gf of two years says sheâ€™s going to kill herselfMy girlfriend and I are about a thousand miles away at our respective parentsâ€™ houses for christmas. She has been distant for a few days and today she finally told me why, because she wants to die. 


I fly back a few days after her, and we both stay at my place. She keeps saying that she will have all of her stuff out of my place before Iâ€™m back, and that she will be gone by then. 

Iâ€™ve tried talking to her about it and begging her not to but she is still insistent. I know that if I tell her mom she will hate me and probably break up with me. But Iâ€™m at the point where I donâ€™t think I have any other options. 

She is my literal world and if she goes I donâ€™t know how I would manage. Part of me would die with her.
