Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯I donâ€™t want to enter 2018. I donâ€™t want to live anymore. I donâ€™t want to go on with life anymore. I canâ€™t continue living. I have no future. I will never be accepted by my family. I will never be able to get a job. I canâ€™t afford to transition. I donâ€™t want to live like this. Everyday I cut myself because I canâ€™t stand living like this. Itâ€™s been this way for a long time. I just want it to end. I canâ€™t get out of this. I canâ€™t stop feeling this way but I cannot transition. I canâ€™t afford it. And no one has and ever will accept me. Iâ€™m just s freak. I hate my body. I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m going to go buy what I need to do this. I donâ€™t want to enter 2018. I canâ€™t enter 2018. Iâ€™m
not a real girl. Iâ€™m not good enough for anyone. Iâ€™m just a fake and everyone knows it and I canâ€™t live like that. Iâ€™m another statistic  Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ but I donâ€™t care.

bye
