Why do I feel this way?Help others before me. I'm low priority, others need your help more. Don't let someone else get hurt. I'm probably not worth saving.



Why do I feel like this? Why do I feel suicidal? It's not a good feeling. I should be happy. I really should. I've got a loving girlfriend and a stableish life. Things seem to be okay. But I still get the feelings, they've been happening more and more. They stopped after my last attempt but now they are worse than ever. I can't get the thought out of my head. I'm worried I'll do something tonight and the little bit of me is saying I shouldn't. But the rest of me is saying I should. I'm going to do something I will regret. I know it.



Final edit: it's all okay now. I hurt myself a little and that made me not sad as much. Deleting topic. I'll be fine
