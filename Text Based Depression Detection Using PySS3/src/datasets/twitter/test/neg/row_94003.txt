Random thought: "I'm tired of survivingâ€¦ i wanna die, just let me die"I had that thought yesterday while my family was yelling to me because i don't do anything besides sleeping and using my phone. They know i'm emotionally broken, but still complaining.
I'm 20 years old with a lot of potential but not opportunities.
