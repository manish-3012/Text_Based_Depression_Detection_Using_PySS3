y'all mind if i post a shitty, cringy poem i wrote?i saw the light 

so many times

but it was never mine.

my silent screams,

my ruthless nights

from which i couldn't hide.

all i have left

is the sharp pieces

of broken dreams.

even though

i bleed out

every time i tried,

this time i must

embrace them tight

to free my mind.

now that everything is dark

i can't see the meaning

of having a sight.

why do i have to get a grip

i was, i am and i'll always

be a creep.

forget the secrets

that you swore to keep.

forget me before 

my eternal sleep.
