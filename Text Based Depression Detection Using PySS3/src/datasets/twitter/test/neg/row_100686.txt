I have a good, prosperous, and promising life. But after 8pm I don't want to be alive. After 8pm I look at the 200+ tramadol capsules on my desk and wonder.My girlfriend left me and I can't move on. She just left, she didn't say why. I'm 21, I'm a campus celebrity who gets a first in every test he does. I'm also a bodybuilder and get a lot of attention for it. Believe it or not I'm also an esports player. But what's the fucking point?

For the past 5 months I've laid awake every night thinking about her. How long do i have to endure such crippling loneliness? Yeah im popular, but im lonely wherein I only want to see her. I don't care about anyone else, not even myself, if she asked me to kill myself for her I might just do it. 

Though to be honest I might as well now, would at least help me to get sleep for once. Pain isn't an issue with the ridiculous amount of opioid painkillers I've got, I'd be a potato in minutes, the drawback of killing myself is how my mum and dad would feel.

I don't talk to my parents about things. I used to talk to my girlfriends mum. I want to. But  I can't. She blocked me. The problem that is me went away for her. Why can't I block myself? Can i block life? I'm going to die one day anyway, why not now? 

I don't think I could commit suicide, but if i could prevent my own murder I definitely would not. Although being blackout drunk might facilitate tramadol for dinner.
