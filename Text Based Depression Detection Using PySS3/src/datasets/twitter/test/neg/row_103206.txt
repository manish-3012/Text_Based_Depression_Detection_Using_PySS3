I believe God overestimated how much I can bear...Too many things to hate when I look in the mirror... too many negative thoughts to combat in my mind, one irreconcilable wound to the heart is too much let alone multiple that I will have to bear the rest of my life.  Despite this, I managed carry on creating joy in the lives of people around me.  Girls say they really like my smile.  Parents tell me I would make a great father.  I was able to experience more adventures around the world than most people could dream of.  In the end, none of it matters when you've got no one to grow old and reminisce with.  None of it matters when you're not capable of creating and truly accepting joy for yourself.  The universe legitimately conspired against me and it got the last laugh.
