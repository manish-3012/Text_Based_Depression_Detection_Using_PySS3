my sibling is suicidal again and i dont know what to domy sibling is suicidal. how can i help them?

we found out my sibling is suicidal again. we want to get them help but they freaked out last time that happened. but they need some help. 

they dont know that i know and i was told not to let my sibling know that i know. in what ways can i help them out now? i donâ€™t know what to do and my family is worried

i dont want to make it obvious that i know whatâ€™s going on in case they freak out, and iâ€™m a generally quiet person so i donâ€™t want to push too much suspicious random support, but i still want to support them. i really dont know what to do right now. i think my parents are gonna help to take care of it but what can i do to help
