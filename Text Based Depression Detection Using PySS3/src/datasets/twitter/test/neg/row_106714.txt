I can't do this anymoreObjectively, I have a pretty good life. I have a lot of acquantices, a couple good friends, a boyfriend and a family who loves me. Yet, I feel so lonely, no one knows how hopelessly depressed I am. I think about suicide everyday. I feel terribly lonely, because I can't truly open up to anyone. I just feel like a burden to everyone around me. I feel like people are lying when they say that they like me. I can't believe anyone would like me. I should just throw myself off a building so no one would have to put up with me anymore.
