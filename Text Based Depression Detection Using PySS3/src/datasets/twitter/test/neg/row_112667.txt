i dont want to die, but i feel like i'll always be brokenive been seen a therapist and she says theres nothing wrong if im functioning the way i am. i do things, i see people. but i dont like myself, i think about hurting myself all the time. i cant stop thinking about killing myself and i dont know what to do. ive been like this for years and i dont want to live a whole life this way. im scared.
