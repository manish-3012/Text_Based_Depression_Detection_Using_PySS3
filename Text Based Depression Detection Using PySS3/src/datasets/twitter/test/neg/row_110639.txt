Thoughts?I'm narcissistic, toxic and abusive, obviously not of my own choice or I probably wouldn't be aware of what I'm doing and continue to do it. I know I could probably get better and get help if i just tried but killing myself is way easier. I understand people would be sad I just don't really care and besides I wouldn't be there to experience it anyway so whatever. The fact that I'd be dead really does it for me, I don't have to face any consequences for anything I just get to quit. I know its shitty.
