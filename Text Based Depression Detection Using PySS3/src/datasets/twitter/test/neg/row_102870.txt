first postI really just need anyone to listen.

I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m posting this, Iâ€™ve never called a hotline or posted anything like this but Iâ€™m so stuck. Iâ€™ve been on a ton of meds, done therapy, outpatient, and tried tms (had to go 5x a week to a dr for 8 weeks) and it did absolutely nothing. Iâ€™m still doing as bad as I was 7 years ago, if not much worst. I started to hurt myself again a couple of months ago after not having done so for a couple of years and I have gotten the closest I have to killing myself recently. I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m saying all of this, but Iâ€™m still too scared to attempt. 

I found out my boyfriend of one year who I think means well has been gaslighting me for a while but I have no one else so I donâ€™t know what to do. Heâ€™s going into the military within the next two months but I donâ€™t know what I should do now or when he leaves. I have no life and Iâ€™m way too depressed to have any hobbies, although Iâ€™ve spent so much money just trying to find something I enjoy. I have one friend I just hang out and smoke with, but absolutely nobody else and my family isnâ€™t helpful. 

I am in such unbearable pain and I have no idea what to do anymore. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever get better. Whenever I see stories of people who have improved, what they describe is not close to what I go through. I know there are people out there like me (this subreddit is one of the few places I see that) but what are people like us supposed to do, the ones who are in insurmountable pain and canâ€™t go on? I have said this to a few people before but I truly donâ€™t think weâ€™re all meant to live. Iâ€™ve always said the reason you donâ€™t hear about people who have depression as bad as I do is because theyâ€™re all dead, you just donâ€™t hear about the people who donâ€™t make it. I wish I had the will to live, or at least had functioning depression. My mind is torturing me and I seriously canâ€™t take it. I donâ€™t know who to go to and I know nobody has any answers, but I just need any answer. 

Iâ€™m so scared to die but I canâ€™t put up with this pain any longer, it just feels like Iâ€™m existing until I get pushed over the edge. I donâ€™t have much of a future and am a complete burnout. Iâ€™ve been out of work for 4 months but Iâ€™m too depressed to apply for temporary disability. Anyways, if you read this much, thank you. Itâ€™s cathartic for me to get this all out without feeling fear that people will think Iâ€™m being over dramatic. I know people like me who read this will know exactly how it feels. I appreciate anyone listening to me or just letting me shout into the void because I canâ€™t keep it all inside, I just need to make it stop. Next stop may be ect if I give up on life that much and then possibly suicide if that doesnâ€™t work, I just wish things didnâ€™t end up this way for me.
