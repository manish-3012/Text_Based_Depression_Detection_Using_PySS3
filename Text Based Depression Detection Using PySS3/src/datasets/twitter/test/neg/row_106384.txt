Anyone else feeling suicidal over their student loans?My last little bit of optimism just went down the drain. I can't bring myself to ask for better hours without my mind pulling up the litany of ways that I've fucked up and don't deserve to work the shifts that actually make money. The other place where I thought I might get treated better specifically requires a bartending license (my unwillingness to get one being one of the major reasons I'm pretty sure I'm no longer getting good shifts at my current job). My student loans never responded to my request for forbearance to try and start repaying again, and there's no way I can pay over $1,400 for the couple months that I skipped repayment. My parents are mad at me because my delinquent loans are getting in the way of them getting loans to fix up the house.

Tonight, I really feel like I'm never going to get my life on track, like maybe my folks should just get to collect my life insurance pay out and use that to pay off these mother-fuckers. But I don't see any way out of this financial ruin other than that. I'm never going to make enough money to repay them, but if I off myself and my parents collect my life insurance, maybe they can get out of the hole that my useless fucking degree and susceptibility to pro-college propaganda got all of us into.

It's a pretty fucked up thing about our country: That I honestly see suicide and a life insurance payout as the only way out of my student loans fucking things up for the rest of my family.

I don't have a plan or anything. Worst-case scenario, I wouldn't do anything until I've got a few days off (how fucked up is that? My shitty job is a big part of why I'm suicidal, but I don't want to *inconvenience* them by making them cover my shifts if I just get myself institutionalized after a failed attempt, or worse: Get fired for a no-call-no-show because I was held for my safety and then have to start job-hunting with that on my resumeâ€¦). In all honesty, I don't think I could even go through with anything: I can imagine the pain I would cause to the people I care about, the disruption I would cause to the lives of people I like. I don't want my friends and family to suffer after I do something rash. I just don't see any other way out of this misery and this horrible, crippling debt.
