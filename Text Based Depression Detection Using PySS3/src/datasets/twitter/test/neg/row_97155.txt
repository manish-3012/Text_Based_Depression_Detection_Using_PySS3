Fuck it I'm doneI don't see the point anymore.

I'm going to steal a gun from my dad, drive into the woods until I run out of gas, find a beautiful tree, sit down against it, and shoot myself in the fucking head.

I won't bother saying goodbye. If I do, it will just delay it for another miserable fucking day.

I want it to be done. I'm tired. I've been tired all of my life.
