Iâ€™m not scared anymore and that scares meDriving down the highway having visions of cutting into my skin. 

Standing in front of rope at Home Depot, debating what to do. 

I want to but I canâ€™t somehow, maybe because suffering is what I know, maybe because itâ€™s somehow better than dying. 

Iâ€™m in constant pain and I hate myself so deeply, I donâ€™t think it can be fixed. I lie. I lie all the goddamn time, and itâ€™s so easy itâ€™s become nature. Iâ€™m walking around in this shell, hating the very thing that keeps me walking, that keeps me breathing, that keeps me... me. Fuck it all.
