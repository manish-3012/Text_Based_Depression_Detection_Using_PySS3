Never sharing depressing or suicidal thoughts with anyone I know.Everyone either reacts with absolute horror and says things like "Don't kill yourself!! You have so much to life for!!! Think about your family and friends!!! You'll miss out on so much if you kill yourself!!!!! I'd be sad if you died!!!!!" or I get people telling me "Stop being overdramatic, you're just a teenager so you can't have depression. Get over it. Try bring happy".

And everyone likes telling me how I should reach out if things get bad or if I need any support, but how does telling me "well don't hurt/kill yourself" or "just be happy" help? It only manages to make me feel worse than I already felt before.

God, I'm so sick of this.
