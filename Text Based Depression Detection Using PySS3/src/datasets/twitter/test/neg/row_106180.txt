I can't stop crying and having intense, invasive suicidal thoughtsLike, if I think about it rationally, I don't "want" to kill myself, but it's like my brain definitely does. And there's just so many issues I'm trying to deal with right now and failing at all of them and I know most of my coworkers hate me and I tried to tell a couple of my friends how I feel and either they don't care or I'm just completely failing to communicate properly which is nothing out of the ordinary and I just want it all to go away.
