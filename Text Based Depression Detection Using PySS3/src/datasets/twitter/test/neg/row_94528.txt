Sorry if this is the wrong sub but dont know what to do anymoreIv'e been feeling down for a long time now, resonantly start smoking to help me deal with everything. Start self-harming and dont know what to do with my life. I feel like everything's falling apart.

Since the start of last year i feel like everything's gone down hill, i've lost all of my friends and i've had to move away to go to University. I made friends up here but i dont really speak to them. I cant do anything I dont see the point in trying anymore. I just feels like whenever i try theres always something els, and it just piles on. Dont know who to turn to for help. I know my family loves me but i've never been an open person. I dont like talkng about my feelings so i just bottle it up, its made me lose people ive been friends with since forever. i dont think im a good person anymore.

All this has left me completely out of character i dont feel like the same person anymore. Its showing in my grades and im failing Uni. I spend most nights and days in bed, i cant sleep and just open my window and smoke. I've gone from an A student to just passing or completely failing. I just dont know what to do with my  life like its all for nothing. No point pushing on and trying because it'll never end, just getting worse overtime. I dont think i can kill myself. I dont have it in me, im just stuck, like the best parts of my life have passed and thats that. Sorry if this is the wrong sub but i dont know where to go for help.
