That's itNothing really to say. It's my last night here, tomorrow is when I do it. It felt so..odd. Talking with my family acting like everything is normal, they have no idea. I'm a mix of excitement and nervousness. guess I'll see you on the flip side. I doubt anybody will read this, I just need to feel like somebody cares enough to. 

That's it. I'm done now.
