Growing up without a familyI'm gonna get straight into it. My mom and dad divorced when I was 7. My mom left our lives after that for tweak. Since then my dad was never really around, he just payed the bills at the house my brother and I lived in. He was either at work or straight to the house of whatever girlfriend he had at the time. If I were lucky enough to see him for a 10 minute time frame before he went to bed he would just stand my brother and I there cussing us out, belittling us, and telling us how much of a burden we were for 5-10 minute sessions for him to release all his frustration before bed. Then that was it. My brother and I have never gotten along because my dad never thought us the value of family or resolving conflict. Basically since 12 years old my brother and I would argue then go 3+ months without speaking a word to eachother then repeat the cycle. The reason why I say "no family" is because I have never once had a family member to go to for guidance or emotional support. I'm 21 now and the effects of being only emotionally beaten down by my dad all those years has left me cold and crass and I have no desire for intimacy or anything like that. It's like that part of my brain turned off entirely. I'm an outcast and I cannot relate to anyone. The pain of realizing the potential I had in me if I had only gotten the bare minimum to do so in life is enough for me to want to head out for good.
