Sometimes I feel like I want to die (not really urgent but please help nonetheless)This is my first actual post here, I've recently discovered this subreddit and have been lurking a bit, commenting here and there a few times.

Anyways,

Sometimes the thought of suicide crosses my mind, I kinda want to but at the same time don't really want to, does that make sense? It's like, not wanting to die because you recognize the blessings you've been given, but instead just wish your parents never gave birth to you in the first place. I know this sounds selfish since I'm middle class, not poor but not rich, my parents love me, I have a decent amount of friends, but to go with this I have several physical deformities that make me feel insecure, and even putting these aside I'm just insecure to begin with. I have social anxiety due to bullying, I've made friends but sometimes I grow distant because I feel like they're just talking to me out of pity, or that I'm just a hassle or burden in their life whenever I try to talk to them, like I'm just some waste of time. I know this sounds somewhat selfish in a way, knowing that there are tons of people who have it way worse than I do, but I do believe there is genuinely something wrong with me and I need advice on how to cope with all of this, sometimes I just isolate myself completely from my friends, thinking they all probably hate me.

I need advice.
