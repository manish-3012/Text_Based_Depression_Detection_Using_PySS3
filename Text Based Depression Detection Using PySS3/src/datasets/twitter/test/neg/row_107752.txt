Im a failure and I will always be a failureEverything I do is wrong. Im just a disappointment to those in my life. Ive tried therapy and Ive tried medication and I tried the hospital but at the end of the day Im just doing everything wrong. Suicide feels more like an inevitability every day. One day I'll run out of reasons to stay. I'll be dead and their sadness wont matter to me anymore. And that makes me feel like a monster.

I tried, I really really tried. Im just too tired to try anymore.
