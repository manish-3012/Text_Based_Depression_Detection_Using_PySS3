Middle aged, can't afford to move out of parents' house, crappy job, I just don't see any hope in sightMy parents are the root cause of all my problems. They made me go to college I didn't want to attend, but had no means to pay for it, so I'm stuck footing the bill. Been paying off the loans for years and haven't actually paid off even a cent of any of them because of interest. I have a job, but the pay is shit and I have no skills to get a better job, nor do I have the means to acquire new skills. All I have ever wanted out of life is to just have my own living space - four walls not occupied by my parents, and a pet. I can't have a pet right now because my parents are abusive to animals - they'd always hit my now deceased pets for no reason.

I thought I'd just have to put up with this shit until maybe 25-26 and then things would fall into place and I could have my freedom, but here I am at 34, no closer to freedom in spite of trying and no forseeable freedom in my future. My parents are also both narcissists and I can't stand the sight or sound of them. Both still control me a lot and I fucking hate them because they've mentally abused me my whole life. They make even trivial things difficult. I got in a fight with them a couple weeks ago over a cake I was trying to make.

I have nowhere to go and I can't afford to move out. I also make too much to qualify for benefits. I never thought that having the basic minimum of adult life would be a luxury. What my peers take for granted is something I would give anything to have: just to be able to live my own life. I am so embarrassed that I'm my age and still living at home.

Suicide is the only way out I can see. I've been wanting to die since I was probably 16 for essentially the same reasons: escaping my parents. I can't tell people I know any of this because they just tell me everything is my fault, I'm not trying hard enough, and so on. I'm at a point now where I want nothing more than to be in an accident or learn I have a terminal illness just so I can finally die because I'm too much of a coward to shoot myself or hang myself.

I know this is going to get buried because so many other folks here are suffering. I just wanted to get it off my chest.
