I may wait till next school yearJust donâ€™t quote me on this. 

I have the best friend ever, it just makes me sad that heâ€™s â€œpopularâ€ and there is a strong chance next school year heâ€™ll completely abandon me/ be separated from me. 

You see, our school has â€œpodsâ€ and we are both currently in the same pod, and have 3 classes together. He constantly talks about his strong friendships with his other friends, (who are not in our pod) and I feel like next year, if weâ€™re not in the same pod I wonâ€™t ever be able to see him because we wonâ€™t have any classes together, or if we are in the same pod, heâ€™ll be in the same pod as his other friends and just ignore me and act like I never existed.

Please, donâ€™t give any replies that â€œif heâ€™s really a true friend, he wonâ€™t abandon youâ€ or shit like that. I know that, but heâ€™s the only thing that seems to make me happy, and if i get separated from him, I wonâ€™t have any reason to live. Yes I can find new friends, but I feel this bond that Iâ€™ve never felt before with anyone else. Someone I truly want to be with forever, yet completely platonically.

I also do have another great friend, and I know my suicide would be so hard on him, but I canâ€™t seem to form that same bond with him. It is tearing me apart. Iâ€™ve never felt this and I donâ€™t want to let go of it, but I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone, especially my other friend. I still care for him so much but I donâ€™t have that same connection and I canâ€™t seem to find it. I know heâ€™ll get over it though. He has a girlfriend and since I know her personally, I know sheâ€™ll help him get over it.

I can just hope it all ends well, but it doesnâ€™t seem positive, and life will probably fuck me over like itâ€™s done many times in the past.
