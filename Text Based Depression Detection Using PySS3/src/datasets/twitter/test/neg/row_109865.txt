I don't know what to do (long post)Right now... I wanted to ask for some advice, because, frankly, I don't know what to do to move on or start healing.

I know that I'm an extremely inmature person (at least 60-70% of inmaturity), I can't seem to be able to make new friends (either in real life or the internet), nor can I keep them (I distanced myself from almost everyone, and I feel that something stops me for trying to reconnect), and that Asperger's misdiagnosis will probably torture me for years... 

The point is... I can't seem to find a way to fix all of my problems, because I've made so much mistakes that those will follow me for the rest of my life. I'm toxic, I annoy people, I make others hate me, I made my mom and family spend a lot of money for treatment, and even after those, I still couldn't find an answer... I feel like a piece of crap for not changing after all of their sacrifices...

When I try to connect to someone, I feel that something bad will happen, or I'm afraid that they'll get angry at me for not talking to them for months (I know I sound like a narc by thinking they'll miss me, sorry for that), so I just spend most days by myself... 

Is it possible to defeat all of those issues in order to find light and peace? I feel like a piece of crap for being jealous of others, for having a heart filled with resentment and rage to people who probably doesn't even remember what they did to me, or that I exist (again sounding like a narc, sorry).

I know I must move on, I must improve, otherwise I'm going to rot in my own misery until I die... But I feel like I want to explode, but I can't!

I want to yell, to cry for hours until I passed out from doing so, I feel like I have a huge amount of grief and sadness... Years of mistakes, failing others, being annoying and condescending... I want to let it all out...

I'm going to a cognitive-conductual therapist, although our sessions are quite short (like 10-20 minutes), because we're in a public hospital, and there's a lot of people (we pay $20 per session), and my mom said we could try with a private psychologist (although it costs $70, and I don't want her to spend more money for me, she has done a lot and I don't want to keep being a lich to her and my family).

What could I do to start changing things for good? This is the last year I'm going to stay depressed; I swear for real this time.
