Messed up big time and can't calm down.I didn't do enough work last month and rent is due tomorrow. I'm posting everything I can on craigslist but no one wants my crap what the fuck am I supposed to do my rent was barely on time last month and I thin my landlord is losing patience. I'd rather die than deal with this stress over and over again for the rest of my life it's not worth it.
