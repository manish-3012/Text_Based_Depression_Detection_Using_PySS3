Planning for the future/401k questionDoes anyone know what happens to my 401k when I commit suicide? My parents are my beneficiaries (Iâ€™m in my 20s) and Iâ€™d like to make sure they still get the money. I donâ€™t want to mess anything up. I know this is a stupid thing to worry about, but it still concerns me. I feel like it will make things easier for them when I go.
