No one likes me and they shouldn't, I'm fucking fake and emptyI have to be one of the most stupid, useless, shitty people on this earth, and everyone knows it and avoids me or leaves me eventually. I wish I was never born. I should not be here, it's such a weird feeling to realize that. My parents got divorced, they should never have been together and I shouldn't be here. I want to die so badly. 

I fucked up all my relationships and now my entire "hobby" community thinks I'm fucking nuts even though the reality of what happened was nuanced and I was gaslighted. My future is over.
