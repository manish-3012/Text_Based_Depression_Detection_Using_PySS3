God I'm such a shit personRally truly honestly, all the bad traits I thought I was working past reemerged without me noticing and I just fucking hate myself. I literally want to die I wish people didn't care about me so fucking much I don't deserve any love. I wish a truck or a car or a stranger or maybe someone I've wronged would just come back to kill me. I fucking hate being alive. So many things happening at once, my head is feeling horrible I feel so shit. The worst thing is that I have supportive people and I'm wishing I didn't have their support. It's so fucking dumb why do I always keep everything bottled up. I have no hope for the future anyways why not just fucking die while I'm ahead
