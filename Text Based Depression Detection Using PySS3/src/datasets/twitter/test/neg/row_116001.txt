I simply think I've lived long enoughI'm 21. I know that's not that old. I'll be 22 in a couple months.

I just don't feel like it anymore. I've fucked too many things up. I don't think I have a chance at feeling content.

I'm reaching a calm acceptance that I don't want my life to continue. It feels like it has run its course. I would like to be done
