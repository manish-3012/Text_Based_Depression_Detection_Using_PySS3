im just a burdeni keep trying to do better. ive wanted to die for as long as i can remember. and it always seems to be getting worse. i recently got a girlfriend and came out and felt happy and accepted. but then she broke up with me for reasonable causes. we tried staying friends, but she said. i was too much and that she was tired of being my even my friend the whole time. she thought i would get better in a week or so. and it fucking hurts. a huge fear of mine is people pretending to be my friend, and it seems thatâ€™s all she was doing. why can everyone else leave me but i canâ€™t leave myself? i just want to die. i have no one. im from a largely christian family and background. they believe im going to hell anyways so might as well do it soon.
