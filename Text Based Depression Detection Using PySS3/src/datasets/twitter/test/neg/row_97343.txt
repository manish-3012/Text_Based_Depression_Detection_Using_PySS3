My boyfriend tried to kill himself while I was at work, and I feel pretty close to doing it as well.I'm still kind of numb about everything that is happening, so I apologize in advance for poor grammar, typing mistakes and any weird wording I might use. My mind is a numb haze and I just don't know what to do. I'll probably leave out so much detail because I just can't get my mind to put to words what I want to say.

I guess I should give some history about us? My boyfriend and I have been together just under 2 years. We moved in together over a year ago. Things have been very difficult for us. VERY difficult. My boyfriend has a lot of health conditions that leave him in pain and cause a lot of complications (kidney stones being a major one for us right now...he's had 2 lithotripsies in the past 6 months and has to have another very soon). He gets sick easily. He had a job last year, but it was seasonal, and since he missed so many days because of having foot surgery, he was let go. He never really found a job again after that. He's had interviews, but is never selected. He even applied to fast food places and isn't selected. Since July of last year, I have been the only income. I have a decent job, but a lot of personal debt that I am working to pay off (college, credit cards and the like), so I am not financially able to support us both. His family (they live on the other side of the country) have had to give us money constantly. My own family, while only living a few minutes away, aren't as helpful. He's a man, he should have a job, and I "am a fool for supporting a free loader", as they put it. He has no real job experience and we live in a small town. It's been very hard for him to get any kind of job. Because he's unemployed, my family thinks he is a loser and they don't really support us. It's not my place to think they should have to either. We are adults.

It's basically been a gradual decline for us. The stress causes us to fight sometimes. We both have depression and have been struggling to keep each other afloat emotionally. I try my best to work hard and do what I can, but it's not enough for us. We just aren't able to stay afloat.

This month was the breaking point. I've managed to keep us 
(barely) fed and bills pretty much paid. I paid rent with the month's bill money because he said his family gave him the money and it was just a matter of him getting it to me out of his account. I tell him I need it by a certain date or I'll get late fees out the ass. The date came and went. I have late fees out the ass. Turns out, there is no money. There never was. I confront him about it and he admits he lied to me and was trying to cover it up, even though he couldn't. We argue. It's been like this since he hasn't been working. We are ok a few weeks, rent time comes up, stress goes up, we fight.

I've done everything humanly possible to keep us going. I took out a loan one month to pay our rent. We applied for food stamps but were declined because my income is too high. The system isn't designed to help people like me. Maybe we shouldn't have been honest? I don't know.

The guilt of lying to me about the money and screwing me over pretty badly has been eating him up. We are hungry, stressed, unhappy, frustrated. My dinner last night was a granola bar and tap water. Tonight it was nothing. I've been trying to make things to sell, but I have no talent whatsoever really. No one is interested in buying the meager shit I can make. I tried to borrow from a pitiful 401k I had set up, but my job stipulates I can't use it for hardship...unless I retire or leave my job. The stress and the struggle is making me want to die. I'm not a bad person. I give 100% in everything I do.

I told him at this point, he should just go back home and live with his family, and I should go to mine. I told him I'd move out at the end of the week (which is my birthday, how ironic), after I helped him take care of the upcoming lithotripsy. There's NO WAY I can make the money needed for us to keep living together, so we just need to part ways and go to our families. Nothing I can do will make ends meet for us. We are just suffering and slowly starving. It isn't fair to either of us.

This morning, before I went to work, he took a bottle of Demerol he had for kidney stone pain. I didn't know he did this until a few hours ago, because he confessed it to me. I was so angry at him, I wanted to hit him. He said he was trying to kill himself, but it didn't work as intended. I asked how this is fair to me, to come home from working for us and doing so much for us....to come home to his dead body. I know the logic though. He sees it as doing me a favor. He'd be doing everyone a favor by ridding us of the burden he sees himself as. His family tries to call and he ignores their calls. He isn't really speaking to me or sleeping in the same bed. He sleeps in the living room. He is sick (a cold) and says it would just burden me to be in the same room as me. I want to hold him and talk to him so bad, but he's so deep into a depression that he wont let me.

My own suicide feelings aside, I don't know what to do for him. I can't MAKE him talk to his family, though I have tried. I... fuck. I don't know what to do. I tell myself we should shut up and suck it up. Some people don't have places to sleep at night. Some people have gone days without real food. There are people out there suffering more than us. But our life is slowly crumbling under our feet and I can't stop it. I can't help him. I'm a failure of a girlfriend.

I love my boyfriend with all my heart and soul and I know he loves me too, but I don't know what to do for us anymore. We have no one but each other. No local friends. Nothing but us. Sometimes I think it would be best if we just went out together. At least then, we wouldn't have to be apart ever again.

I don't know what to do. I hate that all this fucking bullshit is caused by financial stress. I hate money. I always have. Such a little thing and it kills. Has killed. Will kill. We don't have much in our home, mostly hand-me-downs. Our furniture is old and torn. We don't even own a table. We have a few things we will likely be pawning, though I know we won't get shit for them. Pawn shops take advantage of your desperation and give you shit money for what you have, from what I've seen. But maybe it will be enough to pay what we owe and send him home (unlikely).

I just don't know what to do anymore. We need help, but there's no one who can help.
