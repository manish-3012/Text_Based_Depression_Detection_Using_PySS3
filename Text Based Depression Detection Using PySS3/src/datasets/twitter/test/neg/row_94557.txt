I am the villainMy mother abused me for as long as I can remember. Physically and mentally torturing me every single day was her favorite thing to do. She kept me quiet with her anger and violence, creating an environment of fear where she relished in her own power.

But society did not see this from her. To the average onlooker, she was an upstanding member of society. She was the boss of a company that gave aid to senior citizens, and she was regarded as kind and selfless. Someone who came from being dirt poor to having a nice home with a brilliant, polite child to come with it.

Back at home however, I begged for mercy to all the gods in the universe to please kill me, but my prayers went unanswered.

No one could help me, I could not speak about my abuse or I would get killed. I could not try to kill myself because that is frowned upon in our society. Apparently itâ€™s not okay to kill yourself, but itâ€™s perfectly fine to condemn a child to a life of pain and misery. My only other option was to kill her, but then I would be branded a murderer. Not only that but my father would defend my mother, which means I would have to kill him too, which I did not want to do.

I have decided that I will be killing myself, however I write this message for one reason.

When I die, the world will not become a better place. Same goes for you. You will die, and in the end that evil woman, and all people who are just like her get to live their happy, carefree lives while condemning others to a life of pain and misery.

Perhaps before I die, I might want to make the world a slightly better place. In the end, I will die alone, branded the selfish coward. I am the villain.
