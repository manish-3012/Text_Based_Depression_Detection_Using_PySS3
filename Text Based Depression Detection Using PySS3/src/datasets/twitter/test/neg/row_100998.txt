People I love keep losing their loved ones to suicide- Iâ€™ve lost loved ones to it- so why do I want to follow suit?And yet, here I am. I feel beyond guilty. I see firsthand the pain that it causes. Not just see, Iâ€™ve *felt* it. But even then... I wrestle myself every. single. day. I canâ€™t have one single social exchange that isnâ€™t exhausting, not even with family. I constantly feel like Iâ€™m doing or saying the wrong things. Even people that I know already love me... what if I do or say something to change that? It just feels inevitable. Iâ€™ve been in therapy twice a week for roughly a year and a half and I havenâ€™t been making much progress. Though, I was assaulted in October of 2017 and havenâ€™t addressed that trauma at all. Today I spoke with a trauma counselor and made the decision to receive trauma counseling once a week in addition to what Iâ€™m currently receiving. Iâ€™m withdrawing, I almost never feel safe, I trust no one (even the people I love most), I constantly question who I am, I constantly question if I even know what love, trust, life, etc. all means.  Iâ€™m trying. But when I was younger, I can remember being able to picture a future and having goals. Wanting things. And now I just... donâ€™t. And I donâ€™t know how to just magically change that.
