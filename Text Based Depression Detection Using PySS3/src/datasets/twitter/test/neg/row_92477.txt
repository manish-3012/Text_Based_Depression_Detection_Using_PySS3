adviceDisclaimer: This is not suicidal, I am just concerned for my best friend. So my best friend posted something on Instagram, with a black background and the words "Good bye". I am concerned because in an earlier post she says  "I just wanna go home..."

Please give me some advice guys. I am very concerned she could harm herself.
