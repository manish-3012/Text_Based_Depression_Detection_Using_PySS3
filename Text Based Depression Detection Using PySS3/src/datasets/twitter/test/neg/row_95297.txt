I'm giving upI'm giving up on life My life has been a failure since I was i child I was adopted And Now I'm constantly reminded how much of a mistake I was my dad beats me and throws racist slurrs I won't even type down my mom always talks abou how useless I am And the hold It over about how they adopted And I should be better because of that.  But they know my birth mom took many types of drugs when she was pregnant with me and that has really messed up my life and caused many side effects that make me feel like I'm going to be a burden for the rest of my teenage life until I move out.  Because of the rough starts of being a foster child I have trouble making friends so I turned to writing scary stories on reddit but my parents believe writing is just going to be a time wasting hobby and I should quit.  My father enjoys punishing me he once got upset because my mom had already spanked me.  He once spanked me 42 times because he thought my mom didn't do it long enough.  It has tamed down as I get older and I have considird calling cps but I have a 5 year old brother who I could stand seeing going through adoption. I have trust issues and have pushed away any potential friends becasue I can't stop from thinking that it won't work out.  I need to come out to my parent's about being BI but my dad Is a HUGE gay bashing preacher.  I would run away but I'm afraid I would actually be BEATEN beyond nightmares if I got caught  I don't know how much longer before me or my parents are dead.
