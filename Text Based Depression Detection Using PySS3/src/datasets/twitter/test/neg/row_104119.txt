Anger pushes me, I move from hate to self worthlessness.I think emotions are related in many different ways that we don't understand. For me, anger is a prevalent one. I grew up in a religion that promotes non-questioning authority and complete devotion. I always loved my family but my religion has distanced itself from me so much that I can confidently say I am an atheist. Now, here is the catch, no one knows. I am still pretending to be someone of the polar opposite to who I am. When I was young I didn't recognize this and my emotions were fluid. As I recognized what it actually was, a completely different system of logic, and principle. I felt a cognitive dissonance that I couldn't share with anyone. I think this is where my anger started. I was young and I felt that I lived with a bunch of crazy people who would hate me for being honest and intellectual. These repressed feelings were so hidden that I had no idea why I was angry at times, and one day just after I turned 20 years old, I had about a month where I was Virtually alone. In that month I exposed myself to the entire bible and basically all the raw material of my religion. In an instant my religion was nullified and I was a different person, this time I knew that consciously. After that, I had a choice, tell everyone and become an outcast with no home and no money or hold it in.

I am now at a private university that is owned by my religion and my college and work depend on me keeping quiet. 

This is why I am angry, this is why I am sad. The intense anger I experience for at least 30 minutes, sometimes a few hours, a day turns into sadness like it is normal, and it is normal for me. The problem is that I don't know how to deal with it.

I get so angry that my chest hurts, my mind races and I feel sick to my stomach. I want to hurt people, and I don't just flutter over the idea of hitting someone. I dwell on beating people to death to satisfy my anger. I think of commuting arson and destroying millions of dollars of equipment. This incredibly terrorist sense of anger is mixed with and followed by an equally intense sadness and hopelessness. I am in a situation that I have no control over and if I leave, I leave all that I love including my family. I end up thinking about suicide as a practical option. I think about how I would make it look like an accident so that my family could remember me as what I was. the worst part is that I am normally a very social person who can dominate the conversation and make friends quickly.

I need to know how to deal with this. I cant rightly afford psychiatric help. I have gotten angry enough to experience my thoughts as audible sounds like I am speaking out loud but I know that i am only thinking. this is hallucinating and this really scares me. I feel like a crazy psychopath stuck in a kind loving kid. 

I don't know if this is to long but I want you to understand so you don't give me advice that doesn't work.
