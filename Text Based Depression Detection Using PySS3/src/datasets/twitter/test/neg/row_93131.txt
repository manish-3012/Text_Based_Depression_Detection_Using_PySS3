I saw my mentor for the last time todayMy teacher has been my biggest mentor throughout high school. I went to her last year about my suicidal thoughts and she was so kind. I visited her today during her free period for the final time. I thanked her once again. Little did she know the reason I came to her today is because Iâ€™m more suicidal than ever and have a plan. I feel bad about not being honest to her, but I am in a really bad place.
