Ive never been closer to killing myself than nowGot rejected twice today lowest score in my class and lost my last friend i could talk to. My parents say that if i dont get good enough grades they will kick me out ive tried tinder in search of maybe someone i went to 11 likes but found out the hard way people could unlike you. The ones i did match never responded. The only thing keeping me from my own knife is the fact that im too much of a pu55y to do it
