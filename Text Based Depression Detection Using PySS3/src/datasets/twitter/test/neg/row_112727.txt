Just needing to vent a bit, feeling really down...Basically I'm just feeling really down at the moment, and I'm not sure what to do. Currently I'm tired and sick, so that might be making my depression flare up more, but it's there anyway.

I'm lonely, plain and simple. I pretty much don't have any friends, online or off. I talk to three or four people daily, and only one of those for more than 10mins. No one I know ever initiates conversation except for the one friend I talk to pretty much every day. I need more friends, but there are a few issues. First, I'm gay and living dead-center of the bible belt. Second, I literally have no idea how to make friends. I just don't know how, at all. Not online or offline, and I sure as fuck don't know how to find a partner. None of my relationships have ever lasted beyond six months, and I've only had three in my life, and only one of those was a physical relationship, the other two were long distance online relationships. I've tried everything I can think of.

Aside from work, doctors appointments, and other errands, I really don't leave the house. I don't have my license yet, and even if I did I don't know where I would go. I would LIKE to go to one of the two local gay bars, but being right at six months from being legal, that's currently out.

I don't know. I'm... I want to die. I really, really do, but I don't want to kill myself, and I just... I know I can't. But I just feel like life isn't worth living. The only thing that gives me any kind of satisfaction right now is work, but I only work at most once a week since I'm going to school as well. 

I don't know... I don't feel like typing anymore, I'm almost crying. I think I'm going to go to bed. Ask me questions, talk to me or something, please. I just need someone to talk to... I just need someone...
