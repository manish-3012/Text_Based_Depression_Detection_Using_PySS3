Why shouldnâ€™t I kill myself?Why wait for life to choose when I die when Iâ€™m terrified of dying. Why not just choose when I die? 
When my parents are gone, how dare I live on? Maybe my siblings, in laws , nephews, nieces, children and husband can change my mind one day. But in this moment, whatâ€™s the point in waiting? 

Iâ€™m not suicidal in any way, but why should I spend years and years here on this earth, working so hard every day. Working hard at work, saving money, stressing about everything and just living to die and never come back. Seems useless. Doesnâ€™t it?

Unless Iâ€™m going down in history or making a difference in many MANY peoples lives, what is the point?

Just a thought Iâ€™ve been thinking about. Iâ€™ll kill myself when Iâ€™m ready to go. I donâ€™t want to wait for death to choose me.  How Iâ€™ll do it? Unsure.
