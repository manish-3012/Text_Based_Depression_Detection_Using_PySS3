So I really want to just do it already but my younger brother's birthday is in two days.Honestly he's the only one worth sticking around for. If it weren't for him I would have done it over ten years ago. He's only 17, about to be 18. His life is about to start and I don't want to fuck things up for him, but honestly idk what to do anymore. I'd feel awful if the anniversary of me doing it were so close to his birthday. We've grown distant over the years but I know it would hurt him. Ugh. I have no reason to stay other than him and my best friend, who I live with. I feel like everyone is pressuring me to get a job and I just want to take a small break first. I just graduated college, I worked the whole time I was there, I saved up, and now I want to take some time off for myself and everyone is getting on my case because I haven't found a job yet. Even my friend. I'm living off of my money. Didn't ask anyone for anything and I can pay my rent just fine for a while, so idk what people's problem is. I've let them know I want to take a break but I guess that's not acceptable. Why is it that nothing I do is good enough? I don't get it. I wouldn't care what they think except that they're all constantly pushing me, and it sucks. I want to tell everyone to just shut up and leave me the fuck alone and stop trying to make me feel so bad about myself for not having a job. My friend didn't work at all the past two years and she now has a job which is fine but it's hypocritical of her to judge me when she had class two days a week for a year and almost never went anyways and laid around all day. Idgaf it's her life but they hypocrisy is incredible. If I pointed this out I know she'd get upset. I could say "hey you laid around in bed and did nothing for a year taking out loans your parents are going to pay off for you so don't fucking judge me" but I know it would hurt her. She's really type A and I think she's just trying to help, but when I tell her I don't want her help it upsets her. It hurts her feelings, because she's upset that I'm annoyed with her since she's trying to do something nice for me. I've expressed I really appreciate the effort but I have things I need to figure out first. My mental health has always been shit as long as I can remember and it's been even worse than usual lately. I'm just so tired of people always pushing me. I don't want to be nice anymore. Sometimes I feel like if I wasn't extra nice then no one would want to be around me. I don't have any other good qualities. That's why I'm scared of being more upfront and assertive, because if I am then people will stop liking me. Idk what to do anymore.
