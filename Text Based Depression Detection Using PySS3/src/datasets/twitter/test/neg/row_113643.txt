I am on the verge of suicide, but Iâ€™m trying to hold on.Please help me. Some people from one of my favorite games ended up bringing back some memories of past abuse and suicide attempts. I feel hopeless, everything keeps getting worse, thereâ€™s nothing for me to stick around for. I just want to end it all. But I have a few people who would be sad to lose me, and theyâ€™re already in a bad place. I donâ€™t want to hurt them. I need help getting back on my feet.
