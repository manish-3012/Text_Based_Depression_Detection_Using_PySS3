This is probably itIâ€™ve lost so much tonight,Iâ€™m lost in my thoughts. I was told today by my father that today would be our last meeting. That he no longer wants to be apart of my life, and to never attempt to contact him again. Iâ€™m a college student who hasnâ€™t had a relationship with his dad in almost 16 years but even though he had never been a real important part of my life, the guilt and the isolation along with a lifetime of feeling worthless has taken its toll on me. I donâ€™t know what to do. I got absolutely no friends, and no family who I trust enough to open up and reach out to. I fear that I canâ€™t continue to hold on but weâ€™ll see.
