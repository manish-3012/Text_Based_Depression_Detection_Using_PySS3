I fantasize about dying constantlyit doesn't matter if people think i'm happy or not, i only really feel like i can connect with maybe one other person in the world. i can't stop fantasizing about the different ways i may die, for the past few weeks it's become a constant fact that i'm unable to sleep because of my mind going in the same cycles night after night. suicide, murder, medical causes, accidents, i've gone over in my head every way i could possibly want to die and i still can't stop. every day it seems like i spend hours thinking about this and it's even gotten to the point where i have a preferred way to die, suddenly from something like a brain aneurysm. i constantly think about this because i want to kill myself and though i probably won't make it through the summer i dream about being able to die without having any agency in my own death, that's how pathetic and lazy i am, i can't even dream about death in what my own mind thinks is the right way. 

right now i'm just trying to see if i can make it to my birthday, i'll be 19 on june 9 if i don't kill myself before then. i can't take it anymore and i just want it to be over and done with. i just got home from college where i was too busy being a fucking failure to make any friends and at least now i'm as alone physically as i actually feel
