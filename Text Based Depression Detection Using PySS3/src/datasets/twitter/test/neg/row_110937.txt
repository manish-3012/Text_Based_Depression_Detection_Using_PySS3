No reason to be alive. I fantasize about dying throughout the entire dayNever really thought I'd post on one of these forums, I've always been one who keeps my feelings and thoughts bottled up but sometimes it just hurts too damn much. 

I'm 21 years old, I've been dealing with bipolar disorder, anxiety, ADHD and extreme depression for over 7 years now. 

I found the love of my life, he helped me through it all. He was my rock. We were together for over six and a half years.

Recently (the past 5 months or so) the depression has gotten really bad so I had been leaning on my boyfriend for help. It was so amazing to have someone who would support me through it all. His mother was practically a mother to me. I never really had a close knit support system, and they were that to me.
Well, he left me a week ago.

Six and a half years together.

He ended it over Facebook messenger. 

Because "he thought he could be there for me. but he's not that person anymore." He hasn't read my messages ever since. He won't even open my messages, much less reply.

I've always been so used to being abandoned, and he was the one person I thought would never leave me. But he did.

I don't know what to do. I wake up with the most radiating pain possible, I cry my eyes out and then lay in bed and wait for the day to be over. 

He was never that person. He was always there for me no matter what. He would hold me through my emotional breakdowns and console me and promise he'd always be there.
I don't know what happened.

It just fucking sucks that he would abandon me at the time where I'm already at my worse.

I don't have a single friend who lives near me either, by the way. Not one. The only person who I even slightly hang out with is my weed dealer.

I had been suicidal before, but never to this point. I fantasize about death 24/7. Thinking of not existing anymore is the only thing that can bring me any slight happiness. The only reason I haven't done it is because of my mom. Her mother killed herself. She loves me so much, but I never see her. She's constantly working. 
I don't get any joy out of life and I don't think I ever will. He was the only person I've ever related to on such a deep level. I will never find someone like that. 

Even when I was depressed before, I've never felt like this. Never. I'm at absolute rock bottom and I don't think I'll lever have the ability to be okay.

To make things worse, I hate my body and even if I wanted to find someone new, I would never be able to sleep with them. I'm incredibly insecure about a skin disorder I have that effects my buttocks, and yeah. That's just GREAT! 

Anyway, I don't know why I'm writing this. I guess it's therapeutic. I stayed up until 2am last night reading the posts on here and /r/depression and I've never related to anybody more.

If you came this far reading this, thanks. 

I just don't know what to do.
