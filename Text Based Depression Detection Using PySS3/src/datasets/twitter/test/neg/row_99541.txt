Need advice for helpI feel on the edge of suicide right now and I never thought I would get quite so close but I feel a bit unsafe.

I have multiple shit going on in my life right now and lack motivation to even get any help after everyone just kicks me down and doesn't care (I previously did get some help after I was diagnosed with Bipolar but then it stopped)

I need some advice on how I can calm myself down and how I can motivate myself to even get help again or I'm fucked.
