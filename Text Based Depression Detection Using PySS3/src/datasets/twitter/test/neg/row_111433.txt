Even going into a one night stand you can still end up feeling used and worthlessI knew what he wanted. I knew it meant nothing. I knew I'd never see him again. But somehow with the bar near the ground he still managed to dig under it and remind me how fucking worthless I was, am and will be. I dont want to be used anymore. I dont want this life anymore.
