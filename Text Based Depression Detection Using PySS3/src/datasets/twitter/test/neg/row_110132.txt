i'm wasting everyone's time, including my own.i sleep a lot. a Lot. and in the ~8 hours i'm maybe awake, i can never get anything done. my depression always wins. my adhd always wins. something always wins.

i can't hold a job, i can only do one or two classes in college at best because of my sleep issues (and how little time i have for anything else), i can't hold friends, i can't do anything.

i'm 27 and stuck at home, jobless, hobbyless, friendless. all the things i ever think i want to do i cant even motivate myself to get out of bed or try.

it feels like i'm getting my family's hopes up that i'll somehow/someday make it, but i won't.

i'm dependent on other people and i hate it. i hate having to live as nothing more than an empty-brained parasite.
