How to not die by suicide...I'm getting to the end of my rope and I no longer really have a will to live. People tell me to live. They tell me I should live for loved ones' sake. They don't tell me how to live. I'm seeking treatment for my depression but therapy isn't doing much and I'm over a week out from seeing the psychiatrist. I've been down this road before and I've attempted suicide more than once....and I want to do that...but I want to complete and that's one of the few things keeping me alive....I want to be as sure as possible.
