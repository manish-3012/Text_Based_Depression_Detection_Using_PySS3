I'm just so tired ALL the time!I'm a 21 year old full time employee and also part time university student (employer funded) and work roughly 40-45 hours a week.

I'm so fucking tired all of the time, even after a decent night's sleep I want to disappear forever into a deep sleep. 

I wish I had a pill to swallow which would silently put me to sleep. I'm so tired and fatigued, life is mentally and physically exhausting and I'm not sure I'm going to make it. I sincerely believe that before I reach adult maturity, I'm going to end my life due to this tiredness. 

Maybe I'm suffering from something? An iron deficiency, some kind of hidden ailement. Whatever it is, I'm wasting away.
