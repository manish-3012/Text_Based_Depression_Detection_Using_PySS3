What the hell am I supposed to do?Iâ€™m only fuckin 20 and I nearly killed myself this weekend, most my friends are off in school and experiencing life, and here I am working a shit job because I couldnâ€™t get my depressed ass to try in school. I hate hearing about peopleâ€™s happiness, every time I hear about someone being in a relationship it just makes me shut down. Iâ€™m so fucking alone and Iâ€™ve pushed away all my friends by acting like a massive cunt.

Why the fuck canâ€™t I trust anyone, why canâ€™t I meet good people. 

I genuinely feel like I fucked myself over in school, I never went to class, never did my assignments just because I never had the energy, I had a shitty childhood and Iâ€™ve dealt with depression for a long time. That fact just makes it worse now, I fucked myself over and now I just feel more hopeless. I canâ€™t make friends, and people donâ€™t tend to like me. I wish I had something or someone to make it feel worth it, but everything feels pointless, like Iâ€™m miserable to no end. I wish it would fucking change. 

Every night after work I just shower and sleep, I very rarely eat dinner. Talking to friends just makes it worse, makes me feel lonelier. I just want someone to make me feel like itâ€™s worth it.
