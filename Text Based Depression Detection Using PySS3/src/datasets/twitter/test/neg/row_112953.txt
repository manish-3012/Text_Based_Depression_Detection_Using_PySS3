The walls are closing in on me at my parents house, and I don't know much longer I can take it.Hey. 27/m here. Graduated college recently with an art degree. I've suffered from depression for a very long time, but stopped seeking help from docs because when I feel a little better, I think I can handle it. I can't. Anyway, this isn't the point of my post. Just a background.

For the past three months, I've been living at home. In the beginning, right after I graduated for a month or so, everything was great. Went on vacation. It was super fun. But it's coming up on four months being here, and the walls are closing in on me. I tried applying for a couple jobs. Got to a third interview for one of them. Haven't heard back all week, so I'm assuming it's a no-go.

With all the political talk going on, everyone on Facebook getting married and having awesome careers, not having a job, and absolutely no attention from women, I'm starting to feel like college was a waste of time. I never interned because I was trying to get a hold on what little happiness I could muster just getting up in the morning. Never made any college friends. Just sitting, alone, in the basement all day. I wanted to get out of the house for a few days to clear my head. I know I'm in a bad place. I tried telling my parents this, and they flipped. I told them I'm not suicidal, and I just wanted to clear my head. My mom starts crying and says she is cancelling her church convention plans because she's scared and worried for me. My dad drags me into his office and yells at me for acting this way. I tell him I'm depressed and want time away from the house to clear my head and get things straight. He tells me "you always use this excuse!" and gives me an ultimatum: leave and never come back, or stay and buck up.

I feel like I'm choking to death. I hate living here. My dad is sick from hepatitis, diabetes, and encephalopathy. My mom is the most emasculating women I've ever met. She's the definition of helicopter parent. I can't stand living under the same roof as them, and some days, I don't even want to know them period.

I hate people. I hate that I can't get work in my field because, at the time, an internship wasn't as important as trying to keep myself happy and in a good head. I've severely fucked any chances of me ever having a good career or life. This house is not conducive to a healthy lifestyle, and being here just makes me feel sicker and sicker. Am I sick? Am I the one that's in the wrong? How do you help someone that can't even help themself?

Edit: Also, I think that article on /r/science about husband's that lose their jobs getting divorced was what sent me over the edge. How can I expect to be happy in a marriage when I can't even make a decent wage.

Edit 2: Mom just approached me and blamed me for her not being able to go to her church weekend, on a count of "she can't sleep anymore." She also told me she "thinks it's best that I leave."
