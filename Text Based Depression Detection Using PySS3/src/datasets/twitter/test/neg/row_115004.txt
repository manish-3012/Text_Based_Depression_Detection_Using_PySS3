If I donâ€™t know how to fix my problems, you probably donâ€™t eitherA harshly worded title, but itâ€™s how I feel about people I try to open up to. I cannot explain any of my reasons without being met with some â€œsolutionâ€ They assume I never knew about. Yea, I know I can get therapy and drugs and supervisions. Not everyone is looking, or even can be, talked out of their problems. Is it so hard to just listen or read somebodyâ€™s story, and just show compassion without having to try and save the person?

Where is a person supposed to turn to when any cookie cutter advice wonâ€™t help them. No matter how much you really belive it can get better for a person, sometimes it canâ€™t. Itâ€™s not their responsibility to try and convince you why they want to die. Sometimes they just want to vent, be heard freely, without this automatic response people give of wanting to help them. To be quite honest, I doubt most people here have the time or care to actually build the required rapport with somebody for recovery to even be a possibly through your good intentions. If you do, I salute you, because youâ€™re a rare breed.

If somebody comes here looking for help, of course itâ€™s the right thing to do to at least try and help them...but if a user isnâ€™t explicitly asking for help, they might not want it. Lots of times itâ€™s clear people just want to be heard, not saved. 

Iâ€™m not saying this applies to everyone...but before you put on your cape and try to save somebody, just remember thatâ€™s not what a suicidal person automatically wants or needs. Be a friend first, and a psychiatrist second. You donâ€™t have any obligations here. If I explained my shitty life story, and a user comments â€œdamn thatâ€™s sucksâ€...Iâ€™ll be more appreciative of them for being real, and recognizing my pain, than somebody who immediately jumps to the rescue.

Wonâ€™t be surprised if this gets deleted. Talking about this stuff gets censored. Probably for the best, because I do agree that this subreddit can help people...but god damn people, this is not a competition.

Iâ€™m sorry if this is rude or inappropriate for this sub, but I have no idea where else I can explain how I feel.
