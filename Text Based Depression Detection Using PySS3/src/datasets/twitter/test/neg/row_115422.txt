Really just want to kill my selfI just donâ€™t have friends anymore. The â€œfriendsâ€ I have leave me out all the time but claim otherwise. Iâ€™m genuinely miserable and at the end of my rope. I donâ€™t know if I can do this for another day honestly. All I want is a fucking friend. Whatâ€™s so wrong with me that  people treat me like leftovers.. Iâ€™m just done here. Thereâ€™s nothing really to look forward to other than more misery and debt. Itâ€™d be less pathetic if I moved somewhere else and was alone but nope.. still here, still hate my life. I watch myself being excluded and just leave and go home. I really just donâ€™t want to do this anymore
