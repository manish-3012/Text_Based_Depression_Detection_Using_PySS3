Worst kind of pain is wanting to die but not being able toI probably wouldâ€™ve taken my own life a long time ago but I canâ€™t leave my family and friends like that. It seems selfish to erase myself from everyone else just because I canâ€™t handle the pain of living, especially when theyâ€™ve invested as much as they have into me and bent backwards working for me.
