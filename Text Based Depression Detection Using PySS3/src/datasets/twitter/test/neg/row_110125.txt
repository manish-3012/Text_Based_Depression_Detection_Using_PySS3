what reading people's expressions and behaviors led me to.learning that majority of my friends used my insights and stole some of my notes to propel their careers to new heights. 
and made me the butt of their jokes and even insults my nervous breakdowns, my inability to not get part time jobs considering my status 

the same issue applies to family members and be told  "YOU NEVER KNEW HOW IT FEELS TO BE IN THIS POSITION MAN SO YOU DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY SUCH SHIT" 

when in fact i was in such trouble because of them and it was under their leadership, was forced to follow no matter how bad it was, i kept on telling how bad the damages are going to be, but was dismissed and that it was superficial unlike theirs. 

Now I realized i'm nearly alone. and getting insulted as a smart ass (in a very bad way) every now and then
