Lived through this weekend, realizing I really didnâ€™t want toI have epilepsy &amp; there were some problems getting my meds refilled this week. I had a breakthrough seizure but was really lucky it wasnâ€™t a long one or a cluster of them to put me in the hospital. And Iâ€™m laying in bed now, sad about how it all played out. I wish my med had taken longer to refill and I couldâ€™ve had a seizure that wouldâ€™ve killed me. Iâ€™ve been extremely close to suicide before, writing the note, etc but never could actually pull the trigger. This couldâ€™ve been my way out and nobody would have blamed me. I screw up everything. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore.
