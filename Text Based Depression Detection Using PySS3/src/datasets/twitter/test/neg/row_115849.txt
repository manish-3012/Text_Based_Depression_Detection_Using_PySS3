At my wits end. Hoping for any way out.Hi,
So I just discovered this subreddit after having a very rough few weeks. To cover the basics: I had my car repossessed last week, my job cut all my hours down to almost one day a week, I'm basically borrowing all the money I can from my mom just to scrape by and I live alone in a city where everyone around me seems to be flourishing.
I have been having thoughts of suicide but to be completely honest, the one thing that always keeps me from doing it is that I am even more afraid of what might be around on the other side. I hope it's just nothing but I also don't want some hell like fruition to come into play. At some point, I'm not sure I'll even care anymore. 


I have suffered with manic depression since I was about 14, but as I have gotten older (I'm 28) my anxiety levels have grown. I have told my mom just this morning that I think I need some serious help, but I have not heard back from her.
Any advice as to where to go? Not sure where to look for help, especially on a budget.
