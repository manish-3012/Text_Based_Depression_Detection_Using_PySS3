I don't want to live anymoreI wish I had the balls to kill myself, it'd make things a hell of a lot easier. Instead I get to face my teachers and peers because I have no motivation to do my work, then get told the same things over and and over again.

"It gets better."
"You just gotta get it done."
"You can't be doing this anymore."

Sleep is the only viable option anymore, it's that bridge between living and getting away, only issue is its temporary and can only be done during select times. What makes this worse is that I'm only fucking 13, am I supposed to even feel this way? Jesus I slept 14 hours today. Nothing I used to do for fun appeals anymore, life seems meaningless to me, I'm numb and and all I can feel is fear and anxiety. If I'm not afraid or panicking then
I'm bitter and angry. Happiness is a fleeting memory. I have plenty of ways I could kill myself at this very moment and the only thing holding me back is the people I love. It's gotten to the point where I'm bitter towards positive people, I see them as naive and childish, their words of encouragement only stoke a fire of violence in my heart. 

Life will never change, day in day out I go to school, don't do my work because I literally can't bring myself to, skip the punishment for my apathy, and do it all again. I can't miss much more school else I gotta redo eighth grade, so I don't have much choice at this point, not that I did to begin with. At this point it's a game of if I want to make this change for myself... but I don't, I can't bring myself to see a point. I'm in pain, and I just want it to end.
