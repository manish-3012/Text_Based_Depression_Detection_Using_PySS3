I've ruined my lifeI feel like I had the potential to do good things and help people but I smoked and drank away any intelligance I had. Now I'm absolutely worthless and it's my fault. Why should I live if I have nothing to offer anyone?
Edit: misspelled intelligence because I threw away my only asset
