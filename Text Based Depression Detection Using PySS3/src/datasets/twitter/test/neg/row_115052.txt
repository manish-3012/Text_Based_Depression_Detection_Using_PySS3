I want to dieIâ€™ve put it off for so long, I feel like Iâ€™ve already accepted my own death.  Iâ€™m simply a figure walking around, completing the tasks Iâ€™m given and getting by. I canâ€™t handle my own insecurity, my own brokenness and trauma, my own failure. 

Itâ€™s abundantly clear that there is no place for people with ptsd in this society, let alone someone who is autistic, or both. I canâ€™t even handle my own boyfriend, who is usually my saving grace. These days itâ€™s just too much to try and exist around other people no matter how happy they used to make me. 

I just want to die.
