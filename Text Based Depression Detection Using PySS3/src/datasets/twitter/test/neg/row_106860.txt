I don't understand how people have hope.I don't think I can do it anymore, I've been cutting myself for almost 10 years struggle with and eating disorder and experience psychosis when I'm depressed.  Everyday I sit alone with 0 interactions, wandering my mind thinking about all the awful things I want to do to myself.  I have a bottle of alcohol, a rope and a ceiling fan.  I think I'm going to get drunk and hang myself tonight.  I've been telling myself things will get better for so, so, so many fucking years. And they've only ever gotten worse.  I live with and for nothing.  I have 0 interest, friends, hobbies and very very little family or interactions.  I just can't keep fucking doing it. I attempted once when I was 15 by overdose.  Now since I live alone, nobody will find me.
