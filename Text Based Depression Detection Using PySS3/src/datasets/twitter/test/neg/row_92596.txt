I'm ending it...I'm behind on rent. I've been depressed to the point I've been sleeping for 15-30 hours at a time...I've had to go to the hospital twice in the past two months from injuries and sicknesses. I've always hated myself, from the time I started my second year of high school, that's when the depression hit. I'm 22 now, and it's only gotten stronger...My landlord told me today, over E-Mail, that if I did not obtain eight hundred dollars in three days he would evict me. I have no family, and honestly...if I can't figure out a way to keep my place...I'm going to slit my throat, and stab my femoral arteries after downing a bottle of Vodka. I've already apologized to the last two people in the world who I love... I started dirt poor, and just when things were finally going well, all this hits me. I'm not letting myself go lower than I've been...homeless is where I draw the line, and I'd rather die with a roof over my head.
