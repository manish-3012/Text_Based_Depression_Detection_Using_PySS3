My life has turned into one big joke and it's no longer funny anymoreI'm a walking punch bag, a maggot who has absolutely no place on this planet anymore. I'm a 20 something grocery worker with Aspergers syndrome, dyspraxia, anxiety and chronic depression with nothing to live for. My financial situation is dire, the COVID situation is making me feel incredibly isolated from my friends, I'm having great difficulty starting relationships and on top of that I'm basically known as the local fuck up. My ambitions of being a guitarist I've been told are unrealistic and flat out stupid and that I should stop trying and "focus on other things" according to some people. 

I'm tired of fucking up, I'm tired of being alone and I'm tired of worrying about money. I just want everything in my life to be perfect but everything something good happens to me, it all comes crashing down. I'm beyond fed up. I know I'm only in my 20's (I'll be 23 in two months in case you're wondering) but I just feel so burnt out and fed up with life and I honestly feel like nothings going to get any better. When I talk to my friends about how I feel they just give me empty platitudes saying that "suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem" or "you have so much more to live for, you're only 22". I don't care anymore, I want out. It's become brutally apparent that my life is never going to turn out how I want to and I'm just going to be stuck being a chronically depressed autistic loser.
