I have finally decided to do itHello dear reddit,

After months of consideration and praying, i have finally decides to leave this world. Honestly i even feel relieved. I just don't know if there is any arrangements I can make to make afterwards easier for my wife and friends? Also to leave as little mess as possible?

I'm not sure if this is a related sub but honestly i'm too lazy to search. Thanks for the recommendations in advance! If I am breaking any rules, sorry about that but i think mods can remove the post.

Have a great life!
