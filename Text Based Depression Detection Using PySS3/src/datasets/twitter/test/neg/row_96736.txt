I'm glad I thought about my family.I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for a very long time. I hit rock bottom a month ago, when I started to plan out my suicide. I was going to go a park, take a bunch of pills, and call the cops so a stranger nor my family would find me.

 thought up to the end how it would effect my family. I was crying in the tub overcome with stress from my anxiety, and emptiness from my depression when I planned it.


I realized I couldn't handle my anxiety. I'm was sick of dealing with it. I was writing out my suicide note, when I realized I needed help. I was crying after I wrote my apologies to my family.

I have kept my depression so well hidden, no body knows anything is wrong. My family doesn't know how close I was to ending my life. I smile and laugh, try to make them happy all while I am here. 

I know things will get better for me, they already are. I needed to remember The people I love. I at first thought, My family hates me I am just a leach on them, But I'm not. I need to stay here and make other peoples lives better. I have a purpose. I have something I can give the world.
