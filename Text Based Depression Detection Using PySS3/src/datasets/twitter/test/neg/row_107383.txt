Why shouldn't I do it?If I'm not supporting anyone financially or emotionally, why is it selfish to take my life? If my mom and I only fight, why would it be a bad thing if that source of stress is removed from her life?   When I think over and over that the only reason I haven't done it yet is because I'm worried it will hurt my family, why should I even care about prolonging that life?
