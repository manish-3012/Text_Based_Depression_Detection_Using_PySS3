I really want to kill myself but I have too many obligationsI couldn't do that to my parents and I am supposed to be moving into a place with my friends soon. I just want to hang myself now before I build more obligations and it seems like waiting for my parents to die would take too long. How do I deal with this? I can't escape without hurting anybody. It's been seven years and I am tired.
