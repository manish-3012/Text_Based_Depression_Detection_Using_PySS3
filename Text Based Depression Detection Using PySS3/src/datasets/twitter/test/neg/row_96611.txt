Some peopleSome people are just cursed.  They get the shit hand in life.  They have to take care of their disabled handicapped family, and it's just that.  Then they become sick themselves and lose their career.  Then they have to live through multiple miscarriages.  My letter is written.  I just want to feel enough peace to go.  Not fairness, just tranquility.  Peace.
