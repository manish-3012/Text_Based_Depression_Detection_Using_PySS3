I don't know what to do anymore.Mostly just here to vent because I don't really have any other outlet right now. 

Shit sucks. The world sucks. My life is ass. I've tried everything to help myself feel okay and ignore everything shitty about the world. But its never going to get better. All I can do is go to work, eat, shit, sleep and maybe do something on the weekend if time and money allows it. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of how people treat each other. Im tired of this system that fucks us in the ass so much. How can I feel okay knowing my comfortable little "first world" life is propped up by those living in the "third world." How can I feel okay knowing the world is run by really sick people?

The only thing keeping me here is my mother and how she would be absolutely devastated if I offed myself. And I'm afraid that once she passed on, there will be nothing left holding me back. Shit suuuucks.
