[UPDATE] Thinking of killing myself after a failed suicide attemptLast thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/uqoim/thinking_of_killing_myself_after_a_failed_suicide/

I have talked to my therapist a couple of times now and I think it's finally good to talk about my problems to someone face to face. But doing so I've released that I am a failure and not even my own family wants me anymore (I contacted them but they don't want to talk to me). I'm living with my uncle now and he is the only one who supports me now...I'm shaking while writing this...I should never have contacted my parents, it's even worse than before now. I will do it, I just need to get a firearm first...
