nothing to live for again I have so much shit right now I don't even know if I can write it all out

and if I do it'll probably be all out of order but whatever

so there's this girl ive been crushing on pretty hard pretty much since I met her at the beginning last school year but especially these past few weeks

like for real i can't look at her without my heart racing

but anyway after over a year I had finally started to come to the delusion that she could almost like me back

absurd, but I have been working hard to improve myself, I've lost weight, I'm in better shape, more outgoing and I seem like less of an asshole I think

it's kind of difficult because not only do we share classes but we're also both on the shotgun team and her dad is the coach and her mom the finance director or some shit so she shows up to every practice

her, my best friend and l are the oldest ones on the team with everyone else being freshmen or younger

so her mom and the coach often talk to me because freshmen

I'm super quiet around them but I try my
damnedest to come off as a nice person without seeming fake by being a completely different person suddenly

l'm quiet in general so it's not out of character but I think they both like me so i thought that helped my chances

neither her nor any of the girls in my class
message me at all unless the teacher asked them to tell me about a change in assignment or something

I don't want to initiate anything to be weird but I've considered ways to do so

anyway my aforementioned best friend is super active on Snapchat and has her added 
so he took a picture of me which normally isn't funny but based on my personality around everyone it's funny in how
out of character it is and then he sent another normal picture of me I didn't know he took and basically said jokingly "look at this hunk of man he's
single and ready to mingle"

now I'm sure my crush is pretty obvious to him so I assume that's why he sent it

and she responded "you crazy" which was kind of out of character because she can be pretty quiet too so I thought that could be a deflection, right

I thought that was a good sign

but apparently she asked a sophomore (we're juniors) to prom (which is in like March) even though as far as I know she has never even met him

and like I said she can be pretty quiet so this was p surprising too

don't get me wrong, I'm not saying she asked him to try and make it seem like she doesn't like me because they have a ton in common and if I had to pick someone she would want to go with it would be him, but I don't understand how she would know that

 she was basically the light at the end of the tunnel for me

so regardless of why it happened it did and now I don't have anything to live for and it's taking everything in me to not just end it
my life almost seemed to be turning around because i was becoming less of a piece of shit and getting somewhere but that doesn't mean anything if I don't have anyone to be a better person for
