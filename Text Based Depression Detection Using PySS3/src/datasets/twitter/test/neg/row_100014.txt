I wish I had stayed in the carLast summer I made the worst choice of my entire life by cheating on my girlfriend of four years. The next six months, after she had more or less fallen out of love with me I became so depressed that all I could think to do was smoke weed all day every day and spending the entirety of my time listening to music or on reddit. Not applying for jobs, not doing chores. I wasted time time smoking all day for months.  


She kept giving me chances to improve and I kept promising her I would, but then I never actually committed to changing until after she left me in January, shortly after I had gotten out of the psych ward for suicidal thoughts and having been denied a stay at a rehab facility due to my depression and psychosis. Two months later, after getting dumped, I finally get into rehab with my ex telling me we might get back together once I sobered up and started to prove myself to be an independent adult.  Then three weeks into rehab, the night after she had come to visit me giving me hugs and kisses, she tells me she's got plans to hook up with her male friend the weekend after.  


First off, how the fuck did she expect me to stay sober and change for the better after putting me through that? I guess what goes around comes around but she didn't have to fuck with my mind the way she did. This was week after I'd attempted suicide for the fifth time, which nobody knew about. Back in December I experienced my fourth suicide attempt by parking in the garage with an old car. I changed my mind just at the point that the carbon monoxide started making me feel dizzy.  


I don't feel like killing myself now, but I kinda wish I had stayed in the car.
