My sexuality is ruining me.It's safe to say that I know I'm gay, and it pains me day after day knowing that I cannot change how I feel. Typically, a person would not have a problem with this, except that I'm a Christian.

There's so many debates that rage on every day on Christianity and its stance on being gay. The general consensus is that it's a morally and ethically wrong, and that it should be tolerated, but never accepted. This is where I truly have conflicting emotions. Suicide becomes more appealing day by day, and it terrifies me. I'm terrified that I'll soon take the leap and off myself, not caring about the consequences anymore. 

I'm tired of being considered a crazy and radical religious person, because I'm not. I'm tired of fighting to wake up in the morning knowing all I can think about is what I feel inside. I'm saddened as well, knowing I'll never amount to commiting to a relationship because my guilt would eat me alive. If I had just been born in any other life, I feel like I'd be better off by am immense margin. Most of all, I'm tired of constantly raging war in my head against myself.

I feel disgusting. Dirty. Letting my personal emotions getting in the way of being a devout Christian. Of being a complete hypocrite to both the Christian and LGBT communities. I don't feel as if I belong anywhere.

The hole just seems too deep, and I don't see a way out. It's dark. I wish I could get some help, but I care more about not disappointing those around me more than myself. I abhor my way of thinking. It's quite stressful. I never feel as if someone truly understands. Everyone I have talked to has always leaned to one side, be gay and guilty or Christian and miserable. They're comfortable with the choice they've made, yet, here I sit continuing to be conflicted. Forgive me if I sound mentally challenged. I might just be.

I grow weary by the hour. Aside from everything, my problems never are taken seriously due to my age. It's difficult trying to make someone take me seriously at the mere age of sixteen. I'm simply a fetus, as many like to say. I can assure you I lose sleep and cry on end because of this. 

Life is beginning to seem rather worthless. Should I take my life? It'd be quite selfish of me, but I'm slowly drifting away from the thought. My self image and confidence have plummeted, and my effort is nearly nonexistent. 

I just want to die. I'd never wish this on my worst enemy.
