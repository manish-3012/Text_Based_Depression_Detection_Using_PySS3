I'm tired.I'm so tired. I'm so tired of being the bad guy and my mother's least favorite child. I'm tired of being left up with no ride at a place I'm working at that takes a good six hour walk to get home from. Tired of getting stuck in jobs that makes me unhappy. Tired of feeling like garbage all of the time. So tired of being the ugly, depressed chick that jokes about depression and suicide as if she's not actually sad. Because talking about it for real is still taboo. 

I keep seeing the old 'it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem's but... How long is temporary? I've been depressed, lonely and sad since middle school and I'm 26 now. I've been waiting for it to get better for over 10 years. I even quit one job that made me super unhappy in attempt to finding something new that might change things, but I don't like this new job either. 

I think the idea of things getting better is a load of crap. Not everyone gets to be happy in life. Some of us are just meant to have the crap end of the stick. Otherwise, how do you find a baseline for 'happy'? Not everyone can be rich, not everyone can be happy. 

I think I might do it. As soon as I figure out how and a way that'll work for sure. I'll miss my dog but she's better off anyway.
