I'm doneI am done... I have been trying to run our failing business for months alone... Wife had cancer, Breast surgery, full hysterectomy... gall bladder out... shes had nothing but medical issues for the last 3 years... hasn't even been in our store in almost a year... wants me to pay her almost 3k in salary and she doesn't even ever show up... I am 22k in debt through the store... we have 4k of property taxes due in 5 days... I don't even pay myself through the store, I am collecting unemployment at $430 a week since I was laid off from the full time job I had in April...  our hours are 11-7, I am here at 8-9am, don't leave until 8pm, I don't pay myself a dime so she can sit at home, do nothing and make 3k.... in the last 9 months, I got 22k in debt with the company we get our equipment from... in 9 months I have paid her 27k... enough to pay the debt and then some... the company pays her health insurance at $600 a month on top of the 3k a month salary... I am trying to keep my head above water.. I have always been good at that... I've been broke and homeless, I've lived at a homeless shelter before... whats even worse is that she's worth, on paper, about $400,000.  if she transferred any money to anything... we lose money... she's worth money... she has money... I just want a paycheck... and I want to pay our company debt... and I can't... if I tell her we are 22k in the hole because I've been paying her, she will shut down our store... then I really have nothing... I am so depressed, I am so sad... I feel I am at such a loss... if she shuts everything down... I wont even have a purpose.... I am old, and not cute, and overweight with messed up teeth because I don't have $40k to fix them.... I just want to go... my ex... my day 1, my 100% died at 48 yrs old on July 15th.... 14 days after her birthday... I feel I would be 100% better off with her where she is.... lets not forget that I am now a drunk... all I do is drink... it takes my mind off shit... my father drank himself to death at my age.... I want to follow... I don't have it in me anymore to be strong, work through it... be okay on the other side... I just dont... I have been through so much... I kicked drugs cold turkey, i've been to jail, I have been homeless, I have always struggled and always figured it out.. I don't want to figure it out anymore... I just dont.... I am done...
