College Dropout, Soon to be Dead.After trying to fight my way through college, the place everyone promised me i would be happy, I moved back home with my mom and things are getting worse everyday. Something has changed in her and she has gone from a happy friendly person whose only concern for me was whether i was making myself happy, to a mean aggressive person who belittles and berates me constantly. When i was thinking about dropping out, she told me she was fine with it, that she only wanted me to be happy. I know now she was lying, and through that lie has made life worse for both of us. I moved back because i was in a horrible head space and thought being home would make it better, but her constant anger and aggression towards me makes me hate life. I give myself about a month.
