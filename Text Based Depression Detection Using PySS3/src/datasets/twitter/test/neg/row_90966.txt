My mother told me to go kill myself.She told me to kill myself however I like, just don't make it to the news because that would make her so embarrassed.

"How could I ever go in public again if they know that I have a daughter that killed herself" She said this again and again and again. This is all she ever care about. Herself. Just herself. I have depression for more than 10 years I asked her for money so I could go see psychiatrist but she said she would rather lock me up in the house than risking let anyone see me may have mentally illness. "Embarrassing,Embarrassing,Embarrassing" If i get a dollar every time she say these words I would be a millionaire by now.

I don't really want to die. I want to leave the house and start my life over someplace very far away where I don't have to make my mother embarrassed anymore. But I know that they will try to find me anyway because they don't want me to embarrass myself. All I can see the future is me killing myself.
