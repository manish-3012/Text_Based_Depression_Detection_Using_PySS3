Long winded hysterical rant about why i wanna diei am one of five kids between two divorced asshole parents. my parents had me at 17(mom) and 21(spermman). i have a brother that everyone hid from me untill i was seventeen. My parents divorced right after his birth( a year and seven days after my birth!) i have a half sister as a result of an affair(my sperm donor's). i have another half sister(the product of my dad remarrying) and another half sister on the way now(mom cheated on my amazing stepdad and is preggo) when it was just my mother and i, she never did or said anything unusual to me that i remember. i was often lkeft with random babysitters so she could go "be young". never had health insurance or anything and men were in and out of my life quite frequently. my biodad beat his wives and i saw it but it never happened to me. my mother kinda ignored me and would randomly say things to me like "burden" "too much" "ungratefful" etc. i was very small and only tried harder to help out. we were very poor and lived in section 8 housing(welfare homes) i never had new school clothes or anything but that didn't matter because i was happy just being outside or talking to my dolls and furniture. when mom married my step dad it was the greatest thing. she started to notice me gaining weight and picked at me for being fat(i wasn't actually fat) but my stepdad stood up for me. my biodad also has a bunch of random kids that he seeded and never took care of. so anyways.. my stepdad jason is a great guy. slowly but surely he started noticing my mom saying things that were weird to me. personal injuries and such. she left him and ended up with ray. ray called me sexy at 12. he pinched me, pulled my hair, hit me, grounded me, and eventually went on to beat her. she never listened to any of the things i told her about him until he finally hit her. then she went back to jason. things were ok until we moved. she started doing her graduate work at a pretty good university. then the real trouble started. she would tell my friends' moms that they were on drugs, thus alienating me from my peers. she smoked weed but grounded me for not making my bed. she hit me kicked me whipped me and all that lovely stuff. she would tell everyone else that i hated her because i was a bad kid, or that i wouldn't listen to her. i told her i was sexually assaulted and she asked me how i could have let that happen. i got into a car wreck(i was a passenger and the only one hurtin a drunk driving wreck) and the whole time we were at the hospital in icu (2 mnonths) i couldnt eat and she would bring delicious food in and eat it in front of me. she complained about having to be in memphis for so long, and what was i going to do about the immense doctor bills that were to come. i was fifteen. my jaw was wired shut and she had plans for xmas dinner so she didnt want me there i guess. she sent me for a visit with bio dad. after telling me how much i looked like my mom and acted like her, he proceeded to get really drunk on xmas eve and hit me in my broken wired shut jaw. i ran into my baby half sister's room, locked the door, and held her sooo close until his wife came home and sent him away. i called my mom and she said she was entertaining guests and couldnt come get me. 2 teeth were broken in the back(molars) and she told me we didnt have money for it. however she did have money to rent a house from the man she was cheating on jason with at the time. i knew and she told me if i said anything she would leave me and jason. at seventeen i was a huge party kid, because the everyday fighting beatings and mental/verbal abuse sucked. drugs were my answer. there was one day i hid from her and she came running through the house and picked me up off my floor by my upper arms and asked me what the fuck was wrong with me. i had been crying because of usual boy girl breakup stuff. she slapped me until i stopped crying and told me she wished she could just leave us or just me. i decided then to move out. i left, finished high school and applied to college. little did i know that she got my vanderbilt acceptance letter in the mail and threw it away. so i went to another super shitty school. i dropped out because i got the shit beat out of me by a boyfriend and was trapped and beaten for three days before i tricked him into going to a friend's house where my best guy friend was waiting for him. i moved back home only to discover the car that had been stolen from my house while i was in college was sitting in her driveway. she told me about the vandervbilt thing and the car thieving. she told me that because of having me at seventeen she didnt have a good chance. she asked me why i deserved a better chance than she had. i ended up moving back in with her and jason because my job fell through and i became broke. she charged me three hundred dollars a month to sleep in the living room. i had to buy my own things but i was just happy to have a chance to start over. i knew she was still cheating on jason. she told me i was a fucked up drughead(i was) and that she wouldn't take any of it. weed only. i said ok. she then kicked me out because i was cramping her space. i moved in with a friend and began paying bills. she told me that me and my druggie friends would get caught(no more drugs for me after i moved out mind you) so i was sober and she called the cops on me. so finally i had enough of her shit. then it happened. i got uninvited to xmas dinner this past year because she got caught by jason with one of her fuck buddies. a different fuck buddy told jason about the situation. she left jason and asked me to move in with her to help her pay bills. i said yes because i desparately needed her approval and i still wish she would love me.i moved in and found out she was pregnant. mny teeth started hurting from all the wreck damage and i asked her to help me pay for it or at least sign a loan with me so i could pay it myself. she said that she was done providing me with a security blanket(i have paid rent in my house since i began working at age fourteen). she said that i was an adult and if i wanted a hand out i should just go get pregnant. she told me that the sexual assault, beatings, car wreck and being born were my fault. i have inconveinenced her for too long and now its time to move on. iam now over 200,000 dollars in debt because she never took care of the wreck insurance things. i am 21 now. this is six years later and she says that because she didnt handle it then i have to deal with it now. she took out a loan for my physical and mental therapy sessions in my name when i was fifteen and thats another 4000. my dental work lefftover from the wreck is another 5600. so now i am young, poor and deeply in debt at the very beginning of my adult life. she seems to be jealous of my opportunities and every time something hapens(good or bad) she somehow uses it to exploit me. she has never told me she loved me, never initiated hugs or kisses. just so cold and unfeeling. i dunno if i mentioned it but i am a rapid cycling bipolar type 2 sufferer and all the drugs i did to make me feel better also made me kinda crazy. mom said i don't need medication because it doesn't work.
 i am scared of losing my bipolar because the mania helps me work and be creative. i work 20 hours everyday at two jobs and only make 80 buck every two weeks because i am in this unpaid internship. poverty sucks when you have no one to help around you
i just wish i had a family that calle or gave a shit or did anything besides birth me abuse me and abandon me.
i wish i could scream loud enough for them to hear
