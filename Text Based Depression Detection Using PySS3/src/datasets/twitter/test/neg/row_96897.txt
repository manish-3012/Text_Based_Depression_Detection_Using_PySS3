No point - thinking of ending it allSumming it up as short as possible.

I'm almost 16. There are 13 year old girls that have a lower voice than me. I have exactly 3 friends, none of them take me seriously. My parents call me hopeless almost every day. (I can't disagree. I can't even hang up a wall painting on my own). I'm ugly as shit and overweight. I will never have children to take care of, nor a girlfriend/first kiss. I tried to teach myself video editing to distract myself from real life, but it caused me being bullied online as well because of my cancerous cringy videos. I don't believe in my dreams anymore either.

I don't have a future,
I don't have the drive to continue,
I don't have the will to live anymore.
