Death is better than jailI may very well go to jail for a non violent crime in which no one even got injured. I was booked for 72 hours and put in the crazy person cell, no clothes, no toilette, no bed, no shoes. The cell itself was covered in piss,shit,semen and pubes and i'm not exaggerating. 

Goddamn the state of Texas, I wish a slow death on whoever made it law that the depressed had to live in such a state. You're in a cell like that for 24 hours a day. Pending sentencing, I may kill myself rather than go back to that hell for what could be months. This should act as a warning to all of those on the brink. 

My feeling towards the guards who threatened and lied to be are summed up in a Tony Soprano quote 
"May your mother die of cancer of the eyes"  I never knew what hate was, thanks to my actions and the behavior of TDJC Travis County Sheriffs, I now do. I will hurt no one but myself. It takes immense self control not to succumb to cutting just to relieve the stress.


This decision brings me peace, it helps me sleep at night.
