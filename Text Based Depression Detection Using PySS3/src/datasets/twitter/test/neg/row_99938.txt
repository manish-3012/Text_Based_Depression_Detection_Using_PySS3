TiredI seriously don't know how much more time I have or care to have. Everyday takes something more from me, and I have nothing for it. I'm just fucking tired. Tired of the slog. Tired of the frustration. Tired of the loneliness. The only end will come next month when I finally end it all.

Don't listen to those who try to talk you down. These people don't care about you or want to help. They only care about their own gratification. Life is not something to be tolerated until you just die anyway. I'm just done.
