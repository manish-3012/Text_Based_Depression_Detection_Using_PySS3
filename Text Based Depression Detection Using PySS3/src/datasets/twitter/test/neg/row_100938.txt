So alone.I am so alone. Despite a husband and kids. Im alone. I hate myself, I hate my life, I feel so worthless and insignificant. The few close friends I have I barely see. Family and friends I try to connect with all ignore me or leave me out. I am trying but I constantly jjst want to die. The only thing preventing me from killing myself is the kids. I dont want to fuck them up but I just dont know how to live anymore. I just don't. They need a better mom.
