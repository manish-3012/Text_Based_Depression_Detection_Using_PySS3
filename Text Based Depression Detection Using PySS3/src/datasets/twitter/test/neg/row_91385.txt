Please ignoreI'm so alone I dont have anyone and it's all because I'm worthless. I just feel so extremely stupid and whenever I think back about everything. Imagine I'm this useless and worthless of a human and I actually believed that someone cares about me. I dont even know if I should laugh or cry about the fact that I was this stupid and delusional to believe someone cares about me. I just shouldn't have existed and more importantly I shouldn't keep existing.
