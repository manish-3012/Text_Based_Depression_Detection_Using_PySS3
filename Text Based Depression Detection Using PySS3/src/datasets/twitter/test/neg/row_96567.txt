can't continueI hate myself. I have nothing. I have no one. I hate my god damned genetic clusterfucked code. I am trapped in this shitty bipolar, fucking anxiety ridden rotten brain. The thought of having to wake up as myself fills me with dread and despair which I can't describe. I don't see how things will ever change or get better. I am either stuck with myself or have to die.
