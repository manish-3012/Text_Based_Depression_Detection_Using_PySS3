I've decided that I'm going to kill myself once I run out of moneyThanks to my depression, I can't work full time, and thanks to my depression ruining my chances of getting into graduate school, I can't get a job that pays more than ~$10 an hour. I can barely cook for myself some days, the cheapo rent in town costs me ~$500 a month, my medical bills are piling up. Thanks to my brother raping me as a kid, I can't even take advantage of being transgender to prostitute myself out to make ends meet. My family is abusive and blames me for all my failures. I keep on taking out credit cards to pay off my other credit cards, but eventually the credit agencies are going to figure me out.

I can't afford to live, so I guess the only option I have is to die. I keep on hoping for a miracle, maybe I'll even try to use my death to make the world a better place, but I've made my peace with death. It's inevitable.
