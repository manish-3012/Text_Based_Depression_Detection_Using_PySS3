Iâ€™m so close to ending it all, but my boyfriend and my kitten is holding me back.Everyday lately has slowly become agony to me, the entire time I just want to cry or scream or punch myself over and over again. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can live with myself and deal with this. Iâ€™m worthless, Iâ€™ve only been a disappointment to everyone, I canâ€™t keep going.
