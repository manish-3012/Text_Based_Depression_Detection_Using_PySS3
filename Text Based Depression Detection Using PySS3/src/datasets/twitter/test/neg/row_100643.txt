I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing wrongI feel like thereâ€™s nothing I can do. All I want is someone by my side. That warmth feeling you get with someone.

Iâ€™ve put myself out there, way out of comfort zone. I had all the dating apps, I got no matches. Iâ€™m not exaggerating when I say that. I even used a photo mod app to better my appearance and still nothing. Parties, events, small gatherings, you name it. Nothing. 

My roomates are always brining a girl over or being in the mix of one. Not me.

I canâ€™t find anyone. Iâ€™ve come to the realization that Iâ€™m ugly.  I cry at night asking myself and god why canâ€™t I just find a person. 

I want to have that experience of cuddling, enjoying each otherâ€™s company, a real relationship.

Iâ€™m 22. Virgin. I post fake pics/videos on Snapchat to let others know I have a life and Iâ€™m with girls. Thatâ€™s how embarrassed I am of myself.

I just want to have what others have. Iâ€™ve been trying for so long I donâ€™t think I can continue. Not a prayer, cash, or what can help me.

What did I do to deserve this. I just wanna be loved and help each otherâ€™s life.
