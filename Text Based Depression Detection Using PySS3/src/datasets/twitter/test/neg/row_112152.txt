My family would be better off without meI don't have that much to say, I feel like my depression has turned me into such a negative person to be around that it would be better if I just go ahead with it. 
I mean I have a plan and the things to do it with so why not, it's not like many people would miss me. While my family would be upset they'd eventually realize they're happier without me.
