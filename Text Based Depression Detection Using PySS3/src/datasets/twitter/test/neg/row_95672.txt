Need some solid advice from fellow reditors. PLEASE!!Hi I'm new here. Just found this. Basically I'm 20, and got degenerative disc disease because of my stupidity. I can never do any sports ever again and even sitting and walking is pain. Also have other joint issues. I'm a student doctor in the UK and don't think I can make it anymore sitting lectures, walking around hospital ect. Everything I ever wanted to do is impossible now. To add to that my girlfriend left me suddenly and got engaged a month later. I really don't see a way for the better anymore. The pain meds are losing their effectiveness, and I haven't found hotlines useful. Idk what to live for anymore
