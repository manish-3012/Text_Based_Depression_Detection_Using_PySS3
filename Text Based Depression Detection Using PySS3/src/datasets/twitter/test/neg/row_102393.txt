Shotgun ready to goFinally got the shotgun. Date set for this Friday 9/15 for personal reasons. Why? Suicide myths debunked, at least for me.  

1. "It's a temporary solution to a permanent problem." Not for me. Been suicidal for nearly 10 years, been planning all along. I am suicidal over a cosmetic issue that will never resolve or get better.    

2. "Don't do anything rash." Been planning for 5 years, suicidal for almost 10.  

3. "Get help." Have had no fewer than 5 psychiatrists, tried 7 or 8 different medications, several inpatient hospitalizations have not helped. Family gives me shit all the time, they fucking hate me. Friends do the same. What "help" should I be getting here?

4. "Your family and friends will hurt." Good. They have and continue to make me hurt over and over and over. Why should I suffer just so they can keep living their shitty lives making other people miserable? I have asked them for help, I have asked them to stop, I have asked them for grace. Nothing. More laughter, more teasing, more shitting on me. I have NEVER once mocked my family or friends, always done my best to be there for other people, and what do they do? Mock me, laugh at me, fucking call me a freak. I hope they fucking suffer.    

So give me one good reason why I should keep living? There's no solution, no help, no family and friends I care about. This isn't temporary and will not resolve.
