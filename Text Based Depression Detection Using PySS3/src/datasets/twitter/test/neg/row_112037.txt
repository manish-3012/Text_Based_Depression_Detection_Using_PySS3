Dad just gave me another lecture about work19, male, UK

Title pretty much sums it up, dad gave me another lecture of how I need to go out in the big wide world and to get a job even though I have a job as a Graphics Designer, he canâ€™t see it. Third lecture in a week, third time cutting in a week. He said thereâ€™s something wrong with me, yet he canâ€™t fucking see that heâ€™s the one causing my depression. Has never been there for me or my birthday but now he thinks he can tell me what to do.
