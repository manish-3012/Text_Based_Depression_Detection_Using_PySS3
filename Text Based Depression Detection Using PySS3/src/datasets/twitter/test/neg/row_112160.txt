A wandering soul invisible and forgotten by the world.I don't understand this reality I "exist" in, I don't know why I've been subjected to soo much pain, misery and depression.  

People say they're inspired by my strength... but inside, my heart is nothing more than a shriviled black prune.  

When I ask for help, my problems are always invalidated (since there's always someone else "worse off").  

I would always lend a hand... I would always share my last sweet... I would always help you or anyone else when they needed it the most. I forever support people and get nothing in return. It feels like when I do a good deed I receive nothing but punishment.  

This world is greedy.  
This world is unforgiving.  

This world doesn't care about who or what I am or strive for. It feels like my efforts to make a difference will always go unnoticed.  

I just want a hug right now. I want to be able to smile. Talk to someone. Love someone.  

But I am too shy to talk to anyone. I have no friends, motivation or creativity. I've been jobless for years, I'm broke, depressed, lost and disconnected from reality. I'm negative, bitter, tired and I just want to die.  

Suicide feels like my best option right now to escape, but I don't want to be selfish to those who love me.

Why do I exist.
