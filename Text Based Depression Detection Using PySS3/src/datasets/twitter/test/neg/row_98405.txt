I can't stand everything about myself.I don't know why so many people have hope that I'll ever succeed in life. At this point, all I want to do is end my life as soon as I can.

I don't have any friends, and the only one I have is merely an online friend from a different country from mine. I'm too afraid to even say to him that I have a crush on him (not like i seen his face anyway). I am really unattractive for a girl, from having no feminine quirks at all to having an ugly physical disability that turns boys away. I have been diagnosed with both low-functioning autism and social anxiety ever since this year and I have been stuck in special needs classes throughout my entire school life. I hate a lot of people and can't stand going outside. And to top it all off, I am a bitter, angry and violent person. If I even make one tiny slip-up like sitting the wrong way or mispronouncing a word, I would beat myself up about it. Sometimes literally.

I treat everybody like fucking garbage. A while ago, I got back from living on my own for the first time for two weeks, and it was so therapeutic. But when I'm back at my actual home, I'm still verbally abusive to a lot of people for no reason. My mum and I get into verbal fights a lot because of my hellbent stubbornness. I scare my dog a lot because I scream too much. I hate my older brother for being too aloof around me and hanging out with his well-off girlfriend more than me. And yet I shouldn't be this angry, because everybody wants the best from me and my parents have put in the effort to pay off the loans for the family house. And I don't even hit anybody at all, because I really do love the people who support me. But I can't get over my grief and my hatred for myself since 5 years ago. No matter how much I try to love myself, I just go back to hating.

I'd rather end all of this rage inside of me now than grow old and die alone. Everybody loves to laugh at angry people anyway.
