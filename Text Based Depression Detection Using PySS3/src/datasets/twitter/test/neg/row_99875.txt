i dont know what to dohi, i have a rope around my neck right now, i dont know if itll hold, im afraid of the pain, but i dont want to keep on going, everyday sucks, my girlfriend is a bitch, i know it but i ignore it, she tries to distance me from my fam, but i knock it down right away, but it wears on me. when she mad, she says the true shit no one wants to hear, but she right, im unemployed, many years outta of college, graduated with a worthless degree, got too fat...i just want to end it i guess, but im a little scared, i have a rope around my neck, its twine, but im ready to do it, but im scared...

im not drunk enough to try it, but im drinking more, i wrote a note too, all goes to my bro
