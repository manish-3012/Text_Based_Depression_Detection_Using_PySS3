I can't take it anymore.All I am is bitched at for the little things. All I am is the bad guy when I did nothing wrong. I'm the one who's shunned. Ignored. By almost everyone. Majority of my entire family. I'm just "that kid". Im so fucking done. With everyone and everything. I know that I'm forever dirt. It's fucking bullshit. Fuck everyone. Fuck everything. I can't fucking do this and it's pissing me off. Stop expecting shit from me. I'm just dirt. Just like everyone thinks.
