There's nothing I can do. Seriously. [15M]First off, I have depression, I'm gay and no one knows, I'm a creationist along with my family, I don't have friends, and my school/ parents choose to ignore all the bullying I deal with. I haven't told anyone I'm gay, but I get called faggot daily, a kid stabbed me with a pencil yesterday and another person told me some people deserved to be stabbed. My parents just say "I'm sensitive, I need thicker skin, I don't really get bullied kids are just cruel." I don't know what else to do. Sure school will end then what? Go to college, get a job, never get married, die, the end. Why not just skip all the cruelty. I'm not that sad I just don't want to live in such a cruel immoral world anymore.
