kill them or myself?I want to kill myself, but do I really deserve to die? Why should I end it when theyâ€™re the ones making me suffer. I just want strangle them and watch them die as they suffer , trying to get out of my grip. Or maybe I just want to put the noose around my neck and suffer the withdrawal of air?? Does my family really deserve the luxury of existence? 

 I donâ€™t know wether to kill them or kill myself.
Nothing ever changes. Theyâ€™ve all turned against me and have made my life a living hell. So they can all just die. Or would it be better if I never existed? Has anyoneâ€™s existence ever mattered. If the beginning and the end are one in same then why go on? Whatâ€™s the point? If Iâ€™m just living to die. 

If I die right now the world keeps spinning, time doesnâ€™t stop and everyone goes on about their day. Would they respect me more in the state of death I put myself in? Or would they just hate me more because I achieved the ecstasy that is death?? Would they really mourn? 

No, I donâ€™t think so. I think theyâ€™ve driven me this far just to watch me die. 

I thinks thatâ€™s what they all want . Iâ€™m sorry I was such a burden.  I didnâ€™t know that being me caused you to hate so. Iâ€™m sorry , I shouldâ€™ve been better. To save you anymore trouble I think Iâ€™ll do it far away . Where you wonâ€™t find me and there wonâ€™t a ceremony, burial, etc. Iâ€™ll go through the trouble and do the work for you. Nature will be my casket, where animals will thrive and feed on me until Iâ€™m nothing but bone . 

Again Iâ€™m sorry and donâ€™t force yourself to forgive me. Iâ€™m the one at fault not you. Iâ€™ll do it once I can get out and I can see that you canâ€™t stand me anymore .
