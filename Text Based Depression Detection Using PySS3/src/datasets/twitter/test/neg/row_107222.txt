21 and have no reason to live. only using a throwaway because my for-now significant other is also a redditor. 

i've lost everything.

a month ago, my boyfriend got an apartment and invited me to stay with him. i'm not on the lease, and he has another roommate. the first week was perfect. we adopted a gorgeous kitten, celebrated my 21st birthday, and generally had a ton of fun all the time.

last night, he tells me rather abruptly that he's tired of me and bored with the relationship, and needs space. okay, that's fine and to be expected after moving in together, and i agreed to give him space, and came to live with my parents until monday. however, he mentioned that he's had that conversation four or five times before, and it's always been the prelude to the breakup. i'm pretty sure it's going to happen on monday. we've been together almost a year, and i'm completely content and happy with our relationship, adore him, and sincerely want to continue seeing him. 

i had to drop out of college because of a severe eating disorder, and was ready to go back this fall, but my credit union screwed up my tuition so much that i can't go. on top of that, i've got no medical insurance. with my eating disorder, i'll probably die without treatment. so, in some ways, i feel like i'm just jumping the gun and making it happen sooner rather than later. 

i can't work because i tore something in my wrist, and i need surgery within the next two weeks. so, i'll be sitting in bed at my parents' house drugged up and in pain. 

it's only 8:30 and i feel like it's midnight. time has just stopped completely. i know i'll be crying all night and get no sleep, so the idea of time standing still is even worse. 

where do i go from here? i have nothing to look forward to, no friends to speak of, and i don't know how i'm going to handle being dumped on top of all of that. i'm just so lost.
