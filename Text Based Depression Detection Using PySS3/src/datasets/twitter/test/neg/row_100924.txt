Why is it so hard to just do itIve had the thought of suicide constantly buzzing around my head every waking moment for over 10 years. And in that 10 years have expierienced heartbreak in multiple different ways that only makes life harder to live. All the pain and memories are still there years later. I know how id do it if I could ever go through w it but the love I have for the people around me stops me. Or I say that to myself maybe I'm afraid but either way I dont want to live anymore. This life is torture inside and no one around me even knows where I am in my own head.
