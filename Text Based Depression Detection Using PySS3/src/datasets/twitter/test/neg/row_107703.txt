Tell me why I shouldn't do it.I was forced out of a job and all but fired during covid. I worked as a web designer, and we had 3 web developers quit during covid so I inherited all their responsibilities, I'm NOT a programmer. I've never took a programming class in my life. I told this to my boss and he didn't care, told me I should be able to do the same work as people with computer science degrees. I tried to do it, but everyday was just a huge panic attack realizing the 2 daily stand ups we have are 2 meetings where I just get yelled at in a zoom meeting in front of everyone to demean me. I reached the point I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, and couldn't even watch TV because I felt like I had to be studying programming.

After a month of no sleep and losing 40 pounds, I decided to quit. My boss threw a fit with the typical "you can't leave and fuck me over" shit. It was a terrible 2 weeks. Not one person said goodbye to me or asked me anything. It sucks, because I thought if I went into web design it would be full of quiet people like me. But nope everyone is some epic guy, who just has to have a zinger for everything everyone says.

Fast forward I have a part time job, but it's not enough. I applied for over 300 jobs. It was the only offer I got. I WANT to work.

I don't know how much longer I can live like this. Eventually the pigs are going to knock down my door to evict me. (Please close this window if you want to post some pro-cop bullshit) The whole system of capitalism exists as social Darwinism to push weak people like to kill themselves. (Also please close this window if you're some bootlicker who's going to say the free market provides or some bullshit) 

I don't have health insurance anymore of course. So no more doctors or therapist visits. I'd like to see how you fuckers think this is fair. I'm so goddamn tired of hearing how I need to fix myself when a system that just exists so rich pedophile friends of Epstein can get richer while working class people lose their homes. 

Yeah that's right I'm a communist. Don't feel so sympathetic for me now huh? 

Fuck America, fuck for profit healthcare, fuck bosses, fuck it all.

I'm probably going to end it soon.
