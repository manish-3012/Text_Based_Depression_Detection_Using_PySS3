My journey is coming to an endI decided that tonight will be the night that I know peace. I've lost hope that things will ever get better. My mother is dead and my father refuses to talk to me, and the rest of my family has always been distant. The only true friend I ever had has been dead for two years. I broke up with my girlfriend in June of this year. I work a shit job with a bunch of assholes. I have no one left and nowhere else to go. So for months I've just been sitting alone in my apartment and drinking myself stupid. But no amount of whiskey will ever scrub away all those memories. Anything good that happens to me is only there to build me up so that I can be knocked down even harder. Everything and everyone I ever loved has slipped though my fingers like sand. I know that I've done what I can to be there for my loved ones. I've fought in earnest to be the best man that I could be, and there's no shame in the way I've spent my life. But if I'm going to leave this world it's going to be on my terms. In a couple hours I'll be walking out into the woods along one of my favorite trails to a spot by a stream that runs through there. I want the last thing I see to be something of beauty. I want to hear the rushing water and the leaves in the wind, and I want to smell that earthy smell that comes after the rain. And I don't want a clean up crew scraping bits of me off the walls, so it's best that I do this in a spot where it won't inconvenience anyone.

But why am I posting this here? I guess it's because I don't have anyone else to talk to, and no one to leave a suicide note to. I suppose strangers on the internet will suffice. Thanks for reading. I'll be on here for like another hour or two. Feel free to ask or say whatever.
