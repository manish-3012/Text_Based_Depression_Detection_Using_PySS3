"Don't leave me."I have a few times vented to my friends about my feelings. One time, my friend told me she'd kill herself as well, if I did.

 **"Don't leave me."**

I feel so heavy. So sick whenever I think of it. It's not a comforting tether keeping me alive. It's like painful, hard shackles.

I feel like I'm physically fighting to stay alive, and I'm fucking exhausted.
