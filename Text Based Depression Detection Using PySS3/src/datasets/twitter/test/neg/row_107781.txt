I want to talk to somebody about my suicidal tendencies, but I donâ€™t want to end up in the psych ward.... again.I had an attempt to OD on my meds last year. The only thing the psych ward did was solidify that the next time I attempt itâ€”I will succeed. 

Ordinarily, I would experience these feelings in moments of great stress or trauma, but this entire week Iâ€™ve been beaten down so much that I just feel numb and Iâ€™m contemplating it. 

I ordered some supplies that would provide a painless death (donâ€™t ask me, Iâ€™m not going to give anyone any ideas)â€”and itâ€™s scary but also reassuring just to have that supplies on me. 

If I bring up these thoughts with my boyfriend, he says thatâ€™s a form abuse towards him, and I guess heâ€™s not wrong. 

Iâ€™ve done therapy. Iâ€™ve done meds. Iâ€™m just done. I donâ€™t know when exactly. Iâ€™m anxious that the next time I feel devastated that Iâ€™ll just do it.
