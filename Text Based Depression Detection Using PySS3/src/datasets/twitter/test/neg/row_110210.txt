i wish I could rip out my memorieshow do you reconcile yourself to a hopeless future. I canâ€™t forget all the mistakes Iâ€™ve made, all the opportunities I wasted. I try to make a life for myself but I canâ€™t stop thinking about the life I couldâ€™ve had if I hadnâ€™t fucked up. Iâ€™m so tired of day to day living and I just think more and more about just checking out of this existence for good
