I've set a dateSept 1st, last day.

Christmas was when it really hit me. I'm a fucking leech. 

My sister gave me and my other siblings an incredibly thoughtful gift. All three were crying, and I felt nothing. I don't know why.

I've always been like this, I cant feel for others. I'm just now realizing how fucked up that is.

I only feel sympathetic for heavy family situations and animals.

I don't hate people or resent anybody, I don't know why the way that I am.

I just want to not feel so lonely. I've always felt too weird to be normal, too normal to be weird.

In high school I was friends with such hateful fucking people, I was an incel a few years before they were well known. Maybe more of a neckbeard. I became so isolated because I feared the bullying, I stayed silent, always trying to not make any attention to myself.

I was such a piece of shit, I ate that GamerGate shit right up.

These past few years I've been trying to right all my wrongs, I like to think I've become a better person, why the fuck should i be so upset about how people want to live their life? Let people be who they want to be, nazi fascists can fuck right off.

 Ive come to terms with my sexuality, ive never been super open about that, im bi, im happy with that.

I've closed my Twitter account. Seeing all that toxic incel man baby shit on every game / movie related tweet fucked with my mental health.

Maybe I'll be better soon, but thats okay if I'm not. It might be a little cathartic to sit in my chair, drink a couple pepsi, and watch some Simpsons before it'll be over.

My final summer, hoping it will be a good one.
