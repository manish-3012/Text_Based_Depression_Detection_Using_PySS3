Contacted the Samaritans: They flat out lie.I don't get it. What kick do people get, someone tells you "I have no one. I have nothing. I have no options." and then they just say, "You say you have no one. Do you have any family?".....even though you took time and effort to write up 3+ pages stating polity and clearly, 'I have no family, I have no friends. I have paid people to try and help me better socialize, no change in results."  


I wrote daily, for a week to the Samaratins, and they have lied over and over and over and over. People who 'care' don't ignore everything you've written and said. People who 'care' don't say 100&amp;#37; the opposite of what you have been saying. People who 'care' don't issue copy paste messages.  


HOW...how I am supposed to find any hope if the people who volenteer their time can't even find a reason to listen to me or talk?  


Talk doesn't change anything.  


If I wrote a phone number, and address on here, would someone call the cops? I want someone to kill me. I want the pain to stop.
