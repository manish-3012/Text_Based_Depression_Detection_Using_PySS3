Can't handle fucking anythingI don't even know why I'm on this sub, I used to go on it to comfort people nearly everyday but now it looks like the perspectives have changed. As the title suggests I can't handle anything right now, I am facing juvie, have semi alcoholic parents who I love but have mentally scarred me, have mental health issues (possible schizophrenia) and am in general a pretty horrible person. While writing that last sentence I realised those aren't only thing that I can't handle but also reasons to kill myself which I am coming a bit too close to. I have a plan for when things go south and well, things are starting to go south again. I have many problems but one of the most recent is when I accidentally "stabbed" a boy my age. I remember it so vividly, I walked up and down the school stairs searching for him, at sometime point took the knife out, saw him and then its all a blur. After the blur I remember taking back what he stole from me, turning back to shout "next time you do that, I will put you in hospital" and seeing his left Arm covered I'm red from the elbow to themed waist. I knew what I had done but I was too angry to think about consequences but that image is still burned into my minding I can't get it out.

After that I remember sitting in the schools mental health area which was a small room the size of a large elevator for about 4 hours having a complete mental breakdown. I caught my friends eye from the window and he looked so disappointed, apparently after talking to him he thought had gone insane which I kind of had. When waiting outside the school for the taxi to pick me and mum up, the schools football team started to come out, most of which contained people in my year and my close friends who gave me a look of worry and empathy that almost makes me cry. I heard murmurs as the people I didn't know so well started looking at me because apparently when you stab someone, new travels real fast.

I have a question for anybody who might be reading this. Have you ever have 6 articles written that were about how you stabbed someone or have you ever been searched for weapons twice or ever been asked if you have school officials question you if you have secret pockets for concealing weapons or have you ever been held back from break in school for a week just incase you hurt the boy you stabbed again or ever been treated like a psychopath. Ever had your friends phone you up saying that the cops were just asking him about you and one last thing, have you ever been accused of being a rightwing nazi and thrown of school because if you have not then let me tell you something, all of that shit together affects and stays with a person forever and its not nice at all. it makes a person feel helpless because you are treated as the kid who stabbed someone by teachers and staff. 

I am a horrible person if you can't tell. I am manipulative, a thief, violent, abusive to my mothers because she drinks, hate the person I stabbed more than before I stabbed them and burden my friends with suicidal thoughts when I try to open up. I have caused so much pain to my family that they have to stop working and stop making money. I rely heavily on my friends which I shouldn't because they will probably cut of contact with me after a while.

Before you say "think of your friends and loved ones" just remember  I'm selfish and if I really want to kill myself I would only think of them for a split second because after having learned the hard way, everything has consequences and you can not stop that. anyway thanks for reading, it would be nice to talk to someone who isn't drunk because those are the only people I can talk too at the moment.
