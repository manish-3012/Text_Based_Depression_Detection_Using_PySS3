what is suicide watch/inpatient in a hospital like?i've been in the hospital before for a suicide attempt, but only overnight and for vital monitoring. I have a couple options right now, take a shit load of melatonin and sleep thru my shift at work, drive myself to the hospital and check in for a few days, or end it. I'd like to know what it's like in inpatient before i make my decision.
