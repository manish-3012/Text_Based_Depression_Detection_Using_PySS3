Nothing I do is any goodI just want to die

I have been pushing myself to actually do things even though I know I'm a failure that can't make anything good.

I just spent hours today editing and recording and got it all done in a day, I didn't expect anything good to come out of it but I thought I could at least say I tried.

Now I just want to fucking kill myself because everything I make is worthless and has no merit. I am just a sad, little, pathetic autist who can't do anything.

I have no friends, no one who cares, no skills, no talents, no achievements. I am just a suicidal invalid that can't even fucking die right. 

I wish I had fucking killed myself properly 8 years a go, that way I wouldn't have been able to put myself through the agony of thinking for even a second that anything I make is not complete fucking shit that nobody will or ever should see. 

I make shit because I am shit and that's all I've ever been. No, I am worse than fucking shit, I can't even make shit because I lack the talent to do it.

I just want to die so much.
