Iâ€™m still here, although probably not for long.I made a post on here a while ago that if I got the chance, I would kill myself that weekend. The weekend rolled around and the only reason why I didnâ€™t do it that weekend is because of the flip of a coin. I just decided that if fate wanted me here, it would have to voice its opinion, so I flipped a coin. Heads, I stay alive, tails, I tell my parents Iâ€™m taking a shower and then slit my wrists in the bathtub. This happened the past two weekends, each time the coin landing on heads. In between these weekends as well Iâ€™m not just standing idle, I am trying to talk to people and get help. My online therapist, who helped me through a very hard time before, completely ignores any time I try to get into contact with them, even when I told them it was an emergency and I really needed to talk to them. I even told one of my best friends who I have known for years that I almost killed myself last weekend and you know what he said? â€œ I donâ€™t know what to say about that dude,â€ and nothing else, ending our conversation that we are in. Are you fucking kidding me, the one friend that I have disclosed things to that I would never even say to my own family, just refused to peruse the topic further with me, even though he knew it might lead to my eventual death. My parentâ€™s divorce is getting progressively worse, with each of my parents trying to trounce and belittle the other one, while also getting into shouting matches with my brothers. I just want everything to not be this way. I wish my friends cared if I was alive, I wish my parents still loved each other, I wish everyone would stop yelling all the time, I wish I had someone to talk to, I wish I wasnâ€™t so alone, and I wish I didnâ€™t have to flip a coin to decide my fate. I wish I either had the balls to finally kill myself and end it for good, or the balls to decide to tough it out. I will still be flipping the coin this weekend though. With the way things are going, I hope it lands on tails.
