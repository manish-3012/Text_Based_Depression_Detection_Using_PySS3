I haven't slept so good before in a whileReasons to live? I have only an handful. As these days awaken, I think about them dreams and the broken ones. The life soon to wandered have never felt so close to an end. The joys of being loved and the horrors of being betrayed is just a couple of feelings that may surround the universe. As these days awaken, I always learn that the dark in only present when no light is shed.
