iâ€™m so scaredeverything going on at the minute - the worries of ww3, the sickness spreading from china, global warming, a country literally on fire - is making me worry ill have no future at all. i know iâ€™m just a teenager, but iâ€™m so scared that i feel like a kid again. i want to die right now more than i think i ever have - but at the same time i so desperately want a future that is peaceful.
i have no intention of doing anything, at the end of the day i know i have to stay alive for my familyâ€™s sake, but god iâ€™m not sure if i want to grow up and possibly die in some dystopian novel way or die now and never have the chance to live a good life.
