Trying to find the lightI've realized that I have simply been looking for a place to die. I haven't quite got the courage yet to pull the shotgun...however, I think I'm getting close. I've contemplated slitting my wrists, I've attempted even, but I cant cut deep enough. I've gone a few days without food and water but eventually cave, mostly due to alcohol. 
I have a place to die, but not the courage or determination to do so. 
I just want/need this (life) to be over.
The only thing/reason that kept me going in the past was my daughter.
She's no more....not to me. I don't know where she is, what she looks like, or even if she remembers me. 
The pain of my past with my Ex is so excruciating that I struggle to find hope. I struggle to find anything really. 
I was his puppet. I still am his puppet in some form, for he was my true love...that never truly loved me in the way I loved him.
