I feel like I'm too far goneThink I've just reached a point where nothing is going to work any more. I keep setting myself goals and targets and I've managed to give up on all of them. I just don't have the willpower to make anything of myself, everything I do just reminds me of how useless I feel. I was supposed to sort myself out this year and I've only made everything worse. Exercise isn't working, counselling hasn't worked, I can't find a job, I just feel so sad that I've wasted so much time with nothing at all to show for it. Last night I went from googling college courses to suicide methods without even realising. Normally I can sleep it off and feel better in the morning but not this time. I genuinely feel like I'm past a point where I can still turn things around and I'm just going to keep becoming more and more miserable until I can't continue with it any more. I've never wanted to hurt myself so badly. Can't even look at myself any more. I just want it to stop.
