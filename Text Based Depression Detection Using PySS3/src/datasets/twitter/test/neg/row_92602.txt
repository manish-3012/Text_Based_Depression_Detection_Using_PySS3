3 years are gone. What's the point?3 years. 3 fucken years gone. Earlier today I tried to commit suicide, I wasn't taking my medicine for months, because I thought I didn't need them. I guess I was wrong. I miss my parents. I miss my sister. I miss being natural happy. I'm tired of being called crazy, waste of space, junkie, failure by own grandparents. I miss believing in stuff, I miss caring. Now I barely eat, I don't believe in anything. I hate myself. I hate my appearance, my name, my life. 

I'm so scared to say anything. I tried before, and I payed the price for it. So far I'm "lucky" nobody thinks I'm crazy or posted anything. But for how long? I used to think I was irreplaceable, now I think opposite. The only person that's keeping me going is my last remain immediate family member, my 7 year old sister. Can't even talk to her, she wouldn't understand.

I'm tired of being drugged up, not be able to fucken think, eat,  breathe, and be happy. Maybe killing myself is escaping the problem I don't care anymore. I tried killing myself earlier today, and yet nothing happen. I couldn't pull the trigger. As much as I wanted I just couldn't. I'm tired of bothering other people, and wasting their time. I'm tired of having breakdowns. I'm tired of living. I left my old account and sub reddit behind 3 years ago, thinking I'm fine and "normal". Nothing changed. I'm replaceable your replaceable. Everything is replaceable. I'm gonna try to overdose tonight. God for bid I die.
