Someone to just understandSo I have been wanting nothing more then to just die lately. I'm a 24 year old mom of 2 kids and they are the only reason im still here. I dont have the guts to do that to them. My life is pathetic. I have been struggling with depression for most of my life but people tell me to hang on that it will get better and it doesn't it gets worse. I had my first kid when I was 17 with my high school sweetheart. We were on again off again because he kept breaking my heart and I finally called it off when my son was only a couple months old. He was fueling my depression so I thought I did the right thing. Then I met and hooked up with my 2nd kids dad. I thought I was in love at first. He was a stay at home dad while I worked 40 plus hours a week and 2 hours of drive time a day. I was already depressed but working at a job where my boss was unappreciative then coming home to a messy house and no money drove me even more sad. He would spend most of the money on himself and I was stressed out because I was struggling to make ends meet to keep the utilities on. I wanted to break up with him for a very long time I just could not do it. I hated him for it he was so lazy and all I wanted when I got home was some love and some rest. I would have to deal with the kids if they needed anything while I was home and had to work around my schedule to do doctor visits and parent teacher conferences. I also worked 2 other side janitor jobs just to keep food on the table. All while my doctor kept switching my meds because my depression was just getting worse and nothing was helping. That and I have no family where I live. Its just me and my kids. I felt like such a single parent for so long and that my life was going nowhere. I started talking to a co worker and ended up cheating on him with him. I thought it was ok because I was so mad that I was working so hard on the relationship and he was literally just enjoying life living off my expense. I told him what happened and broke it off with him. I then had 2 kids and me so I was not able to work because school had just gotten out so i lost my job. Im now with the guy I cheated on him with and I feel like im draining him for everything he has got because now he is trying to help me get back on my feet. I understand it is all my fault. I shouldnt have had kids when I did and I did this all to myself. But im really wondering if I should find a way to just let this life go and my kids still be ok. I always thought that I would find the love of my life but I really suck at this and now my kids have to suffer with a broken life because they have different dads and mom cant get her life together. I almost wish I just stuck it out long enough with the secound one because even tho I was completly miserable for years. I even paid off my house and own it and had cars thinking it was for the kids. I had put both of our names on everything and now I have to fight to have the things I paid for. He wants to keep everything because I cheated. I just want to lay down and die. But my main concern is breaking my kids hearts. I feel I have nothing left to give and now im just wasting space and time. I have become what my ex is now. I dont even want to move and have no motivation. Only difference is I spend all day crying my eyes out wishing that life was easier. Now im a tramp with nothing to live for and on food stamps trying to get welfare to even support the kids I have. I wish someone told me when I was like 15 to just take my life then it doesnt get any better. I had already had a shitty childhood and always wanted different for my kids but im failing
