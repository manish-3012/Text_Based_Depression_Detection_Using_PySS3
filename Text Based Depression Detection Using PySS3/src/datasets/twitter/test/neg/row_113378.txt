Completely lostTonight I am spiralling. This may make sense to some of you or it may not but I need to get this out. I've realized how depressed and alone I am. Everything I have done and worked for has lead me here and I have nothing a job a barely like and nothing else. No relationship, no real friends, zero home life, no hobbies and no reason to get up in the morning other than I am supposed too.

My friends have never gone out of their way for me, and never would; I realized for the first time tonight. I plan the parties and pay for them, I build up their confidence and would do anything for them and I am the first one that gets called when they need help but when I need something, where did they go? My parents are indifferent to my feelings and while I am sure they will/would be upset with my passing I am also sure like with everything else it would be all about them.

I am thirty one years old, I have a good paying job and that's it. I am fat, insecure, I haven't gone on a date in 10 years and a nice mountain of debt. I. Have. Nothing. I am convinced that the world wouldn't even miss a breath if I just stopped. No one would even find out until someone from work noticed I stopped showing up.

I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say or what to expect.
