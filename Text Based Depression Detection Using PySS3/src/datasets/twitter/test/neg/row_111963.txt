Iâ€™m planning on ending my life in a few weeksI donâ€™t even know what to say honestly. I never thought I would get to this point. I always have to many thoughts in my head but no words to actually convey them. My mental health has always been absolutely awful but a few months prior to now, I had somewhat of a support system. By support system, I mean one friend I could talk to. As I declined more and more, I cut off myself from my friend. I assumed that I was a burden to everyone, so I stopped talking to them to make their lives a little bit easier. But now, I ruined what we used to have. I feel like crying whenever I see them online. I want to talk to my friends so bad but itâ€™s been so long that Iâ€™m afraid it would be weird now. It hurts me so much that not one of my friends have talked to me since I stopped initiating conversation with them. I thought that someone actually saw me as important, but I havenâ€™t had anyone even give me a simple â€œhelloâ€ after Iâ€™ve spent hours upon hours talking to them. Am I expecting too much? Anyways, my point is that I am completely alone and I donâ€™t have the courage to build up the support system that I once had. My family doesnâ€™t care. They know Iâ€™m not ok. They see a very clear difference between me a few months ago and me now. Any time I tell them I donâ€™t feel well, they blame me for it and say itâ€™s because I went to bed too late or I spent too much time on the computer. I try to talk to them to help them understand, but they always try to shift blame my way. My parents are the type of people that everyone hates right now. They are skeptic about covid and are very conservative. Not to mention they are Christian and have no clue that they have a gay son (me) living under their roof. My computer is the only thing that brings me any happiness anymore, and even that amount of enjoyment is dwindling. School is right around the corner as well. Iâ€™m pressured a lot by my parents to make very good grades, so all the potential enjoyment I could have gotten out of school has been drained and I am stressed and tired (due to my awful insomnia, which my parents also blame me for) all the time. Iâ€™ve always been a straight A student and my parents have held that to me my entire life which is unfair as fuck because now things are actually difficult and not the same 4th grade assignments I used to feel accomplished doing. Might be important to give my age I guess, so I am 17. There is absolutely no way in hell that I am going to live through this school year. Not with my shitty declining mental health on top of the stress of school work and my parents pressuring me to always do well on it. If I donâ€™t, then they will take away my computer, citing it as the main issue to all of my problems. And with that, Iâ€™ve lost everything that I used to enjoy. So for that reason, I want to live this summer break through the best I possibly can, and then end my life right before school. Iâ€™m just going to graduate high school, go to college only to be more stressed, work a job that I hate for the rest of my life, retire, and then die. For what? My life isnâ€™t just hell on earth, itâ€™s just straight up hell. I wish I could get help or something, but no one actually cares or wants to help me unless I have something to provide in return, which I donâ€™t. All of the people who told me â€œIâ€™m here for youâ€ and â€œIf you ever feel bad, then talk to meâ€ have abandoned me, and I am stuck, completely alone with my own thoughts. I literally canâ€™t fall asleep before 5 AM because my own thoughts keep me up for so long, and my parents always force me out of bed by 1 PM for no reason other than they donâ€™t like me sleeping in late. Iâ€™m so tired of being yelled at by them for every small mistake. It makes me really sad. I am exhausted all the time. Thereâ€™s a lot of other stuff I could talk about, but I feel like Iâ€™m babbling on for too long. Itâ€™s 3:41 AM and I really donâ€™t wanna cut my wrist again so Iâ€™m typing this out hoping that this calms me down enough to get me through tonight. I just want someone to talk to me again. If youâ€™ve made it this far then thank you a lot. Even if you have nothing to comment, I really appreciate you taking time out of your day to read my pathetic nonsense. All I want is a hug...
