I want to kill myself for no good reason.Every morning I wake up with the same feeling "I hate myself, I hate my life, I want to die, I'm going to kill myself." I'm 36 and it's  been like this for as long as I can remember. I constantly wonder if today is going to be the day I finally do it. 

And I know I have a million reasons to keep on going. I have a decent job, support myself and have  many friends, family, coworkers and other loved ones that would be devastated if I killed myself. I have creative hobbies like filmmaking and podcasting and a lot of people enjoy what I produce.

And yet the feeling persists. I feel like I'm a terrible person and don't deserve to live. I feel like I'm wasting my life, that nothing I do has any meaning. I have constant feelings of shame and guilt about things I've done in the past. And even though those things were a long time ago, I can't seem to put them behind me even though I've become a better person since then.

I've been seriously depressed for most of the winter. I always get down on life during the cold months but this year was just brutal, when I wasn't at work, all I did was lay in bed watching YouTube videos and wishing that I would just die in my sleep. Sometimes I would lay in bed all day. Thus enhancing the feeling that I'm wasting my life, but I just couldn't seem to get out of bed and be productive. And although the warmer weather has helped out a bit, I'll still sleep away much of the time I'm not at work.

I have so many things that haunt me. I did some terrible things in my early 20s that I could have done serious prison time for. I also impregnated my girlfriend when she was 20 and left her when I was 5 months pregnant. Long story short, I have no contact with my daughter and haven't since she was 3 years old - she's now 12.

I coped with all this in my mid 20s by doing a lot of drugs. Ecstasy was my main drug, I would spend all my free time and money downing as many pills as I could with my raving buddies. Spent 4 years in a constant haze. I eventually overcame it, but I still live with the shame of being a deadbeat drug addict when I should have been going to college and being a father.

I know that even though a lot of these things are really bad, none of them justify taking my own life. But the voices inside my head won't stop telling me that I'm worthless and don't deserve to live. I fantasize about ending my life all the time. It's a constant theme in my head. 

I'm convinced that one day I will die by suicide. It's just a matter of when. And everyday that goes by is a constant battle with these feelings of inadequacy, hopelessness, shame and guilt.

I've been through therapy, and have a psychiatrist that has diagnosed me with Bi-polar II and anxiety. I take my pills everyday. And they help somewhat but the constant critical voices in my head tell me to end it now rather than go through the next 40 years like this.
