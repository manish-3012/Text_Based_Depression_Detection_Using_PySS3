What do you guys think of the usage of Binaural Beats therapy to help with depression?[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats)

Binaural Beats aren't scientifically proven to cause positive effects, but it hasn't been proven to cause negative effects either. It's more of something you'd have to try out yourself. As someone who tried it out yesterday, I must say that, depending on the frequency, some of them work wonders, some of them very little, and some not at all. The worst you'd get would be a headache, in which I'd recommend stopping, but nothing serious. The benefits of using it (if it works) are great, but only temporary. To summarize it up, what Binaural Beats are two different frequencies played in both ears, with only minor differences (Maximum of 30Hz) and it influences your brainwaves to change depending on how it reacts to it.

On Rule III. I am not really advertising it, I'm sharing it. The definition of advocate is "A person who publicly supports or recommends a particular cause or policy." I'm not really recommending it, I'm just sharing what I found and used. If I am somehow violating the rule, tell me so I can rephrase it, or if need be, delete the comment (Or the moderator can do that)

There's one for [Depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tS6g8GiwR0), [Anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnImEKa6FUU), [Anger &amp; Irritability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znEU8nUz7lQ), and a bunch more.

Results may vary, recommended use with Headphones (Pretty much will only work with headphones), and not scientifically proven, and possibly mostly a placebo effect more than anything.
