stop telling me how brave I am for reaching outI don't feel strong, I don't feel brave, I don't feel hopeful. I hate when hotline workers try to assign that shit to me, because it isn't true, and it isn't fair. If I were brave and strong, I wouldn't have given up on life the second that misfortune came my way, but I did. I'm alive by sheer fucking coincidence. I don't want platitudes. I want help.
