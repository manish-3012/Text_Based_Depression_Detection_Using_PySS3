Stuff I Think About When I'm Drowning In SilenceI'm only alive because I can't face the fact of hurting my bestfriend, that's it. I can't bring myself to care about my parents, they don't care about me. My mom finds any reason to yell at me or beat me. My dad says he cares about me, but the minute I say something realistic, wanting to be treated as a person, he threatens to beat me when he sees me, or tells my mom to do it for him. My stepdad blames everything that goes wrong on me, and of course my mom believes him. One time I got the lock taken off my door, because I spent too much time in my room. EVERYONE in my family is homophobic, my dad went so far as to tell me that my moving to America messed with my mind, and that's why I support LGBTQ+, I'm Pan, fluid flux. All the signs show that I'm not wanted, so why am I sticking around? I once had a panic attack in front of my mom and stepdad, (they don't know about my mental health problems, I'd get hurt if they did), m mom dragged me by my hair and yelled at me to stop crying. I was shaking and hyperventilating! When I told her what was happening, she told me to spout my bullshit elsewhere.  Later on my stepdad made fun of me because of it. That night I almost killed myself, I said goodbye to people I cared about and I tried to figure out how I'd tell my mom that it was because she was toxic. The only reason I'm here, is because my bestfriend called and somehow talked me down. I wonder what it'd feel like to not be hurting so much all the time. Like I keep almost ending everything, but I never do it, and my life just continues to suck. Its not getting better.
