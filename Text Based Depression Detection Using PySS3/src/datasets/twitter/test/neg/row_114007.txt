Thanks Reddit, You have saved my life.Around a few days ago, I was extremely depressed after a friend died. However After having someone to talk to, and having support, my mental state vastly improved from there. 

Thanks, If I didn't post here, I wouldn't got the help that I desperately needed, and I'll be dead. I can't thank you enough. From Now on I'll strive to help others in awful situations.
