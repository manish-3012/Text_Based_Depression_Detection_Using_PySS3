I've pushed everyone awayI moved away from my home town. I had a fairly small group of close friends (6 or so) I fell out with two of them, one abused his girlfriend so I wanted nothing to do with him. The other started dating a girl who didn't get on with my partner there were a few incidents and we ended up falling out (mostly my fault) one of my friends moved away and I rarely see or talk to the others. My anxiety has gradually gotten worse. I no longer drive. I throw up every day. I can't go to social events. This is putting a big strain on my partner they are very social and love to be busy which I can't handle so I'm either alone or disappointing them. I have nothing in common with anyone I meet. I feel like people don't like things the same way I do. My job is very solitary. I'm running out of people to when talk to and I think my partner will leave soon as well.
