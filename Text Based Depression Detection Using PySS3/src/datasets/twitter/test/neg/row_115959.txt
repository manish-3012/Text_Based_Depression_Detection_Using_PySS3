About to give up, just found out my mother with alzheimers never loved meI'm 15, Female. During the pandemic I look after my mom and everything to do with her when my dads not home (giving her food and drinks, making sure she's okay). She's advanced to a stage where she can't talk properly anymore. 

For the past few weeks I've been feeling extremely suicidal, before the pandemic I was already so depressed that I was missing weeks of school, and there was nobody at home to force me to go so I'd just stay at home with my mom. My motivation for work is severely lacking to the point where I'll feel like crying just from looking at work I need to do. So right now im months behind school (not even including all the work they've set online during the pandemic)

So the other day I thought "I'll just do all of my work for art, because that's something that I don't need any of the months of lessons to be able to do". And I started writing down all of the things I need to do.

Skip forward to today. I went downstairs for some reason (I think to ask him to help with my work) and we ended up talking about my mom. And I mentioned something about how she always used to play with other kids but would rudely refuse to play with me. I said it was probably because her alzheimers was developing.

This is when my dad hits me with a bomb. When she had me, she had postpartum depression, and because she was stubborn and furiously independent she refused to get help with it or even acknowledge there was anything wrong with her. So, she never became attached to me, and then she started developing alzheimers. So she never started loving me.

My whole life, the one thing keeping me sane was that at least I knew that my mom loved me. Because my dads become depressed and irritable recently and it seems like he hates me sometimes. And I've just found out that she never loved me, at all, for any of my life. 

She used to push me into walls when I was little, and blame me for everything, and always take my brothers side in arguments. I don't even know how to ride a bike because she'd always refuse to take me out to do it. And I always thought that it must've just been alzheimers. But all of this was back when the only signs of her alzheimers was that she'd forget her keys sometimes. So she just hated me. All my life I've thought she loved me, but she hated me. 

And im just, struggling to see the point in living in a world where I don't even have the chance to have a connection with her. If she just hated me then I could try to fix it, but I can't because of her alzheimers. I just... Its all too much for me.
