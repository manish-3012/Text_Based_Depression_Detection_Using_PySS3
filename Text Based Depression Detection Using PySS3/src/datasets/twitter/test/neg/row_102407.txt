I feel like everyone in my life would be better off without meIâ€™ll try not to make this too long. 

I genuinely feel as if my life is making things more complicated. Iâ€™ve suffered from depression for years, and have tried to get help numerous times, nothing has helped. Iâ€™m beginning to think that nothing could help. 

Iâ€™ve also been in a relationship for several months now. I opened up to him about my depression, disordered eating habits, and everything else wrong with me yesterday. I allowed myself to trust someone and it has backfired. He didnâ€™t say much, but I could tell it took a toll on him. Iâ€™m just too much. 

Iâ€™m thinking now and I realize that if I go, people would be better off without me. My issues take a toll on everyone I meet who I let in.
