I know when I'm gona dieIs it bad to know when I'm gona die?

When my mom and dog dies I will have no one to live for and that's when I'm gona kill myself. People say that I will find someone but to that I need to stop being depressed. I don't want to spread my sadness anyway.

I literally don't see reason why I would live. It's not that I want to kill myself, it's just logical. No more worries, no more sadness. Just end to this endless cycle of getting better and going into deep.
