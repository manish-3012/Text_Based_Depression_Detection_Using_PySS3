I'm not sure why I'm postingI'm really struggling. I'm having a panic attack once or twice a day now and my thoughts seem to get the better of me at night. I don't think I'm going to do anything silly but I can't deal with this feeling anymore. Existential dread I've heard it called but I don't know, just finding things really confusing and hard right now. I've messaged my father and sister just to be ignored by one and asked 'why?' by the other, and its a question I can't answer.
I just need someone to help me rationalise what's going on, I just need a chat I think.
If you're reading this and feel the same way right now just know you're not alone right now. I have love for you regardless
