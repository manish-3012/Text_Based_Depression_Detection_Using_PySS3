Why bother living anymore?I m 26 year old male (not virgin thx to dozens of hookers),people tell me i look good(which is killing me even more) that i never had girlfriend never could get sex without paying for it.Simply said i went out with some girls they all either had other partners or dished me and got other people and had sex with them(but not me).I was on alot of parties tried drugs and rest of sharade even use them(1/month maybe even less) when i go out from time to time.


Finished university have masters degree trained alot of sports currently stuck with ashtanga yoga working full time jobs since i was 21.Occasionaly watching movies reading some books playing DnD casually and video games from time to time,stopped smoking 4 years ago maybe a bit more.
So i m interested why bother to live since i dont want to get first girlfriend when i m 30(missing out younger age for everything) it just wont be worth it...


Sometimes i wish i was someone else cause it looks so much better 
cant get laid without paying(which i refuse to do anymore) frustration from not getting sex or relationship piles up.So i m wondering why bother with this same tempo(tried some changes and done them) but nothing really changed and if i have to pull devils ass to get girls i simply lost motivation and energy to do it.
My original idea was to suicide at 25 have no idea how i forgot about it but now i m soon 27 on 24th october i plan on possible overdosing myself with drugs and finish like that.
Being late bloomer already sucks,i hate myself and its getting to the parts where i cant even do normal stuff without either feeling really angry or immensive hatred toward my own existance...
