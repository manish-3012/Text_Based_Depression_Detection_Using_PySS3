I'm very drunk and considering getting a knife.I know this is the worst time to consider taking my life because all alcohol is crazy and does things. But I'm considering and its bad. I just scored an internship and I don't wanna kill myself. I have friends. I have family. I don't think they want me to die. I'm not sure. But I'm totally considering it. Please help me. I need help. I don't need police but I need someone to talk to.
