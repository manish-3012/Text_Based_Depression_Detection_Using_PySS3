My deadline I will work to beatI have been depressed for a few years. Major depression has hit me since new years, I feel like crying everyday but cannot cry. I am 23 without a single relationship on my belt and still am a virgin. I have very limited job experiences and I'm terrified I will never make it in the real world and not be able to support my diabetes. I have never had a girl tell me she loves me I have never felt part of a group. I am 20 or 30 ibs overweight that gives me a shitty selfimage. I have made 3 goals lose weight get a wifey and pick a career if I fail 1 of these goals I set a deadline on my birthday In late July to kill myself iv written my notes and made a will. I just wanted to get this out.I am working towards my goal but if I fail that will be the end.
