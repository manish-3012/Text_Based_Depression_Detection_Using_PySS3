Probably need help at this point.Had a dream last night about downing (actually chewing, for some reason lol) all my pills, which has been a recurring thought these past few months. 

I feel like I should probably see a professional. I never know whether to tell someone because I don't have a plan per se, but I can be pretty impulsive and I have the means so it's not like I really need a plan in advance. But I'm scared I'll be hospitalized if I say this to a therapist or a professional. I get that this sub isn't professional help, but can someone point me towards a resource on mandatory reporting and the like? I'm too skittish to go to a therapist right now otherwise.

Sorry for weird wording. Brain don't work too good right now.
