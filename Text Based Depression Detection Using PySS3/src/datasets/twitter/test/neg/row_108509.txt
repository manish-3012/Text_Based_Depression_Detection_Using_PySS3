Lost My Sister, My Mother, and My Best Friend All At OnceMy sister recently died, the person that I could always count on no matter what. She used to raise me, take care of me, and would always make sure I was safe and get me gifts when I was younger and well, I loved her. She died though, overdosed, and I've been struggling with depression for the past three years now and don't see a bright future ahead of myself. I'm gay, I'm pathetic, I have no friends, so what's the point? I have nothing wrong with homosexuality, but I can't understand why I have to be gay, I've tried counseling, tried changing myself and I've come to accept that I'll never be truly happy. She was the only one that knew, and was my anchor, but now she's gone and 90% of my childhood is vacant. We now are taking care of a baby that will never remember her mother, and here I sit, day after day in my basement contemplating my own death. This has been going on for years, but only now have I really weighed the pros and cons, and quite frankly death just sounds.. better. I don't want to live anymore, I can't live anymore, I'm too weak for this world.
