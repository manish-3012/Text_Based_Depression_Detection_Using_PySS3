My depression is taking over my life, my family, and my relationships. I want to die.I don't even know what to say, I just know I need to say it. I've pushed away everyone that's ever meant anything to me, I get hurt so easy. Everything just seems so numb and bleak, I don't know what to do with myself.

I slept through a class the other day by accident, and all I could think about was climbing to the third story of my dorm and then jumping. I've been wanting to hurt myself so badly but it's hard when you live with other people.

I just, left my partner, I love them so much, but I left them, and I can't cry, I feel like a horrible human being.

I have no excuses for the way that I am. I'd really rather die than keep feeling like this. I keep thinking of my future and it all just seems...grey.

I can't hold a job, I can't hold a relationship, I can't stand up for myself enough to come out of the closet.

And the worst part is everyone thinks I'm getting better.

But ever since I moved to college?

All I can think about is dying.

Everything is just too hard for me, and I can't stop time.

I'm not currently in crisis, I've been a year self harm free, and I don't think I'm at the point where I need to go to the hospital.

I'm just so afraid of disappointing the people that think I'm doing great.
