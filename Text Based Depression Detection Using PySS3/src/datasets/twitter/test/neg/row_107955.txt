I am worthless and would like some adviceHello everyone

I am a 23 year old man from the UK and recently attempted to take my life twice, the first attempt failed as I was found during and promptly taken to the hospital and cared for (personally I feel the care wasnâ€™t warranted) following this I made another attempt that I bottled because I couldnâ€™t bare to impact those around me in such a way. 

I am utterly worthless in every way and I donâ€™t mean that in a â€œplease pity meâ€ sense, I truly mean it. Iâ€™ve spent hours upon hours analysing myself and my actions and have found that I honestly canâ€™t act like a functioning human being, so I have resolved myself to a life of non-impactful servitude. 

The purpose of this post is to ask for advice from you all, as we appear to be in the same boat. How should I go about alienating myself from the others around me, and becoming as invisible as possible. My perfect scenario would be that my friends and family forget I exist and I am left alone to quietly work and provide what little service I can until I die, itâ€™s honestly the most net positive thing Iâ€™ll do with my life (if you can call it a life)

Finally I must stress that I have been though the NHS for assistance, I have confided in my friends and family and have tried copious amount of drugs and none of these worked. I am fully committed to becoming a non entity so to speak and would only like advice on this matter. 

I must apologise if this doesnâ€™t fit the subreddit theme.

Thanks in advance!
