I just can't take it anymore.Like, I really just can't. I can't stop crying. I can't stop hurting. I can't get over it. I can't put it behind me. I can't afford a therapist that actually helps. I can't find anyone who cares. Believe me, I've tried. It's why I'm still here. But after so many years of dealing with this pain alone, I just can't anymore. No one considers my problems real.  I was supposed to get over it. It didn't matter. God forbid if I actually commit suicide over it. How pathetic would that be? I just need to get over it, and keep trying. But I can't. I don't think it will get better. What am I supposed to do when I get like this? Am I always going to be crying alone? I don't have anyone. How can you even survive in this world without even one friend? You can't, can you? Then I don't see why I should be alive going forward. I'm disliked by everyone, no hopes, no dreams, no passions, nothing. And when I do decide to end it, no one will care. Not really. Probably just say it's my fault for being too weak.
