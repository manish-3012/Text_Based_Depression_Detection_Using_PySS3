What's wrong with me?I am so done rn ,I hate myself so much and I keep paying for other ppl's mistakes . I have family drama on a daily basis and most of it isn't my fault  I have no power , energy or motivation to do anything . I'm drowning in toxicity and physical illness and I can do nothing about it , everything is consuming me and I'm torn , at one side I wanna kms because I'm a piece of shit and a petty excuse for a human . on the other side I know what's waiting for me if I do it ain't gonna be pretty , everyone looks down on me and I don't even wanna change their minds anymore I'm sick of it.
