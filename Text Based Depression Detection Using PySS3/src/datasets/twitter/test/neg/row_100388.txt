Last callOnce I complete and submit the complaint, I'm gone. Before the new year, at least. It's as much your fault as it is mine, L. I wish I could have just put it out of mind and moved on. But I can't stay silent, not knowing you could still hurt other vulnerable people. I wish I could have made it through to the other side of this, but you've left me no way to find support in the community or even trust those who might help me find a way out of here. I don't know for certain yet if it means killing myself physically, but as strong as you said I was, the person you knew couldn't survive you on top of everything else.
