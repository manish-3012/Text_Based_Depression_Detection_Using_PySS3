i can't outrun the emptiness anymorehow in the hell do i create something out of nothing? 

i can't look at myself. my old 'life'. how i've behaved. 

i just exist as this dead soul. i feel like a young child. i feel like an old woman who's lived out her full life already and is just waiting to fkn die. i feel like nothing. 

my mother is so disgusting sometimes. she erased me. she got so involved in me, my life and successes to the point where i just want to fkn neck at how i let all of this happen. 

i did 2.5 years of a degree i don't even want, trying to convince myself all the time that this was what i wanted. all of this wasted time with a dead soul.

i don't even know what the way out is from here. i don't think it's a question of love and vulnerability... 

all i want is to stop loving my parents so i can fucking be an individual and choose who and what I love. i HATE how I never chose to be connected to them. I hate that they fucking raised me. I HATE that they were the ones to see me at my rawest. I hate that I was subjected to hell and that they probably got off in some sense at seeing my cry. at seeing my try my hardest for human connection. where am I? anymore? idk? just kill me, already. why? they intentionally made me suffer, it feels, when they could have stopped it. but they couldn't stop themselves. and if there was a button i could press to fkn let go of the past, I'd press it. but there isn't. i suffer every day and just wish I could cut the cord but there is no cord to cut and there is nothing to live for and i don't know how the f u c k i can like exist as a normal adult when I was basically emotionally orphaned. when my 'parents' were the cause of my pain and i still live as this decaying fkn fetus internally. i'm rotting away and i've never seen the light of day. i'm 20 and I can't not hate myself. 

i feel like i haven't even completed one (1) developmental stage yet. dissociating most of the time. idk where i truly am. 

i feel like a part of them still wants me in the womb and that makes me wanna fkn kms.

i think it's a question of selfishness and becoming an individual and letting go of the notions of should/right/wrong, but idk how to do that. 

idk how to live for myself. idk what my own story is. it's just a mess.
