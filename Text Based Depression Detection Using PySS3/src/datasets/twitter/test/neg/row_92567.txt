It's a thought I haven't had for a while nowMy thoughts keep telling me I don't deserve to live. I should die instead. I don't deserve to be here, i'm a shitty person who should die instead. I hate myself, I hate my entire existence. I don't understand what the purpose is of me being here, I don't think I should be. I feel like a disappointment, I keep avoiding things and I still remain the same. I don't know what I'm trying to achieve by posting this, like the title said, it's a thought I haven't had in a while. There's no one I feel comfortable with to share these thoughts with, I don't want to bother others with my negative thoughts, but I wanted to let it out somewhere
