I guess I chose such a bad time to delay itI've been thinking about committing suicide for three years straight. There are multiple reasons but the one that triggered my mind to even make me post in here for the first time is my relationship and the way it has been going. I just took a higher dose of my medicine to sleep but it sucks to know that tomorrow I'll feel like crap and that I won't end up doing anything about it because I'd feel extremely guilty demanding something from the health care system considering the situation and the amount of attention the covid patients require. Also, putting my family at risk of catching the virus if they were to join me or my body to the emergency room isn't a nice thought either. I wish I had done it before, honestly. I could have even found other means to do it and that way I probably wouldn't even be here writing to anonymous people who may or may not care about me. My life would be so much better without me.
