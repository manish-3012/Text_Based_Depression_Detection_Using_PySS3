Just about ready to do it.I admit I haven't thought about doing this in a while. But I'll be 52 this year. I don't have close friends. All my family is dead. And I have a job so miserable that if I don't do it first, the job will do it for me.

I'm getting more and more okay with the plan. Swallow a whole bunch of benzos with a whole bunch of booze. Put the gun to my head and then nothing. I don't have a gun. So nothing is going to happen anytime soon. 

I hope i get someone to find a home for my cats. I'm at the end of my rope. There's very little left.

I just need to get a note together and my list of passwords.
