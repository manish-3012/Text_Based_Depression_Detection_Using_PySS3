Getting older.Ive been on antidepressant medications since my early 20's... Ive needed them so much longer, but my parents were into St.Johns wart heals all bull. Im turning 29 this month, im married though i kinda just stumbled my way into it, i haven't been happy for a long time, my 2 year old is the only person that keeps me sane. Even with the meds, and a reason for living, i constantly have thoughts of how much easier it would be to sleep, if i just jerked my wheel slightly i could be in a ditch, and be done.... Ive never had the nerve to hurt myself, not because of the pain, but because of how i think others would view me. In the past few years ive lost my mother to an aneurysm, and my grandfather to skin cancer. My wife doesn't understand, she stresses as well, but seems to thrive on stress where all it does for me is shut me down. I couldn't hurt a fly, but have violent urges, wanting to punch a wall till i bleed, bang my head and scream till my throat is sore. 

I know other people have it worse, starving, homeless, abused.. And i do feel for them, but that doesn't make me appreciate my life as much as i should. I dont want to hurt myself, im just so tired of everything being a buffet of stress. Hoping typing this out will atleast get it off my chest.
