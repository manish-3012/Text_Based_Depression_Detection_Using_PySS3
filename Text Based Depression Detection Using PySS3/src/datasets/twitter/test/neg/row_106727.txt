Today I played my favourite game, while watching my favourite show and eating my favourite dinner but I still feel like crapI feel so stupid. All the time. Nobody cares what I think and nobody sees me. Sometimes I actually wonder if I'm invisible. I'm also addicted to cutting so that's great I guess. I have severe trust issues and my therapist has suddenly and out of the blue gone bonkers. Let me give you some context. I live in a medium sized house with two brothers, my parents and my cat. I live in an upper-middle class family. We have money, food, a house, two cars and access to therapy. I spoke to my therapist yesterday. I told her that I always feel lonely and depressed. First she said that all teens think they have depression. She then reminded me that 'Depression doesn't exist.' Which later turned into 'Stop lying for attention!' We also discussed how everyone has trust issues because really, no one is trustworthy. YES, she told me that no one is trustworthy! That is surely going to help me open up about my feelings.She also felt the need to tell me that she does not recommend therapy for 12 year old's because they haven't experienced life yet. I CAN'T EXPERIENCE LIFE YET! I spend all my time curled up in a ball on the ground crying! I cut my wrists in the bathroom every week, it's actually become a kind of bedtime ritual. She says "you don't need to just hide from the world, go do things that make you HAPPY!" Seriously? I really don't think she has EVER met someone with depression. She knows nothing about depression whatsoever. See that's the thing about depression, all the things that normally make you happy... THEY DO NOTHING. I am sitting, playing Minecraft and watching New Girl with MY CAT, MY BELOVED CAT! And yet I still feel like crap.. I'm on new anti-depressants, THEY'RE DOING NOTHING! I am so sick of nothing working! We then discussed how I just need to think happy thoughts and I will then be happy forever. And finally, the cherry on top, she tells me that I am UNGRATEFUL and IMPOLITE. Sometimes I am selfish, sometimes I am mean, and yet the only two insults in the world that do not apply to me are being impolite and being ungrateful. I am thankful for everything I have ever received in my entire life. Whether it's the phone I got for Christmas or the barbie set my aunt gave me three years after I outgrew barbie. And Impolite? I am by a long shot the most polite kid in my school filled with 700 kids. All my friends parents think that I'm a good influence. I say please and thank you, I offer to help with anything they need. I have gone to my friends house, helped make dinner, set the table and cleaned up her dishes. You might actually think that she was my guest at my house. I am just so sick of trying. All my therapists suck, all my friends suck, all my meds suck, all my teachers suck. All I want to do is sit back, cut and cry. But I can't because I have to keep on living even though I don't want to keep going. I just don't think I can do this anymore. I just don't get the point? I'm so tired of letting my walls down just to get hurt. I don't tell my friends anything real, because I don't trust them. And while my therapist sounds a little nuts, the funny thing is that I really thought things were working for awhile. A few sessions ago we really connected and I actually told her real things, not just what I thought she wanted to hear. I can't keep putting myself through this. I feel like I'm living a lie and I just don't want to do this anymore. Living is overrated. What's the point of living if you aren't enjoying it anyway? I feel so empty and drained. I just need to sleep so that I have enough energy to live in this hell-hole again tomorrow. I just think that.. I've done my time here you know, God had a really fun 12 years messing with me and wripping out my soul. It's a little ironic actually because everyday here, well everyday here, my will to live dies a little inside. I'm just feel ready to die.
