I donâ€™t care abt anything anymoreI donâ€™t care about having a date. I donâ€™t care about anything. I just want to die. Itâ€™s all I think about. You didnâ€™t even have the basic respect to let me know the truth so I didnâ€™t go insane, youâ€™d rather let someone think they are crazy and lost their mind then tell the truth. Your a pure evil. Your not welcome to my funeral. You better not show up. You better not act fake like you cared. You better not do anything except sit there and deal with the repercussions of your lying actions you demon. Itâ€™s all set up and ready, theyâ€™ll find my body in a day or two. I already have my place set up, outfit ready, all thatâ€™s left to do is the last part and Iâ€™m finally free from the evil of this world and also, you.
