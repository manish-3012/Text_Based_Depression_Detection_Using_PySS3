It's not selfish to end my own lifeI don't understand....How is it selfish to end my own life?

Is it because my 'loved ones' will go through pain?

Doesn't that make them selfish? I'll have to deal with pain for the rest of my life so that they don't deal with pain? How does that even work?

I am tired of everything. I doubt I'll be remembered or forgotten beyond my family, I never had true friends.


Horrible, horrible bullying in high school, I've always been the weak person, the person who always gets picked on, and I never even dealt any harm to anyone, but everyone I knew insists on harming me.

I am now in my first year of university, and it dawns upon me that nothing got better, I am still as lonely as I was in high school, and everyone has friends and every guy has a girl that he can love...I do not even have a glimpse of that.

My own brother thinks I am a loser, my father sees me as an embarrassment to the family.

I do not know if I ever had good days in my life, my best memories comes from online gaming, and even online I don't get a long with anyone.

I only have one friend, and that friend doesn't even care about me, he wouldn't even care or be affected if I were to no longer be his friend. I feel like I truly have no one in my life, and that this is how it will be like.

I remember, being alone through middle school and high school, and now the first year of university is almost over, and I am still alone, how long will this go on for? Have I not tried enough? Is there something wrong with me?

I just want to kill myself, and I feel like I want to do it sooner than later, I don't want to wake up another day and remember that I have to go through a pathetic day in my pathetic life.

Thanks for reading...I guess? I literally had no one who I could've said this to, even in real life.
