I have half a planI have all of my notes written and proof read/edited.

I have to go home to see my psych in a week in a half. I have a date day with my sister planned. I have a day to spend with my mom and stepdad and sister.

I have an idea of where I want to do it and when. I just dont know the exact date. Im scared. Im tired. Im exhausted. Im burnt out. Mostly, I'm scared.

I'm going to tell my psych all this in one last ditch effort to try and figure out what the fuck is going on in my brain. It's been 4 years and no medicine as worked long term. I'm convinced nothing ever will.

But maybe if I'm super honest with her something will change.

Here's to using what minimal hope I have left I guess.
