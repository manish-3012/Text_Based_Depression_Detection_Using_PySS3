Want to end my lifeHi
Its been a long time I want to end my life but I donâ€™t have enough courage to do it. Iâ€™m stuck in a life that I donâ€™t want to. I loved my wife and she loved me before, the thing is, I put everything I had to marry her but now I think we made a big mistake. I donâ€™t wanna get divorced because I canâ€™t go back to the past. I lost everything I had in my country and we migrated for better life here.
But now I cant see any future with her, I donâ€™t have any relative or friend here.
She is very bossy and always want to control me.
She always want to change everything about me which causes feeling shameful about myself.
There is no wayback for me. I want to end this shameful life.
