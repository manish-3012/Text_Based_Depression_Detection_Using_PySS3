I made a list**Reasons not to kill myself**

&gt;My existence improves the lives of family, friends and acquaintances --- even if the improvement is subtle.

&gt; No parent should have to bury their child.

My suicide would cause these people grief. This is the main factor holding me back. On the other hand, this is my life and the feelings of others shouldn't necessarily deter me from ending it given the magnitude of suffering. I won't care about the feelings of those I've been close to after I'm dead.

&gt;The Little Things in Life (TM).

The decision of whether or not to live really comes down to whether or not the sum of my experiences (not the right word, really, but I can't think of the proper substitute) is positive. Sources of small happiness count toward this, too. 

    life.big_things + life.little_things &gt;= 0    

&gt;It's still possible that my net happiness will eventually outweigh my net suffering.

Counterargument to the above. Waiting to see if this turns out to be the case would be the most rational option. I would have plenty of time to experience nothingness after my natural lifespan has expired. However, given the treatment-resistant nature of my depression and anxiety, as well as my family history, it seems unlikely that I'll ever fully recover. 

&gt;I haven't yet listened to all of the music/seen all of the films/read all of the books that I would like to.

On to the section of the list where I rattle off things that I haven't done yet. Of course, these could all be negated by the argument that I won't give a shit after I die.

&gt; I've never created a satisfactory work of art.

Attempts tend to result in frustration rather than catharsis.

&gt; I haven't tried all of the drugs that I'm interested in.

Feel free to judge me. It's kind of sad that this one is on the list, in retrospect.

&gt; I have never been in a romantic relationship lasting longer than a week.

&gt; I have never had sex.

These are, depending on who you ask, major parts of life that I would be missing out on.

&gt; I have never been in a band.

&gt; I haven't fully explored my gender identity yet.

&gt; Though I'm no longer in class, I haven't yet technically graduated from high school.

&gt; It's still possible that a college I would like to attend will accept me.

&gt; I have not had the "college experience".

&gt; I have never traveled the world.

&gt; I have not satisfied my desire for knowledge.

&gt; They're making a third season of Twin Peaks.

Again, I can dismiss all of these easily.



**Bonus**

&gt; People will think I've done it over something trivial.

My recent rejection from my top choice college. Or Valentine's Day, which I don't even care about. I won't care what people think if I'm dead, though, so this doesn't really matter.

At this point I'm leaning towards doing it.
