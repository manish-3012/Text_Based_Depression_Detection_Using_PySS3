Why shouldn't I just kill myself?I (16F) was clean from self-harming for almost two months until tonight. I just can't help myself from doing it. I deserve to relapse. I'm ugly, I don't contribute anything to this world, I'm dumb, no one cares about my feelings, and I'll never make it anywhere in life. No one has ever truly loved me or admired me, and that just says so much about my appearance. Why couldn't I have been born with nice genes? Why did this have to happen to me? I just can't live this life anymore seeing people my age being so happy and naturally pretty and successful. Why wasn't I born into a life where I can be perfect? I'm so through with being stuck in this ugly body, with my fat stomach and my gross face and my acne scars all over my body. And I'm through with dealing with the fact that I will never amount to anything. I deserve to be hurt and I deserve to die. A part of me hopes that one day something could get better, but I doubt that will happen and the harsh reality of it makes me want to end my life even more. I don't have anything left to live for, aside from my amazing pet rabbits, since my mom told me that if I ever commit suicide she'd kill them all herself. I just don't know what to do anymore and I have no one I can talk to.
