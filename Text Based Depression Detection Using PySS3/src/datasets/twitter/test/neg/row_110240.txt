Does it matterDoes life even matter Iâ€™ll live till I eventually die at some point. And even if I accomplished something like curing cancer or something like that what would be the point because even the people that that helps would die at some point to. And I donâ€™t see a reason to live my whole life of just trying to accomplish financial success just in hopes of living longer to eventually die. If I just killed myself now would be the same as if I died in like 75 years or something. I donâ€™t know Iâ€™ve just been thinking about this for a while trying to see something but I donâ€™t. I just see the failure I am and the disappointment I am. The stupid failure of me. Me who will never accomplish anything. Me who doesnâ€™t have any purpose and is just a waste of a life. I just will get fucked more by life.
