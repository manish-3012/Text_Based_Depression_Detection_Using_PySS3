finalewaking up everyday feeling the same, feeling useless, frustrated,sad.

confused about the world and all it holds, wishing you could be like those who have reasons to be happy

going and working, your mind occupied, coming home only to be stuck in yourself again. thoughts, memories all seeping in.

as days turn into weeks weeks turn into months it all piles, no one to turn to so you turn to the blade, cutting at your flesh. using physical pain to silence the mental pain.

it stops working, you stop working, you no longer see any hope only darkness, nothing helps you forget anymore

suicide seeps in little by little, you try to avoid it but it seems like the only answer

only answer
