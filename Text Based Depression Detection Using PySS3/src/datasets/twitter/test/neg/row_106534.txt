I should be happy. Why canâ€™t I be happy.Nothing is ever enough, I should be happy that I got what I wanted. But. I want more. Thereâ€™s always going to be so much more that I want and I will never have it all. I canâ€™t stand life being just constant jealousy and dissatisfaction.. I donâ€™t think itâ€™ll ever go away. I donâ€™t know why to even bother waiting.
