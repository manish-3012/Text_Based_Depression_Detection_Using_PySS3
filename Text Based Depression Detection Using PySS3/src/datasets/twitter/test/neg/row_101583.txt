I want to end my lifeMale 24y

For the past 5 months I had strange reactions of my body which were: Robotinc breathing, forgetting to breathe when falling asleep, wheezing, shortness of breath, extreme insomnia (4 days no sleep 1 day 3hrs and repeat for a month), constipation, bloating, stomach pain, gurgglijg stomach by just drinking water, headaches, dizziness, lump in throat (lasted 2 months), extreme rhinitis, rectal fullness (this was awful, still happens but less often ), GERD.. 

All of these somehow magically subsided or completely went away. No doctor could find anything wrong. 

Recently I developed the worst symtpom that causes me to be extremely suicidal. Bladder malfunction. It feels like I need to pee 24/7 coupled with urethral burning (even without peeing) and ejaculation is making it 10/10 burning. I cant even know for sure when I need to pee anymore. I've had this for 2 weeks.
My urine is fine (no UTI), I have no STDs, nothing can be found. Ultrasound is perfect. 
I googled what it could be and it can be 3 things: Interstitial Cystitis, Chronic Nonbacterial Prostits, Pudendal Neuralgia. All 3 are debilitating chronic conditions that have no trestments. Yes some treatments exist, but they can only make it a bit less awful. I just can't deal with this feeling. It means no relationships it means constant pain and mysery. 

I feel robbed of life, one condition that connects all of these is MCAS. I am taking treatment for it (H1 and H2 antihistamines and Quercetin). No one can diagnose it in my country so I tried it myself. No successes.

I am basically fucked up to the point where there is no reason to live.  Suicide would end my suffering.

I''m done.
