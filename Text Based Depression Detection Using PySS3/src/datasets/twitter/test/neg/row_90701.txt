Goner.Lately, the only time I donâ€™t feel like a void is when my nose gets all stuffed up from crying. The only time I feel warmth is when my salty tears roll, heavy and round, through my face. The only color I have is the red that paints my lips when I bite them, desperate to feel something, looking for the relief of relief. Like leaves in Autumn, my hands shake more than they ever have. Sometimes itâ€™s hard to take the pills out of the tablets. My hands donâ€™t fall to the ground, but my hair does. Iâ€™ve started to feel pain all the time, slight migraines and lots of stomach pain. I can barely eat anymore. My body has no strength left. Iâ€™m completely shutting down and today I might have the courage to end it for good. I lived a lonely life, barely had any friends and those who were my friends I pushed away from being too sick to even function. Maybe I was too much, or they didnâ€™t try hard enough â€” either way, it doesnâ€™t matter. None of them will attend the funeral, they all live far away. I remember the last warm hug Iâ€™ve ever gotten, but the person who made me feel safe is even more far away now and I would never be with her again even if I lived. There is just no point anymore. My dog will be fine and nobody else cares. I hope I donâ€™t wake up tomorrow. Please get help before you turn into me. I wish I had the help before I became, as they say, too broken to fix. Reach out and find someone that loves you. Good night.
