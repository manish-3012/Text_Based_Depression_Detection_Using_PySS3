I wish someone would come along and fucking kill me alreadyWhere are the serial killers when we need them?  Iâ€™m so sick of doing this everyday and even as things get better, they always end up getting worse.  Iâ€™m going to live the rest of my life on this horrible rollercoaster and I canâ€™t opt out because â€œyOU hAVe sO mUch tO liVE fOR.â€  Iâ€™m going to be stuck with so much fucking anxiety and depression that will continue to build up cyclically until I go fucking insane, again, and get hospitalized, again.  I already feel crazy and Iâ€™m not even doing anything.  On paper my life is pretty great.  But I canâ€™t fall asleep unless I load up on melatonin and cry to exhaust myself, I canâ€™t talk to anyone because they think Iâ€™ve made this grand recovery, I canâ€™t go to my best friend because heâ€™s dealing with his own shit and honestly our relationship is getting pretty dicey, and I just donâ€™t want to do this anymore, I donâ€™t want to live in misery, Iâ€™m sick of being alone, and I just keep thinking of how much I hate this existence and how much I want to just stop and give up and die.  We put animals down when their quality of life begins to decline and theyâ€™re just living in pain, so why not me?  Why canâ€™t I just lay down and be done with it?  Why do I have to live like this?  I may not be a saint, but I donâ€™t think I did anything to warrant the absolute hell that is my brain.  Thereâ€™s just something fundamentally broken with me and I need it all to go away, I need to just stop existing so I can finally get some goddamn peace, and for once just not have to feel like Iâ€™m in immense pain every fucking second of every fucking day.  Fuck.
