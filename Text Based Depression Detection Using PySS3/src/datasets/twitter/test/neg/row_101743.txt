Talking to my husband makes me want to dieI am in the middle of getting divorced. My state requires a year of separate addresses before you can do so. My husband is an on the road trucker. He moved out and bought a huge house. He needs help getting mail, receiving packages, etc. We have been trying to separate amicably and coordinate with moving his property into his house. 

We own a third house that his elderly father lives in. Since its paid off, we've agreed to have me move in there and move his father into the house I'm living in. 

The old house has no parking so movers would be challenged--a truck would block traffic. My husband prefers spending his money on new toys for him and his house. I have ADHD and collapse at trying to organize--my stuff gets piled. My husband just dumped stuff in the old days--he ignored his own stuff piles when he's home. His new house has only the stuff he really wanted, and is immaculate--no dumping on the floor there! His father is a near hoarder--the old house floor looks awful and needs deep cleaning. My husband informed me that his new family will be moving into his big new house by Christmas or New Years (his girlfriend, her husband and kids, they want to be polyamorous). 

I am panicking over all the cleaning/packing I will have to do, for everyone. Since hearing about the girlfriend move in, I have had extreme trouble sleeping--I end up over sleeping during the day.

My husband wanted me to do a 12 hour drive with him to pick up his car at his truck depot, so we could bring it back to his house. He 'generously' offered to pay for gas. His car is a wagon and has a trailer and would be useful for moving. He wanted me to sleep while driving--I have never been able to do sleep in his car when he's driving--so he could get in his own appointment, drive, then he could sleep before heading back to a job. Except I had an appointment of my own immediately after the long drive, so I asked for rescheduling or extra time. 

He accused me of wanting him dead because he'd be tired on the road--he refused to reschedule or take extra time away from work. I avoided further confrontation (he enjoys it) and just said to get someone else. (He said he might use our son, his father, or rent a car.) 

He's accused me of wanting him dead before, but he never never never takes caution when I ask him to (he's a vet, paratrooper, loves driving motorcycle in the rain). Logically, he knows I'd be worse off if he died because only his job has enough income for all his purchases (3 houses, 5 vehicles, expensive hobbies), insurance wouldn't cover it. Its like a "how I get the better of you in an argument" and deny your feelings trick.

I don't want to die. But every interaction with him makes me feel like life isn't worth living. I'm seeing my therapist in a few days. She's not very good at grief management, but she is helping me get stuff done. She asks me if I'm suicidal each time. I don't want to say yes and I don't want to lie. (I take Wellbutrin)
