I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m on the verge daily of killing myself, and if not I do completely reckless stuff, or atleast feel the need to. I donâ€™t have money to see a psychiatrist or the money for medication. I feel like Iâ€™m at a wits end and helpless because it just gets worse throughout the years, Iâ€™ve thought about checking into a treatment center for a few days but idk if thatâ€™s possible because I seem stable but Iâ€™m really not. This year has been one the hardest years since I watched my Dad kill my step dad and this is the first year my Mimi has been gone (dads mom) and I didnâ€™t get to spend the last few years of her life with her because my dad put a wedge between us and thereâ€™s nothing I can do to fix it now. The only person Iâ€™ve told is my boyfriend but it doesnâ€™t help when I make him mad or try to break up with him Everytime he tells me to kill myself and takes it back but I really think heâ€™s right because I feel like Iâ€™m never going to get better. Iâ€™m 21 and I have no life, I canâ€™t drive, the only job Iâ€™ve kept for a good period of time is babysitting. I feel weak and worthless and idk what to do about it or what to do anymore because I have an overwhelming feeling of wanting to die.
