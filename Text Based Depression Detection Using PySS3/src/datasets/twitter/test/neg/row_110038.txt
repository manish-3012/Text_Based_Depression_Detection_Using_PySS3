Struggling to find purposeMy life is completely without purpose. I bring nothing to the table. Iâ€™m 41, single, never married, no children, I donâ€™t own a home, and I have a very limited social life. About the only thing of interest  I do is run â€” marathons, half marathons, trail races, etc. Iâ€™m pretty much useless and irrelevant to everyone around me.
