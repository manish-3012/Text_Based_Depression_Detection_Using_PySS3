I have been more ready now to kill myself then ever.I will admit it. I overdosed without intent to kill myself, but I said I did. I got put in a hospital and then a mental hospital. I didn't do it for attention, but I did do it because I had no way to ask for help. I tried therapy after that but absolutely hated it. My mother acts like "I'll do anything to make you happy" but then forgets my mental health all together. A few months after that hospital incident I felt dangerously suicidal and was crying multiple times an hour over nothing. I couldn't physically do my homework because my mind was racing and that made me more stressed and suicidal. I texted her, asking her to take me to the mental hospital when she got back, but she just said "it's only for people in danger, you want to go back to the crazy house!??!?" I went to bed and cried my eyes out of course and she made me tell her I cut again when I woke up. I just always say "I won't do it again" and she just takes my word for it. As of now I am cutting daily or every other day. I have a suicide note ready to be printed. I know I am going to kill myself by drinking and passing out and drowning in the bath. If that doesn't work I'll cut myself and bleed out in the same bath. And if THAT doesn't work I'll hang myself. It's not that I hate my life, I just don't see the point in living. My life is pretty normal. I don't have many physical problems. All of my problems are in my head. I don't believe in the afterlife so if I die, I will feel nothing. Just like before I was born. Just a little bit of physical pain, and then I'm gone. My family will get over it. I know. They'll act like they care, they'll trick THEMSELVES into thinking they'll care, but that's just human nature. Death is depressing, but it's inevitable. I would rather die now, how I want, when I want, and be able to leave a note, than later, by nature. I know I'll hurt some people but I'm just done. I'm over it. I don't want to waste any more resources of life. I don't know when I'll do it, but probably sometime this summer. I have everything but a date, but I won't make one. I'll do it when the time is right. I honestly do want to go to a mental hospital but my family won't take me seriously, and I'm not going to go through the whole calling 911 thing and telling them I'm going to do it. 

TL,DR: I overdosed a while back as a cry for help but nothing happened in the long run to help me. Mom won't take mental health seriously. I'm cutting often. I'm going to drown myself sometime but I don't know when.
