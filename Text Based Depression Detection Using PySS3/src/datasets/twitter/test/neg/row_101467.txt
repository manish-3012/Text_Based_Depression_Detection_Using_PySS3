Tomorrow is my birthdayIt makes my stomach drop to think I will be 27 tomorrow. I've been so incredibly stressed and I just want my head to stop... I'm so tired.. I don't know why I stay.. I can't even get myself to get a good nights sleep. My eyes are always burning... I just want to disappear. I'm tired of being the "crazy" fucked up person... but my brain is winning. I don't want to be here. Maybe I will finally snap from the lack of sleep and just give in.
