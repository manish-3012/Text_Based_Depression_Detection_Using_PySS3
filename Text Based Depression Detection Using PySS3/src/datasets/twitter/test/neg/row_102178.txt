How to talk to about it?Iâ€™m 19 years old, I feel suicidal, although not to the degree I did right before this past Christmas, the feeling and desire is still there though. I feel like I canâ€™t express those feelings to anyone, not my parents or friends. I feel like Iâ€™m looking for attention then it that Iâ€™m burdening them. Iâ€™ve told one friend and that was when I was drunk on New Yearâ€™s Eve. Itâ€™s gotten better now that Iâ€™ve moved back to my home country, but all my friends live in a different country and because of reasons that I royally fucked up, I may not be able to go back and ever visit them there. So the feeling is still there, I still want to commit suicide, but I also want to talk to someone about it, but itâ€™s hard and I feel so alone. Does anyone have tips?
