The only reason I haven't pulled the trigger is my gun has been taken from me. I want my G19 back so I can give myself the absolution I desire while not harming the ones I love.I don't want to leave a mess for my family and loved ones to find but I feel it it my right to take my own life.  I seek only to minimize the impact on people that don't deserve to have to live with the consequences of my decision.
