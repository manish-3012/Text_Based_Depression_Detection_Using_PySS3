Thanks 2020I just got back from vacation to find I no longer have a job due to covid. While it is likely for the best since I have suffered permanent damage to my spine and feet from serving for 15 years, I still don't have any clue what I'm going to do. If I get another job in serving, I'll be in pain due to the damage. But I am also the sole caretaker to my children and the sole provider while my husband goes to school. I remain unhopefull that I will ever find another job that complies to my children's school schedule, especially since due to covid they are doing school from home. I just want to end it all. I want to stop being in pain. I want to stop being a burden. I want to stop worrying. I want to stop fighting just to get up in the mornings. I just want everything to stop.
