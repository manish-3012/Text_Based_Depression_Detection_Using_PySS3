How do I make this stop?I'm 35, probably an alcoholic, and I don't know how to stop, aside from making it all stop. I have a bf, and a decent job. I have a vehicle and a life. I just enjoy coming home at night and having a drink or 2 or 3. Because of my partners concerns, I tend to buy a set amount of beer or liquor, drink it, then be done, all before he gets home. I recently told him about my drinking, and he's insisted I stop, even helping in the ways he can. But even tho, I'm hiding a bottle of vodka from him and taking shots to unwind. I have attempted therapy, I can't afford it (literally in my country it costs more per week than I make in a week). I plan to be done, drink myself to death and pray he takes my beloved dog as his own.
