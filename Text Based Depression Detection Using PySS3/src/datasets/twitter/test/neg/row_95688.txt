HelpI'm 16 years old in CA, entering Sophomore year in High School. I've been feeling depressed and suicidal for years now, and I can't even remember the last time I felt happy. There is literally nothing good about my life. I'll start from the beginning: 

Parents divorced in 2006, spent following years in court fighting about who had to keep me. Both my father and my mother hate me so so much. I ended up living with my mother and my little brother. I really cared about my brother until my mother started brainwashing him into hating me. My mother used to whip me every couple of days, until I started running out of the house. She called the police on me a few times, and lied to them about how I'm violent and unstable, even though it was really her.
I really try to be a great son, but every "I love you" is met with sarcasm and hate. I've never tried any drugs, alcohol, and I'm not in any gang or anything. I respect her completely, but yet she only cares about my little brother and thinks nothing of me. She's always saying how I'll end up homeless with no friends, I'm going to hell, she's going to kick me out as soon as I turn 18, etc etc. 
We're really poor too, even though we live in a decent city. I never ask her for anything, and I can't ask because we can't afford anything. I have only one friend that kind of talks to me, even though I'm as normal as everyone else. I really just want to die. There is nobody on this earth that cares about me. The only plan I have for the future is that I decided that I am going to join the Marine Corps after High School.
I really have nothing going for my life. I'm ugly, I'm stupid, and I'm going to die alone. I really just want to die. I've given up all hope.
