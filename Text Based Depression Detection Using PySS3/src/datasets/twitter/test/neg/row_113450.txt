Just Told my Parents Dont know How to Feel I just opened up to my parents about my depression and I don't even know how to feel. They really cared about me and told me that we would find therapy and stuff after quarantine ends. But then they kinda brushed it off as depression and said I'm not really depressed but it's just a phase and that I shouldn't use the phrase depressed. I feel kinda relieved that I have my parents to help me through this but at the same time I just feel the same way as if I didn't tell my parents and I really thought telling them would help ease my depression but it really didn't. I'm currently a shit show on the inside a bunch of mixed 'feelings'(ig but idek what feelings or emotions are at this point). Hoping someone can help plz. :)
