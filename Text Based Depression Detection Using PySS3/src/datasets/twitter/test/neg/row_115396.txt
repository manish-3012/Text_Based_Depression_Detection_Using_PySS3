I'm not worth the air I breatheWhere do I start? I am a 19 year old college student in the US. I still haven't decided what I am going to do with my life. I am weak. I am so weak. I live with my parents and brother. My parents make me feel crippled. I can't go anywhere without them asking where I'm going. I think about killing myself literally every single day, at least once per hour. I think about shooting myself, getting shot by the police, swerving into a bus head-on, jumping off a cell-phone tower...

They don't know I'm gay. I dated a man ten years older than me for a year. He was funny, intelligent, handsome, and was the one person who could genuinely make me feel alive, like I actually meant something. He was everything I wanted in a person. After a while, he wanted to have a polyamorous relationship with me, him, and his ex, and I gladly went all for it, until he dumped me and just got back together with his ex. Just thinking about them together fills me with an incredible mixture of sadness and jealousy and anger I didn't know existed.

It's been two years since that happened and haven't been with anyone since. And today, I found out a guy who I've been in love with for a long, long time, turns out to hate my guts. I don't think I have ever felt a worse kind of pain in my life. 

I haven't talked to any of my friends in months. I am incredibly dull and quiet and boring. And I really am quiet and shy; have been that way ever since I was a kid. People always tell me, "You're really quiet, aren't you?" and that just makes me want to shrivel up and die.

I was on anti-depressants for a year but it didn't help at all.

I am so weak and worthless and this world would be a much better place without me in it.
