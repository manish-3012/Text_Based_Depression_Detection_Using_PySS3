Is anyone listening?(16yo)As im on this sub, we all can tell its not going good for me.  Its not even being sad i just stopped caring, chaos doesnt let me break threw so my life is 24/7 fighting my own mind. I always knew that alone i wont do that... im weak. I wont overcome power that gets twicr as strong each day. Who i can talk to bout it? i dont havr friends,  parents keep calling me not doing a thing just being lazy. Suprized that i dint have power to do anything even that i just woke up. Im getting numb and cold, selfharming isnt eay of coping no mo. Its just a thing i like to do thinking i deserve that. All started just cuz i have BPD, kids in school bullied me cuz of that. I hate my self for having that so hard. I wish i die but im too big coward to do it so i keep going on even that whatever i do anyday, at night i still think of sucidie. I think im getting closer... soon i might actually do it. week/2. Even if it gon be better in 4 or more years. I cant handle even week no mo w mess in my head and there is no one to help me sorting it out." What bout reddit?" As always. ill endup w 0 reaction prolly. Im not surpzied at some point, but on other hand each time i post i checkup on it hoping i got more than... nothing? 

either way sry this one was so chaotic, im just gettig more and more desperated
