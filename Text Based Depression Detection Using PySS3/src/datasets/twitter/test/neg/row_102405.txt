I thought it was over, guess not...I'm 13 and gay, and I actually thought I was accepted, but reality shoved a big "**NO**" in my throat.

Unfortunately for me, I am just in 8th grade and if I want to get out of this nightmare, I would have to wait for four more years.

People in my school are really mean and obnoxious, they even drove this girl to killing herself (which thankfully, she never did), and I developed a great fear of these people. I would stay up at night just thinking about it. I was crying all the time and keeping my head down cause I'll never impress them.

I got to the point where I already bought a blade and I was just waiting for the right time to do it. Fortunately, this happened two weeks before vacation so I thought I could control myself for a while. 

That's where I'm wrong. Today, this person wrote a post on facebook and you probably guessed who he was talking about and I just stood there until it finally sank in. 

Well, it's only three days away until the start of classes, and I have never been more scared in my life.  Guess its time to start my nightmares again. 

I wrote my suicide note and I'm just waiting for the right time.
