I played myselfI recall being suicidal at 8, 12 and the entire duration of high school. I kept delaying it and had a close call in 2016. Sometimes I canâ€™t help but feel that I should have done it way earlier. 

I couldnâ€™t decide between nursing and medical school. Wanted to do nursing since itâ€™s much easier and less time consuming than medical. Currently an LPN thanks to trade school. went to college and majored in biology since my Christian mother was all like â€œGod said youâ€™re a neurosurgeonâ€ after I asked her to inquire about my â€œcallingâ€ since he  likes her enough to reply.

As my luck would have it, college is absolute shit. I hate chemistry and all the math classes I have to take. I hate my major, the school, the teachers. I donâ€™t want to sit for for a 7+ hour MCAT (itâ€™s like SAT on crack + bio, biochem, physics etc) I barely made it through trade school and somehow passed the NCLEX. College is kicking my ass, so what makes me think I can go to and graduate from medschool. 

I lost my lab internship at a renowned due to my &lt;3.0 GPA. I had a break to â€œget my grades upâ€,  but itâ€™s so much worse this round, I might just ghost them when they ask â€œhowâ€™s it goingâ€

I went to the dean today to drop a fucking trig class. YES TRIG. Fuck Iâ€™m such a dumbass. school calendar posted online was absolutely fucked. The dean told me that it was wrong and I should have referred to a SLIP of PAPER given at orientation. ORIENTATION FOR THE SPRING TERM. Iâ€™m not a transfer, so why the hell would I go to Spring Orientation. They didnâ€™t even announce that. 

I managed to gather three consistent mentors through out the years. An MD-PHD I met in middle school, a pediatric ICU doctor who I met through a teacher, and a medical student I met through the aforementioned internship. Iâ€™m letting them all down. 

My mom wonâ€™t shut up about how Iâ€™m a nurse in college going on to medical school. I havenâ€™t been accepted to anything. Iâ€™m failing math and barely passing chem. I ainâ€™t shit.

School has been stressing me out since 8th grade. Iâ€™m dropping out to work and save up enough money for cremation. Fuck higher education. I canâ€™t transfer anywhere with grades like this.
