I don't want to be alone anymoreI don't know what to do. I just want to be able to create a connection with someone without being so anxious or afraid. I just want to talk to someone without being so afraid of being judged. I just want to be able to be myself without being scared of doing so. I just want a friend or a partner or just someone who I won't try and run away from. I want to talk to someone without being afraid of them trying to put me back in a hospital. I want to stop hating myself so much. I've already tried to end my life but I couldn't even do it right. I'm so scared of everything and I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm 16 and I feel like I don't have the right to feel the way I do and I just hate myself more because of it. I want help but I'm scared of getting it. I just wan't a friend I guess. I don't know anything anymore. I don't even know what else to say.
