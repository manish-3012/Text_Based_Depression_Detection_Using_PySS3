I need helpOne of my online friends said theyâ€™re going to commit suicide with a gun, I donâ€™t know any information of where they live so I canâ€™t call the cops so they can check on them. Iâ€™ve had attempts in the past so itâ€™s helps that I can relate to them better but what should I say to make sure they stay safe and donâ€™t hurt themselves in a way that they canâ€™t repair?
