StrugglingStruggling to see what the point is. I donâ€™t want to die. Iâ€™m terrified of dying. I donâ€™t believe in any sort of afterlife so Iâ€™m scared that all the shit we get subjected to is it. So whatâ€™s the point in prolonging the inevitable? Weâ€™re going to die anyway. To make the most of what weâ€™ve got? Why? Thereâ€™s going to be nothingness when weâ€™re gone so again, what is the point?
