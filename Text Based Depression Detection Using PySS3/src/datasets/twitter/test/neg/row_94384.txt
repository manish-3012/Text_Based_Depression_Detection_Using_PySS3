Thoughts that built up overtimeYou know, when someone asks you whatâ€™s wrong but itâ€™s like... thereâ€™s so much wrong you donâ€™t even know where to start. Youâ€™ve had so many thoughts and breakdowns that you canâ€™t even remember or get anything out, because itâ€™s just too much?  So you sit there numb or staring into the void because itâ€™s just like, damn. Do I even know whatâ€™s wrong or going on anymore? After a while you just become numb or something. Putting your thoughts/feelings to the side because, nobodyâ€™s there to listen.
