I really wish I was never bornI don't even know why I'm posting here, I don't see how my life can change. I didn't experience major trauma, I didn't have big hardships in life, I feel so selfish and miserable for being the way I am. I've been depressed since I was 9 years old, from then, it took me some years to become suicidal too. Today I'm 17, every fucking situation that I experience causes me to panic, every fucking thing. I can't bear being anxious, panicked, depressed, and deep in my phobias all the time. I just want to rest, but I can't, I simply can't. I tried my entire life to feel happy, to be calm, to not panic all the fucking time, you know what? All these attempts served nothing. I'm still as miserable as always.

I wish so badly I was never born. Because truly, I don't wanna kill myself, I just don't want to have existed in the first place. But yet, I keep googling and trying to find ways to kill myself, but I don't have the ways neither the courage to try them.

I'm sorry for posting this. I just wish I was normal.
