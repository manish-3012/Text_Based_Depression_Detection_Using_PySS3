What can i do?Those antidepressants supposed to help me, but my mom knows how to ruin everything. She knows that i have VERY low self esteem, and every time i go to swim in pool, my mom says: â€œOh you gained weightâ€ and even saying â€œIf some things donâ€™t fit me,it means that your thing donâ€™t fit you.â€ Every damn thing i have in a house fits me perfectly. But thatâ€™s not a very big problem. 

She wants me to be like her. In everything. Even on folding goddamn clothes! 

-You did that wrong,do it again!

Thatâ€™s what i hear from her. 

That was the second problem. The biggest problem is that she makes me stressed. Every time i like photo on instagram, i think â€œOh,my mom would see this and she will make this
meme into 2 hour lessonâ€. Thatâ€™s why iâ€™m rarely on insta. Also, she is religious, and iâ€™m bisexual. If she will find out, she will try to â€œconvert me back to religionâ€. I donâ€™t want it. Every time i do my homework,i think â€œWhat if my mom will se this? She wonâ€™t like itâ€. 

She doesnâ€™t supports me much. But i donâ€™t kinda care. To be honest, she loves me and i love her and i donâ€™t want to make her sad, but i donâ€™t like the way she is talking and doing to me. She bought me a lot of games, i want to buy for her gifts. But this,what she does to me, makes me stressed and very sad.

I just want to kill myself, or at least, go live with my dad and move to Turkey with my dad. where my relatives are.

I wanna smoke sum blunt. I am too stressed. Nothing will happen to me if i will smoke one.
