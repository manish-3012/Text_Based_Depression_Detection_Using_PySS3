Oh man. I read sw and depression, and I so very badly wish there was something I could do to really make a difference to someone out there.  But I'm too afraid that I don't have the experience or stability to actually help. That I can't relate, that I'll make it worse. I communicated with some people recently and I recognize now some major mistakes I made.  Specifically mentioning alcohol or drugs as having temporarily helped me.

I worry that just offering an ear isn't enough.  I feel like just saying "I truly do care, and I want to listen" isn't good enough, because the next morning they are going to wake up in the same situation and it won't make any real difference.  And anything I say is just meaningless words.  Because I can't actually meet them and make them laugh, and make them feel better, feel hope, truly be there for them in person.  Or, they are going to think "This guy doesn't truly understand, I guess no-one does.. why did I even try to reach out..." and it kills me reading their posts and wanting to respond but being too afraid. A long time ago people used to tell me that I had some sort of "gift", a "big heart", I could make anyone laugh, and feel good.  That they could "say anything" to me.  I've had people say they didn't want to be around me because they felt like I was "looking deep into [their] 'soul'" (I'm not religious, but that's the word they used).  I've been told that I'm "highly observant" and I think that's all it is, I pick up on the smallest facial expression or mannerism. They even gave me the nickname "Giggles", because I was always happy and making everyone around me laugh.  Someone once told me that I should be very careful who I trust, because others latch on to me because of the way I make them feel, and that ultimately makes me feel used and depressed, that I surrounded myself with people who don't really care about me. That was all before my own issues and I cut myself off from the world.  Man, I'm really tootin my own horn here eh? Maybe it's all bullshit, and I'm just a terrible selfish person trying to make myself feel special. I feel stupid saying all this, but these are things that people have really said to me. And with so many people who have said these things over the years, I have to believe I have some capacity to help others feel good.  But what if I dig my self into a huge situation, that I can't escape.  Some people are just fucking nuts man, and they will take advantage of me again and hurt me.  I guarantee if I met you I would make you laugh and feel better, but how do I do that, and safely, without being just words, on the Internet?  

I'm worried that I'm in such a bad state myself, that I shouldn't be trying to help others in the first place. Should I focus on fixing myself first?  But what about the people out there right NOW that need someone?  I've tried so hard to avoid asking for help for so long.  But I no longer have a choice.  It's die, or fix it.  And if I'm going to fix it, I'm finally ready to say after so long... that I need help.  I've been thinking more and more that I need to finally go see a doctor, that I can't get out of this myself, and I'm not as strong as I think I am. That I stay up for 3 or 4 days at a time, is probably a good indicator that this won't last much longer.  I think I might be going insane.. . :-/  ?? It's weird, I'm so strong for others, but I crumble when I'm alone, is it all just an act?  Who am I really?   I NEED TO SLEEP.  I. NEED. TO. FUCKIN. SLEEP.  I don't even know what I'm doing here.  Who am I posting too?  I've been drinking as I post this, I'm drunk now, Fuck... fuck fuck fuck..  I can't help anyone when I'm so bad.  I can't do this much longer, I want so bad to go back to when I felt nothing.  I have to find peace.  So I can find a way to stop others, someone, anyone, from going through this. :-/
