I keep thinking about dying. I just want to feel pain. Should I get help?I don't know if this is the right place to post. I have generalised anxiety and have been having a rough two weeks. I keep thinking about me dying by accident, and the urge to seek out dangerous situations so I can die by accident. Like I thought about not eating so I get really really weak and then expose my self to the covid19 so I can hopefully die. And I then thought about getting in a car crash by driving recklessly. Today I told my brother I don't mind dying. I don't think I've ever thought like this before. I don't know if this nothing or could get worst. I don't know what this is.
