Wish it all endedSold up, moved country with the wife and kid, no debt, car I own, around 60k in the bank.

Still hate myself and still living life 1 hour a time.

Dont speak the language here, not many friends and they're all far away, no job yet although the thought of going back to a dead end piece of shit job makes me wanna puke.

My meds don't fucking help at all. And even if I did try kill myself for the 4th time I'd also be fucking up my wife and kid's lives, so I can't leave the world guilt free.

I hate everything.
