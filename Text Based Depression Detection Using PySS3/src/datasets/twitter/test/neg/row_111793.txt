I'm almost there.I ordered the necessary things from the internet, all I gotta do is get to them before my family does when they arrive. I'm finally fucking done with life. I am sick of myself, and hate who I am and I will never change. Society looks down on suicide because it has been part of history to do so, but people don't realize that maybe it's the better choice. Maybe they actually want to do it. I'm sick of following false incentives and lies. Bye.
