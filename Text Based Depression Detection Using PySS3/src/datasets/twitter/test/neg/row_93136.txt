My storyU know it is hard to write here, i literally writed this text 3 times and each one of it was a lie, so i wont lie now.
When i was young I was badly treated, so i decide to hang myself cuz there was nothin in this world that could keep me here, and I did but the rope broke and i got a souvenir at the neck from the rope. Of course i never told anybody the true story i was just sayin that friend did it to me, well i dont have friends girlfriend and i dont talk with ppl most of the time im spendin time playin or sleepin. But than at our school came this new girl wich I love, I tried my force for 1 year to get courage to ask her to go out, well it didnt go well, she was standin up front on me and i started cryin but I said to myself, "that is your chance, just ask her god damn" and i did i was with her 3 years well it couldnt been called relationship, anyway after break up i tried my second suicide, and gues what, I cut myself, well and that gone wrong obviously, I pass out all in bleed, well I was still livin so that is the sad part. Than I looked at her picture on my phone, and said to myself "I will do everything to be with u" since than past 4 years. Well right now every day im draw her and cry. Every day i pick same road to home just to see her. Well still dont have friends and dont talk with parents even that if we live together. That was my retarded story, hope u enjoyed. That was the first time i wrote that down i could skip some part.
PS: I dont know that good English, so it might be notunderstandable.
