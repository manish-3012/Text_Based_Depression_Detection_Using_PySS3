HelpI keep getting closer and closer to making an attempt. I don't know what to do. I'm sick of being in mental and physical pain. I don't know what's going to happen to me. I've tried getting help. I've tried everything. People said it'd get better but it hasn't and I don't want to let them down but I'm so so tired. I can't go back to hospital
