Why should I bother living if that means to be a wage slave?28 year old, male, unemployed since the beginning of time, schizophrenia with cognitive symptoms with a 33 % disability. I can't work in what I want, all that's left are shitty jobs I don't want, I would rather kill myself, at least I don't have to become a slave to kill myself. I have thought about it for years and I cope with life because I know I will eventually kill myself and be free of this shitty place called Earth. 

I am tired and bored every day and wish I was dead with or without depression. I don't understand why others bother with life, I guess that's why there are many suicides in some countries. I don't care about anyone (including myself), I don't care about anything. I just wait patiently until the time to kill myself comes (when my parents are die).
