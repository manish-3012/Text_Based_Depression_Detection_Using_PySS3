It would barely make any difference if I die anywayI didn't graduate, don't work a formal job (I do online freelance), I have two friends tops and no partner, only two family members who would mourn me, so its not like it'd make much of a difference if I died. I havent made any impact. It's pointless to stick around.

It's 99.99% confirmed that I'll never be happy, as the poverty cycle shows no mercy to anyone. The 0.1% is in case some rich foreigner stumbles upon me, decides they actually don't find me annoying or ugly or stupid or useless, and decides to get me out of this fucking boring ass country.

lmfao. It feels so miserable sticking around with such weak reasons. idk what i'm trying to accomplish posting here. I just hope I'll get a heart attack while I sleep.

Please pray for me so that'll happen. It's all I want, and more realistic than my poor shitty life ever improving.
