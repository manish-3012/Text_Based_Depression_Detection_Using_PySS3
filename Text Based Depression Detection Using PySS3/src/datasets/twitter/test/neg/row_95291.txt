Bad thoughts.I'm 25 years old. I've always been a somewhat solitary and introverted person, but in the last year or so I feel that I have really hit rock bottom. There is no love in my life. The very few close friends that I have are in the process of outgrowing me as they establish their careers and get married. I just got back from a night out with them where I might as well have been invisible. I haven't been able to relate to anyone in my family in years. I just spend a lot of time with negative thoughts in my head and have been unemployed for about 2 years. I can't connect or look anyone in the eye when I'm out in public and on the off chance that I even try, the self doubt that I experience is crippling. I feel best immediately after the runs that I go on, but those moments are fleeting.

My living situation is disfunctional. It's just me and my mom in a big house, so I at least get some privacy. I try to tell myself that it's her fault how my life has turned out and I hate myself for it. Even the most insignificant interactions that I have with her just piss me off irrationally. I never had a stable social life as I was growing up. I had 4 older siblings who all moved out for college by the time I was cognizant of the fact that my mom and dad never spoke to each other. I was forced to switch schools several times and I never recovered. Since then my circle of friends has gotten increasingly smaller and it's gotten to the point where I just don't trust people with my feelings anymore. I know that it sounds extremely petty for me to be so fixated on something that many people face at some point, but if I had to pick a moment in time... I spend a lot of time just browsing the facebook pages of people that I knew in high school and seeing how practically everyone I've ever known has surpassed me in every way imaginable unless they're a corpse. Tonight I deactivated my fb account out of frustration, but I have a feeling that this will just add to my isolation.

The world is just passing me by. I don't think I accomplished a single thing all last year and it's fucking depressing. I'm currently in the process of finishing my education at a fifth tier college. When I think about my options for success, which at this point would just be not living in a basement, the one thing that always comes to my mind is enlisting in the military and getting myself killed in a pointless war to spare my family from the shame of a suicide. Most people would probably tell me to just man the fuck up, and I realize that my issues are 100% mental. It's just impossible to get anything done when I feel worthless all the time.
