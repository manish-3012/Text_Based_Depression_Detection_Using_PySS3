Fuck meSo yesterday I fucked up my entire life. I wonâ€™t tell the whole story, I will just say Me and a kid in my class almost killed eachother and now we have to see a therapist, but after the doctors told me I had broken my leg, but was still moving fine and barely registered the pain, Iâ€™ve been put under 24/7 watch to make sure I donâ€™t hurt myself, because there isnâ€™t anything wrong with the parts of my body that feel pain, itâ€™s my brain that has numbed it out after being cut so many times. I donâ€™t know what to do.

Iâ€™ve always just cut myself for any reason I can think of, I love it. That feeling of being light-headed, half-conscious and the blood dripping out of your body. But a while ago it started to become more common because of my depression and it turned into a suicidal thing. 

I want to kill myself, but how? Everywhere I go people are watching me. They say the care, but itâ€™s just another fucking cunt trying to make themself look good. I was in a relationship with my girlfriend for about 3 hours, because I chose to break up with her because I was ruining her reputation, but itâ€™s too late. 

Iâ€™ve fucked up everything, my life, my brain, my body and the lives of those close to me. All I can do is pray that something puts me out of my misery.
