I've got what I need, but I am too scared to try this againI've got a lethal dose ready with a bottle of alcohol to compound the CNS effects.  I've read extensively on this combination, with firsthand physician accounts of lethality and lack of a fast detection method basically guaranteeing I will succeed if I try.


I am worried if I fail or am found I will lose my freedom to try again either through institutionalization or by disabling myself somehow.  

I haven't wanted to be alive since I was 8.  I'm 34.  I never finished school due to bullying, learning disabilities and self worth issues.  I have no practical knowledge or skills, lack the ability to learn said skills (I've fucking tried, and over the years have figured out I'm too stupid), and am too 'crazy' to hold a job.  I had one at a store owned by a close friend and I couldn't even do that 3 days a week.  I've got a volunteer gig with a local neighborhood association clearing snow for elderly and mobility impaired folks that pays an honorarium that amounts to less than  $100 /month in reality, cant qualify for CRB, can't get eia/disability.

I am worthless and useless.  I have severe anxiety and depression, BPD, ADHD, eating disorders.  I have two friends left to me, and I can't lean on them anymore.  I don't  want this life.  I never did.  Why the fuck am I being forced to keep it?
