Struggled with depression whole life; body dysmorphia and recovering from surgery; recently a bad break upI've struggled with depression and anxiety as long as I can remember. I am a transracial adoptee born with a cleft lip and palate. I was loved, but it was tough. Over 20 surgeries (on my face) and lots of work on building a sense of dignity and self-respect. I'm a musician, and music was something that no one could take from me. I've been in graduate school for a long while getting a PhD at a prestigious program. That's also tough and wrecks your self-worth.

Back in June, I had some scar revisions on my lip that were "due" (very common for someone my age, ~30). Unfortunately, they did not go well and I've struggled with nursing it, trying to keep it from scaring even more, and with painful post-op. treatments: steroid injections that go directly into my lip... it's so painful I almost pass out. Months of that. Then in January I had another very small revision to correct again (they did more injections while I was under...it was so painful I woke up). It's still not doing well and I feel like giving up. I feel like I wrecked my face. (Though some tell me they don't notice, especially my parents. People tell me I'm handsome without solicitation. It doesn't help.)

I also just went through a bad breakup (a week out). The past 2 years with this woman have been at times blissful but mostly devastating. She revealed late in the relationship that was married but it was a loveless, toxic relationship. She had a dark past of working as a sex worker and finding her way out wasn't pretty. It was tough; she was selfish and at times emotionally abusive and manipulative. But we are both survivors and we tried to make it work. I don't like the "savior complex" for why I stayed with her; the simpler explanation is that I loved her (and she me) and I didn't want to abandon her. There was something there that was more powerful than our pasts and we could overcome it. 

But over the course of those 2 years, my dignity chipped away. Her constant lying, hot/cold needs, and her toxic situation with her husband ate at me. We let each other go last week and I'm trying to figure out where my confidence, my self-respect went that I worked so hard to get earlier in life. Moreover, nursing the scars continues and it is torturous. Grad school continues to demoralize for reasons that you can read everywhere (most of us are in therapy). I feel like I'm starting all over again...

I am on meds; I see both a counselor and a psychiatrist (I am..depending on which doc. you ask... bipolar II). I have excellent family and friend support. But it all doesn't seem like enough. I love my family and I love my friends, and I would never want to hurt them. But as I write this, I'm not sure I can keep up... the sadness is too big.  

_______________
I've always prided myself at being big-hearted and poised to listen. Friends have told me such and that that capaciousness has led to rich, loving relationships. But the hurt and deep feelings of injustice about still having to care for my cleft, about adoption and my race, about how I'm in an inert professional state in graduate school, and now having worked my heart dry at this relationship seems to intensify each day.

My therapists and I know the drill. *Do you have a plan?* *Of course, I do. I've been thinking on it for years.* 

While I don't think that I ever "cried wolf," I feel like this time is more serious than before. I don't know how much friend/family support, good therapy/meds, and just gum-shun I need (I have loads) in order to just get on with my life and feel **free** of myself. I have all the resources that some don't have, and yet still I feel like I can't get away.

About a week after the last operation in January, I was able to go outside for the first time. It was dark and I walked maybe a mile. I remember praying for the first time in a long while. It was more like a statement than a prayer, really, and I said it out loud. "I could be doing so much more if you'd just let me." By which I meant, if I didn't have to spend so much energy just managing the situation I am in, I could use that energy for good and not self-care to take care of the parts that want to fall apart as soon as I take my eyes of of them. I feel angry, frustrated, defeated...weary for my age (30).

I want to kill myself and I'm feeling less and less afraid of it. I have more reason to now than ever. I've had a good, rich life...full of music, conversation, food, nature, and art. I have enough money saved to take care of expenses and debts for when I'm gone. I want to be with my family when it happens. See them again and say goodbye. I grew up in the wilderness. It would be very nice to see that again...
