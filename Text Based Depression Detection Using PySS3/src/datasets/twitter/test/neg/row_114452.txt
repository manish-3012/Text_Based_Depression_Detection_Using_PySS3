Gf [22,f] of 6 years left me [23,m]she says she loves me but she's not in love with me. says she dated me at the start because i was nice, not because she was attracted to me. i want to kill myself. what if im just ugly and cant get a gf. she was my first everything. she says she wants to see other people. i am going to do nc, but im just crying every day, eating, watching tv, going to sleep. when i drive i just scream at the top of my lungs inside the car because i know no one can hear me, and i just cry, and im crying right now writing this. i feel so depressed...

i am trying to hit the gym, but i just feel like what if this is all a waste of time and doesnt help cos im just ugly. people say they feel empty after a breakup but i just feel pain everywhere. my chest hurts so much, i can only sleep like 1 hour, and i wake up crying cos i have dreams that are just about her

she also left me just as i was about to propose to her, i had spent all my money to buy the ring and everything
