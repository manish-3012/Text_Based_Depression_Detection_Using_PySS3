the boy i loved tried to die, plz help me help himso me and this boy (both 17) talk everyday and have done since last year. iâ€™ve been in love with him since december but i know he isnâ€™t in a good position mentally for a relationship which i completely understand and can relate to on some level. 
he has anxiety, his mum died around a year ago and he denies it to cope but recently itâ€™s been dawning heâ€™ll never see her again, his dad treats him horribly but thereâ€™s no where else he can go. 
recently he told me he attempted suicide around 2 weeks ago. he feels like no one wants him around (despite simultaneously being aware thatâ€™s ridiculous) so feels itâ€™s best to avoid everyone. 

i just want to show him how much everyone loves him and having him around but itâ€™s hard to find the right words after telling him that. i canâ€™t relate to his bereavement or anxiety or a mentally abusive parent. 

iâ€™ve attempted myself a few times but it breaks my heart to see him feeling the way i felt. i understand him, i just donâ€™t know what to say to him because i sympathise? if that makes sense? i never received any super good help, most of the people in my life at the time said if i died theyâ€™d die too so obviously it wasnâ€™t great reassurance. 
is there anything i can say or do to help him?? so far he says iâ€™ve helped him but i know itâ€™s not enough

please, anything at all will help me
