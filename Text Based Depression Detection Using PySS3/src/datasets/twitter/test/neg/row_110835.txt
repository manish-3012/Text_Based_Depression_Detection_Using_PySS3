What do I even say on a suicide hotline?Dumb, I know, but Iâ€™ve been trying to call a suicide hotline for the past week and can never get to talk to a volunteer because I panic and hang up the phone everytime when my turn gets closer. What do I even say to the person? I donâ€™t know what to say after they introduce themselves or how to transition into talking about my life (not sure if they tell you to since I never made it that far on a call). I have trouble speaking about myself to my therapist even so this is a nightmare lol.

Also, I know thereâ€™s chatrooms but here in my country these are always overcrowded, everytime I try thereâ€™s a waiting line of at least 100 people before me, and it only works at specific times of the day. Itâ€™s closed right now and I really need to talk to someone :(
