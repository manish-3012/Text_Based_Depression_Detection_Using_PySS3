I donâ€™t want to live to my 20th birthdayIâ€™m gonna turn 20 in a couple of days and I honestly donâ€™t want to live to then. Iâ€™m a failure, a disappointment, and I bring nothing to the world. Iâ€™ve been feeling like this for years, and Iâ€™ve attempted to take my own life three times already in the past with pills, and today is the fourth time. Iâ€™ve failed each time just like everything else in my life. Iâ€™m always pushed to the side, no oneâ€™s first choice, always at the bottom. Iâ€™ve been abused since childhood by my mother, and although our relationship has gotten better the effects of that still haunt me to this day. Itâ€™s not completely good, as I have admitted to her once before that Iâ€™ve been feeling suicidal and her response was the beat me instead for being abnormal. I have friends and family, but they donâ€™t really know the things Iâ€™ve really been through because Iâ€™ve just felt like I would be judged so heavily. The people I have opened up to in the past have just abandoned me or used it against me. I was violated last year and publicly humiliated by the guy that did it, and itâ€™s my fault that I put myself in that situation. For years, Iâ€™ve been just feeling pain and trying to fight through it but itâ€™s just been so hard and Iâ€™ve reached my breaking point. I hate burdening the people around me and I appreciate the ones that have been trying to help but I simply just canâ€™t take it anymore. I havenâ€™t been sleeping, I havenâ€™t been eating properly, Iâ€™ve been trying to cut it a bad habit recently and itâ€™s just making everything worse. This is the lowest point of my life and I donâ€™t know what to do. This is my last chance, Iâ€™ve already tried four times and itâ€™s never working.
