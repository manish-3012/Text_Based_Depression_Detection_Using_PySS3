Im fucked upI don't know what to do I have my final exam tomorrow and I can't study ...May be because I hate this education system...It's killing me...Why do I have to fucking mug up these formulas when I know it's of no use...Now you may think that I am running away from my problems..May be iam...But I don't have anyone to share  how I truly feel...I tried to suicide 2 years back and as you  know I was unsuccessful...From that moment my parents always supported me..They loved me more and they are the best parents in the world and they want me to score good marks but I don't think I can coz every time I open the book to study I feel like why am I wasting my time..I feel so fucking empty and demotivated that I wanna die...If I don't score good marks they will be sad what should I do..I don't want to write the board exam..coz I don't believe in this education system..Believe me I have tried my best ...I was the second topper in 11th ... First time being studious but I wasn't happy..I really don't wanna do these ...I like dancing and programming and swimming but due to school and the stupid system I wasted my life trying to study all the equations and theories from the text book
I don't want this...I'm so tensed and depressed I don't know what I will do...Its so hard...I don't want these and my parents won't understand coz they think that to get a job u need to pass 12th...I'm tired I am acting so bold infront of them telling that I will get good marks...I cry in the washroom everyday...Why should I be judged on the basis of marks..I don't want this ....Please help me
