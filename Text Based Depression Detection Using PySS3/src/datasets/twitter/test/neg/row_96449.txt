I'm aloneFor awhile I relied on my small group of friends as a way of making it seem like I wasn't the only lonely miserable asshole around. But now both of my friends are happy, and I'm still miserable. I was on antidepressants for about 2 weeks, they made me feel physically strange, and I couldn't quite think straight, so I stopped taking them, maybe not the best decision, but I made it. I don't know, seeing how happy my friends are just makes me even more less so, it's nearly to the point where i'm mad at them for being happy. I'm such a piece of shit, but I can't help it, I can't be happy for my own friends, I have to resent them. I guess misery loves company, i don't really know, but I'm so sick of feeling alone, I just want to die, it just sounds so much better than this. Honestly I dont know what i expect, it's not like anyone would care enough to be with me anyway, im fucking repulsive.

I dont know, this isnt going to help, id just backspace this out, but i might as well just go with it at this point. Jesus christ, im 17 and all i look forward to is the possibility of death, the thought that i could possibly be diagnosed with terminal cancer actually EXCITES me, what the hell is wrong with me. I used to want to help people, to make the world a better place, i had hopes, but lately all of that seems so diminished, i dont really have hope anymore, my dreams mean nothing anymore. god, im rambling. 

I just want something to change, I dont want to feel alone anymore, i want to be happy. I want the idea of dying to scare me rather than excite me. i dont want to keep feeling like shit all the time, I used to enjoy video games, but i dont even get pleasure out of that anymore. sorry, thanks for reading? i guess.
