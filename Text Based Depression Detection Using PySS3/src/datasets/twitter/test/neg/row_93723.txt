I'm only 22 but I just want it to end already. What do I do...I'm feeling horrible and miserable and I don't know what to do so I'm going to rant on reddit and try to maybe get some feedback or just share my shitty story. My name is robotrocketleo and I just turned 22 in the first week of June. No one really remembered my birthday though because a lot of other things were going on. Only my father told me happy birthday. I've struggled with depression for many years and I've always contemplated suicide but everything just started going downhill recently and I just don't know how much longer I can keep this up.
On June 1st, my roommate Kenny (35M) robbed my apartment of everything I own after threatening me with a gun and a knife and assaulting me; he took all of my clothes, and a picture of me and my father; not to mention all my valuables such as cash, books, electronics, food and the money he owed me for prior 2 months rent that he was going to give me that day. He literally took everything from me that I owned and trashed the whole place leaving literal trash everywhere such as his cigarette butts and ash and putting holes in the walls. I filed a police report but they told me that there's nothing they can do. Their exact words were, "this is a classic he said she said situation and there's nothing we can do for you." (Even though I'm a guy) Apparently they talked to him and they trusted him and didn't believe me or something? I mean, I came back from work to find the front door to my apartment wide open, all his stuff was gone too, so I called the police immediately and they came and took pictures and left me with a paper to fill out a report. I asked them to stay with me just a little while longer while I fill out the form because I didn't feel safe but they just left me there alone. Then, right after the police left the apartment, Kenny called me to extort me for more money for my own things which I never got back. Plus to threaten me some more about sending people after me to kill me if I went through with filing the police report. So ya that sucked. 
Then 3 days after that happened, my mother suffered from a cerebral aneurysm and barely survived. I moved back home with nothing but the clothes on my back to see my mother in the hospital and care for her once she got out which took about 3 weeks. Those first few weeks me and my dad got barely any sleep. We just stayed at the hospital but knowing what was going to happen. Eventually they performed the surgery and kept her in ICU for a few weeks and now I watch over her every day helping her with whatever she needs. Cooking, cleaning, driving around town to run errands for her. Whatever she needs I take of it without any complaints or questions. I love my mother and this really scared me. I realized that all the material things I got taken from me didn't matter because my mother wasn't taken from me. Now I try to just make sure she's happy because you never know how much longer you have together.
So I've been back home since then trying to make the best of it and not sink into my deepening depression that's always lurking right around the corner, always in the back of my mind, hiding in the shadows of my own thoughts and suddenly my girlfriend Maria (20F) just starts ignoring me after treating me like shit. As if she didn't care about me at all. We've been together for over 3 years now. I don't know what to do anymore. I love her. I wanted to marry her and grow old together but she just disappeared out of my life after treating me horribly after these incidents. Like she just didn't care about what I was going through and she made it really clear she didn't care about my feelings. 
I was staying in Denver before I was robbed and I was drinking heavily on a daily basis and smoking marijuana heavily as well. It was to help me cope with my depression and loneliness because Maria was living in Maryland. Now I've been clean and sober and it felt great at first but now I can't sleep, I can't eat and I cry every night alone in the dark and wake up in the middle of the night covered in sweat and tears from my night terrors. 
So reddit, what do I do? I seriously just want this all to end but I know that's selfish of me because there's no one else to care for my mother right now. But if I'm gone, I won't be worried about it, right? And if I'm gone, I won't be a burden to anyone. Give me some advice internet. Tell me that killing myself isn't a good thing... Because I can't talk to anyone real about it without just feeling worse for burdening people with my shitty life and my own shitty problems that I can't seem to handle on my own. I need help, but I have no friends to help me. The only person that I thought cared about me is gone now and I don't know how to get her back.
P.S. My mother isn't incapacitated. She could take care of herself if she had to (not too much permanent damage), and if not, assisted living is airways an option.
