So I think im actually just going to give in tonight.I can't stand sitting here and watching everyone in my life be so happy and travel and party. I cant be happy, I just cannot do it. I cannot have fun, I never have fun I never learned how to.
I will never be able to love again. I will never be able to trust anyone, I cant even trust myself.
I cant get a job and if I do it is just going to be some shitty ass job where I dont make enough money to progress in life.
I tried going to school and I just cant do it, ive tried a few times and its just something I cannot do.
I honestly want to be happy but I truly believe it is not going to happen. People say oh in 20 years you will look back and laugh at how stupid you were, well im pretty sure im going to look back and think about how I should have just gotten rid of myself now.
I dont have anyone to talk to about this so im posting it to you. I cant go to a therapist, I just cant afford it.
I cant sit here confined to my room while everyone is out and enjoying life and I contemplate suicide everyday.

Tonight I think I will go by carbon poisoning myself with my car.
Maybe someone can change my mind but I really dont see that happening.
