I'M THINKING ABOUT LEAVINGI want to leave this life.  It's been nothing but challenging.  I'm 14 and I've been abused my whole life.  I just don't see why I need to be here.  I know that acetaminophen in high doses can really do some damage to your liver.  I'm thinking that's the way to go.  I've got 6 Nyquil bottles in front of me on the counter.  I'm thinking about chugging them all down.  I just can't take this anymore.  I'll wait to see what you guys have to say before drinking any of them.  If you can offer me hope that'd be great.  It just feels like nothing will ever get better.  :(
