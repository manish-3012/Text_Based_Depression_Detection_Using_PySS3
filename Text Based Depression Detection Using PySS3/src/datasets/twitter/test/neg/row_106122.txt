I'm doneLife is too hard. I spent my life until now thinking my anxiety problems were all because of my social issues, but now that I actually have solid friends, I realize that was never the case, and I still don't know why I'm anxious. Do you know how it feels to have an anxiety attack in front of everyone you care about? I just... Don't know what to tackle. Therapy doesn't work, time doesn't work, self care doesn't work, I just want to die. I JUST WANT TO DIE AND I KNOW HOW STUPID IT SOUNDS BECAUSE MY PROBLEMS ARE RELATIVELY MINOR. I'm sorry I hope you didn't waste too much time reading this I don't even know why I posted.
