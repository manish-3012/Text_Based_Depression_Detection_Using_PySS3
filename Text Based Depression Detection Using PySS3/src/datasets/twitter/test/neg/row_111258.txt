Ready to go...I have a box of items that need to be tossed out and a program to obliterate my HDD. Nothing illegal, just interests that my family doesn't need to know I had. I've been listening for the trains, trying to figure out if they have a predictable schedule. I figure I could walk down there and lay my neck across the rails as one of them comes by. Quick and easy. Mostly painless and it wouldn't have to be my family that finds the body. I just need to find a good home for my awesome little Boston Terrier, Lucy.

I spent several years almost completely numb. Doing it crossed my mind ocassionally, but mostly as a way to end the slow meaningless trudge toward the end that was going to come one way or another. Living with my parents long after I should have moved out. No job, no license, no real friends. Just existing. The family moved right after I graduated highschool and I my only option was to go with them. Friends were left behind and my only friends after that were work friends, the sort you go out drinking with from time to time but not the sort that would be there for you if you really needed them. Was lied to by my highschool principal and promised that a dimploma from the "continuation school" (where trouble makers and pregnant girls used to get sent) was the same as a real diploma. Turns out it isn't. 

Then a friend that I knew from an alliance chatroom for a game we both played broke up with her boyfriend. We started chatting more in private rooms, texting, phone calls, really getting to know each other. Then she invited me to fly out and spend some time with her, just for some fun, nothing serious. So of course I did. I put the shyness aside and flew to Texas She's gorgeous and a wonderful person and I'd never forgive myself if I didn't go see her. It was so nice falling asleep next to another person, with them in my arms. Or waking up with her draped across my chest. It's so much diferent than drunken hook ups with strangers you'll never see again (duh?). I'll interrupt you here though because I already know what you're thinking and no, it's not over a woman. Not some sort of unrequited love thing. It's about how she opened my eyes to just how lonely and unhappy I really have been all these years. The worst part is how I got to a point that 
I didn't even notice anymore.

I spent so long just empty and apathetic that I'd gotten used to it. Like walking with a rock in your shoe. It sucks at first but eventually you'll get used to it and you stop noticing it so much. Visiting her was like taking it out and remembering how nice it feels not to have that damned rock in there.

So instead of just putting the rock back in the shoe when I got home I said "Fuck this!" and decided to do something about it. If I wanted any hope of finding someone to share my life with I needed a job and for that I needed my license because where I live public transportation isn't really an option, neither is riding a bike like I've done for past jobs before moving here. So I got the book, studied it, took the written test and got my permit. I was feeling pretty good. Things were looking up and i was actually smiling on some days. I was off my ass, making progress. But that's where it stopped. I have to have a licensed driver with me to practice and I know I won't pass the driving test without some practice. But I can't get any help. I can't get any time behind the wheel except an ocassional trip down the street to the minimart.

I damned near had to tell my mother I was thinking about suicide just to get a ride to the DMV for the written test. I didn't use that word, just said that I was very unhappy and I really needed some help to fix it. Before that asking about a ride to the DMV got me snapped at like a fucking child that's pestering the adults with constant requests for candy.

I'm starting to feel like accepting that rock is my only option and I'm not going to do that. I'll stop walking before I put the rock back in my shoe. The things I used to love doing don't bring me pleasure anymore. They simply kill time now. I do them out of habit and boredom rather than because I actually want to do them.

I know that my situation is my fault. I had opportunities to better myself when I was younger and that could have led to a decent job. My "not quite a diploma" diploma doesn't mean shit so I need to get a crap job to get money to at least go to some sort of trade school to get something decent. I should have done something sooner. But chose not too. It was just so easy to drift along. With a crap job making just enough to pay the parents a little rent and have enough left to entertain myself. I could have gotten a license sooner. Had to go without a seizure for awhile to show it was controlled by my medication. But by the time that was ok I was already coasting along and not caring.

I'm not even sure why I'm posting this here. Maybe it's becuse I don't intend to leave some sappy suicde note. Just a simple "Goodbye and I'm sorry". Maybe I'd just like someone to know. Even if they are just strangers. Once I made the decision and started things moving by packing up my embarrassing stuff and looking for a home for my dog I started feeling lighter. Started sleeping better. It was kind of a relief. I'll be tossing out the box this coing Sunday. They pick up the garbage on Monday. I should have the trains schedule figured out by then.
