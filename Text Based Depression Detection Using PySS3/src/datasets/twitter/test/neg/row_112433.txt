I wish I had done it.I didnâ€™t even attempt. I broke down and told my mom. I went to the hospital and started realizing that life could get better. iâ€™d make more friends, enjoy life again, and maybe even find love. all those things happened.  iâ€™m still depressed.  i hate myself just as much. iâ€™m scared no matter how wonderful life is, no matter how hard I try to appreciate it, iâ€™ll always be miserable.  i donâ€™t want to grow up just to stay the same. iâ€™ve tried change. iâ€™ve met people i love more than anything. i have such a good life and instead iâ€™m miserable.  I wish I had done it . I wish I had just ended the pain instead of dragging it on for so much longer.  i wish I could just disappear.
