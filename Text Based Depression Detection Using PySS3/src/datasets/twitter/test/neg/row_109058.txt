I just don't know anymoreI've been battling depression and suicidality for over 30 yrs, since I was like 11 or 12. In and out of therapy, on and off tons of drugs. I've had several attempts, my last one being 12 years ago. I've only had one long period of what seemed like feeling normal, and that was in the mid 90s. Before that, I never understood why everyone didn't want to kill themselves. 

For the last three years I've been pretty actively suicidal (my long-term boyfriend broke up w/ me the same week I was laid off from my job), but I've been hanging on. I'm under the care of a psychiatrist I see 2x/month, and a therapist I see 2x a week. 

But I feel like I'm done. I'm just so tired of everything. I'm not getting better. I feel like I'm getting worse. No one really cares about me, and it wouldn't make any sort of impact if I went, except my homeless couch-surfer would be really homeless. He doesn't like me very much anyway. 

I used to think that my parents were cold and had difficulty expressing tenderness and love. I recently discovered that they're only this way to _me_. I've never heard "I love you" from either of them, but I've recently heard them say it to each other, and to my brother, and to my sister-in-law. So, they wouldn't care. I have very few acquaintances who would care either. I think they'd care in a vague, "Oh, that's sad" way. And they'd never think about me again. My ex was the only person who cared about me, or at least I thought he did until he cheated on me and told me I was old and fat and not attractive anymore. 

I'm old, I'm tired. I'll never have anyone who loves me again. What's the point?

I'm not really looking for an answer. Thanks for listening.
