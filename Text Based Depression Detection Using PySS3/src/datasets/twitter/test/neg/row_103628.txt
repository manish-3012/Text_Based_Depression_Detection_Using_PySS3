Am I worst than Onision?Hilo I've had a very shitty social life in general and I'm an awful person so all I can do is be better than the person I was yesterday. I will tell you my full story because I want you to understand. I presently have a lot of trouble dealing with certain social circumstances because for the first 11-13 years of my life I experienced mostly social isolation and social withdrawal due to bullying and harassment. I was often bullied and harassed for my awful vision,awful hearing,lack of riches,athletic inability,my name,and even social stress.I didn't like this so I became the quietest female in my class.I was sent to a private school and I was an outcast for these lack of attributes.(I was usually socially confused as to what was going on a lot too since I was very young) I literally had no real friends. I had these two females when I was 11-13 years old when one would only hang out with me online and then would bully me irl. The other would only hang out with me on holidays and then eventually hung out with me too much because she started blackmailing me about who I should and should not hang out with or else she would harass me and cause me a lot of stress. They eventually moved away from me one to Virgina that ghosted me and the other to another city. I was often lied a lot to and I'm very gullible so I've said a lot of shitty things.I grew up to be apathetic instead of empathetic because I suffered a lot of loneliness growing up. From 12-14 years old. I was often bullied and harassed everywhere I went for my acne,braces,glasses,bushy hair,and etc. I got sick of this so I eventually cursed and screamed at the people who did this to me. I hung out with this female named Ruba who befriended me while I was crying who was getting bullied because people called her Ruba Tuba so I gave her advice but she continued not to listen to me and saw Ruba Tuba as racist and cried about that a lot so she got a lot of support for this. I was really upset about her doing that. I was suicidal because I was often being bullied for my appearance so most people saw this as stupid and usually told me I was just being a baby. My parents told me a lot of nice things about me when this happened( though I did have a few friends that tried to help me though)I slit my wrists a lot,my throat in certain areas,practiced self deprecation,suffered from stress,and even depression from 12-14 years old.I literally cried almost everyday. I also randomly got punched in the stomach by another female and we had a bitch fight but I left the fight because I did not want to hurt anyone anymore she cyberbullied me the next day and I became suicidal again. I was bullied everywhere I went for defending myself in the fight.(also the whole fight wasn't completely recorded)I hung out with this female Theresa who befriended me when I was 13 but when I turned 14 she held a grudge against me from then on because I had a lot of listening issues in our relationship then. I came in contact with her again in 10th grade English class and since I was really self confused which caused me mental breakdowns,anxiety attacks and etc in random places I did not directly instruct or argue with her like I usually did so I actually stayed away from her and tried to minimize the drama as much as possible however she randomly insulted me along with a male but I ignored them whenever they did this to keep the peace. I contacted her again in 11th grade and she said she never remembered her being in my English class and that she still holds a grudge against me from 7th grade.I completely destroyed that relationship as well I also hung out with this female Madyson when I was 14 but I had a lot of nonsense humor to cover up my depression so I hung out with her for 3-4 weeks but then for 7 months straight she ghosted me and I got sick of it and she told me she did not want to hang out with me because she believed I sounded like a person who belonged in a mental asylum for my humor. I completely destroyed that relationship as well.(When I was 14 however I did not want to bother people so I hid behind a boastful ego that year so I would no longer put people down around me and I trolled people on IMVU for a brief period of time because they often told me that I should not wear pink and black and love the things that I love also for fun however that doesn't excuse my behavior)I found out a lot of that depression was a side effect of stimulant medication that was effecting my already overstimulated brain so I got new meds Anyways Ruba and I got into a lot more arguments in high school because I started having a lot of listening issues. However I did not have phone service in the 8th grade so she called me a lot on my dad's phone to speak to me to talk about my awful behavior so when I called her a lot in 9th grade with phone service she talked about how I handled the Ruba Tuba thing in 6th grade how she was still so angry of me of not taking that seriously enough. She always saw me as conceited and judgemental because I have a tendency to share too much about myself which resulted in me going to homecoming alone and her not giving a shit a long with my crush who was dating my best friend at the time so in the 11th grade I asked her a lot of questions about her(they often came out awkward though)however she still called me conceited and judgemental in the end because my mom did not want to invite her friend over to our house because her friend was asking for a crap ton of money from us and my mom did not want to deal with that anymore and also because I spammed her with messages one day because I knew she was lying to me and she wasn't responding. However in the 12th grade we both apologized to one another and talked about the positive memories we had to together so I asked her more questions about her self during the end of high school on Instagram and she randomly told me ten times FUCK YOU NEXT BITCH! And unlike in middle school I did not curse at her and I asked her why she was sending me those messages and she never told me then I felt hurt and I asked her if she would miss me after high school so she did not respond and I blocked her on that account she wanted to talk to me during graduation but I was afraid that she was going to get upset with me again so I just continued to mind my own business much later on though I created a new account and told her Hilo on several different days and she did not respond and I can not find her account on Instagram anymore. I completely destroyed this relationship as well. I hung out with this female Eryka and her and I hung out a lot in 8th grade so I considered her my best friend and she said she believed that too. We hung out during gym,chorus,lunch,early dismissal,late dismissal,and even social media. Her and I broke up though in 9th grade because she hated my self confusion so I contacted her a few years later and I asked her questions about herself at first but then I told her about how I'm still struggling with self confusion and she said she struggled with that too in the past so I asked for her advice and a lot of the advice I would follow and a lot of it I would try to follow but it wouldn't work. I told her that after a while of events I decided to socially withdraw myself from people because I did not want to hurt anyone and she told me not to do that because she told me that even I deserve a social life since we are human beings that are all social creatures by nature and I always loved Eryka and spoke about her so positively for years but I had feelings she was upset with me so I asked her if she was upset 3 times in a 45 day period and she responded that she was good until she sent me several paragraphs on Facebook talking about how I never meant much to her and that at best I was a distant acquaintance and at worst a nuisance and that she only befriended me to be closer toy friend Emily,that I only care about my issues and never her issues(which were often regarding legality and family I don't get anywhere near as personal as I was back in middle school because I wanted to be careful with people's feelings so I told her I did not want to bother her with that because that sounded very personal and she said she was good),that she wanted me to follow her advice at all times,she was pissed I would send her a lot of messages wondering why she wasn't responding to me and not explaining anything in a non vague way and that she considers us to be strangers now because she can not stand me she said that because I did not realize the information and thought her and I were friends makes me an awful person. So I apologized for all the trouble I caused and asked her several questions on how to fix it but she kept ignoring my questions and sending me several messages about how right she was and how wrong I was and that she did nothing wrong because her intentions were to be kind. She eventually did not respond to my messages so I promised her I would never contact her again since I caused her so much pain. Again I completely destroyed that relationship. I hung out with a female named Veronica in 10th grade and it seemed we got along just fine (however I was very sexually confused and indecisive)until she told me she was a lesbian and my mind went blank because I did not know how to respond since I was sexually confused so I walked away for a minute instead of saying something that might hurt her however the next day I sat next to her in chorus class and she cursed at me and I asked her why and she said FUCK OFF so I asked one of my friends what the issue was and she said she thought I had hateful homophobia and has been going around saying that to people and that I have no personality so I apologized and said no I don't hate anyone I just didnt know who I was attracted to because of highly religious parents and other factors however she said she forgave me but doesn't want to be close to me again because of a grudge so I completely destroyed that relationship as well.(Im pansexual now I realize)There was this guy who met me in 9th grade who seemed familiar like a guy I knew in 6th grade that used to always stare at me and really wanted to hang out with me a lot in 9th and 10th grade but I would hang out with him for a little bit but not a lot because he was way worse at listening than I was and I told him that him and I did not have a enough in common to hang out.(I said this a lot in 10th grade because I was extremely stupid)He was a flirtatious gentleman at times so I thought that was cool.However my grandfather had died in 11th grade and I told him I was going to be on a funeral trip away from school so during the funeral trip he took my friends phone with permission to text me sorry for not listening and I hope you get better and I thanked him however he sent me several more paragraphs being very flirty but also sounding very serious on the phone and irl. I fell in love with him for this because it helped me feel better about my grandfathers death so then when I came back he talked to me about how much he loves my best friend and asked me if he was allowed to go out with her and I said yes because whenever we disagreed he would often scream and curse at me(I lied to him)He also attempted to use me as his winggirl and I did not accept that and I kept avoiding him more and more but he did not care and I told his best friend about how I felt. However I told my best friend how I felt as well and she went out with him anyway because he would not stop attempting to force her to be attracted to him like he did with several females only to dump or cheat on them later on(he had several exes and always said he did nothing wrong)so they went to homecoming together and I went alone only to hear him and Ruba bitch about how much they hated the dance and him flirt with my best friend in front of me and then flirt with me when she wasn't around so I cried in the bathroom and stayed away from them because I did not want to bother them like I usually did so during this time because I did not want to bother them I got a partner that did not have chemistry with me and vice versa to feel better. Later though my best friend broke up with him because he was being possessive and passive aggressive so he screamed,cursed,insulted, humiliated,and etc at her in several paragraphs on his phone and he showed me the messages. He immediately attempted several times to force attraction out of her but it didn t work. I saw he was upset about this so I waited a couple of weeks for him to cool off and I broke up with the partner I had no chemistry with to ask out the guy I did have chemistry with he said he did not agree with my decision and that he wasn't good enough for me(a.k.a. I'm not attracted to you I can't read social cues well) so I thought he was upset but had no particular grudge against me so I decided to leave him alone for while to cool off. The next day my expartner who I was friends with before and after we dated told me he always hated the guy I loved because while him and I were dating he was being very nosy about our relationship,he was always loud,he also ruined pop culture a lot,and etc. Anyways my crush came over to talk about how much he hates all his teachers because they won't give him good grades for being lazy and because hes gotten a lot referrals in the past and that day. Then he smiled at my friend and I and said see this is why you don't want to date me I'm an awful person so a couple of weeks went by and I still wasn't hanging out with him because he always seemed stressed so I sat next to my friend again and my crush told him to come over to him and said look Ive gotten my best friend not to hang out with her and I don't want you hanging out with her because of the break up and told him that he thought I was really a bitch anyways my friend came to me and told me so I was pissed because he talked behind my back and said he never would do that so I contacted him on Instagram and I kept my cool to ask him questions as to why he was upset so he responded way later with no one should be friends with you because of how confusing and bipolar you are and you deserve so much pain for breaking up with a guy for another guy,and that he enjoys hurting me more than anyone else. I cried at this and I said okay and blocked him because I did not want to say anything hurtful to him. So after this he tried harder to get others not to hang out with me for months and I ended up being so depressed to the point that everything I ate tasted like nothing because I hated myself for loving him until I eventually sincerely told him that I was sorry for loving him and I would never pull the same stunt again and I apologized to my expartner but he did not care and he accepted my apology although my parents did not want me hanging out with him because I quoted that I was scared of him because I believed he loved hurting me however I would hang out with him occasionally only to have him one minute flirt and the next minute scream and one day he got another girlfriend and told me that him and her were going to have sex in the restroom to make me jealous so I got jealous and he got pissed that I got jealous.i often felt that he lied to me a lot so I asked one of my friends who was friends with one of his exes what was up with him and since she's never lied to me before and he has she told he doesn't just verbally or emotionally abuse girls he psyhically so as well so I believed it and I told a few people who I was friends with about that to protect them only to find out that wasn't true by his words and people he told that were upset at me but they got over it which upset him and luckily he was calm about it to my face and I cried and told him I was sorry several different times and I'll unblock him on Instagram and he said he's over it but still has a grudge against me so he's okay so then he went up to his best friend behind my back to manipulate him into screenshotting all my messages from high school so he did so and he got upset that I wasn't being nice to people that he either hated or wasn't close to and told me that he's a good guy that has always been direct and that I have a lot social issues because I'm fake and that he's told several people that he believes that I'm fake so I cried and apologized because I believed I hurt him and then I sent him a love poem called emotional pain about how I'll always love him no matter what and he said I appreciate the poem but you are still not taking responsibility for your actions and I still have a grudge against you and then he blocked me on Instagram along with the several messages he had sent me insulting me and then he told one of his friends to tell me that he thought I was cute and I got upset because I believed it was just another emotional game so he glared at me several times a day in the hallways because of his grudge.I completely destroyed that relationship as well.Then on graduation day almost all of these people wouldn't look,think,talk,or even acknowledge my existence ever again with grudges and I have been a clingy person for a long time. I destroyed everything and now I'm isolated again because I was abusive for my awful listening,stupid humor,occasional slander and etc. I can't forgive myself for what I've
