I'm not 'hanging in there'.I've been feeling depressed for a long time now. My mom convinced me to meet with someone at my university health center, who sent me to a consultation, who sent me to a psychologist, who sent me to a psychiatrist. And he said that putting me on medication would be a bit of a leap, given my symptoms. Since I've already been taking iron and vitamin D supplements, the only advice he gave me before opening the door was 'hang in there'. 

I'm not hanging in there. I feel more and more worthless each day. I become less and less functional, and I'm slowly withdrawing from everything I've every taken part in. I have no friends on campus. I have no interest in anything I'm doing. I'm unhealthy, I have no energy, I'm acne-ridden, and I'm just barely a healthy weight. I do these routines of getting up early and using medication on my skin and going to the gym and going to class and doing my homework and using medication on my skin and I see no results. It's so hard to get out of bed. It's so hard to see anything positive in the future. I just want to sleep and never wake up.
