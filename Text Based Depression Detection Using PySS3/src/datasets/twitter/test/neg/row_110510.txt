Down by the river.I'm 20. I've had suicidal thoughts before, but they've never stuck around this long (over a month straight, scratching myself and waking up puking every day) and I'm afraid they won't go away.

I lost all my friends and am forced to share spaces where I can see them all happy to have me gone.  
I don't want to be alive any more to see it because I know I'll never have them back and I don't want to "move on" or "get new friends" - like it's that easy. Everyone I've tried to talk to about it has just shut me down with a "It's just a misunderstanding, they'll see eventually" "Move on, get new friends" "Don't hurt yourself!" "You have your whole life ahead of you." "Just live." Every time I hear one of these it just sounds selfish - people trying to cater to the little fairy inside them that says "yeah you're a good person" when they say something nice that they don't mean.

I just can't take it any more. I want to kill myself. I have many means to do so - christ's sake I live below a 400 foot cliff that I can walk up, let alone the firearms, medicines I could OD on, the river just a short drive away being deadly to jump in in winter... I'm down by that river right now typing this.

I can't carry on like this knowing I'll never get closure, and that somehow people that have claimed for months to love me just abandoned me - the one thing I knew I couldn't deal with if it were to happen.

I know this post will get buried and that it will be hours before I get even a single reply. It's the only place left where I can have a voice.
