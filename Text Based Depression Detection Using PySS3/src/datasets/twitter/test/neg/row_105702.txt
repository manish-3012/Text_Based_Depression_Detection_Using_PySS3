I'm only alive because...My mom.

She's the one person who actually loves me but I can't talk to her about how I feel about my mental health she just brushes it off and tells me to go out side make friends.

I've tried to make friends I've tried to make relationships I just can't connect with other people. I feel so isolated, I feel like the world would be better without me I want to end the constant loneliness and just go into a deep sleep forever.

I just don't want to hurt my mom I know she wouldn't see it coming. So I'm just waiting until she dies so I can commit suicide.
