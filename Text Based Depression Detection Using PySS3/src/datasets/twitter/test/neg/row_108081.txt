Severe Aspirin Allergy just gonna down 1000mg of excedrin and 1000mg of Motrin Fuck I know this will hurt but at least it's not messy, I'm tired of being depressed and fucking up everything and I'm sure anaphylactic shock won't last too long. Last time I had it (3 months ago) I just passed out and woke up in the ICU but this time it's 4am I'm alone nobody will find me until my heart stops and I'm gone. Time for me to go. I love you all especially my friend tyler, he was always there for me when no one else was. I'm forever grateful that we become friends. I'm sorry I had to do this
