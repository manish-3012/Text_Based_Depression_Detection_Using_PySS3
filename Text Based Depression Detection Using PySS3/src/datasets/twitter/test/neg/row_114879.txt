No one to talk to"There must be ANYONE" you say.
Well, no.
There's not even a suicide hotline, and even if there was, I can't even use the phone (because it's not mine)... and because I have so much anxiety about it that I'd rather shoot myself.
Mom just keeps saying the same uplifting trash "that attitude won't get you anywhere"...

Hmm. Death seems so nice. No pleasure, but no pain (for me at least).
