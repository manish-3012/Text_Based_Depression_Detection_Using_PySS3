The Suicide debate is so incredibleBeen suicidal for 2 years ever since I broke up with my ex and her daughter.  Regret it everyday, but life goes on. End of 2017 I started writing a journal, maybe 1 or 2 posts a week on average.  It's mostly drunk rambling, but I know some people will appreciate hearing some of my thought process.  I really wish I had my pistol with me, but I moved to SE Asia and couldn't bring it with me.  I just recently met a great girl, but that is not changing my plan.  She asked if we could date and I said no because I'm suicidal, thats not fare to her.  Everything has been falling into place because last year I gave myself until Sep this year.  I even sent my 8 months of journal entries to my mom, but its password locked.  She knows the inevitable for me and has accepted it, that makes me feel more at peace.  I'm just gonna drink and pop pills for the next month and then its time to move on. The earth is over 5 billion years old, our very short life is minuscule. Im an American in a third world country, I saw a dead guy in my guest house and they just threw him in the back of a truck.  Shows how important our life is huh.  I want to be reborn in a different universe where temptations don't exist.  Death will be my final euphoria.
