I self harmedAt first it was a few light scratches, but then I made more cuts in my left wrist, and my mom found out...

I was feeling pretty bad, because of my family's health and college stuff, I felt that I wanted to puke and had waves of nausea, so I did that...

She had me swear that I would never do it again, and that I would start doing something to change all of this...

The thing is, I don't know if I have a future in the first place... Our family is quite ill, I have a great difficulty making friends, I'm confused and exhausted, I don't know what to do...
