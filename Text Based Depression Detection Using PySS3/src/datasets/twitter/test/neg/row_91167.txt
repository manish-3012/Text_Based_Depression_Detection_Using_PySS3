I'm sorry SW, I'm so sorry...I can't do this any more. The ups. The downs. The pressure. The pain, the suffering... life, love, stress and setbacks. I'm so tired... I'm tired of failing. I'm tired of failing myself, I'm tired more of failing people. I can't do this any more, but I don't think I can kill myself either... I used to have nobody important, nobody that cared for me or for whom I cared, and it was easy to try then. But things are so much different now... I would hurt so, so many people. I'm sorry I got tangled up in this, in everybody's lives... I'm sorry I can't control my thoughts, I can barely even control my actions now. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm even thinking rationally any more. I don't have time to wait this out, and I have nothing but time... I can't focus any more, old distractions and pleasures are meaningless now, classic anhedonia. I can sit here and analyze all of the problems I have, and it doesn't help. I'm so done... I'm so lost and confused, I'm drowning. I've sought professional help, I've medicated... it doesn't help. I might fail out of college this quarter. If I do, I'm done. I can't take it. Fail too many people, one more big failure like suicide won't matter then. I know I could recover from it, community college and what not, but... I can't. It's too much. I've lost any sense of purpose or self, and I don't know where to go from here. I go on late night walks in the sketchiest areas of town, hoping someone will try to mug me so I can egg them on into killing me. I can't sleep. Food revolts me. I can't even fall back on old self-medication, I don't see the point. I'm sorry SW. There's hope out there... but I just can't see it any more.
