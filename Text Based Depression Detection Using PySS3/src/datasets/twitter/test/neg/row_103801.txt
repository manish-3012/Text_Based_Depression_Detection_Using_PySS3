How do you break the cycle?Thoughts of suicide just seem to trickle back, no matter how good its been, or how long I've gone without them, seems like a default pattern that I have no control over. I've just been riding them out, try to remember that they pass when I let them, try not to play with the thoughts. But always, they come back to me, eventually I find myself playing the same game, just trying to be patient while they run their course. They wash away but always find their way back. Again and again, and I'm getting tired, and frustrated, I don't want to die, but these thoughts... they are relentless. I try to notice what happens before they make their re-entrance, but even then it doesn't stop them the next time.

Is this just how it will be forever? Is it really a vicious cycle, always eventually returning to the same place? Has anyone found solace, a solution, something to break the pattern of unconsciously resorting to suicide despite working so hard to accept or avoid these thoughts?
