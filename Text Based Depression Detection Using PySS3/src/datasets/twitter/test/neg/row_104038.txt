HELP! I'm feeling helpless and suicidalI've never considered suicide as an option up until this point in my life. I'm feeling terribly helpless and don't know how to solve this fucking problem, except for ending my own life:    


My parents kicked me out of the house and let me out on the streets. While this may sound bad, (and it is), it actually helped me feel free enough to pursue my interests and develop my autonomy. In a very short time, I managed to do very good, enjoying independence in thought, action, and income. However, due to circumstances that are too long to explain, my parents regretted their decision and now I'm in contact with them again. The problem is that this devastating fear of helplessness has reemerged in me which, as strange as it sounds, feels like it's denying that independence that I've gained.   


I keep hearing a negative, shaming voice telling me, "What you're doing/thinking/feeling is stupid and worthless," which prompts me to avoid working, or thinking those things that help me work (e.g., planning). I understand this to be a mechanism of undermining my independence so that I can be dependent on my parents, so they won't feel abandoned. I can't take this anymore. I don't know what to do and it's wearing me down.    


I feel totally powerless and helpless. The people who normally support me don't understand me; they think it's a good thing I'm in contact with my parents, and don't understand this feeling of helplessness that completely impairs my ability to do literally anything. I don't want this anymore, and I keep thinking of suicide as the only way out, because I have no idea how I'm going to mute, minimize, or eliminate that voice that puts me down so viciously...I just don't have the time or energy anymore. Please help
