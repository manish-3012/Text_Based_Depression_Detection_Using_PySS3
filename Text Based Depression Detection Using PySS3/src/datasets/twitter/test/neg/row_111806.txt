I can't think of a way out of this life.All I want to do is enjoy my life after all I have been through and I just can't seem to do so.
I have been hurt so deeply by the person I love that the only reason why I want to kill myself is for revenge. I want him to suffer emotionally forever for what he did and let his actions be the definition of his life. Just like they effected mine.
I don'r care about my life as much as I care about making the other person suffer the rest of their life for turning their soul into desire to see others hurt for their benefit. When they hear I past, I hope their soul cries that they did this to a friend.

I tried everything.
Medication.
Therapy.
My life experiences mean nothing to no one.
