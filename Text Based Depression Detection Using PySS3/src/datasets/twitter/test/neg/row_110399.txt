I just want to dieMy birthday is coming up and I don't feel happy at all. I've hurt myself but never attempted suicide. I don't know what to do anymore. My family loves me, but I always feel like the burden. I have a bunch of medication on my dresser. I am so tempted just to overdose right now. I am lonely, with no talent whatsoever. I'm stuck and I want to be free.
