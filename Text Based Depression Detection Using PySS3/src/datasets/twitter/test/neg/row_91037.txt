Like I'm drowningEvery minute of every day feels like the moment one of my friends tried to drown me when I was 6.  


Like I'm crying out for help but no one is answering.  The people I thought I could trust are gone.  I can't trust anyone in the future anymore.  


I will likely disappear soon.  It will be good for me and it will be good for the world.
