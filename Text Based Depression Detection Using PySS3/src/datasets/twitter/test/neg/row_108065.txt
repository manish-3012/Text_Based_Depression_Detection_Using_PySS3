OTCs to help CTBAny recommendations on over the counters to help relax/sedate before and during an attempt? Would love real drugs, but seem impossible to obtain. Also yes, I know of alcohol. Anything else though?

No, I don't want "help". Just advice on how to more comfortably pursue the solution to my problems.
