No desire to do aniethingLast 7 years since I graduated high school I basicly did nothing with my life I just waited the days to pass I slept for 12 hours a day I just waited till the weekend or till the next party so I can get drunk , I attended difernet universities and dropped out because I wasn't doing shit at them just waited for I don't know what. I don't know and I don't want to do anything so now I set my mind during this Sommer to do something different to not wait to do something  I didn't do before something that noraml people do and if I fail and return to the same waiting for something to happen mentality I'm going end it.
Biggest problem is my crippling anxiety and depression that one of the reasons why I never even try is of the mentality I'm going to kill miself eventually so why even bother now I'm on the brink of it and it's all of nothing. Any advice from people who changed everything about the way you think would be apriciatedt.
