How to talk with parents about suicidal thoughts.I don't know if this is the right subreddit to post it but I'll try. I don't want to go into much detail here but I'll make short summary - I've been fighting with depression for past 6/5 years or so. I stared to have suicidal thoughts 3 years ago. At the beginning I didn't want to talk about it with my parents. I have a support in my teachers and friends. But, you know, they can't go with me to the doctor. So I tried to speak with my parents. It took me 3 tries to eventually give up. All of those conversation ended with my mother saying things like "You'll get us in trouble" or other nasty things I can't really recall right now. 
I feel like my life stared to slip out of my hands again. My grades lowered, I fell isolated, I feel that I'm a burden to every single person that I've met. What shouls I do? Should I seek help in other places? How can I start a conversation with my parents? Any advice?
