I don't want to live anymoreI've been through a lot. And everyone seems to leave me when I'm at my hardest moments, I have a boyfriend who was there before an incident occurred which left an obvious impact but I feel like he blames it on me and isn't ready to accept the fact that it's not my fault. My whole life is tumbling down and I don't know how to keep it up on my own, I have no one ready to listen, everyone just keeps throwing what they want and never asked me what I want. Please help..
