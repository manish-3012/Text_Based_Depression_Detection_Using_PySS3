Idiotic MeI know people have it worse, but I really suck at coping. I can only think about how much happier I would be if I was dead. I had thoughts like this before what just happened, happened but I was doing good now I feel like itâ€™s all for nothing and someoneâ€™s hit reset on my progress. 

I feel disgusting I feel like you can look at me and see it, I should have done more to stop it but Iâ€™m stupid and I didnâ€™t know how to and he was so angry and I just feel like Iâ€™m an idiot, like a dramatic little bitch, I deserve to hurt even before him, I did. I feel like everyoneâ€™s just hoping feelings like that get the better of me. Iâ€™m sick of some people saying coz im only 14 I donâ€™t understand life. Like they donâ€™t care about my feelings coz Iâ€™m not old enough to want to hang my self or what lmao? I just wanna tell them to come home and tell them what fucking happened but I canâ€™t. Itâ€™s my own stupid fault anyway coz Iâ€™m a dumb bitch ðŸ¤·ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸
