I am always the dumbest person hereI never am able to understand seemingly simple problems that 99 percent of the world understands. Everything is super hard for me to do and I just wanna give up. I think I have an iq of 80 because of how fucking stupid I am. I cant understand anything basic or philosophical. I am a complete moron at everything I do.
