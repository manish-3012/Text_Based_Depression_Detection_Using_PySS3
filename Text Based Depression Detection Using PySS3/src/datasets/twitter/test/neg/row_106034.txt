I want to die and it's driving me crazy.I feel trapped. I want to die. I want to put my gun to my head and free myself from this pain. I want to but I can't. I've read a few posts here on read about what the family goes through when their children kill themselves and I don't want to put them through that, but it's getting harder and harder every day to hold on that. I wish i could just fade away, or something bad would happen to me. I wish I was in store that got robbed and the robber shot me. I know they would feel bad, but at least they wouldn't live with guilt, the feelings that they failed as parents and that they could have done something different. At least then it was more of that I was at the wrong place at the wrong time. It was not preventable.  My father runs a small business that is barely treading water and I'm afraid that if I die, he'll lose his mind it'll go under.

I feel like I'm strapped in a chair, being tortured day in and day out, but my tormentors won't let die. They torture me right up to the cusp of death, then they bring me back so they can torture me some more. They want to keep me alive so they can torture me more. I feel like I'm surrounded by world. I wish I could just fade away, and no one would miss me, or someone would kill me and put me out of my misery. I pray to god everyday to kill me. I joke to myself sometimes, saying that I wish that Thanos chose me, but it's not a joke.
