I'm a disgusting person and I want to dieBoth of my parents could be happy and in retirement at the moment, and they wouldn't be divorced. I am the origin reason of why they Arnt retired and divorced. Not only that, they spend tons of money on me, only for me to be a lazy piece of shit and do nothing with my life except make them depressed.

I'm incredibly toxic to my friends, and they have to tolerate my shit. I don't want them to put up with my shit. They deserve better. 

Not only that, there's a lot of fucked up shit going on in my head, almost constantly. A lot of times, when someone tells me that they want to kill themselves, I say in my mind that "They'd be doing themselves a favor if they did." Which is why I I usually avoid this sub. 

The world would honestly be better off with me dead. I have not done a single thing for anyone, and have only fucked shit up. But I'm too much of a wuss to do it, and I'm pissed off at myself for that. Every attempt to improve myself as a person goes down a drain and leads me back to being a toxic fuck.

I wish I wasn't such a fucking wuss.
