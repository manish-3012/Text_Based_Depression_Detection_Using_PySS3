Characters who die in moviesI am so jealous of the characters who die in movies. I was watching Terminator Genesis and all I could think about was how I would run up to the robots so they'd take me out.

My movie watching experience is ruined slightly because I don't understand why the characters fight so hard to survive.

It's horrible that this extends to real life. Though I don't wish for others to die, where is that nuclear war we were promised? At one point, I was hoping for Jesus to come destroy everything. He ain't coming.

Did I just misinterpret life thanks to my old religious beliefs? One thing for sure, it's much easier to die than it is to live.
