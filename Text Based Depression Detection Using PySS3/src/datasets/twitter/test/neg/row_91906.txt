22 no friends, no social life, try to do fitness everyday to keep me sane.Iâ€™m just so done with everything my family are so meh. Everything is just shit. No one ever stays around I either get used or just fucked over. I suffer with IBD my parents think Iâ€™m lazy because I need to rest some days due to random fatigue. My mum said I only think of myself. Iâ€™ve already had one suicide attempt and that was last year but this time family wonâ€™t know at all so itâ€™ll be a breeze. I think Iâ€™m better of dead than alive to be honest.
