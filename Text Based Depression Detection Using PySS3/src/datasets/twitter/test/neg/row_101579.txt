I feel trapped and I don't see a way outHello.

I've been thinking about killing myself for a while. 

Basically the last few years. 

I'm trapped in a teaching internship program. I don't even want to be a teacher. I just applied and got into this certification program because I didn't want to be a failure and I had no idea how to use my history degree.

Now I was put in an internship across the state. I don't know how to pay for my drive up there, so I've been working more hours at the club. But it's not enough.

I don't want to do this. I don't give a shit about being a teacher. 

But I can't back out. If I do, it will at 14 grand to my student loan debt without a certification. I'll be so fucked. 

But I don't want to do it. I don't want to put myself through this wringer for a piece of paper I don't even want. I wish someone told me "Don't do it, you don't have to be a teacher, you can figure something else out." 

But I was scared. I didn't sleep at all last night so I called out of my internship sick during the first week. And my parents lectured me, saying how I'm going to be seen as unreliable and that I could never take a sick day again and that the whole thing will be shot unless I get my act together. I really didn't think it would be safe for me to drive up there when I was so tired, but they didn't understand. They never do. I've said so many times "This isn't for me, I want to drop out and use my bachelor's for something else" and they never listen. They say "this will make you more marketable. Just do it you pussy. you don't even have to teach, but you should finish it."

I haven't been happy in years.

I'm an unhappy 22 year old moron in an internship that he can't support, only desperately trying to do it to stave off future loan debt, going down a career path he could not give less of a shit about.

I can't see a way out. I need help. I'm home alone today and I am half in tears and also just staring into space. 

I'm sorry. I should really man up.
