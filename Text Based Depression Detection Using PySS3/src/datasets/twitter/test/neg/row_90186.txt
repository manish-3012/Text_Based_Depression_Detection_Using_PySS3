I want to talk just like you doI posted an hour ago about the extreme hopeless situation I'm in. After a few minutes of reading on here, I can relate to just about everything. 

Additionally, I'm really lonely, so if anyone else is just as lonely, you can reach me via DMs. I'll talk about anything, anything at all. No judgments whatsoever.
