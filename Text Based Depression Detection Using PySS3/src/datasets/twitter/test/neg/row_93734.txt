Life is humiliation, pain and a constant, deep and profound sadness.I'm just so tired of going back to ground zero. All I want from life is to have love, and yet I destroy the relationships that matter to me most. Shame and lonlieness, a blank cold and emptiness. I supposedly have a personality disorder, but honestly, maybe it's just that I'm facing the world without a family that would take care of more of life's responsibilities for me or inspire me to do anything for myself and do not believe in any sort of God? I don't care about anything in my life if I can't truly and completely share it with another person. I don't hate myself (maybe I do? idk) but fuck all this personal growth crap if I can't give it's fruit to the one I love. What's the point of relationships if people just give up on them, find new partners and move on?? I only want to love my love, and my love is unconditional, why am I not good enough at it? I immediately want to lay down on the train tracks near my house as soon as I feel pushed away again. I believe that from a psychological standpoint I am nothing special, just plain ole fear of abandonment, probably the aftermath of my mom dying when I was a kid other awful childhood experiences and then 12 years later me findng my only brothers dead body in his rented room, which I know I am coresponsible for, all these goddamn therapists say that it's nobody's fault but that's just a blatant lie, somehow we believe in the notion of justice and judgement, why do we suddenly abandon it in therapy? I'm probably not making any sence anyway, I just wish I could love &amp; be loved or if this can never be my reality I pray that something kills me soon so that I don't spend years and years wandering this planet in doomed, futile hopes. Why won't the hope die if I can't have it. Maybe I'm just all wrong.
