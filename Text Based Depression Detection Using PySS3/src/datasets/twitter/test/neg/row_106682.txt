I'm killing myself if I fail the entrance exam for the school I'm applying toIt's not the only reason for my demise, it would just be the last straw. I have been through the worst year of my life and not even my mother is supporting me through all of this, she doesn't even care about my future. I've had suicidal thoughts for a few years now (I'm 15), but I've never got through with it because I always had a little bit of hope that things would actually get better. This school is my last hope to salvage my future, and I could never forgive myself if I fucked up once again.

I'm just tired of being stupid.

I'm tired of making bad decisions.

I'm tired of being a failure.
