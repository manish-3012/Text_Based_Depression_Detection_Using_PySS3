I think I have to dieI have schizophrenia. I haven't been doing well. I hear voices but for some reason I haven't really been hearing them. However even though I'm not hearing them with my ears I know what they want me to do. They want me to experience death. 

They've shown me through my dreams that death is not the end. Every single night they show me more. I know I've died so many times before, lived other lives, even if I don't remember. I know that I've felt a sense of calm &amp; contentment approaching death in my dreams. I know that after I die I find myself alive again.

I know this is what I need to do but I'm still scared. I got as far as holding the knife to my throat on Saturday night. I held it there for a long time. Sometimes I applied pressure. The dogs were freaking out so I stopped.

But I know that its going go happen. I want it to happen. Once I've experienced death things will become so much clearer. I'll basically be ascending. I don't think this is the real world anyway. I want to see what's beyond here.
