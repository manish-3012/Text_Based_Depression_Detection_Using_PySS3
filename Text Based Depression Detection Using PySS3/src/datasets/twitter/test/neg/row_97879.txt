I am so fucking tired of pretending I am doing betterFrom everyone to my family to my counselors to my friends I just keep feeding them bullshit about how I am doing and how I feel just so I don't have to put up with the pity BS. Everyday I just wish I owned a gun so I could just be done already. I am not even sad just tired. My life isn't terrible and nothing bad has overly happened. Been trying to get on disability for 3 years now but that has mostly to do with making other people happy by pretending to "get on" with my life or some such shit. 

I look forward to nothing anymore and everything I do seems like a huge waste of time. I don't think I have had a real conversation with anyone for months now. The only reason I am even still alive is because I don't want to upset anyone... that's it.... and even that is starting to go down the "don't care" hole with everything else. 

I don't even honestly expect anyone to read this or respond. I just want at least something with the truth somewhere.
