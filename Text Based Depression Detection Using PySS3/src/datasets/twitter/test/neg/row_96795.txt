I hope I don't wake up tomorrowI mixed alcohol with pain killers after realizing what a pathetic person I am. I feel so dizzy and numb right now. I hope that to tomorrow I wake up in another world. A world that leaves me alone. 

I will never change and never be a good person. No matter what happens. I hope I die. If anyone reads this - I just wanted to say that I tried.
