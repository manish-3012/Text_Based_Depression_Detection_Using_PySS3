everything makes me want to kill myselfeverything. my problems are petty. stupid. pointless. i still love my ex madly? i want to kill myself. someone messes up my pronouns? (ftm here) i want to kill myself. someone said something mean to me online? i want to kill myself. did something wrong in a game? i want to kill myself. the thing is, i want to kill myself if even the slightest thing doesn't go the way i hoped so. even if i feel the least bit sad, i just want to die. i want to die so bad but i'm too scared to do it. literally the only place i can now vent to is here considering if i talk to my therapist about this, she'll tell my mom and i'll be admitted to the hospital (which i almost have numerous times). i've tried to kill myself before and afterwards i always feel so relaxed like i just curled up into a blanket by a fire after a long day out in the snow. i just don't know what to do anymore. this has gone on for 3 years.
