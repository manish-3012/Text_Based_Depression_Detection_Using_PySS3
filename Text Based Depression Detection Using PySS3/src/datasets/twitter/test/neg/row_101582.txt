Iâ€™m doneI canâ€™t enjoy anything.

I love with my parents at 23 and they hate me.

I canâ€™t do anything right. I leave my job early because of anxiety and I feel useless.

I have no friends.

I canâ€™t enjoy people anymore.

Everyone gets mad at me for being suicidal.

Iâ€™m gone. If Iâ€™m alive tomorrow then Iâ€™ve failed my mission. This was a long time coming âœŒï¸
