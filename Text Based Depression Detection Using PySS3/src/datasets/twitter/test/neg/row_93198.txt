I don't want people to say if only we had known, or if only we could have done something.I've seen people's reactions to suicide plenty of times throughout the last three years unfortunately and the family and friends often say thing's that make me wonder if what they are saying is really the truth.  

If/when I kill myself what will the reactions be, will they say 'if only we had known' or 'if only we could have done something' because the reality is if you genuinely knew me, you would know and you would have had many opportunities to help, so I guess what I'm saying is, you clearly have priorities in life which is fine, we all do but at the very least please don't pretend you did everything you could and that I was the number one priority in your life or that you didn't know how bad I really was.

You don't owe me anything at all, but please don't try to create lies in order for my death to have been seen as unexpected or preventable if only you had known, in order to justify me not being a big priority in your life until I'm dead and you need to explain to people why I did it and the circumstances around it.
