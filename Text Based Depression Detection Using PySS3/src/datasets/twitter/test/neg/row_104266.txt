Not sure if I'm in the right placeAbout a month ago my partner of 2 years and I experienced a profound loss of her mom, since then I've been trying to be the rock she needs.
I have made a few mistakes not taking her into full consideration over that time as well as had points where I showed emotion. 
Our lives are for the better since we met and I don't want it to end but we have had some problems and I'm scared we might break up. 

How could I help her while maintaining the distance she needs to grieve as well as be there for her so she knows she's not alone and I am here for anything and everything?
How do I deal with my own grief while being supportive?
