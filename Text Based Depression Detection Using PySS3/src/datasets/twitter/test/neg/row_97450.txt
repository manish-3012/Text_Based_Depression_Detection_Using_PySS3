iâ€™m going to die alonei know iâ€™m going to die alone. iâ€™m expendable within my small group of friends and every relationship iâ€™ve ever had has ended with me being dumped for someone better. no one could possibly love me - romantically or platonically. im a manipulative person and im toxic no matter what, every person i meet is always for the worse after knowing me. im so close to killing myself i think i may do it tonight, if i dont ill just grow older and die alone anyway, and i would rather die quickly and painlessly than grow older and feel this way for years
