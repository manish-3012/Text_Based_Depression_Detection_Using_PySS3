This SummerWhen my family has gone, my friends have departed, and my obligations are no more, I will get in my car. I won't open the garage door. Instead, I'll sleep and for a long time. My friends tell me to chase my dreams and so I will, right to the grave where they've lain for some time. I can live for them no longer. It's time I chased my dreams.
