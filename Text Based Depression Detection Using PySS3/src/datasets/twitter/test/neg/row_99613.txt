I think I will never be able to forgive myselfI been suicidal for 4 years and I donâ€™t think anything will get better. I just wanna lay inside my coffin and never be able to wake up again. Iâ€™m 17 years old and depression as well as suicidal thoughts has stuck to me since I was 12. I grew up with little to no friends, rejected, made fun of, bullied, etc. I pretend the life I live is temporary, it surely will get better over time. Wrong, it never will no matter how you look at it. Mental health is something you canâ€™t quickly get â€œover.â€ Everyone that has ever walked in my life, always acted like they know my life and how I live. Surely they might not know what depression feels like or what suicide is like, but, that doesnâ€™t make it right for them to make fun of me for it. Iâ€™m currently a junior in high school and as I have finished 2 years of high school already, and Iâ€™m slowly feeling my friends and everything fade away. Iâ€™m down to almost zero friends at this point. No one contacts me, checks up on me, call me, etc. I just wish I had friends like other people where they actually care for them and they do things together. Itâ€™s hard waking up to misery and having to live in this dreadful life. I honestly donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll last anymore on earth, Iâ€™m just patiently waiting for my life to be taken away. But, at the same time, before I go, I want to cleanse myself and make sure I have made everything right with everyone. Some might say thatâ€™s ironic since apparently, suicide is a sin. I have done things that I  think only god can forgive me for, not me. I have gotten mean, turning to an asshole, and turning cold. I wanna make thing right with people before I go if possible. I canâ€™t do this anymore
