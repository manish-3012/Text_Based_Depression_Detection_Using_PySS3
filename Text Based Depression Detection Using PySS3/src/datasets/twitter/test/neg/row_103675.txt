I canâ€™t fucking live with this body anymore, I just canâ€™t.Iâ€™m trans. I feel so fucking stuck in my body and I want to crawl out of my skin. I hate living as a girl so much, but Iâ€™m too scared to transition with hormones because Iâ€™m scared of being ugly and I place so much value on appearances. If I keep living in this body Iâ€™m going to kill myself, I have plans to jump from a bridge soon but the main thing stopping me is that I know my body will be undressed and I donâ€™t want to have some people saying things like â€œwe found the body of a girl in the riverâ€. 

But if I transition and look ugly Iâ€™m going to die too. Being really and truly ugly is one of the worst things that could happen to me. I donâ€™t have any personality and while I donâ€™t look great right now, I donâ€™t want to look worse. I canâ€™t handle this anymore, the pressure is crushing and overwhelming and I feel like Iâ€™m going to be deeply miserable no matter what. I feel like crawling out of my skin. I feel like I have to go, I need to escape this body.
