There always has to be one more thing.Beyond all my issues and things I'm going through including mildly want to no life myself, I'm now even more stressed out because I have to take on more hours and maybe a part time gig to help my mom, she needs like 15k or else she loses EVERYTHING. Like everything. She loses the house and everything in it, and all the debts she already has remains even past losing everything. She said, which is why I'm here and mildly worried is that shes worth more dead than alive, she has a great life insurance policy for a half a million dollars and she is out of the suicide clause as she has had it for most of her life. Now I dont know what to do, whether if I can help her in other ways than money, I have no way back to my hometown without spending 40 round trip for greyhound or just in gas as I have no car. Fuck. I'm a student idk how much I can really help. I'm already fucking fasting and meal prepping to lose weight and save a ton of money. I have no other areas I can cut back on  I pay 13 on internet and cheapest phone plan already, cheapest room I could find. Idk what I can do. I dont want to lose her or her way of life or my childhood home but i dont want to lose myself on the way trying to be the rock or provider and helper. Can someone give me some perspective and maybe guidance on what I should do. Although I want to no life, I also hope that everyone would be fine without me and that clearly isnt the case. If I did it and then she lost everything I'm afraid she would give up too.
