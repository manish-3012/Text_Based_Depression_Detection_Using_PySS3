Just kill me already!All right, I confess, I cannot bare this anymore. I'm loosing touch with reality. I'm starting to see my life from the 3rd person perspective. I can't afford psychiatrist, I can't get a diagnosis. It's tearing me from the inside. Being around people feels bad, being alone is even worse. Please, please, please just end this madness, I don't wanna be like this any longer...
