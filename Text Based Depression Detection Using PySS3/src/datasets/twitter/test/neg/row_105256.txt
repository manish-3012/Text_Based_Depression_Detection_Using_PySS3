Bought a gun two days agoThey stopped processing permits in my state temporarily so I bought a hunting bolt-action rifle. It takes ten rounds. I keep it next to my bed with the magazine loaded and next to it. I just keep looking at it over and over and over again when Iâ€™m home from work.

I bought it to kill myself. I took care of my will. Figured out everything thatâ€™s gonna happen when I die. Knowing itâ€™s ready to go has given me so much peace and my friends have commented that I seem so much happier the past couple of days. I wish I could tell them itâ€™s because itâ€™s finally going to be over for me and for everyone I was a burden on. Theyâ€™ll be without me and it might hurt at first but then their lives will be so much better.

I just wanted to share somewhere they wouldnâ€™t see it. I donâ€™t want them to stop me. Tomorrow night Iâ€™m going to drink, call emergency services so that they can get my body right away so nobody has to see me that I love, and take care of it. I feel so free.
