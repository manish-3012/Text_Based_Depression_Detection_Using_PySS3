Some advice that helped me out of bad timesThis might sound stupidly simple, but **find something, even one thing, in life you enjoy and live for it**.

It could be anything from video games, browsing the internet, socialising, or even to simpler things like eating, breathing, the feeling of the wind, etc. 

Live your life solely for that thing you enjoy. Put as minimum effort into everything else e.g. get an easy job, small apartment with low rent, if you want to play games all day.

Minimise pain and maximise pleasure.

If there's nothing at all in this life you enjoy, then try to look for something. I suggested video games because they're a good way to escape from reality but others may enjoy travelling, hiking, sports, TV shows/anime, writing, etc.
