I already have a noose ready. But Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll change my mind once itâ€™s too late.Iâ€™ve been severely depressed for nearly 10 years. Yes Iâ€™m able to be happy but it seems I never am for long. I just want this pit in my chest to end. I attempted to slit my own throat when I was 8 overdosed multiple times in middle school. Tried to shoot myself two year ago. I havenâ€™t had any active attempts in the last two years but I have seriously considered slitting my wrists. Iâ€™m at the end of my rope, literally st this point. I donâ€™t know if there is much even left for me in this world.
