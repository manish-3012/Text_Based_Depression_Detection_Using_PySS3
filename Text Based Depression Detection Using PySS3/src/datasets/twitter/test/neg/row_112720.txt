Back on the train to kill myself.So as I've said in the title. I'm back again looking for people to help me live. As I have none. The one person who was helping me out financially has said fuck you and is no longer helping me. I have $-500 in my account and no longer have any will to live. So I'm sleeping on it now. And hoping that buy tomorrow someone will read this with some advice. Because I'm pretty well done. I couldn't care if I die slowly. I just need it to be over. 

Edit: I've also made a post in r/confessions about a recent history in drug abuse. And how I've come clean. I don't know how to tag the post in here. But long story short. Life was 10x better on drugs. Family treated me better. Wasn't arguing with people all the time. And over the year and a half to two years of drug use. I never once had a suicidal thought.
