When you are to caring, even in your suicidal thoughts.I've been thinking about taking my own life for some time now and even found a painless way to do it. But being the caring idiot I am, I just had to google the impact suicide has on survivors. I'd personally not like to put my mother through that but I honestly can no longer put myself through the pain of having to live any more. I am still trying to figure out how to lessen the emotional impact, by probably doing it away from home, but in a location where my body will be found quickly. *sigh*

As much as I'd like not to be a further financial burden on my mom, I guess at this point it really can't be helped as I am in no position to leave any money for my funeral expenses. Literally all of my bank accounts' balances are below $10 right now. 

But I guess the most I can do to lessen the financial impact is to request no funeral or memorial service, cremation, no obituary, basically I just want to cease to exist with little impact to everyone around me.
