Survived a suicide attempt, I donâ€™t know what to do nowIâ€™ve been depressed for as long as I can remember. I have a lot of trauma and Iâ€™ve experienced a lot of shitty things. I reached boiling point Tuesday night and overdosed on booze, anti depressant and painkillers. I was completely disassociated at the time and didnâ€™t think about the consequences. My only conscious thought after 15 minutes was that itâ€™d be a painful death, and so I tried to vomit up as many of the pills as I could. During this my mother discovered what had happened and an ambulance was called. I spent about 24 hours in hospital as they ran tests. I was extremely disoriented the entire time and due to covid I spent all of my time in the hospital alone. I have no access to my family as I had no phone, and so I basically stared at a wall for 17 hours straight.

Psychiatrists saw me, as did doctors. They told me I was very lucky to have managed to get the painkillers out of my system. They forwarded letters to my doctor advising her on what had happened, and sent me home after about 24 hours of monitoring and tests.

My family have rallied around me, which is nice. My boyfriend is hurting and in shock but heâ€™s been there for me. I hurt him a lot because I didnâ€™t say goodbye, and I feel terrible for that. None of my friends know. The ones who are meant to be closest to me donâ€™t actually check in on me anymore, and so I donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll ever know anyway. 

Iâ€™m still coming down from the large amount of antidepressants in my system, but I donâ€™t really know how to feel or what to do now. It was one of those events you experience in life where there was a before and an after. Now Iâ€™m in the after, peopleâ€™s perspectives of me have permanently changed, not positively or negatively, or even consciously. My perspective of myself has changed too. Iâ€™ve scared myself. I donâ€™t know what to do next. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m a danger to myself right now but I still have no idea how to get better
