I think Iâ€™m finally gonna kill myselfIâ€™ve wanted to die for years. Iâ€™m just a worthless waste of space and thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m ever gonna be. Nobody really likes me, all I do is burden people and get on their nerves. I havenâ€™t cared about small and simple things like chores or anything else in years, because I just donâ€™t have the energy. Iâ€™ve felt dead inside for years, just not caring about anything and just waiting to die.

No matter how hard I try, no matter how much I scream, no one actually hears what Iâ€™m saying. Iâ€™m just a lazy, stupid child to everyone. Iâ€™m beyond sick of it, and Iâ€™m beyond sick of living. Life is just not worth it.
