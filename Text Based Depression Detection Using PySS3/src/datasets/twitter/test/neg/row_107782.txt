Just need help.I dont know where to begin. Iv made some terrible mistakes in the past few days and tonight and it just gets worse. I'm losing a close friend that's moving away and I lost my significant other and many coworkers are leaving. It's like I'm alone in this world with one click. Befor I nodiced and blinked I had nothing. Getting out of bed gets harder and harder. I sleep longer and longer. I dont like being awake anymore and I do what I can to exause myself so I have to sleep and for long periods of times. I'm doing things I never I thought I would to get away from it. I dont want to die I dont think, but it feels like it worsens everyday. I just want the pain and loneliness to end. Especially loneliness. Theres not one person I have anymore to talk to. Out of all these people and no one to go to. I usually thought of my self as upbeat. I dont know how I ended up here.
