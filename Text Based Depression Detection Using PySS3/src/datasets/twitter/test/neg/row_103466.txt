NOOOOO STOP THISSTOP PITYING ME AND THEN WHEN I FINALLY GIVE IN YOU LEAVE WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? NOOO NO NONON NO NO NO. STOP THIS I WON'T ALLOW YOU STOP MAKING THESE NOISES STOP MAKING THESE THINGS HAPPEN AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 

They leave me and make loud noises so I can't follow why do they do this? Loud noises make me think of all of the other senses that I have blocked off like touch, I don't want those feelings. Why do people always leave me? Why don't I have anything in common with anyone? WHY? I hate this. I hate being forced to be alive. I hate this. Arrogance.
