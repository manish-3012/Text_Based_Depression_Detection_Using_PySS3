Why is this so frustrating?Nothing is going wrong in life right now so why is it that I am starting to want to distance myself from everyone? Sure, life has been rough and now its going okay. I have a job, husband has a job, we aint got kids yet, I on good terms with my family now. His family, thats a different matter.

How does everyone else deal with moments when you just seriously shut down from life and begin to want to fade away?
