My gf cheated on me, left for the other guy. And depression came backI have no skills. My gf of year and a half who has been my only mental support has cheated on me and left me for some asshole. They started going out, making out and I don't know what else. The guy is a fucking asshole. Plus my depression came back since my ex was the only one who could help me. My grades at school are shit. I will fail this semester so I am screwed. I've been thinking about suicide. Where to do it, how to do it, when to do it and what to write to the goodbye note. Whether to mention that whore (my ex). How she betrayed me and broke me even more than I was before. There's only one thing stopping me. My mother. Friend of mine hanged himself recently and I went to his funeral. My mum didn't even know him, but she was shocked when I told her that one of my friends hanged themselves. She was devastated by it. I can't imagine what would happen if I did it too. I started crying while writing this post.. What do I do? Nothing makes me happy anymore, I stopped going to school. All I do is just lay in bed because I don't have the energy to do anything else...


using throwaway for obvious reasons...
