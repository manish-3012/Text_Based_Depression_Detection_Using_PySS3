I feel like I'm losing itI'm not good enough as I wish I could be, I want to be the better version of my self but my useless ass can't and I'm tired, I just want to relax and apologize to everybody that treated me so well and I didn't give anything in return, I feel like this is the best way so that they can move on and forget me like I deserve to be forgotten
