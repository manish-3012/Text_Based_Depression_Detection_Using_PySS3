Downer than ever, just needed to vent.This new year is getting to me. I'm no more important than any other fellow-being with emotional problems and writing here for help and advice seams some what wrong, like i don't deserve any help because this is my problem and my alone, for that same reason is hard for me to ask for help, so, i usually never do. 

Getting to the point, i feel miserable, i really really do and it pains me so much inside that i cant take it anymore and something gotta give but the last thing i want is more suicide thoughts, they disturb reality and prevent me from self healing, having those thoughts in my head never helps but sometimes i can't stop them, i guess i am just weak minded.

What is the problem and why? Getting old, watching my dreams getting behind and feeling like they will never come, thus feeling like i truly am a failure. Desperately alone with no one to talk, i'm a 26 year old guy with almost no real friends and the ones i do have i grew tired of them, mostly because everything is always about them and i just feel so tired of sacrificing myself for others and never getting the same treatment. My last relationship ended almost 3years ago and since then my self-esteem been decreasing steadily and it's almost depleted at this moment.

On the 31th i put all that behind me and went out with some relatives. Well, it backfired, everything came flashing back once again, seeing all the nice people partying, the beautiful girls, i realty felt like "forever alone", all the memes that i usual i'm so keen to laugh at were coming into reality, my reality.

It's hard for me to meet new people, even online if i see someone that i think interesting i just ignore thinking they will not have the slightest interest in me and that i would just be a bother to them. In person is even worst, there is always a panic attack waiting to append and even if it doesn't the fear that it might is always present, making me hopeless and thoughtless, resulting in a very uninteresting person.

The past? Well, broken home, parents divorce, mother issues, the usual.

Working, i don't have the strength nor the motivation anymore.

I know everything is solvable, especially emotional problems, that tomorrow anything can change, but at this point i feel that knowledge and feelings are just enemies trying to kill each other, and in my case the feelings are winning. &lt;Need Hug&gt;

I hate my self for hating myself. Being smart sucks, thinking is the worst and doubting is just painful. Crying helps for a moment, the feeling of total hopelessness tends to vanish for a moment, but its like a cat, as long as you feed him it will always come back.

After all this, what i feel i need, is someone that understands, comforts and assures me that everything will be alright. This is all i ask and been hopping for, but in the end (at least until now) i have been giving the short stick, everyone just seams so far away from me. In a fairytale point of view i would only ask for a "prince", but this is reality were nothing is effortlessly nor a kiss in the frog saves the day. 

Other thing that makes it all the more "stupid" (for me), is that i actually have a pretty face and a normal composition, and although this last few years been putting on some extra "depression" weight i still hold some charm, or at least that is what i want to believe. But that is not enough, i lack the strength to overcome my fears and talk to people resulting in me feeling hideous and unattractive, that i have nothing to give and thous nothing deserve. 

At this point in writing this post i feel like it's all a mess, gibberish if you may, but i will try my best to leave it unedited since i need someone to feel my unbalanced mind, everything seams coated with feelings in a clothed mess.

SuicideWatch might not be the best place for me since i battle with this thoughts and they usually stay at bay, but i just don't know anymore, the tiredness is giving in to the thought. It's not like me, i'm becoming something else my foundations are collapsing one by one to this point.

English is not my mother thong so i ask of you to forgive any spelling or grammatical mistakes, feeling like i am now makes it hard for me to process every thought in other languages and translate them into words i don't often use.

To anyone who reach this point and went to the trouble of reading through every babble of mine, i thank you.
