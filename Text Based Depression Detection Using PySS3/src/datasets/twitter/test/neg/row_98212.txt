Emotionally drowningI don't think I'm going to kill myself. But I don't know that I won't either. I'm a somewhat known internet personality and I make a good living in the entertainment industry. The past few years have been hard with family illnesses and friends who have abandoned me for bigger and better things, so I've made some bad choices that have led me into a job that I hate but I can't quit because I have a lot of debt and I've pigeon-holed myself career wise. I feel a great deal of responsibility to care for the people around me but all I want to do is close my eyes and never wake up again. I work hard and the people who follow me online think I'm happy and some kind of role model but I'm constantly one step away from the edge. I don't know how to be alive.
