Never told anyone I'm suicidal, I feel that's too big a burden to put on anyone, and I can't tell that to a professional as I'll get locked up so what are my options?All my life I've felt suicidal at different times and I have been trying to fuse that secret but it's slowly getting away from me. Now people know I'm depressed and it's bad enough,m the worry that my fiends as family are going through, I can't imagine what it would go to if I upped depressed to suicidal so I just keep it inside which doesn't help. I just can't bear the thought of someone knowing I was suicidal and thinking they should have done something at least now they have plausible deniability and if I leave a note hopefully I can explain everything well enough that they are at peace. I just wish I could answer everyones questions before I did it but then I'd get stopped from doing it so that's not possible. Ideas? Thoughts? I dunno what I'm after here. Anyway thanks for reading.
