Selfish cunt and I hate myselfTLDR: selfish cunt who has things way too good for what they deserve yet is still complaining even though every single post I've read on here Is from a much worse situation.

I had a much longer post typed out, but no one wants to hear my life story. I'm almost 19, had depression &amp; bad social anxiety since 12. Grew up in a fairly well off family, dad has a good job. I was a terrible student, was never motivated to study or even try. Finished school with terrible grades, no invitations the the universities I applied to, no surprises there. Spent the first few months after school cooped up inside feeling sorry for myself with no job or aspirations. The thing is, I managed to land an amazing job that pays amazingly well for someone my age. I was never bullied after the age of 11, I have some great mates, I'm by no means unattractive, yet I can't help but spend 97% feeling like shit. Everything I used to love and enjoy like tennis and video games, I no longer do. I'm merely existing at this point. Due to the social anxiety, I've never been in a relationship, I can't even talk to someone new, I only have friends because I wasn't this bad when I met them 8 years ago. How would I have any hope of being in a relationship when to this day i still have trouble simply buying something from a store, ordering maccas etc. I can't even hold eye contact with even my best mate for more than 2 seconds without feeling awkward. I ran into a girl a few days ago who I had met previously and I can tell she's extremely into me, yet I have no idea why. I struggle to hold a conversation, and I'm afraid of a relationship purely because I have nothing to give, a plank of wood would be more interesting to talk to than me. Basically suicide has been in my head for the last year or so, and has recently become a stronger force. Nothing negative would come of me leaving, other than the fact my dad would have 1 less person to provide for. To sum it all up, I hate myself because I somehow can't fucking grow up and realise how fucking good I have it, and that I'm so undeserving of everything good I have. I know some incredibly amazing people who deserve so much more than me yet here I am with everything I could ask for, yet I'm still miserable. I just expect everything to come to me, I don't want to have to try for anything, and I fucking hate myself for it. I'm sure I've missed some points but I can't be bothered checking. This is the first time I've openly spoken about my mental state, even though It's under some shit name online. I don't need any comments or help or any of that shit, just feels good to finally say something. Suicide feels close. Have a good day
