I thought I could make it in college but it seems like I canâ€™t.Iâ€™m taking summer classes and Iâ€™m on term 2 right now. In term 1 I got a D in my chemistry class which is failing for my major. I was able to move on to the next chemistry class but my professor doesnâ€™t believe I can do it. I have a lot of medical issues including fibromyalgia and some sort of sleep disorder. I couldnâ€™t stay awake for more than 2 hours at a time but now Iâ€™m on Ritalin this term. Iâ€™m just doubting myself a lot. If I donâ€™t pass this class this term I wonâ€™t be able to move onto my next two major classes and Iâ€™ll be super behind. I already missed my first semester due to my medical issues. My goal is to become a doctor but at this point I donâ€™t see it happening. I got essentially all Câ€™s my first semester and then that D last summer term, those are just the intro classes too. I just feel like an idiot and lazy. I donâ€™t even want to be alive, Iâ€™m only alive for my family and for the possibility of being a doctor. Iâ€™m just so tired of trying to work hard and getting no where. I just wish all my medical issues would be solved. It seems like when one gets solved or is starting to get solved another one pops up and Iâ€™m so tired of it. I just donâ€™t understand why people want me to be alive and suffer through horrible pain all the time. I just want to be able to do well in college, to do well in life, but it seems like Iâ€™m destained not to. People suggested me changing my career goals but I donâ€™t see myself doing anything else. I like being able to make people better or at least try to because I canâ€™t make myself better (fibromyalgia has no cure and none of the dozens of meds Iâ€™ve tried have really worked for me). People keep telling me itâ€™s all get better, but when? Iâ€™m tired of trying, I feel like Iâ€™ve just given up in school and in life at this point.
