I'm such a fucking coward.Everything was set up. It was easier than expected. The noose hung tightly and sturdily and I just couldn't. I pussied out.

 There is a tiny smidgen of hope left, but i'm afraid i dont know how much longer i can hold out. Thinking of trying again soon, not sure if i will be able to do it though. There's no point in living if i don't enjoy it. My life is miserable, i fucked up my education, i argue with my parents daily, they are disappointed, all i do is fucking play video games because i'm too lazy and incapable to do anything else. I can't bear existing much longer. Maybe next time i'll play my favourite song to make things easier. Sorry if this sounds really pathetic.

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=da7gMOY8bTA) my favourite song if anyone cares. Amazing musician.
