I feel like i was depressed, though i think i am notSo, here i am. Almost 25 and that's one third of my supossed lifetime, though i honestly wish it was the the 2nd half of my 3rd third. Lol 

I really like the song Wish by NIN. Especially this part:
"this is the firs day, of my last days"

When i got the time, i just drink alcohol, listen to music or making some music. I used to play videogames, but i can't force myself to do anything else than to make or to listen music, and of course to drink.

Do you believe in God? How deep is your belief? Who do you think he is? Why do you believe? Do you honestly love this entity?

Well, i am not depressed. I believe, i am fine. There is just anything else for me to do now, than to write here these random thoughts. If i told those thoughts to people i know, they would consider me an idiot, or a wreck, or just some sort of an exot. Recently i tried to say something to a couple of people and they did laugh on me and ignored me. 

My life is nice, anyway. I know it sounds really weird, i only wish that couple of things were not like they were. And i daydream about it a lot.

If this is according to you depression, i want to know what was or what is going on inside of your mind when you was or/when you are depressed.
