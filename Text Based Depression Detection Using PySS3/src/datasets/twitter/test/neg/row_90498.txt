Procrastinating is ruining my lifeI wasted so much time and energy on college and the semester barely started Iâ€™m already way behind on my school work. My sleep schedule and anxiety play a huge role in this and itâ€™s kind of ruining my future. Last week I almost dropped out but because life is not that set for my family I have no choice but to go to college. I do go to therapy but it feels like it is going no where. I just want to end it all itâ€™s currently almost 4 am, Iâ€™m probably not gonna attend online class and iâ€™m just wasting time and money. I just wish I could live in my bedroom for the rest of my life all I ask for is internet access I really dont need much. I donâ€™t think work life is cut out for me either but definitely canâ€™t afford to beca dropout. The bedt for my sanity and family is that I just kill myself.
