What to expect from a suicide hotline?Hi, I don't know if this is the place to post this, but I've been feeling particularly bad lately. More so than usual. I've though of calling a hotline but when I do, I'm in such a bad shape I wouldn't even know what to say. It's difficult to explain being depressed for seemingly trivial or imagined reasons, and I always feel like it would just be me crying drunk on the phone. At this point, I'm just thinking it would be easier to go through with it.
