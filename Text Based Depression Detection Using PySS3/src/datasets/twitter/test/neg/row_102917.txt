I just can't keep goingThere's just no point. Be born, go to school, get job/go college for better job, make money, buy things, repeat until death. Anything else is a lie. But the truth blows. I'm so mad I didn't die on deployment, that was like 95% of the reason I joined.

I was stupid for believing I was special, the world was just, and people weren't apathetic zombies slogging through life.

It's pretty funny how no one cares until you're gone. Then they blame you for never being forthcoming. But I'll be dead.
