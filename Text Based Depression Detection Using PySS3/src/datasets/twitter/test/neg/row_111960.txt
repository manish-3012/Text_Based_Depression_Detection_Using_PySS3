Feeling lostDo you ever have this feeling like you don't really know why you're still living? Like you should've died a long time ago? 

I have a hard time just going through day to day life because I feel like I'm just waiting to die and if that's the case then nothing matters. Somedays it's worse. I feel like I could end it right then and there, but then I wonder what my family would think and I can't do that to them. Just the other day I took a ton of my anxiety meds just to see if it would do anything. Anything at all. And I woke up the next morning perfectly fine. 

I don't ever want anyone to go through this, but I also don't want to be alone in it. So I guess what I'm asking is how do y'all deal with this empty feeling? Or if you can relate at all? I just feel stuck in this one spot while the rest of the world goes on without me.

Sorry for the long post. I'm just trying to figure out how to put this all into words.
