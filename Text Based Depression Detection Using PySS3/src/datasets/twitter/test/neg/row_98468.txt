I dont like anythingI have never been diagnosed with depression or anxiety or anything like that (I have never tried to get help tho) but I just dont want to do anything. Nothing is fun everything just sucks. I play football and I like it I quess but I just feel like im complete shit at it. I feel like im complete shit at everything. I dont do good in school I am a shitty friend my parents are dissapointed of me all the time because I just stay home and play video games if I dont have football practice. I have a couple friends and they are awesome. They are the only thing I live for. I dont want to ruin their lives by killing my self because I love them but I dont enjoy life myself. Maybe you cloud tell me how to die without them knowing or how I cloud enjoy living. I am just 13 years old soon 14 and I dont think wanting to die constantly is normal. Its my biggest wish, dying.
BTW I made an alt account so no one knows who I am, so I dont have karma.
