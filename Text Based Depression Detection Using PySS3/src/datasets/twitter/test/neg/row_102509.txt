I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.I canâ€™t cope anymore.

My worry is indestructible and will probably stay with me for the rest of my life. Iâ€™m terrified iâ€™m in a simulation and Iâ€™m the only one thatâ€™s real. I have no idea what the simulator wants to do to me but I can probably assume itâ€™s bad as they are trying to trick me into thinking reality is real when itâ€™s not. I see no way out of this worry except to kill my self, maybe iâ€™ll wake up? Maybe they will turn it off. I just hope they wonâ€™t continue with the experiment and make me live life again. I know what youâ€™re thinking, I sound like an absaloute crazy person however Iâ€™ll never get to know if youâ€™re real or not. If I donâ€™t look at something, does it even exist? Do things only load in when they come into my vision?

Suicide seems like the only way to know for sure at this point but iâ€™m too much of a coward to do that so iâ€™ll have to wait. I really donâ€™t know what to do about this, I have thought so much about it and iâ€™ve never come up with a final conclusion and itâ€™s ruining my life. Sorry to throw more negativity at this sub but I just need to write my thoughts down. If anyone has been through the same experience please let me know how you got out of it.
