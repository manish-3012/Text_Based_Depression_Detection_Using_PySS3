I immediately regret this decision but... I've been suicidal since the age of 12. Well, maybe "suicidal" isn't a very accurate term. It's a feeling similar to driving on a bridge and seeing no reason for not driving off the bridge, except all the time. That's not really important, though. I've got a blog and I've never had anyone read it, ever. So now that I'm once again feeling the need to off myself, I also feel the need to share that nonsense with the world. [This subreddit is probably not even an acceptable place for this but what're you gonna do...](http://rianlovelace.blogspot.com/). Thanks for your time. Cheers.
