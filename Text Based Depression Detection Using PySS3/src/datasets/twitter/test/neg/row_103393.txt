Friend threatening suicide with a date really soonHey guys. I have a friend who is suicidal and has been threatening to kill themselves very soon. I'm all too familiar with depression and suicide, having attempted myself. 

This is always so nervewracking. I do call contact the authorities, right? I'm just scared because they're in college, and they can lose a lot of money from losing the semeseter(that their parents paid for), and their parents aren't great. They might really flip. Having them institutionalized would probably ruin the whole semester, and make life so so difficult for them at home when they got back.

I am doing the right thing by calling their imminent threat out, right? This is always always so scary... having a person's life decided by one call. I'm scared of ruining their lives. But I also know that they may absolutely be serious.

I just need someone's thoughts. It's freaking me out, really. I've been drinking all day just to keep the anxiety over it all down. 

EDIT: I called 911. I supposed this can be closed now. I feel absolutely awful though. If anyone would like to say anything, I'd still appreciate it.
