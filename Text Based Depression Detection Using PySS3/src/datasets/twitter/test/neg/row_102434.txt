I want someone who is in love with me, but I am so anxious that it's impossibleI've been in love with my cousin (who's 20 and three years older than me) (don't make fun of me) for months now, and she already has a boyfriend. I get incredibly jealous when I see them holding hands, and I feel like life's not worth it if I can never be her boyfriend. I also hate that we're cousins, because society doesn't think dating your own cousin is normal. But my cousin is the most beautiful woman on the planet, and she is the nicest to me out of all the girls. I can't think of another girl to spend the rest of my life with. But it will never work. She already has a perfect boyfriend, and even if they broke up, she wouldn't date me because I'm her cousin, I'm three years younger than her and still a kid, I'm incredibly ugly, and I am really anxious. 

I've been thinking of ending it before I turn 18 next year using a suicide bag. I'm sure my cousin wouldn't care at all. If my aunt (who I know cares about me at least a tiny bit more than my cousin) told my cousin I had died, she'd probably get the biggest smile in the world and say "oh ok". And then she'd arrange a party celebrating that I died, and probably piss on my grave every year.

Some days are better than others of course, but the worst days are when I face rejection from my cousin.
