Permanent fix sounds good to meI've been sitting here, in the dark, contemplating suicide. I can't seem to find a reason not to pull this trigger. There is this crippling amount of pain and depression washing over me. I'm not expecting anyone to read this or comment. Hell no one in my life has tried to reach out to me. Why should it be any different here. I think what im doing here is simply venting before the inevitable happens. I've spent a considerable amount of time today making sure the gun and ammo will do the trick and where to aim. So I guess what I'm writing will be the last words I'll ever speak/write. Im not looking for sympathy or anyone to change my mind. I have lost the last little bit keeping me alive. I literally have nothing left to lose except my life. Now that the realization has set in that I will die by my own hands, I feel a sense of relief. I'm not scared about what is going to happen. Its almost freeing in itself. This is the calmest I have felt in a long time. I now know a sense of peace I've never known. Its actually exhilarating. Wow, this is it. Goodbye.
