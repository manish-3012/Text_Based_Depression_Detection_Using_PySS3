Still here, still in pain, still thinking about doing it.If anyone cares to read my backstory, you can find my other two posts from clicking my username.

Yesterday I found a note my wife had written me the night before she had an operation that was meant to save her life. She was so frightened, but she wanted to reassure me and my son that she loved us, that we made her the happiest woman in the world, and that she would always be there for us.

I can remember staring at a lady in the waiting room, I think I noticed I might be able to see up her skirt. While my wife was on the operating table. This is just one of a long list of memories I can't bear any more.

I might be able to live, if I hadn't done something so reckless that it could have cost me my son, and now whenever I try to comfort him or play with him, anything, it's all I can think of.

Why shouldn't I kill myself?
