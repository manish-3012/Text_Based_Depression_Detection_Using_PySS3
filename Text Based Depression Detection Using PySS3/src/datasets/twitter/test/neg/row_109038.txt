f*ck it, i'm doneI CAN'T HANDLE THIS.


an extremely close family member passed away last night, just when i was starting to crawl out of the hole of depression. we were going to visit her soon.

i have a few methods in mind. i won't be missed by anyone, so that's fine.

Why did this happen?! What did I do to deserve this?!
