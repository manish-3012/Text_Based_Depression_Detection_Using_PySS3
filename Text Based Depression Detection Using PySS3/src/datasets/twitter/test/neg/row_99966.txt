I just don't want to live this life without him, even after help.I've never posted here, I hope this works, anyways...
A few weeks ago, my boyfriend of three years (basically unofficial fiancÃ©, just minus the pending ring) left me. He was going through one of his emotional waves and just acting so confused and crazy upset, oh my god. He has done this before in the past, and come out of it and come back to me, and then we would be even happier than before. But, he thinks that now he just doesn't love me anymore, when back in April/May he was saving up for a ring and a home for us and called me the love of his life, he told his best friend the same thing. He's cried over me, put himself in harm's way to protect me... I was abandoned by my mother some years ago, and this man is all I really had for family. He would tell me how he would hurt anyone who hurt me and would really get angry, he was always there to comfort me when I was upset and I didn't even have to ask. We had everything in common and he dreamt of spending his life with me, he has wanted to marry me for years and seriously, he told me I was the only one he opens himself up to. All of this... and he just leaves, like he forgot it all...
Now, all my days since then consist of being too scared to check my messages since him and I are still talking, and hoping and believing in him that he will return to me. He tried being mean but can't bring himself to just completely throw me out of his life, then calls me something special, anyway...
A few days after this, I had to go in for sudden emergency surgery, which I didn't want to do. Because I knew that once I had been under the anesthesia again, I would want that feeling of nothingness again. Going into the surgery I told myself that this was it, I was going to die in sleep and never wake up, and I was so calm that the nurses were really concerned. And yes, when I awoke and realized I was still alive I was devastated, again. That I was still here existing, I just wanted to stop being here. Because even though I've been to see help since all this, I just have come to the conclusion that without this man, I do not want to continue my life and I see no value in it for me. Everyone says I'll find something else I'll love but I know in my heart that I just won't. I have no will to, regardless of what anyone has told me I just don't want to exist anymore. Even when I am not crying, I still feel like I'm in absolute agony or despair, but even when I'm thinking clearly it is just thoughts like "I want this to be done, I don't want to wake up again" and I don't want to do anything anymore. I guess you could compare it to major depression, except that I don't want to seek help. I don't wish to keep living this life and "change" into someone else and forget him and everything else I have lost- I just want to be remembered as I am now, and I am content with my life meeting its end now, because it all feels so wrong and I just want to be done. I'm terrified of pain and feeling the life escape me, but I just want to go to that nothingness again forever and never wake up. I love that man with every part of my being, he has never wronged me and I trusted him with everything, but he left and now I just don't want anything anymore that life has to offer. I have the chance to go overseas if I want and I don't even want that, nowadays I just stay home and burn out my support system.
If there was a way to easily be gone by now then I would be. I believe death is how it was before I was born, and that nothingness does not scare me anymore. I really wish they could just kill me while in anesthesia, I would be so grateful, but they can't. I just know that I have lost so much in my life, I have no one now that I love and I don't want to exist anymore, I don't want to spend every day of my life in agony though I refuse to forget and change my feelings, the only reason I'm living right now is to talk to him and convince him he's being foolish, and to feed my cat I guess, and I just don't /want/ any different. I've always had these feelings of nihilism, but he was the only one that could make me ignore them, and now I know that it's what I want. I wish I could leave this world as I am now, I don't want "help" from these therapists or to change or forget. Everything only worsens by the day, and I just want to stop.
