Has anyone gone through life after considering suicide, and then realized that it would have been better?Has anyone ever throught about suicide early on, and now later in life realized that nothing was all that great? Be Honest.

I feel like Im holding out on being happy and its never going to happen. Im going to wake up in 20 years as miserable as now, but with more attachments to keep me there.
