I'm completely invisibleI try talking to my therapists and all my input is ignored.

I try talking in my group therapy and I get ignored, even when I report that someone threatened to break both of my wrists, it takes until I mentally break down for it to even be realized.

My friends don't care, and redirect me to either other friends who don't care, or professionals who don't care. Hell, one of my closest friends decided to block me and absolutely trash my life, turning me suicidal. And he doesn't care; hell, he says I *deserve* it.

I even call a suicide hotline, get put on hold for 8 minutes, and the bitch begs for my ZIP code and doesn't even help me since it's "required." She redirects me to a crisis hotline's VOICEMAIL and they haven't even replied after **38 hours for an urgent call.**

I post my frustration on depression and SW and *absolutely nobody even sees the posts.* I know they're not invisible, an alt account can see them just fine, so for all intents and purposes, I'm being *ignored.*

It's not even hyperbole to claim nobody would even realize my suicide. Absolutely nobody even pays any attention nor mind to it. The rare people who *do* see it, either don't care, or redirect me to people who don't care.
