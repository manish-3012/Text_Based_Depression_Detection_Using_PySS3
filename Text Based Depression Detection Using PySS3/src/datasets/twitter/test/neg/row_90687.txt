Just failed another test. Will probably fail the course, lose my scholarship, and have to drop out of school.I just failed a test I spent 20 hours studying for. This is my third failing grade in that class and I will probably fail the course now. Because of that I'll lose my academic scholarship and I can't afford to go to school without it.

I've struggled with depression for about a year now. I stopped going to counseling because I couldn't afford the sessions anymore. I haven't told anyone in my family about my grades or my depression. This grade feels like the last straw. I feel worthless- if I can't even pass a test after WEEKS of studying I don't even know if I should stay alive.

I feel like I can't talk to anyone. I just wish I was dead. I'm such an embarrassment. I think about doing it every day. It's just a matter of when I get the nerve to do it.
