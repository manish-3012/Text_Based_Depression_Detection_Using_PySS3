I'm not sure what to do.Today I realized that nobody gives a shit about me.

I don't suppose I can blame them, I've yet to find even one tiny reason why anyone should.

The only person I matter to lives on the other side of an ocean. To her I'm little more than a bit of text on a computer screen. I'm completely replaceable, despite how I know she'd deny that.

I'm a worthless person. This isn't my lack of self-esteem talking, though it does certainly give its own contribution to the voice. No, this is a fact. I have no remarkable talents. I look like shit - and not in the everyone-is-beautiful-in-their-own-way sort of looking like shit, but of the honest and unarguable variety of the assertion. I have no confidence. I have no job and barely any money. I'm an idiot. There is absolutely no reason why anyone should want to know me.

Not even the people who are obligated to care about me do. My family is a collection of horrid people who would sooner cling to prejudiced beliefs than alter just a few words of their vocabulary to avoid hurting me quite so much. The member of my family who I'm staying with doesn't even hesitate to tell me how happy he will be to have me gone, and how miserable it makes him to house me. This is the one who I choose to stay with, because he is the least horrid of the bunch.

But I recognized this shortcoming of mine. So I tried to give people reasons to care. I went out of my way to care about people, but none of them have thought anything of it and none of them have returned the favor.

I have no friends. Well, I have one friend. The one friend to whom I am rather easily replaceable. We haven't even been friends for so remarkably long. But I don't have any real and material friendship with anybody. Every time I try to start one I find myself ignored or declined.

I don't know what to do. I'm not enough for myself. I'm weak and unsteady and pathetically dependent and I'm running out of strength. I need someone to hold my hand. But nobody wants to, and I can't fathom any reason why anybody should.

So what am I supposed to do? I've told myself not to consider suicide an option, but it's not working.

I'm closer to ending it than I've ever been before because I can't find anything to live for or anyone I don't inconvenience with my mere presence.
