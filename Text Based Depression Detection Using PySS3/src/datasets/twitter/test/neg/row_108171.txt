I'll die before I turn 20Fuck this shit. I failed everyone including myself, and I keep on failing. What's the fucking point in going further. I am already a sore loser and I am ashamed of even talking about the way I live my life. I don't belong here. If you can't play the game, don't play it. I don't have a plan yet. Probably will rent a hotel room or something.
