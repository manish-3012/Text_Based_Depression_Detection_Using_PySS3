When youre not sad, not pitiful, just that you've realised how pointless living is.I'm no naive teen, am going to be 30 soon and I just.. life is so pointless you know? Everything is so meaningless. 

The life I had imagined for myself when I was in school... couldn't achieve anything,not even 1% of it. I was so bright once upon a time. I was so happy as a child.. what even happened? Seems like something lifetimes ago... Was that even me?

The only thing keeping me from offing myself is the possibility... of meeting the love of my life?.. I know.. sounds so stupid and childish but I just...I've never fallen in love. In this almost 30 years of life.. so I keep hoping that maybe.. but if I kill myself today, maybe I lose the chance of meeting them ever?.. does it make sense.. I don't know. 

Its not that am sad about it. Am not. I just think I'm not required. Not in my family. Not in this world. 

I don't hate myself either. Infact if you meet me irl you'd think am this confident well read woman who has everything figured out. I do. And that's the realisation : that's its pointless. Living a life searching for meaning but that's it : there's none. Some people have nothing to live for. I am one of them. I took forward to nothing. There's nothing I wanna do. There's just... Nothing. So what am I doing here? Putting myself through misery every second by breathing.. For what reason? 

Its not like I think finding the love of my life will change anything. I just wanna know if they exist. There's no expectation or want to be loved back. I just wanna feel what its like to love and be in love... Just once. Before killing myself.
