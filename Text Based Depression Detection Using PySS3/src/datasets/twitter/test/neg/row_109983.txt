I just canâ€˜t do it anymoreEveryone would just be better off without me. I keep disappointing everyone in my life on a constant basis. I just canâ€˜t keep dealing with this existential dread in the back of my mind. Iâ€˜ve made my peace and am going to end it soon. See you in the next life my friends.
