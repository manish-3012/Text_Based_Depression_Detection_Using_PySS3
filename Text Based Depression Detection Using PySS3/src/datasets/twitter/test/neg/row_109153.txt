HospitalizedHeld hostage for 7 hours against my will all cause I senta textmessage. Guess the stories are true.

 Would've been even longer had my parents not gone "CanISeeYourManager" mode. Got nothing out of it except upsetting my family and boredom. Last time I tell someone about my problems. Worst day ever.
