Let me goLet me fall, slip in to the mouth of the void, for once thought as a beautiful sky, filled with stars of hope, shining on those who I once could call friends. Tis but a call for help, as those who I, foolishly attempted relying on, happened to be none but forced by someone whose priority is no other than themselves. Let me go, run away from the flame keeping me alive, at the cost of slowly burning my soul. Let that bit remaining rest in the eternal bed as others speak meaningless words on their false love. Let me go.
