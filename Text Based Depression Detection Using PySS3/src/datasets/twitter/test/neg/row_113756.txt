7 billion people and I have the audacity to think I matter.I hate myself for thinking this way because im generally living a good life and am privileged. aside from financial troubles im doing okay, but for some reason i cant help thinking this way. Some days i consider doing it, never have actually tried, but damn do i want to. I want to be able to leave without hurting anyone but thats not possible. I wish it got so bad so i had a reason to go without looking like a coward. 
I'm sorry.
