Really need some help, Iâ€™m in too much emotional pain.I just wish I wasnâ€™t here anymore. I have thoughts of ending my life multiple times each day, for the last 7 days and Iâ€™ve planned that if i canâ€™t fix myself Iâ€™m gonna have no choice but to do it. 

Basically they is this Friend who went to the same class as me and we finished not to long ago. The course was 3 years long and I started to develop feelings for her as we was finishing but I finally got the courage last Tuesday and told her I ask her and asked her on a date. 
It went bad. Really bad in my opinion. 

Since then I havenâ€™t stopped crying since, as I also lost a really good friend. She was the only person who I had feelings for and I would do anything to keep her happy. 
I havenâ€™t been eating fully either I just feel so down. 

Every time I sleep she is in my dreams, every single night I just wish I would never wake up but at the same time I donâ€™t want to sleep as it makes me think about her as she is irreplaceable and unique in so many ways. 

Sheâ€™s constantly on my mind, making my eyes water as we speak. Because of this itâ€™s stopping me from doing anything and everything. 

I tried dating apps like Match but when I signed up I answered the questions and the first person to pop up for best matched as her and I just canâ€™t take it. 
I tried Tinder and boom she pops up I just really want to super-like her and press the wink button but at the same time itâ€™s a bad idea as she rejected me in the past. 

I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. She was everything to me.
