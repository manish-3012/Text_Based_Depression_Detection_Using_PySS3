I don't even know what I want to doLike honstly I am not depressed. I'm just at this point where I'm already a junior with a 2.8 GPA with no chance of going anywhere for college. I have no college fund. I have nothing to move onto. 
For the past week I've been just looking up ways on the Internet to kill myself. I'm taking everything with a okay manor. I just feel like that would be the best bet. I'm also really intrested in where we go when we die. I do not believe in heaven beacuse it seems to far fetched but I've always though of what would actually happen when I die. 

I don't know though.. I've been going on with my life as normal. Making plans for farther dates and such. I just don't know if I will do it or not and when.. I guess you can say in seaking help even though I feel it would do no use. But I just figured why not post somthing.. thanks
