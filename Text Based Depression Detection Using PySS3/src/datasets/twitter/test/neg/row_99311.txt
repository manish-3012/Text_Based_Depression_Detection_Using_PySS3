What could go wrong If I take this?Ok I have 25 pills of stilnox (zolpidem). 
More of 40 of Bromazepam
And 30 of tramadol.
Can this put me to sleep without any worries?
I'm tired.
I'm alone. 
I'm not searching support. I just want to know if all this together can work. Because I know some medicine can nullify the effect of others.
