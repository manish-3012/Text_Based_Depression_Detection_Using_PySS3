I donâ€™t really see things getting any betterIn the midst of a health crisis, my employer decided to force me to take an unpaid leave of absence. 

They decided I wasnâ€™t going to be productive enough with the medical care Iâ€™m requiring at the moment, but didnâ€™t say who this decision came from. My reporting manager did not agree with this decision, and was unaware it was even being discussed until I told her.

They refuse to pay out my time off so I can keep an income for the next month. If they donâ€™t terminate me, that money isnâ€™t owed to me. Iâ€™m simply sitting on their payroll, unused. I canâ€™t file for unemployment this way, either.

They refuse to give me the time I need to have a doctor clear me for short-term disability or FMLA. In fact, they gave me 48 hours to accomplish this, which is nowhere near enough time. (It would take at least two weeks based on my doctorâ€™s estimate.)

Nobody is hiring right now. I canâ€™t do physical labor (because of my medical condition, I canâ€™t lift over 20 lbs). Itâ€™s unsafe for me to work with the general public, at least until an official diagnosis is made. 

Really at a loss and as stupid as it sounds, feeling betrayed. They obviously donâ€™t care if I have a roof over my head or can put food in my stomach.
