don't think i'll make it to 15i'm 14 at the moment, turned 14 june 28. i still got 8 months left and i honestly don't think i can make it until then. every fucking night i think about and plan out my suicide but tonight's one of those nights. I could do it any time i want to, but i would prefer to not do it the way i could. man i know this is common but fuck man i feel so goddamn alone. i have a girlfriend who i highly doubt even likes me and a decent amount of friends but fuck man i would rather quite literally kill myself then tell them. Goi back to my girlfriend, she asked me to homecoming and for a few days it was great but then she started acting different and i don't even know anymore if we're a thing anymore 

i swear man every night, every single night i think about it. I'm scared because i feel like once i actually get the materials to commit i'll do it and end up causing shit to go down. with my friends and family
