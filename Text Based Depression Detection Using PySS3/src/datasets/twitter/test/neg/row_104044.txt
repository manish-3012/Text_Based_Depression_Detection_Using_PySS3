Iâ€™m so tiredIâ€™m so tired of everything. Iâ€™m tired of hurting Iâ€™m tired of feeling so empty I donâ€™t even feel human. Iâ€™m always bored or sad or alone..anytime I feel the slightest of happiness I canâ€™t help but feel sad because I know it will all be over soon and I will be alone again. No one even thinks that I could be depressed they all think just because Iâ€™m â€˜meâ€™ I canâ€™t be sad, sometimes I donâ€™t wear socks and put on shorts so people can see the cuts on my ankles but no one cares or asks. Iâ€™m sure it sounds like I just want attention, and thatâ€™s probably it but I just want someone to comfort me or tell me Iâ€™ll get through this but I have no one. None of them notice or blink a fucking eye, on top of everything I keep having these nightmares where I feel something chasing after me and I try so hard to scream but all that comes out are small croaks. I canâ€™t sleep anymore because of them so Iâ€™m stuck laying in bed crying or trying to find anything online that can keep my attention.
