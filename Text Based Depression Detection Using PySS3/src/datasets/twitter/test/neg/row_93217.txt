If someone you know kills themselves out of the blue and it doesn't make senseIt could be because they realized that as far back as they remember they did not feel a part of anything.

They tried religion, but they were the mustard seeds that sprouted in shallow earth.

Normal life eventually wore them down due the stress depression and anxiety creates.

Finally, there was nothing they could see in the future to look forward to, just pain.
