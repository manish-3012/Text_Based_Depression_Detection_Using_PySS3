I have no futureIâ€™m 19 and I have lost any hope a life. This isnâ€™t a matter of â€œoh youâ€™re young and itâ€™ll get betterâ€. It wonâ€™t. It never will.

Why?

Iâ€™m 19 and cursed with the one thing which isolated people for the rest of their lives. I am â€œtransgenderâ€ as it were; but really, itâ€™s more just an empty category considering nothing Iâ€™ve done changed anything. Iâ€™ve spent 8 months on hormones, with no changes; it isnâ€™t a matter of my levels being wrong, itâ€™s just not working at all. The only thing it succeeded at doing was sterilising me.

I can never have biological children. Ever. And that hurts. I couldnâ€™t and still canâ€™t afford sperm freezing, so even if I stop the medication it will be in vain. Thereâ€™s no options for that issue. 

I am deformed. My bones bind me to a reality of being a hulking monster. My jaw is wider than anything Iâ€™ve ever seen. Thereâ€™s people who will tell me to get surgeries; again, I refer to part where I cannot afford them, and wonâ€™t be able to for almost 10 years in an ideal scenario where I get a degree and a job. That wonâ€™t happen though, because in a cruel catch 22 I canâ€™t get a job without the surgery to my face, because of how deformed it renders me; without a job I cannot afford the surgery. Circles.

I am an ugly deformed hideous monster freak tranny and I have no future. There will be no loves, no family, not even friends; they all cut ties with me once they found out. I am alone, and have been for months. This is the way society and the world has made my life, and theyâ€™re completely right; I donâ€™t deserve to live. I am broken, in every sense of the word; and for that, I refuse to continue. The only future allowed to me is one where this continues constantly ; I tried your usual shit of talking to people, trying to make new friends, seeing therapists, all it did was highlight how no one wants to be near ducking freaks like me no one wants to be friends with ugly hideous monster men and that thereâ€™s nothing I can do to improve my situation.

I canâ€™t keep doing this. Everyday is painful and I canâ€™t stop. Nothing can fix this. 

I am 19 and Iâ€™ve lost my entire future because I am a disgusting freak who has nothing left to strive for.
