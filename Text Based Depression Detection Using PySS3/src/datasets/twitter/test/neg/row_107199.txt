It doesnâ€™t get any easierThe more time that goes by, I still feel just as shit. Just as heartbroken. Some nights I get so drunk and I breakdown on the floor in an anxiety attack, fighting back tears and thoughts about killing myself. Last night I drank too much and came pretty close to taking a lot of pills..Iâ€™ve been trying to be okay. I started going to the gym which is a big deal for me. Been trying to go out with friends more. Working more, etc. But none of it is helping, and I always want to vent but itâ€™s just pushing many of my friends away at this point cause theyâ€™re tired of hearing about it. And Idk if I can blame them. Heartbreak gets worse. As time moves on, and she moves on. I canâ€™t move on. Everything reminds me of her. And no matter how much I drink I canâ€™t get her out of my head..

Iâ€™ve been fighting the thoughts of killing myself for months now, every single day. Itâ€™s exhausting, and painful. And everything about this is unfair. I wish I never met her. Sorry for the rant
