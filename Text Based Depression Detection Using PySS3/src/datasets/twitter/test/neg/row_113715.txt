I want to attempt suicide againIâ€™d tried to od on pills before and it almost worked, but I ended up in the hospital okay. I really donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I was hoping my eating disorder would kill me but I got hospitalized again before it got to that point. My parents only took me to the hospital because they were close to getting into legal trouble for neglect. Nobody cares about me I donâ€™t want to do this anymore.
