I gave my kids everything gave up my whole life and i was very young and very beautiful married but aloneNow they are grown my oldest is a successful attorney and his brother who is one and a half years younger did not want college and has such anger towards me i don't know why. My husband i have been with since i'm 14yo he was 16 and chased me down and we married and i had kids in my early 20s. My husband is Israeli, selfish a gambler and i raised the kids alone he lived his own life but he made sure i never had any outside friends. He was threatened i was too pretty and people would wake me up to allowing this man to treat me like [this. Now](https://this.Now) we sold our business young in our 40s and it was worth tens of millions. My sons are good kids but will never understand how much i gave up for them, i was mom and dad alone. I did all their doctors ,schooling and sports alone while their dad was off with his friends and gambling. The kids have their own lives and know their dad was bad to me but that's my problem. I am sad , lonely i have no family except my kids and husband who constantly berates me and just ignores me. I cry every night my husband is gone from morning until late night or takes off to Vegas for the weekend and doesn't even tell me he's gone. I just want a will or trust in place if something happens my boys get all my marital assets that he can't take all the millions and gamble it all away. No doctor or therapist understands why i don't leave and go on my own. I don't want to start over at this age even if i still look young and pretty. I wanted to be with someone i shared my life and children with a history. I know i sound crazy and selfish but i just want to be done with life already.
