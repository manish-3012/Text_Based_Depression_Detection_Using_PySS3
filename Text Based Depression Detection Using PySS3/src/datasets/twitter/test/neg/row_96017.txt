Done with the rat racePretty much thinking about taking a shitload of drugs and jumping off the bridge tomorrow. Or just telling a hospital and being admitted while I try to figure things out. Although I'd rather not do that because they'll be another bill to add to my ever-increasing debt. I'm flat broke, I live in a van, haven't gotten a good night's rest for 2 months, ration cup noodle, lost a job because for a while I had no means of transportation, my family either can't or won't help (that's reserved for my siblings - who have literally been spoon-fed two Harley Davidson motorcycles, $60k in student loans, a new car, wedding and quarter million dollar house). I'm picking up gigs here and there but it's kind of at the point where I don't see the point in going on. Get to wake up tomorrow to be hungry and poor for the four thousandth day in a row. All the while living in the richest country in the world where I'm bombarded by the assertion that I just don't try hard enough. I can understand the ethical dilemmas around euthanasia because doctors probably feel uncomfortable killing a 26 year old man but I'm starting to wonder why I shouldn't be allowed to have autonomy over my own life and whether or not I want to keep going.
