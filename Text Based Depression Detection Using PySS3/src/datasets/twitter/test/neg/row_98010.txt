Just not sure how to continue this cycle.I AM NOT A DOWN PERSON, AT LEAST I HAVEN'T BEEN. I KEEP THE ENERGY HIGH, KEEP THE HYPE UP, AND I PICK UP THOSE AROUND ME. 

So to give you a complete run down. The last decade has really kicked my ass and here is where I am at. 

  
Before we get to "you brought a lot of this on yourself" I know that. I just don't know how to get out of it. 

  
This last decade I have really fucked up my situation. 

Got my now WIFE pregnant early and dropped out of college to take care. 

I'm in debt 65k (student loans and other bad money decisions)

I'm in constant pain due to a back injury at the gym. Cant even put a sock on in the morning

I'm married but feel like my wife kind of resents me because of where we are financially and the lack of ability for us to (responsibly) have kids due to the lack of funding

wife and I dealt with a miscarriage.

I feel like my son is feeling a lot of the stresses to by lashing out at home

When I tell you I am living paycheck to paycheck. Its down to the penny.

Constant anxiety 

I've gained 70 pounds due to stress eating and not being able to work out due to the injury

got my car repo'd 

I'm fucking balding 

Took this stupid fing telesales job which can be lucrative but I am struggling might get fired due to performance and I commute an hour a day 

MOST IMPORTANTLY MY FAMILY THAT RAISED ME IS SLOWLY FADING DUE TO ILLNESS AND AGE.   


I'M NOT A WOE IS ME PERSON, I'M THE EMPATH. I HAVE PICKED PEOPLE UP AND HELPED THEM ON THEIR FEET. I FEEL LIKE I CAN NO LONGER BE POSITIVE. CANT TAKE MY OWN ADVICE.

I feel trapped, I feel alone.  


I have a non-profit in my area that helps kids in bad situations.My buddy and started it through urban arts and teaching these kids to take control. I CANT EVEN DO THIS MYSELF.   


I throw and host local events and I enjoy them but doesnt bring in any money so my wife isnt a fan with me doing it. Which I get in our current situation.  


I am tired.   


All I want to do is sit on the phone/watch tv all day. Every day is a bit harder to get up.   


I want to hit the reset button or not participate in the bull shit cycle of "LIFE" I am over it. I have people depending on me though, COULD I EVER REALLY END IT. PROBABLY NOT. BUT, LET ME SAY I HAVE NEVER FELT ANY CLOSER TO CONSIDERATION. 

IT MAY SOUND WEIRD THE KOBE SITUATION REALLY MADE TO STEP BACK FROM IT ALL THOUGH. BUT, REALITY SMACKED THAT MONDAY MORNING WITH A PERFORMANCE REVIEW ON MY DESK WHEN I GOT TO WORK.   


ANYBODY BEEN IN A SIMILAR SITUATION WHAT DID YOU DO ?
