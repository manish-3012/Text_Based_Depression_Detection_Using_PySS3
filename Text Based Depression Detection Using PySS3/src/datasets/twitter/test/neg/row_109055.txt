I'm giving upThere is nothing left here for me. I have no motivation, no energy, no hope. I'm so much of a disappointment and a waste of time.

 I wish more than anything I had killed myself years ago and spared everyone the burden of dealing with me. I'm so stupid and lazy. Hopefully tonight is the night I finally put and end to this pathetic life. 

Still here, but I wish I wasn't.
