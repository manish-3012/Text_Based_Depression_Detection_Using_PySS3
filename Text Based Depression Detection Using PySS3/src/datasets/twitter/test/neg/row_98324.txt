Need helpSome background I have bipolar aspergers adhd generalized anxiety disorder and ocd. My relationship with my mom is deteriorating, and suicide has been in the back of my mind for months now.

I'm home alone and I know where Ibuprofen is I want to take it, but I'm so scared of the psych ward that that's the only thing keeping me from taking it. I need someone to talk to. I just don't want to be miserable anymore.
