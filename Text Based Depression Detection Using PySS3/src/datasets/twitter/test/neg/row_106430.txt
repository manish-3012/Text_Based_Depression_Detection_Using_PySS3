I hate myselfNo other way of saying it other than that. Everytime I think about the future and being several months away from becoming an adult (I'm 17) and the goals I'm expected to fulfill and complete I just despise it with all my heart and soul. So many regrets,so many things I wish were different. I don't have a bad life,but my thoughts will kill me one day.
