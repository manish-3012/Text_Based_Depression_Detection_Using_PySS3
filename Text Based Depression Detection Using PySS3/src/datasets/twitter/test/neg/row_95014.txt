What does one do who has tried everything.I've done it all. I've cried, I've been to therapy, I've meditated. I've worked out, I've reached out, I've talked. Day after day, year after year. It doesn't get better. I feel like I will become one of the statistics that didn't make it. That didn't get to say it gets better. I can't do this anymore.
