After my latest stint in the ICU...I've decided to give up trying to overdose on medication (prescription and OTC). If you've been following my voyage it'll come to no surprise that I apparently can't die from medication overdoses. The latest was a combo of Welbutrin (30 @ 300mg each) and Adderall (30 @ 20mg each IR) within an hour. 

So it looks like the only other appealing form of suicide would be a good ole' slit of the wrists. I'm aware of the veins/arteries that need to be hit and where they're located. Will be using a scalpel so it will be a good, clean, deep cut. 

No intentions on doing it tonight, but my last day will be September 1st.
