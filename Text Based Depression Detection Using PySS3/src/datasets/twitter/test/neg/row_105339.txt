I will definetly put an end to this.Sadly it's 2019 and i am still alive.I was planning to end this pathetic charade before New Year's Eve but here i am.I made a promise to myself that on the 14th of January i'm definetly doing it.
I'm 18 and i don't even know when depression creeped up on me,i think it was around when I was 14 or so.It was painful all these years,having to put up a fake smile every single day when i was actually rotting inside.I have quite a lot of friends but i still feel alone and my "best friends" that i have known for like 8 years now started making fun of me for random things so probably me being gone won't affect them more than one week at max.The only thing that kept me alive these 4 stupid years was working out but now I feel so miserable that even working out doesn't help.
My parents will miss me but i did not ask to be born in this world so that makes me feel ok about hurting them.New Year's Eve was shit,even though i was with a bunch of friends i felt alone as always and i saw the girl i love the most hooking up with some random dude making me even sadder so i had to go outside and stay on a bench for 2 hours listening to some sad fucking song,crying all alone thinking "Why didn't i end it before?".At this point nothing i do brings a smile on my face.This is my end.
Sorry for writing in such disarrayed manner but i am not feeling really ok rn,if u want we can talk until the final day,i am still thinking of a good way of doing this,thinking of going on a trip to the mountains and cutting myself or hanging myself in a forest.What do you think?
