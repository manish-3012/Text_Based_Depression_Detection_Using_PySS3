On giving in to thoughtsIâ€™ve been wanting to OD since I was 13. Iâ€™m almost 16 and itâ€™s just getting worse. When it started it wasnâ€™t that bad. It was easy to distract myself and the thoughts were pretty infrequent. Now I canâ€™t get them out of my head. Things are much more complicated than that but the thoughts are what mainly bother me. A part of me wants to give in to make them stop.
