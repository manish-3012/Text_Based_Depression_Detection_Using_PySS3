I don't want to kill myself......I just wish I never existed in the first place. I'm sorry you ever had the misfortune of meeting me. I'm sorry I'm such a burden. A constant distraction from your happiness. If I could disappear without causing any impact on you, I wouldn't think twice. I just want to die and rot in secluded hole in the middle of no where, never to be found by anyone, or remembered by anyone, or be a concern for anyone ever again. I'm sorry. For everything.
