I just dont know who else to talk to. I just want to vent. (probably going to be very long)Hey everyone. Never thought I'd end up on here...but here I am. I just need to get my words out before I go insane. 

I don't even know where to start. I'm a 23/M, and I want this all to end, for real. 

I've been feeling like this on and off for about 10 years. My first suicidal thoughts started when I was in 7th grade (~2007), and I've had a few breaks from it, but they always come back harder and harder. I'm starting to have really bad thoughts and I can't focus on anything. My manager at work has had to talk to me about my performance. I really think that if my brother wasnt a manager there, I'd be out. (Yeah, can't find a job on my own. Nepotism has gotten me pretty much every job I've ever had.. lol)

 I don't mean to get too intense here, but I have recurring thoughts of blowing my face off with a shotgun.  I can almost feel the *bang* go through my body, and sometimes it makes me cringe.  Thats not how I want to go, though. Something a little more peaceful. It's an image in my head that is stuck on repeat. Like a song stuck in my head. 

I always struggled in school ever since I can remember. I was put on medication to try and help me focus, but it just made me feel sick. All through my childhood I had to take all these mental tests, I had to go to speech therapy because I couldnt talk right (I still have trouble pronouncing some words) and I had to see a doctor all the time,  so she can ask my mom how I've been doing in school. If I wasnt doing well, they would up the dose on my medication.. I think it was ritalin or something like that. 

 I was almost left back in 7th grade, and I barely made it out of highschool. I tried to go to college (4 times), but always flunked out. Now, I get to watch everybody I graduated high school with go be succesful people. I just ran into an old friend, actually. He's an accountant in NYC. Another is now shooting music videos for an artist I wont tell, but you've heard of him/her.

Now, I was lead here because I feel like I'm breaking down again. After 6 years working jobs I HATE, I thought I had it figured out. I decided on a whim I was going to take a flying lesson, and I was hooked. I started going back for more, and I actually started to take it seriously. I felt happy, and in control. Like everything was going to be okay. It gave me a break from my head for about a year. I studied for almost a year about weather, aircraft performance, how airplanes work, etc. I really, really wanted to be a pilot(scary, huh? I can't belive I actually thought that was going to happen..I feel humiliated that I even thought I could be a pilot..It was a good distraction though). I was in love with the idea. I have many books about planes, I watched every video on youtube,and I even got to fly solo in the airplane I was training in. Life was good. I was so happy I found what I *really* loved to do.

 Well, I just found out I wont be able to fly anymore because of a few disqualifying medical conditions (both mental and physical) and  I honestly feel I've been seriously crushed. I really feel that this was the tipping point for me. All the thousands of dollars I've spent. All the countless hours studing and putting my heart and my soul into flying.. all for nothing. Now I'm stuck at home, broke,  living with my parents, making almost minimum wage working a job I *hate*. 

On top of that, I cant keep a relationship. Every girl I ever get involved with loses intrest SO quick and bails. I'm severely under weight, everything is a mess and I really just don't have any energy left. I'm spent. I dont know how much longer I can stand to get out of bed and go to work. I just cant stop crying and thinking about how long it's going to be before I pull the trigger. I just feel like a pathetic, dumb person, and I honestly have NO reason to think otherwise. I have nothing to show for anything. It's hard to look anyone in the eye, because I just feel so embarassed to be me. I feel like actual scum.

 Now, its not immenent, I know that, because I refuse to kill myself in my parents home. That just aint right. I'd have to get a place of my own, sell my stuff, say goodbye to everyone for the last time, and check out. Thats gonna take some planning. 

I'm way too afraid to go see a therapist(I cant even make eye contact with another person) and I don't want to reach out to anyone. I don't think they would take it seriously/wouldnt understand

I really dont know what I'm going to do. It's hell in my head, and I want out. In all seriousness, thinking about death is the only thing that brings me peace right now. 

This is the only place I felt comfortable talking about this. I'm sorry if I went off too much, but I needed to get it out.  

All the best to all of you, and if you actually read this.. you da bomb
