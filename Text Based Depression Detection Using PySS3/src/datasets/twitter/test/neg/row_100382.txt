I am so tiredI don't really know what else to do. I haven't really gotten anyone that I can talk to. I keep mentalizing sticking a pocket knife deep in my arm. I tried talking to my girlfriend, but everytime I try talking to her it ends up becoming a terrible argument. I'm in a really bad place and I tend to be more direct when talking to people when I am like that. But she says I'm being rude and that she doesn't deserve to be treated that way, she has already a lot on her plate and her own problems. I don't understand what way I'm treating her that is so negative. I don't know how to communicate with her without her getting mad at me or sad. I really don't know what to do anymore and I don't have anyone else. I just want this pain to go away, this agony. I haven't stopped crying for 3 days now and tomorrow I have to go to university and I don't know how I'm going to make it. My masters is draining me. My advisors are literally just that on a paper, they overlooked a small mistake I (and 2 other students!) made that made me lose a whole year of work, just like that. I am literally racing against time now and I am just having a really bad time dealing with this. I can't focus. I've been on zoloft for over a month now and it hasn't really helped much. And the longer I take to be productive, the more anxious I get and eventually depressed. I am utterly useless. I am so tired of everything, I just wanted a break, you know? Something to break through the agony. Both. I can't deal with all of it anymore. I'm tired of the discussions, of the anxiety, of having to live with my parents in order to finish my fucking masters. My parents who find every little thing to complain about me and my father, who is always always right and completely unable to deal with anger. And I'm tired of having to stay closeted while I live here because I wouldn't be able to stand it anymore if they got worse with their homophobic comments. If they targeted them at me.

And why you know? Why keep on going through all this? I won't kill myself, but it surely is very tempting. I'd probably make everyone's lives much easier. Nobody really cares about me anyway, except for my dogs. And well, I can't leave my dogs alone.
