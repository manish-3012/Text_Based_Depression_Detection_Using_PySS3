donâ€™t know what to domy boyfriend just got taken away by paramedics and I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with him but seeing him in so much pain made me want to scream and itâ€™s bringing back old memories of my dad dying and I donâ€™t want him to die, I just want him to be okay, and I couldnâ€™t go with him because of my stupid ass job and I tried to call my sister about it and all she did was make me feel worse because every time I call her she just has to find something I did wrong and belittle me the entire time and my boyfriend is the only person in real life that cares about me and if he isnâ€™t okay or if he dies I swear to god Iâ€™m going to just blow my brains out because Iâ€™m fucking tired of everyone I care about dying!! he was perfectly fine today, why couldnâ€™t he just stay fine! Iâ€™m so fucking stressed now I donâ€™t know what to do with myself
