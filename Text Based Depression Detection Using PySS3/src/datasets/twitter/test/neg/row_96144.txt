Crazy ? Anyone else?I'm 17. I have had a very troubled life ever since my parents died in 9/11. Since then I was raised by my uncle, who has never taken care of a child, and often just gets up and leaves. I am crazy. The things I've done... I've driven 2 cars of bridges, I've almost tried to fight a bear, I killed my neighbours cat with my skateboard, ect. All I the hopes I would receive some kind of punishment. Or some attention at least. But no. So now, I'm making this text on a bridge, one side, a busy freeway, the other, a freezing cold river. God help me.
