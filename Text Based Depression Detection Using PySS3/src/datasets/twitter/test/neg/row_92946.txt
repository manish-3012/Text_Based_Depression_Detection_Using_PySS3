Anxiety is preventing me from living the life I want to live, don't know how to speak up and get the help I want, don't see any other way out, can't bare to continue life like thisI've lived with severe anxiety my whole life, now I'm in my mid-20s it feels worse than it's ever been. Only very recently was I even able to do anything about it, I managed to stump up the courage to talk to my GP about it who promptly referred me for CBT which has been useless and I believe has only worsened my problems.

I am constantly unable to do the things I want to do; working on the dreams I aspire to, going in a shop to buy something I want, talking about how I'm feeling, trying to meet people of the opposite sex I'm attracted to, I struggle with all of these things immensely. The idea of someone thinking of me in good or bad light makes me feel extremely nervous, sometimes to the point of tears, and anything that I know is going to bring this up becomes extremely difficult. If I could live a life without this degree of anxiety I'm convinced the vast majority of my problems would disappear in an instant. I keep hearing that 'there's help' but I don't think most of the anxiety help services I've tried to use are very outreaching which is something anxiety sufferers desperately need, and when I have managed to get my voice out there it seems I'm either asking in the wrong places or nobody is listening. I have no clue how to get the help I need, I feel like several years of 'things will get better' with nothing ever changing is enough, and recently I resolved to end my own life. Unsurprisingly, my anxiety-fuelled procrastination has held me back in this regard. I haven't been able to get it together and actually do the deed, as much as I want to.

I don't think I'm clinically depressed, I'm just sick of this and don't see the point in living a life where I am hamstrung by my own irrational beliefs that I can't control, and all I can do is watch any potential I have to live a good life wither away, so why bother living 50 more years of mundanity when I can just end it now?
