I want to end it. I keep planning it. I keep remembering it will hurt. I keep remembering that the chance of failure is really high. I am stuck. I hate this existence. I want it to end. How do I end this pain?There's no answer for me. I'm a borderline, everyone hates us. Our attempts to get help and comfort make people angry. I want to end this tragedy already. Why am I still alive? Why is life stringing me along like this?
