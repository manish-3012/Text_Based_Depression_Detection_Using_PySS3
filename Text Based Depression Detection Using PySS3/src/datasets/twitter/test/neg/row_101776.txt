Sometimes I wonder if my family would careI'm not gonna attempt suicide or self harm or whatever but sometimes I just think of scenarios of how my family would react if I actually killed myself. I feel like a burden to them and I feel like the only people who actually love me are my mom, uncle, and sister. The rest just don't seem to really give a shit about me. Hell my dad even said (when I wasn't around obviously) I remind him of his bipolar ex. It still bothers me to this day and I just think about this a lot.
