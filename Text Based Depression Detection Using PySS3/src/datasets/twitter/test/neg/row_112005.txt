I can't stand my college.My sophomore year of high school I lived in a large city that I had been in for 14 years. Great friends, great area, I loved it. Then my mom gets a job in a small suburb in a different state. I instantly hated it and became depressed within a year and still am. I'm in college now in the same state and I fucking hate this place. I haven't passed a single test yet because I'm so fucking depressed I can't get the motivation to study for longer than 30 minutes. I'm an accounting major and I want to transfer out of here to a school in my home state where I have more friends but if my grades don't get better I'd have to go into liberal arts which my parents won't allow. If I'm stuck here for 3 more years I'm just going to fucking put a bullet in my head. My mother keeps telling me it's not that bad but she doesn't understand it's a hell of a lot different for a teenager than an adult. I want out and I'm afraid I'll be trapped here and if I am I don't think I'll make it past the summer
