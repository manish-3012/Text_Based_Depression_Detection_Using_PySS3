Hey it's me. Just me.Hello. I'm 26 years old. I'm a person that doesn't like to leave the house, I don't want to meet people, I'm a loner for my whole life. I'm working in an hospital as a male nurse, but I really hate it. I hate the flashy life, the loud noises. I just want to decay here in my bed...  I'm in this state for years now... I don't have any ambition to anything... I'm just waiting every evening in hope that I can rest forever. I never tried to kill myself actively. I would never do. I like to slowly decay and waste away... Most of the times at home I'm crying when I realize i have to go out soon. It's so much Pain, can't handle it at all... I feel imprisoned in my self and in this life.
