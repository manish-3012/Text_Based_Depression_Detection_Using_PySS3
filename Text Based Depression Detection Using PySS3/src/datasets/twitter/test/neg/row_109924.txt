I dont feel comfortable reaching out to others for help but talking to someone is what i truly wantideally, i want to talk to a close friend whos known me for a long time. no therapists, no teachers, no parents, i want someone that im comfortable talking with. i did open up to my best, closest friend that ive known forever and i told him that im fine now and he understands that i dont want him to look at me differently and he accepts that. however, i dont want him to worry about me bcuz that would just add more stress in both my life and his life. i have other close friends to open up to but i dont feel ready to tell them how ive been lately and i really just wanna talk to a close friend. should i just straight up tell them how ive been feeling or should i start casual and gradually shift the convo towards the topic of suicide?
