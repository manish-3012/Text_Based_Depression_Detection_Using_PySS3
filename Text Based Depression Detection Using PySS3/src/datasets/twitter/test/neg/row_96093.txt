Whats the Point of Living or the Rat Race?Roger Moore was James Fucking Bond.

Handsome, Tall, Well Built.

Rich, Famous, Tons of Beautiful Women.

He won the Rat Race.

And where is he now?

He is 6 feet under rotting.

I see so many people everyday trying to achieve a life of success, wealth, luxury

and meaning in jobs and materialistic things.

But Roger had all of that and it didnt save him in the end.

And even though His Name is remembered, no one really gives a shit about him

People have moved on so fast after his death.

It was all for nothing.

All the studying, working, chasing women, chasing success, it

is just vanity, a dog chasing after it car, it is meaningless in the end.

I dont understand why people are so evil, nasty and cut throat.

In the end it doesnt matter.

This life is just a competition to reproduce, acquire resources, chase dopamine hits then die.

It is meaningless. It was meaningless for Roger.

What makes you think it would be meaningful to you? 

What will you gain by winning the Rat Race?

You will just be a Big Successful Rat in the end and then die like a fool.

People need to get their pirorities straight and stop pestering me to chase after meaningless shit

when I am suicidal and have no desire for temporal shallow solid things which will maldfunction and rot in the future.
