Feeling lonely but am I?Iâ€™m 24 years old. And Iâ€™ve never had a romantic relationship. Not because Iâ€™m ugly or anything. Itâ€™s just never happened. And I feel so alone. I feel lonely but then I ask myself why because I have a group of friends whom I hang out with relatively often. Probably 2-3 a week. So how can I feel alone with people around me. 

Grouped with this, and the fact my dads health is declining. My health is declining. I feel lost in where Iâ€™m going in life. I have been diagnosed by two separate doctors with dystemia. I just want to kill myself. Literally only thing keeping me alive is knowing that I canâ€™t leave my mom alone should something happen to my dad. I just canâ€™t. Sheâ€™d go homeless. This past week and a half have been extremely hard. I think about killing myself every moment of life now but I donâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to feel like this. 

Pretty much Iâ€™m asking, is it normal to feel lonely even though you surround yourself with people (and those relationships arenâ€™t petty or meaningless). I feel stupid feeling lonely.
