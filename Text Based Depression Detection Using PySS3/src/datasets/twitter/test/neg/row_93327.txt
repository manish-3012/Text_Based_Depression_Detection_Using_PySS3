tiredI'm fifteen. I go to school every day. I'm a happy person. I love making my friends smile. I love making my teachers smile. People have told me my happiness is contagious. I always ask my friends how they're doing more than once throughout the day. No one ever really does the same for me.

I go to therapy. I have a psychiatrist. My doctor knows about my history with suicide and drug abuse. Yet it seems like all of the people I go to for my mental health have bigger worries. There's always someone else who has it "worse", and I don't understand that. I just want to scream and cry and shout at them. Why can't they see how much I'm suffering? Just because someone can't contain it as well as I can, how does that make them any more at risk than me?

I frequently self harm. I'm addicted to nicotine and I have been addicted to worse in the past. I haven't gone a single day in years without thinking of killing myself. I've attempted to kill myself some 30 odd times in 2018, and so far two times in 2019. My parents don't understand, and I don't mean that in an "edgy teenager" way, I mean my parents have walked in on me attempting suicide and have done nothing. They brush my actions under the rug with "she wants attention" or "she's just being a typical teenager".

Nobody understands. Seriously. No one understands. I've tried to talk to people, I've tried to talk to my friends, but every time I do, they look at me differently and treat me differently. I've tried to talk to my social worker. She doesn't understand because on the outside, I'm "happy and carefree".

I'm just so tired. Nobody sees how bad it is. When I'm finally dead, I know everyone is going to think that they could have done more. And the truth is they fucking could have.

I'm exhausted.
