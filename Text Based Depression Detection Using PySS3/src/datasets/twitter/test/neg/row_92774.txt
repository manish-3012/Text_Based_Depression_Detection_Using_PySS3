I hope you have a great day todayToday I want you to get up and iron your favorite shirt and pair of pants and just smell the scent of coffee in the air. Do a few pushups as many as you can and donâ€™t be ashamed if you canâ€™t to any. Wash the dirt off your face and eat a nice breakfast. take a nice warm long shower and and start your day off nicely. 

Remember a bad experience is the difference in a good day and a bad day. But a bad day and a good day is the difference between a good life and a bad life. Donâ€™t stress about pointless things because in the end what has stressing done for you.

I hope you have a great day and remember that at least one person in this world loves and cares for you. If you ever need to talk to someone then feel free to message me I will happily talk to you.
