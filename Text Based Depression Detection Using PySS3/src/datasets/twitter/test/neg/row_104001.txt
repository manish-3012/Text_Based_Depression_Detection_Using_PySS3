Scared (idk how to describe) of 2020Not really belonging here... or maybe? idk, sorry, Iâ€™m tired yet canâ€™t seem to sleep.

I see everyone excited for 2020 as in "new decade, new me, new goals", even more different than just "another year, another resolution" thing.
But really itâ€™s past 2 am and Iâ€™ve been somehow convinced that getting into 2020 will kill me. As in video games or movies, like , "enter this room and you will die instantly", same thing, but for 2020. I have no idea why but this makes it that I have to kill myself before that. Which is totally stupid because if I should die anyway then why not wait the last moment aka when life/2020 will kill me and not "me killing myself" ?

I havenâ€™t been suicidal lately, or should I say "have been but from far away"? I guess I donâ€™t want to die "actively", but Iâ€™m stuck between "no hope" and "eh maybe hope but like no but maybe weâ€™ll see". Iâ€™ve been home for 3+ years now doing nothing and recently got diagnosed as autistic, and I guess Iâ€™ve been hiding behind that as an excuse to hide/do nothing for a bit longer and stay in my confort zone without having everyone yelling at me that I should find a job and such. My parents (canâ€™t say "and myself", I donâ€™t do anything, I canâ€™t bring myself to "care" and/or figure out how to do anything without crying), so, theyâ€™ve been "working their way out" to get me a disability,,, thing,, help, idk the English name?
like, being recognized as disabled I guess, and I guess I had found hope in that as in I would have this as a help both for money and helping me find an adequate job and such. But really now Iâ€™m just back to thinking that Iâ€™m a burden to everyone and I wonâ€™t ever be able to achieve anything as I never did, and Iâ€™ll just stay at my parentsâ€™ forever watching YouTube and eating or sleeping all day, all of that using their hard earned money while I donâ€™t do shit. So, yeah, I donâ€™t know if the fact that "2020 will kill me" came from that and my stupid ass brain transformed it into "actually, physically dying, disappearing woo lol" or whatever.
OD urges are strong plus I know that downstairs we have a shitload of different painkillers (stuff like opium and a bunch of others) because both my parents got surgery/might need to soon so they were given this. The only thing keeping me from taking them all is that, if, they, are in pain later (aka what they were originally given them for), they wonâ€™t be able to use them, and in the first place they belonged to them so like, I just canâ€™t do that to them.
I also wanna drink but I canâ€™t because the only things I drink arenâ€™t stuff they drink so itâ€™s like leftover from years ago like from parties and they wonâ€™t rebuy it so I canâ€™t take more of it because they will notice at some point. I keep telling myself I should buy more/by myself but itâ€™s so expensive and I have barely any money because I spent it all on binging haha what a fucking idiot.
Idk this is more like a stupid useless long ass rant, but I just donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m feeling atm??? Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m scared of what will happen in 2020 and donâ€™t want to see, but I also kinda want to see because maybe thereâ€™s hope, but I donâ€™t want to suffer and most of all make people suffer and keep me as a burden for so long again, and I donâ€™t want to kill myself for multiples reasons (which are all like, either stuff releasing (music, videos, science progress, traveling etc) and guilt tripping myself into missing them; and that I canâ€™t bring myself to clean my whole room and all so that they donâ€™t find anything cringy/I lied about/fucked up(...) and that I canâ€™t escape from being dead yet "seeing them (like from above) going through my stuff and laughing at me all together because itâ€™s so embarrassing, fucked up and things they just didnâ€™t know about but definitely knew I was fucked up and just waited for this moment", but I guess I also want to die to get this finally over with and stop this endless, years-long rollercoaster of:
disappointment,
sad,
insane
OH, hope!!! ??dude maybe life is gr- oh wait no lol.
suicidal,
burden,
useless,
hope??! ah fuck, no, still the same.
fucked up,
,,not even human???

Iâ€™ve been reminiscing all the school classes I skipped, how I havenâ€™t been able to go through the first year, even the first 2 months of high school when I was a "great" student all along before that, all the hospitalizations Iâ€™ve had since then, all the therapists, the meds, the yelling, the crying, the reminders of abuse everywhere everytime, the self harm, the eating disorders, everything seems so exhausting just to think of and so fucking sad and awful and making me feel guilty for just being so fucked up. Itâ€™s all like, we/I did all of this and it got me nowhere, just wasting peopleâ€™s time, money... my dad fucking paid 800â‚¬+ or maybe even like, 1000, 1500, what the fuck do I know? for the diagnosis. Like. How can you not fucking cry at this.
I just donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m saying nor why even and this is long and useless and I didnâ€™t mean to do that at first Iâ€™m sorry.
I just want to say that, I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m writing so maybe I kinda already mentioned it but I hope I donâ€™t make it look like the diagnosis is also an issue, like when I say my dad paid for it etc.
The diagnosis might be the only "good" thing that has ever happened to me; I was talking about all the shit around it/before getting to it.
I donâ€™t even know if words I put together make sense; which, is also sad and embarrassing like everything  else I do.
Iâ€™ve been listening to ASMR/having it as a background for the past two hours because I canâ€™t sleep and I keep repeating the video once itâ€™s over, or even a bit before because even the few seconds of silence where the video stops are too fucking hard to deal with, so let alone turning the light off and trying to sleep. Iâ€™m trying so hard not to cry (spoiler: by the end I finished writing I already was) and scream and Iâ€™m tired but I canâ€™t sleep, Iâ€™m sorry, Iâ€™m so fucking lost
