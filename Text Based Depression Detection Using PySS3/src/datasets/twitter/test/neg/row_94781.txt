back again... so lost and tired of the fight.I keep going in this cycle:

1. bad shit happens

2. get sick enough to do something about it.

3. good shit starts to happen.

5. everything falls apart as soon as things start looking up, despite my best efforts.

6. rinse and repeat.



I feel like I'm fighting a pointless battle, and that any victory is Pyrrhic as best. I'm so sick and tired of not being good enough; of coming so close only to fail, of being so damn useless and feeling so damn powerless.

relationships are few and far between, and they never work out. I've been unemployed for the last year, and my last job was a part time seasonal gig that interrupted an eighteen month stint of nothing. 

I'm 22 years old. I should be a Fucking college senior or looking at picking up sergeant, not being a fucking loser who lives off the charity of friends and family.

I have nothing left to lose, but I'm not really gaining any ground either. I'm a burden to those around me, barely pulling my own weight. the lowest common denominator in our problems is ourselves. I've done everything I really know how to do, and I've gotten nowhere, so why not just remove myself from the equation and make this easier for everybody?

yes, I'd be letting the bad guys in my life win, but this isn't a fucking storybook, this is real life where the bad guys win all the time. what's one more casualty among the masses?

I'm so tired of fighting, so tired of Coming so close, only to lose it all. What's the point?

if suicide is murder, then I've certainly got means, motive and opportunity. I'm alone in the shower and have been drinking. I'm armed with a knife, loads of booze, and guns. and I'm just sick of myself.
