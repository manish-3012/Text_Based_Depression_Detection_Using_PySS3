What's the point anymore.I just don't care anymore whether I love or die. The love of my life is gone. My will to live is gone. I'm in over $60k in school debt, I've been fired from my job, and I can't find a new one. I have no more will to live anymore. I can't take it. I know I have amazing friends and family and the only thing stopping me from ending my life is not hurting them.  I'm emotionally dead and gone. If I were to just to just end it today I wouldn't even care anymore. I can on my oh hope every day that I don't wake up and every time I do wake up I get more and more disappointed.
