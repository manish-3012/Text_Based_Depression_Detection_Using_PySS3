Will you just keep getting more hopeless until you finally bring yourself to do it?Iâ€™ve been â€žsadâ€œ since elementary school. I never had a friend that I could fully trust and was always quite lonely. Last year, however, I tried really hard to be happy despite all this, but the way through which I was able to achieve this deceitful happiness was to stop caring about anything and only focusing on things I liked.
But in the last two weeks my life has just spiraled back into a crushing hole that I find myself to be unable to come out of. 
I tried talking to my friends but it didnâ€™t help.
Now, the question is, is there really any point in going on if every joy I have, will be overwhelmed by a depression, thatâ€™s even worse than the last one?
Will I just keep growing more lonely and detached and desperate?
Will I even be able to commit suicide or instead just rot as a living corpse?
â€œItâ€™s better to burn out than to fade awayâ€ is probably truer than I thought...
