Im helpless, private video and pictures leakedHelp me please, I don't know where to go. I'm having nightmares and suicidal thoughts. I don't know if I can go on wth this life any longer. I feel hopeless. To make this story short. A while ago, someone I trusted would do a terrible thing to me. He was a friend of a few years. Just a friend and he knew nothing more would come of it. There will be no romantic relationship. I explained it to him on many different occasions that I felt nothing for him. I knew he had feelings for me, but I told him he was like a brother to me. Eventually I met someone and started to work and concentrate on different things in life. Our paths diverged. Then he finally realized it was over. Some time later, he posted my intimate photos and videos that I had with my first boyfriend. It turned out he  was stealing the material from my computer systematically, which I had no idea of. Maybe he did it while he was fixing my computer on ocassions.
He created fake profiles on various dating and pornographic websites. He posted my videos on different sites. He wanted it to look like I was doing it. There were attacks on me, stalking, slut shaming, bullying.
I was afraid I'll never have normal life, a job, friends...
I had noone around me who would help me. 
I had to deal with it on my own. I went to the police but thy did nothing. The policeman even said that I have nothing to worry about because even if he is not caught, people will envy me. 8 years have passed and I still can't handle it. I trusted the wrong person. Maybe I shouldn't have made these movies with my boyfriend in the first place, but he asked me to do it and we were together for several years. I didn't see anything that wrong in it. I was young and 
I never have thought people could be so cruel.  Maybe it was a mistake but I will not turn back the time.I can't do it anymore. I'm weak. please help
I still blame myself.
