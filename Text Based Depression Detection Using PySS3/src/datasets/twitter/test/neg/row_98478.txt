Rejected after a job interview, there's nothing left for meI currently work in fast food at fucking 25 years old. I tried college and I'm not even halfway to a useless associate's degree. Never had a girlfriend, haven't had friends since middle school. Have my driver's license but completely terrified to drive on anything more than simple 2-lane roads or dirt roads. Debilitating social anxiety that prevents me from even grabbing some food/snacks from convenience stores, so I eat whatever's at home because I can't communicate with a fucking cashier. 

 I tried one last time to apply to an entry-level position into a field I thought I was decent at, but I got the rejection email yesterday. I have severe social anxiety and I've always struggled in school and in life in general, so I'm sure me fucking up during the interview was the reason for that. 

The sad part about all of this is that my parents would just let me leech off them in the basement till I'm 40. I can't do it though, I cannot stand being a burden any longer and watching my younger siblings achieve great things. I've never been this close to ending it all and I never thought I'd be this type of person. I need some type of guidance that my parents never gave me, I want to be a normal functioning adult for once and if I can't, this is the end of the road for me.
