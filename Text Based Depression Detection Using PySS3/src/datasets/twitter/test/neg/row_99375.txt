Is mass suicide ideal?Im not sure how to express this correctly, but i am going to try anyways bc i think it may be important. My whole life i've been very into human rights and trying to do my absolute best for humanity, but ive also always suffered from suicidal ideation and mental illness. I know that everyone suffers, and all i ever want is to try my best to end suffering. Since living inherently comes with suffering, the only way to completely avoid it is to stop living. im willing to answer questions about this thought of mine since it may help me understand the thought itself better. Thanks
