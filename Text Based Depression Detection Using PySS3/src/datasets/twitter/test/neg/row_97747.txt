I feel like not taking my medication and sitting in a bathtub until I have a seizure and drownI can't get it off my mind I'm so fucking lonely. I want to get off work so badly to come home, and I don't do anything. Everything I enjoyed is just boring. I feel like just getting home, get stoned and go to bed until tomorrow to repeat.

It's a never ending circle and who the fuck cares about me nothing would change if I were gone, I doubt anyone would even show up for my funeral, and if they did they probably just felt obligated to go.
