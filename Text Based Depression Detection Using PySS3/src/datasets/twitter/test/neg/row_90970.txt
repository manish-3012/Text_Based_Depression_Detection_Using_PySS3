I've been really thinking about doing itSo a lot has been going on. My mom died, my dad got a new gf way too soon, I just hate my life. And the icing on the cake is boy troubles.

I really like this guy. He has a gf and is 10 yrs older than me, so I don't really think he sees me that way. But we had sex a while back and I've felt guilty.

I also am just jealous of whoever gets to know him. I wish I could know everything about him. We have this other friend that hes really close with. They text late, she knows more about him. I wish I could get to know him better.

Then I realized maybe I dont like him that way. Maybe I just really want to be his friend. I really just want to be anybody's friend. I have friends, but not close enough to talk about this stuff obviously. I've never known anyone deeply. I've never had anyone that shares everything or want to know things about me. I've never had that best friend that we do everything together. If my family died, I would have no one. I can't reach out to anyone.

I own a gun and have just been really imagining myself doing it. I feel so empty. I don't see a reason to live. I try to come up with reasons but they're all stupid, like pizza, dogs whatever. What is the point if I can't make a connection with anybody. I have so much emotional turmoil and I can't take it anymore. I'm so tired. And it doesnt help that I can't get this man out of my mind for whatever reason. My mom isn't here to keep me company when my dad is out on dates. I'm all by myself and have so many chances to do it. But it would kill him. Idk. Life is terrible.
