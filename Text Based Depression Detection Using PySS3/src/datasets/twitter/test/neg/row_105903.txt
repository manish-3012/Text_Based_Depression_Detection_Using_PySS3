I donâ€™t feel safe with myself anymoreI just canâ€™t trust myself, Iâ€™m 14 years old so I guess I shouldnâ€™t feel this way given Iâ€™m too young to even know what a tough life is but a few days ago I almost threw myself off a big rock into a lake to kill myself. Just 10 minutes ago I was clawing at my leg and sobbing from the pain but wouldnâ€™t stop. Iâ€™ve talked to people, I have the numbers. Nothing helps. All I want to do is end it and it gets so fucking hard sometimes. I know for a fact my parents wouldnâ€™t understand, theyâ€™ve always had such a loose grasp on mental illness and my step parents arenâ€™t any better. Whenever Iâ€™m walking from my bus stop to my house I make sure to stand right by the blind spot for a few seconds hoping someone turns the corner and ends me, Iâ€™ve tired drowning myself but gave up because I canâ€™t go through with fucking anything. When Iâ€™m home alone Iâ€™ll just sit in my kitchen holding a knife to my stomach, head or throat and just think. I have the best sleep after having a dream where I kill myself. I feel like at this point Iâ€™m just a ticking time bomb, only a few people have ever gotten through to me enough to get me to talk and I rarely mention more than just me cutting myself or me wanting to die, I donâ€™t mention the attempts or all the times Iâ€™ve written down plans to kill myself. My latest plan was foiled by my own doubts (the throwing myself off a rock one). I stood looking over the edge for a few minutes to calm myself and prepare myself but couldnâ€™t go through with it because I didnâ€™t want to traumatize the girls I was camping with (was at a TH camp) ,didnâ€™t want one of my leaders to risk their lives to save me because I donâ€™t deserve it and I didnâ€™t want to accidentally just permanently paralyzed myself or something. This is just something Iâ€™ve needed to get off my chest I guess, thanks for listening/reading.
