I can't do anything right at allI cannot do this anymore. I have failed every single one of my classes, and i donâ€™t know how to fix anything. I've gotten a zero on math, got below-passing levels for almost every other subject, and I can't fix this. I am a total mess, and because of me failing my classes I had given up to having an idea of a successful future, I'm not sure i will even be able to attend any colleges or universities. My parents won't bother listening to me, they just keep on repeating the same thing over and over again, how i'm being a total dumbass and how I should be able to focus on my work, but I just can't. I can't focus on one single thing without getting bored or distracted, therefore I can't do anything right. I tried therapy for 5 months now, but to be honest, it got me nowhere. I can't do anything correct, I've lost both trust and respect of my parents, because of some stupid crap i did before, I'm failing school, i'm scared that I won't have any future, and I cannot rely on my friends either, since to the ones I've told my issues to won't help, and the others, well I just do not trust them enough. I try telling myself that ending it won't do any good, but I just don't see any ways that I can fix it. I'm trying my best to keep the bad thoughts of ending it as far as I can, but these thoughts keep resurfacing more and more nowadays, since I have been losing everything I loved or cared for.
