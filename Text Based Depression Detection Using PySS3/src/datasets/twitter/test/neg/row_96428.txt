TiredFuck my friends, fuck my family, there's nothing holding me back but 3 failed attempts.
Maybe that means I don't want to actually do it..
I don't know I'm drunk but I hope my liver gives out or my lungs.
I'm fucked.
But it gets worse and I get that it's tiring everyday, even when someone cares for you deeply.
I feel like it gets worse because some one cares for you it makes the escape harder.
Fuck do I want to blow my brains out but I can't because of her, I know that's not the case for everyone but lurker brothers/sisters like me understand, it might get better.
Listen I'm on the verge but it hurts me to see you fucked up just as I was and not give a chance.
It's okay to hurt just know it may get better.
Sorry if this isn't an attempt or I void the rules I'm just tired like the rest, I just don't know where to go and I'm hurting.
