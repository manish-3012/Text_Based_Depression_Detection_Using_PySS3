Numb now.Enough is enough. Life isnâ€™t fun, it isnâ€™t joyous or amazing. It is hard, horrible and cruel. My partner doesnâ€™t want me, my kids are happier when theyâ€™re not with me, my income has suffered enormously in the last few years and my debts are out of control. 

I think about dying all day, every day. Every morning I wake up Iâ€™m disappointed that I havenâ€™t died in my sleep. I think about ways to kill myself all of the time. 

The single thing that keeps me from taking my life is that Iâ€™m a total fucking coward. 

I have attempted suicide on several occasions but always lost my bottle. Iâ€™m a pussy. 

Iâ€™ve felt this way for around four years now. If I found a way that was painless, quick and not too messy for those who had to deal with it I would do it right now. The guilt I feel over what happens after makes me want to do it more. 

Iâ€™m a piece of shit. Always have been. Iâ€™ve slept with good friends girlfriends,  cheated, lied, stolen, hurt people etc etc. My funeral would be attended by less than 20 people and most of them only because they share my surname. 

So, my final possibility list is as follows :


Drive on a motorway as fast as I can without a seatbelt on and drive directly into a bridge base. 

A lot of strong sedatives and an exit bag. 

Jump from Beachy Head (I live nearby)


The third is my least favourite as I donâ€™t have the courage to do it. 

Sedatives and an exit bag are my current top choice. 

Anyway, just unloading some thoughts.
