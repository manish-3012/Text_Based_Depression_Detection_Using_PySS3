My brother died 8 years ago today. It still hurts just as much as the day it happened.As the title states, today marks the 8th anniversary of my older brother's death. He was 19 and I was barely 17. I'm now 25. I'm now old enough to look back and realize that I really didn't know shit about life when I was 19, although I would have sworn I knew everything.

Life has its ups and it has its downs. Just know that even when feeling your shittiest, you'll soon be feeling so good that you'll think you were a fool for ever feeling so bad.

Also, it might not be obvious, but your presence is more important in the people around you than you think.
