I'm scared please help meHey so, this is kind of difficult to discuss but i guess ill give it a shot. I'm 17 years old, and for about 9 years i grew up with a heavily building amount of depression and anxiety. Ive tried to end my life at least twice and was recently admitted to a hospital for almost a week. For so many years ive tried to fix myself but nothing works. Im always falling into these dark moods where i lose control of myself and it feels like someone else is making me do things and say stuff (No im not talking about ghosts). I feel lost and scared. I dont know what to do. Im scared to talk to people about this stuff thinking that theyll hate me. And i think this because its happened before. Please if someone can help.....
