Chronic pain, controlling familyI've lost my faith a while ago, family still controls me and forces me to go to church. I fucking hate it. I am in so much pain all the time and it hurts so much to do anything. My grandmother accused me of using the pain as an excuse! I have never, ever done that. I'm going to kill myself now
