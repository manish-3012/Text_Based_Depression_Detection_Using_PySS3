I think I finally have enough courage.I'm sitting in my closet right now, with a noose around my neck... 
I have had a decent life. No abuse. No trauma. Just depression that makes being alive such a fucking chore. I've become numb... I fuck up relationships and let friends and family drift away. I wanted to kill myself since as long as I can remember, even when I had no business knowing what suicide actually meant. I just didn't want to get older than 25.

I have never self-harmed... I have never tried to kill myself before... nor did I rely on drugs and alcohol.
But I grew up thinking I can't talk to anyone about feelings, being a guy. And I took that to an extreme. Im the happy guy. Never fights with anyone. Never looks for trouble... but goddamn am I a fucking mess. 
I've been to a doctor and am on anti-depressants. It has its ups and downs... but it's not enough

The fact that my Mom says I'm all she has doesn't even bother me anymore.... people will move on. They always do. It's a mission just to get friends to make plans with me... then they cancel or change plans without a second thought. 

Today I find out I essentially failed a subject that cost R24 000( +-1942) USD over two years to do. Which I needed to get good marks for to get into University. 
Im already 2/3 years late with University and my dream of becoming a paramedic is dead. Along with any respect my Mom has for me. 

I'm know im pathetic for wanting to kill myself over that. I just feel like a burden. 

Thanks for reading. 

I'm sorry.
