nobody caresNo work, no friends, no dreams, no life - in other words: i'm fine.
But, i'm really think about myself: i'm not yet foolish but maybe i'm infant, if i cant find way out. But  if  i'm &gt;24 years old - it's fucking shame.
i think need to talk with some man, who have life experience and many knows about things, who very important for me. Because I have no fucking life experience and i can only just go with the flow, without doing anything. I think first step with solution this trouble - find mental support. Man, who will be believes in me, and can hinting that make for fulfill task. 
i need your advice
