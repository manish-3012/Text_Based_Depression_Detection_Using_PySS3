tried to commit suicide not sure what do do nowRecently, i was prescribed a large dose of Valium to sleep. I was warned by my pharmacist and psychologist not to mix this drug with alcohol and I felt comfortable avoiding alcohol if the benzo actually helped me sleep (I've tried numerous other options that were ineffective). It really wasn't helping, so i decided to have a few drinks with friends one night. But by the end of the evening, I was so depressed and lonely that I started taking Valium, on after the other, hoping that I wouldn't wake up. I've dealt with suicidal thoughts for a long time. But this was one of the first times I felt very...relaxed and right about my choice. It felt both active (i was mixing two things I wasn't supposed to) and passive (if I don't wake up, I don't wake up). 

I supposed I didn't take enough because although I slept for almost 24 hours straight,  I didn't die. Now I'm not sure what to do. I'm not in as bad a place as I was the other night, but nothing has changed. I don't actively want to die at the moment, but I'm disappointment i didn't. And I don;t know how to tallk about it with friends. I don;t know what the point would be. My main source of pain is loneliness and I don;t want to extort connection from people by making them afraid of the regret they may feel if I do die by suicide. Or I'm not sure how to behave, if I laugh or have fun, will they think I was faking? Or that I'm fine? I've considered checking myself into a hospital, but that feels like something you do in an emergency, not after. 

I understand anti-suicide sentiment. But as a person who has struggled with mental health and worked very hard to find a balance with my own fr years, the old "don't die, you're loved" message isn't really helpful anymore.
