She's the best, but I can't love her anymore. I broke her heart, I deserve this.She and I have been together for five years now, but I don't love her anymore. I tried to, God knows I really tried to make things work, but the flame inside me died and I can't light it up again. I broke her heart when I told her, and I could feel as a wall of ice rose between us. She really loves me, and she's done *everything* for me. And yet, I hurt her.

The man she loves made her cry until throwing up. I did that. We have a great thing going on and I fucking ruined everything because I can't keep my eyes from wondering or my mind from pondering "what if". She doesn't deserve to be hurt like that. But I did. I'm a piece of shit who cannot love her back. I don't deserve being loved by someone as good as her. I don't fucking deserve to live either.

All I do is hurt her, maybe doing this will at least end my fuck-ups for good.
