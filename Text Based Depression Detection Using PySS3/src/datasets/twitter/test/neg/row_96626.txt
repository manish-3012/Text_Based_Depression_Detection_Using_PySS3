My Roommate Situation- I need helpHello.

I've tried posting in r/relationships for advice in this but they keep taking it down so I apologize.

I started college this year and we are in the second semester of school right now. I met my roommate around 7/8 months when school started and we hit it off. Since then she had been like a sister to me and I think I was like that to her.

Well in the first semester she had accidentally OD'd and she wanted me to go to the hospital with her. That was fine but the amount she had took she couldn't have OD'd on and before she had me list off the symptoms of OD'ding  then repeated word for word exactly what the symptoms were to the paramedics.

I just found this weird and it had a major impact on my mental well being.

Well over the break I took time to review our relationship and I noticed that  she was extremely manipulative and selfish. By the end of the first semester I had extremely exhausted I had just thought it had been from school.

Now I am not the most mentally stable. I have always had the thought of killing or cutting myself in the back of my head. I am just a coward to do it. I have never seen a therapist in my life and when I had tried telling my mother how I was feeling in high school she essentially played it off saying everyone is like that as teens. Now as a college student I'm very scared to go to a therapist and a psychiatrist but the thoughts have never left.

**I am not blaming her for ANY of my thoughts. She has a mental illness as well and is not healthy.**

Well at the start of this semester we decided to throw a small back-to-school party in our dorm. We had been drinking a bit (she claims she had a lot). She had gone up to cuddle with a guy. Well that guy had left with 1 other person. Once they were out of the room she had yelled to us (probably like 4 or 5 people) that she had done something inappropriate with the guy.

We were all disgusted since we had all been in the same room and been there while she had done it. Everyone had left afterwards.

I had gone to my bed and just wanted to sleep this night off and forget it. Well the guy came back and went to her bed to 'cuddle' again.  Now my bed is directly across hers and I can see what is happening. There arms are moving and I'm disgusted cause they were gonna do stuff while I was sleeping in the same room.

I left pissed off and went to my friend's room. She had come in on the phone and told me to get rid of him for her.

Now all during first semester she had made me do things like this for her and I was tired of doing it. She would also throw a fit or use her mental illness as a scapegoat. She would also lie to me and take credit for what I had done for her. She would also guilt trip me into doing stuff for her as well.

Back to the story I had yelled at her that I'm tired of doing stuff for her and that she created this situation/conflict she needs to get rid of it (she is very dependent on me). Now I don't really remember this part but she and my friend had gone to the room to get rid of him. Then I think my friend told her that I got mad at her and was pissed off (I'm a very calm person and it takes a lot to wear me down).

The she immediately started saying that she was gonna kill herself (and making me think its MY fault cause I was mad at her). She started writing notes and mine basically said 'Your the best roommate I have ever had. But you've never made me happy once'.

Frankly that had really hurt me since we were like sisters and really close. She started talking about her family (I have a very similar situation as well) and I left and broke down in the bathroom.

When I got back she had tried to make a noose from a blanket (we told her that isn't gonna work) and she then proceeded to take a bunch of pills. We had called the cops but I didn't want to deal with all of that so I just went to my friends room.

She was admitted in the hospital and an institution for a few days. I understand that she was going through something and she needed support but I was still hurt.

When she got back I talked to her about that night and how relationship isn't gonna be the same. She told me that I'm not the one to blame for her doing that (she blamed it all on her being drunk) but she then said 'When I'm drunk those things were at the back of my mind. You yelling at me just brought it forward.' now it wasn't that exactly but something along those lines. I feel like she is blaming me then for her attempt. She would also contradict stuff she said earlier or even before this incident.

I started avoiding her and not talking to her for a while. I don't even want to be in the same room as her anymore.

We then had another conversation but this time I didn't care and wasn't gonna spare her feelings. So I told her that she was manipulative, selfish, and that she did blame me for it with that comment.

She proceeded to say she needs a support system, that I'm not to blame (but then again later on in the conversion she contradicted herself again), that her eyes are 'open' now. She also told me that she understands if this relationship isn't gonna be the same.

I also said that she needs a therapist, and that she contradicts herself a lot. She then used the excuse that she isn't mentally there and kinda spacing out, and said the she was 'spacing' out during THIS CONVERSATION as well.

I'm done with her.

**I AGAIN AM NOT BLAMING HER FOR THESE THOUGHTS**

I have always had thoughts of killing myself and harming myself. This whole situation has made it even bigger in my mind. I am trying not to think about this situation and trying to focus on my academics but I can't. I just want to die.

I don't really know what to do in this situation. I might talk to my RA and RD about it. I know she has a 2 week grace period if she wants to drop out and I hope she does but it sounds mean. I am also thinking about transferring rooms but she might do something like this again and I'll feel like its my fault. I feel trapped.

Should I just have a conversation with her and tell her that I think she should drop out (she doesn't want to but the only reason for that is that she doesn't want to be by her family)? I think she should be held at an institute until she gets better that way she isn't by family and she can get the help she needs.

Am I in the wrong here? Should I still be apart of her support system so she doesn't do this again? Am I just being over dramatic in this situation and just over thinking things?

I just feel like the more I think about this situation and be around her I feel the guilt and I might actually kill myself.
