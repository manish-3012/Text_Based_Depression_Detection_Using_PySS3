Postponed my suicide until my parents are gone... but I don't know if I can last that longBeen entertaining thoughts of suicide for a while now.  If my loving parents weren't around, I would probably not be here right now.  Things aren't looking good for me but I decided to get through life until my parents pass away.

My parents are in their mid 60s and pretty healthy.  I think they will be around another 10-15 years.  But, I'm not sure if I can take 10-15 more years of life.  I have an older sister but I'm not sure how good of a job she will do to take care of them when my parents need a caretaker.  

I want to be freed.  I want to rest in peace.  I just so worried about my parents.  We're immigrants and my parents really know english too well either.  I feel stuck.  I feel guilty.  But, I really want to end all of this.
