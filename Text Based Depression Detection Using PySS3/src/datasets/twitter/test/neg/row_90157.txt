AcetominophenApproximately how much acetominophen can I take before I throw it all up? I took a whole bottle once, and am extremely tempted to down another whole bottle, but for efficiency's sake, I'm thinking of separating the doses. Yes, I know about the liver failure. That's kind of the point. Should I just take the whole bottle or what?
