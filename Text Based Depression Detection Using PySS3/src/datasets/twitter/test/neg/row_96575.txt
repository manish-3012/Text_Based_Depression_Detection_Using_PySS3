In debt, no motivation, living cause my dna insists upon it.  In debt, no motivation, living cause my dna insists upon it.  

Every year is the same.  Family disowned me for habitual failure.  

No hope but I see all my blessings.  I'm smart, attractive,  funny.  Women want me but they infrequently interest me on any real level.  

Simply no motivation and plan on taking the easy way out.  Soon I'll be evicted and I can't live with that.  Don't see the point in fighting, can't convince myself.  Fighting for a fool's dream of happiness in the future.  

I know these things come and go but its a cyclical ride I'm ready to get off.  

Thought I was gonna be something great. Everyone said so.  Can't hold a job for more than a year.  

I know it gets better, I've been here before (not this close to the end) and it got better, then worse.  

I just don't have the motivation to try anymore.  

Back story: dad left when I was young, moved into a "boys home"  at 12 it wasn't a foster home, my mother put me there with good intentions, to help me have a better life.  Was molested and confused for years.  Kicked out before senior year for smoking weed. One year later kicked out of mom and new step dad's home for the same reason.  Leeched off friends for years. Maniac depression, never diagnosed.  Well liked but I don't like many ppl, as I find our social rituals often tedious and fake..i know modern catcher in the rye, right.
Recently lost another job..no motivation to go on.  Have been searching for a quick and painless.  I don't want to die but it seems the easiest option.
