I donâ€™t understand why EVERYONE hates meI just donâ€™t get it. I didnâ€™t do anything to make everyone hate me. Everyone just ruins my life. Everyone rejects me, ignores me, leaves me, makes fun of me, and/or doesnâ€™t listen to me. No one has ever wanted to be my friend irl, no one has ever wanted to be my girl friend, everyone online always leave me even when they say they wonâ€™t. Why does everyone else has friends, dates, and spouses while I got no one because of how everyone treats me? Therapy and medications are useless and jut a scam. Hotlines do not help either. No one cares. Anyone that says they care are liars. No one cares that Iâ€™m alive. They wonâ€™t care when Iâ€™m dead anyway. I have no choice but to kill my self.
