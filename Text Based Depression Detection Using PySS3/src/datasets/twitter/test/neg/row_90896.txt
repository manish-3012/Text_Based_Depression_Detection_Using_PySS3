Nothing dramatic; I just can't see the point.Does everything ever seem empty to you all? I don't have anything I'm both passionate about and willing to pursue as a means of living. Go to college, meet people, find a SO, buy a house, have kids. It just doesn't seem all that appealing. Life seems like more trouble than it's worth. Whenever I begin to feel overwhelmed, I feel bad. Not just because of the workload, but because I don't know why I'm doing it. An easy day is comparable to an acquaintance asking to borrow $5. I say "sure thing" and the day goes on. No problem. When I'm feeling overwhelmed with everything, it's comparable to having an acquaintance ask to borrow $500. Of course, one would ask "what for?" before deciding to lend them the money. And the response is always "a good reason, trust me." I don't want lend that person the $500 again. I don't know what that reason is. I'm not sure if I really want to live.
