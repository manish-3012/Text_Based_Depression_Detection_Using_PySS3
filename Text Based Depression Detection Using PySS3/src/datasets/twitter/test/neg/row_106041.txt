Life's default setting is a black hole of misery.I know this because for the last 5 years, I've just coasted. 

I didn't  maintain my friendships, and I just let them die unceremoniously. I didn't  go to college, and I stopped trying  (academically) years ago. I only acknowledge my family members when they acknowledge me (they've almost stopped talking to me completely).

My life has been boiled down to it's rotten core. There's no friends or family coming to save me from myself. There's no great job waiting for me just around the corner. I'm all alone, broke, and forgotten. This is the natural version of life. The type of life you get when you don't try, and you've already spent all your life energy on crappy jobs, simply trying to make ends meet.

You're in your early 20's, and you have your whole life ahead of you, but you know deep down that you never had what it takes to make your life what you want it to be. And since you're too scared to actually commit suicide, you'll just post on Reddit when you feel bad, and never take action, ever. 

You know it. Even as you're typing this. 

And you're just going to keep being miserable and not taking action as your life crumbles around you in painful ways you couldn't have even imagined. Life will keep going without you (it never needed you in the first place).
