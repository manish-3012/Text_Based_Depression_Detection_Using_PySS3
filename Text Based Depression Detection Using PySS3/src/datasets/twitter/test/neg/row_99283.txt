Itâ€™s all goneI might be rejected from all colleges if a teacher reports me for copying on a test even though I didnâ€™t. I made a careless mistake so bad that it looks like I copied. Itâ€™s stacked up against me and I donâ€™t know how I can even clear myself. My whole life Iâ€™ve worked towards applying to college and it might be all over. My parents keep trying to cheer me up/ get me excited about my birthday coming up, telling me that it will all end ok. It just makes me feel worse. I had an older brother who died at birth, I wish he could have been in a my position, he would have done better for my them.
