I feel like a massive failure for quitting my job. I don't want to live anymore. I accepted defeat. Help?I quit work because I couldn't deal with an emotionally abusive coworker. I talked with management and they didn't take further steps. 

I'm trying to better myself buy moving out of my NParents house.
