So I wrote my suicide note today.Im writing this letter becuase it may be hard for anyone to understand why I am choosing this. The number one thing I want every one to know is that not a single human cuased this, there is nothing any one couldve done differently or at all, except of course myself. The why is more than a simplistic reason, it is not cut and dry or black and white. I have thought about suicide daily since I was fifteen years old. I have seldom had days in which my mind was not my worst enemie. 
	I see the world in a different way from most. Everything is constantly and consistantly jumbled. Numbers, faces, letters, words, thoughts. I see things backwards, sideways, upside down, and sometimes even blurred. I hide this and I hide well. I have told people that I am dyslexic, off hand, but what I really mean is  I am in a perpetual state of confusion. I try so hard, to learn all that I can, or at least take a jab at it. I do this becuase I am afriad of being seen as stupid, and having that voice in my head be at all justified in its mocking of how unintelligent I really am. So one reason why is that I am tired of being in a perpetual state of confusion. 
	I am not sure when it started, I'm actually not really sure when anything started, my memory is fleeting at best. Some where along the line my mind began to tell me that I am worthless. I don't mean on a bad day I had a passing thought. I mean every single day, be it a bad day, a normal day, or even an amazing day. At some point when I start to think about anything that little voice seeps in and starts to go blow by blow. It is always there to reassure me that I am worthless, stupid, a failure. I can not eat without it telling me I will only get fat, and more worthless, I cant not read without it laughing and calling me stupid when I jumble something up, I can not work without it telling me that I am a failure and its only a matter of time before I am fired or give up. It is always there to promise me that I am infact worthless. So why number two, I am so so so tired of trying to live while my mind is consistently telling me I am failing at that to. 	
	I am fucking crazy, not because of the aforementioned voice, not because of my stomach turning anxiety, or my mood swings, or depression. I am literally fucking insane. I have five, yes five, voices in my head, that is excluding the aforementioned. These voices are constantly fighting, with me and with eachother. So an example would be that I want to go bowling with my friends, so like any normal person I begin to think how to bring it up to them, this is where the voices the come in. Voice 1 will tell me to just ask, be blunt. Voice 2 will tell me to ease it into the conversation. Voice 3 will tell me I am stupid and to just shut up and sit down and pretend to be content. Voice 4 will tell me bowling is lame, and I will look stupid for asking. Voice 5 will tell me to ignore voice 4. Then the fighting begins, and I am stuck helpless with this look of fake content on my face, pretending thier arent five voices in my head argueing about fucking bowling. So maybe you have noticed I am not all there all of the time, some even call me a space cadet, this is why. So yes another why, I am tired of not being in control of my own brain. 
	Anxiety, oh anxiety my sweet toxic lover. Im not really sure when it got so bad, I am afraid all of the time. The only moments when I feel a sliver of safety, is when I am in my room with my dog, and on occasion my boyfriend. Otherwise I am irrationally fearing things. What am I fearing you ask, it can be as simple as my jeans ripped, that person thinks I am ugly, or I am going to spill this drink and everyone will laugh. It can also be as crazy as everyone in this resteruant thinks I am crazy, that random man on the bus can read my mind, maybe that lady is a witch. It can also be as extreme as, what if my dog is dead, what if someone in my family is dead or dieing and not telling me, what if today I get arrested, or mugged, what if today I get fired, or in an accident and die or become a vegetable. So you combine this anxiety with my five voices inflating the thoughts, my voice that is always there to reassure me of my worth(well lack there of), and my own rationale, what you have is enough for anyone to never want to leave thier room.I am tired of being afraid So there a fourth reason why. 
	I could on, and on, about the inner workings of my mind, but upon writing this I have come to realize that the answer is in fact simple, it is cut and dry and black and white. The why, is so simple, I am so fucking tired. I am not the kind of tired a nap can fix, or an energy drink, or a good nights rest. I am the kind of tired, where I can not will myself awake, it is a forceful battle to climb out of my bed, it is a struggle and I am loosing everyday. I am the kind of tired where the only solution is to sleep and never wake up.
