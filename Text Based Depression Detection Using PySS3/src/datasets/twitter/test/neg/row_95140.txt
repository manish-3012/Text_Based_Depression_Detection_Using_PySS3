Maybe I just need to clear my mind.Don't you guys hate cheaters? Thats me. I cheated in a college final, got caught, and ultimately got expelled. I applied for other schools but got rejected due to the note on my transcript that says I am a cheater. I can't go back to school, I can't be what I wanted to be in life. 

My father has scoliosis and was on the verge of becoming paralyzed. He got surgery and is recovering but he has been out of work for almost half a year now. My mom is working by herself, and the little money I do make goes to her but its not enough. They're on the verge of losing their house, their cars, and everything they have worked for. My mom was crying last night and all I could do was watch. She thinks I'm still in school. I cant tell her that I was expelled and I am dying on the inside everyday.

My suicidal thoughts grow with every second that goes on throughout our lives. I see no future where I can be happy. My mind is plagued with dark thoughts. I feel like I'm barely alive. Maybe this is it. Maybe tonights the night. I've tried picking up new hobbies. I've tried reconnecting with old friends. I've tried making new friends. While I experience temporary happiness, I am filled with depression when I am alone. Depression is something I can't avoid no matter how hard I try. 

I am sorry mom, dad, brother. I don't think I can do it anymore. Ive tried my hardest but in the end, depression won in the end. It has taken over my life. I'm sorry I couldn't be the son you expected of me. I'm sorry I couldn't be as happy as you wanted me to be. You will never see this post and I never had the courage to say this to you but I love you. I'm sorry for failing in the one thing you wanted me to succeed in.
