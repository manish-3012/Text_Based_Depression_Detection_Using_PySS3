I think im done.I've started skipping university more and more now - I just don't know what to do with myself . I've had suicidal thoughts flow in and out constantly for the last 5 months, only recently have they never left. I haven't had a friend for about 6 years now I think, I am very lonely and unhappy. A portion of my family guilt trips me for things that have happened in the past, so I'm wracked with guilt on a day to day basis. I just feel like an empty shell of a human being, like every morning I put on a mask because it's simply better than my mother having a panic attack or even going into depression herself if she found out I'm suicidal - and I would never subject anyone to that kind of torture. Life just doesn't seem like it's worth any of this. I really have no reason to wake up and try everyday, yet I do it anyway hoping that someday I'll find a reason to be happy or something worth waking up for. 

Sorry for making this sound like a rant. Thanks for listening.
