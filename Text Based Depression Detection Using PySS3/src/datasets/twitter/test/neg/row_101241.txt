Done with thisI've dealt with depression since I was 17. I never had many friends growing up, as my stutter kept me somewhat anti-social. That changed during college, but the new experiences made for stressful situations, further making me anxious and depressed.

The summer going into my senior year of college, I got in an argument with my best friend, and thought to myself that was it. I took out a knife and held it up, and was ready to stab myself. But I couldn't do it. I don't know why. That person is still a good friend, but we have drifted apart somewhat.

I've been to four counselors since then â€” none never really getting to the root of the problem. In addition to my stuttering, I'm about 15 grand in debt, have a job that I absolutely hate that doesn't pay me nearly enough to make a living, and have been dealing with suicidal thoughts on and off for the last 7 years. What's more, one of my good friends from work has completely turned into an ass hole and we each want nothing to do with each other anymore.

I'm at the point where I can't take it. I can't afford medication, and my counselor is only helpful to a certain extent (which I'm getting financial assistance for). Most of my friends don't understand it, and the one that does (a nurse) wants to put me in the hospital if I keep this up. I just want to give up and fucking blow my brains out.

Everyone keeps on saying things will get better, but they haven't in years. And I don't foresee them getting any better either. I've been on the lookout for a new job for three years and haven't found anyone who will hire me, despite me being 100% qualified (and with some, over-qualified). I can't make it through a job interview with people understanding me, and my confidence level is pretty much at zero. My speech continues to suck the life out of me, and it's been so inconsistent that I don't know how to deal with it.

I'm at the point where it's not an if, it's a when this will all come piling down.
