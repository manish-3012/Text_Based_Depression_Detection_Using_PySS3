Screw everyone who has very stopped me from killing myself!Seriously, I have had serious mental health issues since I was six. Every freaking thing. I've heard voices, I rip out my hair, my skin, I just hate this. I have attempted suicide many times. SO far, I have been stopped. And, I am so mad about this. Yes, they had good intentions, but it doesn't make up for what they did. I am tired of suffering. This never ends.
