I have no futureI'm 17 and I don't know what to do anymore. Late 2017 I switched to doing my schooling online because my depression and anxiety became really bad. And now I'm very behind on schoolwork just because I have no motivation. I've thought about just getting a GED but I'm probably too stupid to manage it and my grandmother (whom I live with) already calls me a disappointment enough as it isz because of my failure to keep up with school.

My own mother also recently disowned me because my grandmother and I refused to gives her more money (she's literally always been unemployed so she mooches off of her mother and has even stolen money from my wallet before).  She never seemed to love me much anyways but it still hurts, a lot. She's always cares about money and drugs more than me.

The only real friend I had moved away and so I don't get to talk to her much since she has her own life to keep her busy. And she seems to care about her boyfriend more than me anyhow.

I have no one. And I feel like I'm stuck here, in this state of existing as basically a useless, (sort of) dropout, with no passions or real desires or talents. I just can't get myself to care about anything. I just wanna die so badly. There's nothing here for me in the present and nothing for me in the future. There's no real reason for to keep going. I've never been anything more than subpar and I'll never be anything but subpar; no matter how hard I try at anything, I just can't do anything right, itf doesn't matter what it is. I just can't seem to succeed at anything and life isn't worth it anymore
