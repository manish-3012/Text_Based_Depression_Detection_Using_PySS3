Iâ€™m currently in an ambulance carI told my girlfriend I was trying to overdose, and she got extremely worried and stuff~ eventually her parents found her crying at 1:15 in the morning so they called 911 and here I am... I regret so many decisions and actions Iâ€™ve done. This was incredibly dumb of me and ironically I just want to die even more to end it after now. Iâ€™m being taken to a teen pych ward~ hopefully I can get out tomorrow. What the fuck is wrong with my life.
No... what the fuck is wrong with me?
