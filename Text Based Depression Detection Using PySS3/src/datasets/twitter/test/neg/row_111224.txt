I'm sick of everyone being mad at meMy mum is constantly mad at me and doesn't understand anything I'm going through and doesnt care to help me. My girlfriend is mad at me all the time. I have ptsd from my abusive father and everyone knows I struggle with it but still make life hard for me and I don't know what to do at this point. Thank you for your time
