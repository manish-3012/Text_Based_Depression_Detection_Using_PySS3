Sick of peopleI got diagnosed with bipolar in February. I can't remember a time that I've ever really been stable, even before I got diagnosed. My boss has been on my ass, conplaining that I make too many mistakes. I tried telling him I was struggling with my diagnosis. Even told him what the diagnosis was. He said he understood because his sister has bipolar. But apparently he doesn't understand. Almost right after that, he put me on night shift. And he's still on my ass, even though going on night shift made things worse for me and for over a year, everyone's been expected to do at least 2 people's work load every day. But how dare I make any mistakes, right? And not only that, but despite struggling to find meds that work for me, my psychiatrist told me today that "I have too high of expectations for medication." How? How does wanting to be at least semi-functional on medication expecting too much?

I'm getting sick of everything. No one listens to a damn word I say. My boss refuses to listen and just makes me feel like shit on a regular basis. And everyone are the metal health facility that I go to don't listen to anything either. I feel like shit now because my psych shamed me. "You have too high of expectations. You should focus more on therapy." If I can barely get myself out of bed half the time and am running around like a crazy person the other half of the time, how can I focus on anything?? I got on meds to stable myself out a little, so I COULD focus on therapy and getting better. But apparently, I'm a lazy asshole for that.

Honestly, I'm just half tempted to do something because I'm sick of feeling like this and sick of not being listened to.
