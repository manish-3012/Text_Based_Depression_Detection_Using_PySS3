Cant believe Im here...I have been feeling so down the last few weeks. Ive thought about ending it all more times this week then in my life. I just dont. I could but I dont because I know how shitty it is for the people left behind.
But I cant shake the feeling that I may never be able to find love again, and Ill never get married or live the life I wanted to. I wake up to a empty phone and dont send anyone a goodnight text.
Ive tried online dating I try to talk to girls but no one is a good fit. And Im only getting older. 
I probably sound like a whiney bitch compared to what most of you are dealing with. But Im so sick of feeling run down and good for nothing in this fucking life... 
One minute I wish I was dead the next minute I want to see if tomorrow I find that beautiful woman. She wont want a man like me though... and I cant even get my shit together to be a good man so why even try? 
FML
