Nothing mattersI'm having something between a mental health episode and an existential crisis rn. Probably a little bit of both.  
  
I don't know how to express what I'm thinking without being snobby or sounding like an asshole so i will just say it. This world sucks. I hate all of it. No one really matters to anyone. Were all going to die. Am I real? Are you real? Can we really know anything??  
  
like YOU??? person reading this post?? Are you even real?! oh my god im so fucked up. ARE YOU THERE???? DOES ANYONE EVEN EXIST?? IS THIS JUST A BAD DREAM??  
  
I sound crazy dont i but thats how I think a lot of the time. like goddamn life is so complicated and im stuck in my own little bubble. We can't really know anything.  
  
Im so fucking worthless. I never asked to be born. My monkey brain is keeping me alive though because its scared of death. Im just an animal. Im a really weak and worthless person.  
  
god i mean ugh like is anything real does anything matter oh my god  iwant to die.
