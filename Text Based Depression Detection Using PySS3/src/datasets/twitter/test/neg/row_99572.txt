NumbToday I feel so numb. I just want to crawl under a rock and die. I'm plagued with nightmares of my husband's infidelity and this morning I woke up not knowing if I can face another day.

He had a family emergency and had to leave town so it would be the perfect time. I could give my kitties enough food to last and no one would notice I'm gone.

What is the point?
