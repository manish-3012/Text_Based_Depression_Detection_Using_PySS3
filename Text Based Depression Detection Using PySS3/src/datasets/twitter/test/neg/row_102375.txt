I'm so frustratedHi I'm Hugh.
I recently moved schools due to bullying for being Jewish. I have severe anxiety and depression. I'm sitting here on my phone balling my eyes out because I'm sad and frustrated that no one understands me. I still cut but haven't tried to end it YET. I have tried talking to councilors and other people but they don't understand. I need someone to talk to who understand soon or i think I met end it.
