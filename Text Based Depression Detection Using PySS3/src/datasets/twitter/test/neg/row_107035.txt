StrugglingSo I guess this is it. I've been desperately struggling to keep going for so long, and now I've just run out of the will to keep it going. A loveless relationship, freshly out of work, with no prospect of a new job, nor any way for me to make money. Probably going to be kicked out of my home, and no way of getting support elsewhere. No friends, and a family I can't go near because of my abusive father. Basically, I'm as screwed as I can be, and even if my head wasn't so fucked up, I'd be struggling. But at the best of times even, I can't shake the suicidal feelings from inside me, and this is probably the most difficult situation i've been in, in my life.

The worst part of it though is I do have a dream, a life I want to live, I know exactly where I want to be, what I want to do, and who I want to be with. But I have no way of getting to that place. And I don't even mean in a "depression making it hard to see the possibilities in life" kind of way, I mean there is absolutely no way of me having anything near the life I want, even though it's hardly ambitious.

I've tried to get support, I've tried everything, and just have no way out. I guess the only worry I can deal with is making sure my suicide goes off without a hitch. I guess the only hard bit left is the one tie to life I have left, which I'm struggling to sever. I'm sure I'll be there soon though. It will be good to be at peace.
