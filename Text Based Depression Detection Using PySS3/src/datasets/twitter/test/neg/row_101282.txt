I am a loserI am 23 year old female and have achieved nothing with my life.  
I have been unemployed for over  a year. I have a law degree. A law doesn't make you a lawyer in the UK the process is complex.
Seeing people my age getting married, moving in to new cities, becoming famous or just doing big things with thier lives like getting elected as Member of parliament or being on the forbes under 30 list

I feel like a loser . We live in a world if you are young and successful society evaluates you.

I have never a had boyfriend and still a virgin. Society thinks something is wrong with you if a virgin at this age. I am unemployed and living at home.

All i wanted was to make the world a better place and be in a relationship with a man who deeply loved me. 

I am going to kill myself as i dont want to see the next 10 years.

I have no future due to recession from covid.

The older i get the less attractive i will be to men
 I wish i died of covid 19. Seeing all these people died i wish it was me.
They had so much to live for wheras i dont.
I been suicidal for years.
Life is not for me . I dont belong here in this world.
