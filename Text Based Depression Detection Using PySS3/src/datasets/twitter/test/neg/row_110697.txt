Loaded gun but no triggerIdk guys I tried to do it but I couldnâ€™t. I bought a gun about a month ago but havenâ€™t felt ready to use it until now. I loaded it and held it up to my heart for a long time but couldnâ€™t pull the fucking trigger. I guess Iâ€™ll have to work up my courage or get drunk first. Also I think I fucked up bc I bought a .22 and didnâ€™t realize how small the bullets were until the guy helping me picked them out. And itâ€™s too late at that point to be like yeah... I need a bigger caliper(?) gun so itâ€™s more effective... So yeah fuck me. But I figured a hole through the heart is a hole through the heart, even if it is on the smaller side. 

Iâ€™ve tried to get help and stick in there for my wife but I have reached my breaking point. I tried talking to a counselor and was on meds for depression/anxiety for 6 mo but fuck that itâ€™s not working. I stopped taking them and cancelled my counseling appts. 

Iâ€™m in so much fucking pain all of the time and have had 0 luck at fixing it throughout the past 6 years. At this point what am I sticking around for? A wife that gets mad at me every time I get upset. A life filled with pain which has effected literally every part of my life. A mom dying of cancer. A family too self absorbed to care that they trample over me and ask too much of me. And me who canâ€™t fucking say no to anyone. 

Idk but Iâ€™m not staying around for much longer. I guess Iâ€™ll just have to keep working myself up there until I can finish the job I started.
