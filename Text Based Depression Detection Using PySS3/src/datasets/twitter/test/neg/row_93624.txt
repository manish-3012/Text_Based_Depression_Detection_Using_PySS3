Itâ€™s all dark nowI feel like Iâ€™m losing my mind. My life has been aggressively spiraling downward and the only thing I can hope for is being killed upon impact as soon as I hit the bottom. I donâ€™t have any control anymore. Thereâ€™s no light at the end of the tunnel, thereâ€™s no more hope. No one is coming. Itâ€™s all dark now.
