It will not endGuys, I don't know what to do. I haven't slept since early May. I've seen a shrink, got put on meds for depression and to get my appetite back, sleeping pills for the long nights, but I still am overwhelmed by grief. I think about killing myself every day. I've reached out to hotlines, doctors, family. They all mean very well, they say all this pain will dull but it just doesn't. I've been so sad for so long. I've tried excercise, changing diet, changing meds, meditation, sex, uppers, art, literature, therapy. I just want it to end. I'm tired of crying myself to sleep. I'm tired of the memories and pain. What do I do...
