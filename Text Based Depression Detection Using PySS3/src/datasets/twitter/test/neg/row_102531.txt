Been a while since life had appeal.I'm not the best writer, and I guess I won't make myself totally clear, but I'll try:

I'm 22, saving up for university, or at least that's what I tell people.
I work a dead end job, read books, and just live.
For the past five years I felt like I'm slowly fading away, I don't even feel joy from anything anymore, not reading, not masturbating or having sex, not playing video games.
I even quit smoking, because why smoke when it doesn't even do anything anymore? 

Lately I've just hit my emotional bottom, where I just sit and think to myself "Holy shit, this isn't going anywhere, what's the fucking point anymore?"

I don't see any point in living, there's no goal to achieve, and even if I'll make one myself it would just be some hollow thing used to pass the time towards the inevitable.Hell, I even tried giving myself a goal, turns out it didn't do anything to me, just kept me busy for a little while.

 I don't care about other people, I don't care about being moral and staying alive just to make others happy or because "it's the right thing". Maybe I'll start practicing extreme sports, maybe then I'll feel alive, maybe I'll finally die without people asking questions.

It's been a long time since life had appeal, and I don't think I'll manage to keep on living for long before I'll lose my mind and just end it.

I'd be lying if I was saying I'll do it soon, but... I have my limits.
Hopefully when the time comes I won't fuck it up and end up with brain damage, otherwise I'll be in a living hell until I'd die naturally.
That's pretty much the only thing that worries me about killing myself. Just fucking it up and ending up in an even worse situation, as hard as it is to imagine right now.
