I didnt pull hard enough.I should have pulled the trigger harder. I know that it's a hard trigger to pull, but I didnt squeeze hard enough I guess. I pulled but it didnt blow...

After I just couldn't stop looking at it.. and took the  bullet out of the chamber and put it away.. but... yeah.. just to share.. 

Maybe it means something. Probably doesn't.
