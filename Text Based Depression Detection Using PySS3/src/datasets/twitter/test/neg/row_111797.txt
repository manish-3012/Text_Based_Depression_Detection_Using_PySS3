It is what it is...Just a few notes;

1. Chasing money is fine, but trust me, in the long run, it wont keep you happy, it'll just distract you.

2. Help isn't always available (especially at the moment) so, keep yourself above water as long as you can.

3. Make sure you go to the correct people for help, if you don't, it may make things worse.

4. Asking for help after you have done something wrong isn't attention seeking, it's sometimes the last resort to get the help you need.

5. A Rolex will tell you the time but not buy time.
