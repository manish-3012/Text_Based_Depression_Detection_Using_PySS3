If I can make it to Wednesday, I can check myself into a psych ward.I have a test on Tuesday night that will mean my classes this semester will be 75% completed (hopefully with passing grades), and I can get an Incomplete designation to take them again at some point. I don't know if I can make it that long. I just don't know. I'm terrified that if I check myself in, my family will react badly (like they did toward my second suicide attempt), and I'm even more afraid of trying and failing again. I already know I'm a disappointment to everyone in my life, and it's worse that they just make it about them (do you know how much you're hurting us?) when it _is_ about themâ€”no matter what I do, I'm not good enough, and I hate it. I just want someone to tell me in person that I'm good enough, that I'm doing the best I can, that it's okay to be myself. As soon as I stopped mimicking my "role models", all of the approval I thought I had backing me up disappeared. All of that "unconditional love" from family members has vanished.

I can't do this anymore. I _know_ I need help, but if I can't at least get the chance to retake these classes, I doubt I'd ever be able to earn back anyone's respect.
