Friend called the suicide hotline on meYeah so long story short, I was super suicidal the other night and a friend called the suicide hotline on me without my knowledge. They got my address, ten cops and a fucking ambulance show up at my house, shit was absolutely terrifying.. anyone else had a similar experience? Like I was physically ok but god it was so scary. Also I just feel like they.. don't need so many people for that? I don't know I was very taken aback by the sheer amount of cops that showed up at my house. Random but it's been bugging me to say the least
