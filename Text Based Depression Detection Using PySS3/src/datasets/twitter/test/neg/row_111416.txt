iâ€™m 16. i got depression after a long period of boredom in which i began to lose feelings of happiness for everything.my grandfather died. i watched my dad hit his wife and get arrested. my family is broke and my spine is damaged so i canâ€™t play sports anymore. the girl i have been in love w and had a relationship with for so long has treated me like shit and iâ€™ve found out that she hooked up with my best friend. there just isnâ€™t really anything here for me. not even god.
