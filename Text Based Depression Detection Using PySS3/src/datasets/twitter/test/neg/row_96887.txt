Itâ€™s hard being fakeDo you ever feel like thereâ€™s two people in your head, one that wants to end it all and the other wanting a future. One side would do anything just to feel pain, do anything just to feel. Most of the time that side wins, there are good times though. Sometimes the smiles are real, sometimes the mask actually comes off with a smile. Other times itâ€™s a character I made to represent me, the funny,like able gal that everyone likes. And put away that girl that has the same traits, but real. The girl that doesnâ€™t need people to like her, that doesnâ€™t care.

I donâ€™t know why I cut, my life isnâ€™t bad. Iâ€™m just here, Iâ€™m just like anybody else. Sometimes I wished my â€œPrince Charmingâ€ would come release me from my curse, I know stupid waiting for some guy to heal this. At the end of the day Iâ€™m just a terrible person, and asshole.

People pm trying to make me feel better, have someone to talk to. I appreciate it really, I do. Yet i donâ€™t respond. I think part of me wants to die, just waiting for that one thing that would just end it all. At the end of the day I just hate myself, I donâ€™t know why. I just donâ€™t want think, feel, be alive. Iâ€™m such a hypocrite, I help other people from killing them self but I canâ€™t even help myself 

Do I even want to get better, I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t think so, my mindset is so messed up. Other people have bigger problems then a scummy, fucked up teen. Some people actually have problems, when Iâ€™m just here. No purpose, no nothing. I hate being looked at as creepy, as sick. I hate being faked loved.

Do I even have a future at this point, no one knows I still cut. Only my family knows Iâ€™m on medication, I donâ€™t even think itâ€™s work. Iâ€™ve never been more suicidal in my life, I just want to go. I donâ€™t want to deal with anything anymore, I canâ€™t.
