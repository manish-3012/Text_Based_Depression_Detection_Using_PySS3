I dropped out if school 3 years agoI'm not quite sure when I started getting depressed, maybe it was around 8th? No, maybe earlier... I was part of the IB and a from of IGCSE before? It was designed to prepare you for the IB. Since I was kind of smart I never really studied, in fact after 6th since my mum stopped forcing me I barely even touched my books at all. Everyone told me I had a tough time in 1-5 and I skipped a lot of days but I don't really remember anything. The skipping and the hatred for school stayed though, it got kinda bad in the later years of school where I'd get warnings frequently that I'd fail the class thanks to attendence and all my classmates would make a big deal of it every time I was absent. Maybe that was their way of trying to make me go to school or maybe they were just being kids, either way it didn't help much being called a liar all the time. Oh, I forgot to mention this but I moved from India to Germany after the 5th. I had a sort of best friend from the 7th, we shared a room on a school trip and just hung out after. I'd get called gay from time to time just for hanging out with a guy because 'cool guys can hang out because they're cool but if lame guys hang out they're gay' I never really understood that mentality but the LGBT community wasn't popular then so maybe people we're just looking for a gay guy to pick on? It didn't matter because neither of us were gay. Anyway we'd play games at his house often, our favorite was black ops zombies, just killing hordes with a group. It was fun, while it lasted. Before I knew it we were a group of friends and I actually was in the core of the group. It felt weird to be accepted but I still kept to myself. It's just my preference I guess, or maybe it had a little to do with trust issues. After leaving everyone I knew and moving to Germany might have had an impact? I really don't know, for some reason I don't remember much. Around 8th my best friend said I seemed depressed and that I was spacing out. I didn't really know what it meant to be depressed and what depression was so I just shrugged it off. It was then that I started really struggling with motivation, I skipped a lot, rarely did my homework and rarely studied. I should also mention that I rarely talked to my parents, probably because they seemed strict, at least they were till the 6th so I didn't want to argue with them. Around the 9th my best friends mum died. She had lung cancer. I didn't really know what to say, I was supposed to halp him but I didn't know how. I also didn't know how to acknowledge that my best friends mum had died. I was a shitty friend, he had to move back to England shortly after and we kinda lost contact from then on. I can't really remember anything from then till the end of my 10th. I clearly remember that because for the first time when I decided to do something I couldn't. I usually procrastinate but always get things done when I decided to. This time I had an extended essay to work on for English, it was supposed to have analysed a book and discuss the themes and literary devices used, at least I think that the term. About a month before submission I decided to start, except, I couldn't. It sounds like I was just being lazy but I physically couldn't, I don't know why. Every time I tried starting I felt frozen. This kept on till the day of submission, it was time to pull out the excuses. I kinda hoped she would just give me a zero but she actually cared so I was the only student who was given extra time. Everyone knew this. I'd get asked about the essay every now and then by me peers but I'd give some stupid excuse. The hard part was coming up with an excuse for my teacher, I'm not sure why but she cared and I knew that, Soo many times I contemplated asking her to give me a zero, I wish I actually did but I just kept giving excuses till the end of the year. The really hard part was trying to write that essay every day but never getting past the first word but somehow I passed! That came as a surprise to me as well, even though I did well in the exams I missed quite a bit classes and didn't do a lot of assignments. It was around the 10th my anxiety started to have physical symptoms I'd have a tough time in the toilet and in the morning. I actually still get anxious whenever I hear a song that I had for my alarm, but the real symptoms came as I got to school. I'd shiver a lot of the time on the bus to school and whenever I got near the school building I'd get extremely dizzy. I found out recently from the doctor that it's called situation anxiety but I still don't fully understand it. At the end of 10th I was told I'd have to move back to India because my dad's company was shutting down in a year. This would be the second time I'd say goodbye to everyone I knew. When I came back to India I was put in an IB school and I thought everything would be ok if I put my mind to it, it would be like starting fresh. It wasn't. I found out that my mom would have to stay in Germany to help my brother out since it was his last year so I had to live with my uncle. I really felt lonely then so I decided to socialize and at times I'd stay out too late so I had to stop doing that. I had a real addiction to gaming by then but u didn't have my stuff so I switched to anime. It was calming not being able to think but before I knew it I started to think 'what would happen if I were to jump out of this window?' (we lived on the 19th floor). It was the thought after that, that really hurt. The only thing that was stopping me from killing myself was that my family would be upset. It was at that point I realized I wanted to die. This was a few days before my mom came back from Germany so I decided to touch it out and just survive till my mom came back because I didn't want to hurt anyone. When my mom came back I thought I would tell her about it, except, when I tried to put it into words I realised I hadn't spoken to my mum about what's troubling me and what hurts me in years, so I decided to to think of who I spoke to about this, but there was no one. I spent a lot of time spacing out from then until the 11th was over. We had to go back to Germany to help move back but I didn't really know what I was supposed to do. I didn't want to hurt my family but I didn't want to live either. I distracted myself unsuccessfully by watching anime most of the time except for the 3 days I went to spend time with my friends from Germany. The days went by fast and before I knew it my vacation was over. I hadn't done any of my homework and school was starting soon. I decided that now was as good a time as any to say goodbye. Then I did the stupidest thing ever. I listened to music on YouTube. Most of the songs were depressing but I could close my eyes without thinking so it helped. Then on the stupid YouTube autoplay came a voice log of a sister of someone who killed themselves. She went into great detail of her experience up until her sister committed suicide. I expected it to stop so I got up to change to a song, but then she continued. She spoke of thanks giving, Christmas and New year, and how her family dealt with her sisters passing. It hurt. I didn't want someone to go through that because of me. I always found it kind of hard to hurt someone but I thought it would hurt for a month or two and then they'll just forget about me. I realised I was being naive, or maybe it was just wishful thinking. I mustered up the courage to ask my mom if I could drop out of school, I expected a no. She said yes. I was surprised and didn't understand why this strict parent allowed me to leave school. I thought that would be the end, it wasn't. Even though I was a little relieved I still wanted to die and I didn't enjoy the things I used to enjoy before. I started cutting myself to stop thinking. It was easy to focus on the pain, a lot easier that focussing on a game or an episode of anime. My mum found out. I started going to a psychiatrist and a psychologist it didn't help. 'It takes time' they kept saying until I stopped, but my mum kept going. Eventually she got me to go again just to check the medicine. I was told a while ago that what I told him would remain between us. I told him I was contemplating suicide. He looked in silence, I noticed a little bit of a smile but just ignored it. He said to get my mom in and I did. When we both sat down the first thing he said it 'He wants to kill himself'. I didn't really know how to react. My mum was crying but I couldn't move. 'What you say remains between us' kept going on in my head. The psychiatrist said it would help if I were put in hospital to be monitored and my mom agreed. Those three weeks felt like months because all I could do was think. I couldn't focus on anything. To get out I promised to come for counciling a week after though I had no intention of going. I could lie, it was the only thing I was good at. 'If I believe the lies, they will.'. A year passed, maybe two, I actually was a little better  but my dad said enough is enough, you're going back to school. So I was sent to Singapore. I lasted about a week but the anxiety came back and so did the thoughts. So I quit, maybe that's another thing I'm good at. A few months past and I'm going to a psychiatrist again, no councillor for the time being. The meds aren't working so they'll probably be changed. I still think about suicide everyday and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. I've spent the last three years at home and I'm as lonely as ever. The few friends I had I pushed away because when I kill myself the people I hurt will decrease. I spend most of the day playing videogames, I'm kinds happy I can do that again but lately even that's not working. I'm going to cut my leg today to see how much force I need to get to the veins. I still kind of hope someone will stop me, but I'm not that naive anymore. I just made this to vent, so to speak. If for some reason you decided to read this then thanks :) I didn't really think of the size and before I realised, it was too long. So sorry. I didn't go into what makes me want to kill myself because I don't really understand it and I don't want to think about it.
