Is it just a "coincidence" that I've never met more than one person that really cares about me?I posted here before. My family doesn't love me. None of them talk to me or care about me. My mom left me. My dad was never around. I try to make friends. I give them everything I have, all of my trust, all of my support, all of my emotion. They all let me down. I love them. They leave without me. They befriend each other and leave me alone for seemingly no reason. I reach out, I try, I tell people I'm being pushed to the edge, that I can't find myself giving a shit about the one person that cares about me anymore. I just want to die. Nothing in this world would ever make me happier than this. I've heard it all. I have tried to find a reason not to feel like this. I've tried so hard. I don't want to try anymore. I need a way to fall asleep and never wake up. All people do is let me down and hurt me. No one ever cares about me, just themselves. So why can't I be selfish for once too? Just once. I don't want to be alive. I want to give away all of my things. 

I tried reaching out to people. I really, truly did. I tried so hard, I tried soooo hard. No one listens. No one believes me. This isn't a joke, it was never a joke. It's not overdramatic. All I do at night is go through my thoughts and plans on how I'd go through with it. I'm so ready to end my misery. I'll keep plotting in my head until one day I finally figure out a way to make this real and make this happen. I think about hurting myself often, maybe that will make people care? Or realize I'm not joking? None of this was a joke. It was never a joke.
