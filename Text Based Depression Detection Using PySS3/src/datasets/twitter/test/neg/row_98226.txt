Just want to say one last goodbye...I will kill myself tomorrow. No chance for me to live on my life. This is punishment, an honorable punishment, for living in this cruel world.

Just want to say, this is my final decision. I want to say thank you for trying to help me, but I feel like my life is at the end of the line. I canâ€™t do this anymore. Youâ€™re better off without me, anyway...

So, I want to say goodbye.
Goodbye, everyone... ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜”
