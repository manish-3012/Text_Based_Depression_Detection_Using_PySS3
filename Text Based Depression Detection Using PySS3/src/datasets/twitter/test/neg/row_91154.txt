GoodbyeMy last post ever here. 

Mom and stepdad are divorcing and I'm about to be homeless.
My girlfriend dumped me.
I have no skills and can't get a job to support myself.
I could never get into college because I'm missing a half credit and can't afford it. I have a high school diploma but who gives a shit?
Worst of all I've been rejected from the Air Force. That was my only way to straighten out my life. 
My life is 100 percent fucked. I even had a fucking friend tell that. Thanks bitch.
In a few hours after I do one more favor for my mom I'm gonna throw myself off a bridge onto the highway.
And before anyone says "think about the people who will miss you" I don't care. All my life I've been used looked down upon. I was bullied and tormented for being skinny all my life. My family has given up on me and what little friends I had left don't care anymore.
I don't want to feel emotion anymore, I was never supposed to be born. My biological father took off when I was a baby. I wish nothing well for him

My stupid rant ends here. Goodbye.
