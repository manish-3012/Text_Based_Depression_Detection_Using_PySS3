Do your parents love you?I have like the kindest parents ever, and that's the only reason I've kept on living for the last year (been depressed for 4 years, but the last one has been much worse). I sometimes find my self wishing that they would die (absolutely sick I know) just so I can get the fuck outta here. My mom especially is already suffering because of my suffering and I can't even imagine how terrible she would feel if I commited suicide. Not that I'm complaining, I just can't believe I would end up having these thoughts.
