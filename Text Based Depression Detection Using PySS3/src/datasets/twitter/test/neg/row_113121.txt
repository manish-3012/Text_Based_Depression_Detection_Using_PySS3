I don't know why I want to kill myselfI really don't know why. It's not emotional pain, but recently I've been getting this strong urge to check out from this world. I can't talk to anyone about it for some reason, so I thank you for listening ear. I don't know what's wrong with me. It started a few days ago out of no where. I do have past history of mental illness (PTSD) and probably a few other undiagnosed issues. Since I got the urge I've been feeling numb to all feelings. I figured I need a second opinion before I take any action. Its just something I've never felt before. I feel adequate as a person, so its not that. Maybe its because its been 5 years since I've been with a women. I really don't know.
