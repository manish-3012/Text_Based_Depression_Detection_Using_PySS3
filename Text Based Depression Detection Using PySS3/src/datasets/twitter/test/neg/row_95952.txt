Iâ€™m losing interest in everything I love.Iâ€™m losing the love that I have for the world, I can actually feel myself growing numb with each day. Even the repercussions Iâ€™d have with suicide arenâ€™t enough to deter me anymore, even with how selfish it sounds, I donâ€™t really.. care that people who love me will be hurt anymore. And itâ€™s terrible to say. But I feel so. So fucking miserable..
I know I think differently from most people and itâ€™s a curse, I think I might have some fucking.. disorder because no one seems to function the way I do. And Iâ€™m not saying this to seem smart or edgy but Iâ€™m just.. not right. 
Iâ€™ve been in therapy for years and years, a majority of my life.. and they all say the same thing. â€œIt gets better. Everyone gets sad. Iâ€™m here for you.â€ But in reality theyâ€™re paid to say that, they say that to everyone, everyone says the same fucking thing but they donâ€™t really mean it and even if they _do_ it makes no difference because I genuinely donâ€™t want to live 
I have horrible crying spells and canâ€™t make it through a single day without breaking down. I canâ€™t do school and I donâ€™t want to. All I want to do is die and rot.
