I am in an unstoppable downward spiral, and I just want it to end.Hi.

I am not doing well right now. I screwed something up at work, and I have to leave my job. I was planning on quitting anyway soon, but it kinda sucks that I did this to myself. I don't know if I will be able to find a new job. I know that it might sound silly where you are, but the unemployment rate is at least 40% here. And getting higher every day. There are people more qualified than me who can't find jobs. And I am the wrong colour to find a job (again, I know that might sound silly where you are sitting, but here it is a pretty shitty reality).

I don't know what I am going to do. I just want to cry.

I haven't been able to sleep in days. Even though my antidepressants are very strong sleep aides. I feel like death.

I'm sorry.
