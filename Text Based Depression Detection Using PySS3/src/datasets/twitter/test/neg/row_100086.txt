There's no one I can reach out to, please help me..girlfriend problemsI think my girlfriend doesn't love me anymore. I had only her and nothing else in this life. We are still together but I feel like she's slowly losing her feelings for me. We fight almost every day. I have mental illnesses and severe trust and abandonment issues. Every time we start arguing I get scared that she will leave me and I start spamming her with desperate sad messages and this way I overwhelm her. Then I promise I won't do it again but every time I end up breaking my promises. I can't control the way I react to things. It's all my fault. I am disgusting and abnormal. 

The past few days have been excruciatingly painful. She is acting very cold and told me she feels uncomfortable and scared to talk to me because I might make a "huge situation" again.
Yesterday we had a good conversation so I thought maybe things are okay but today she deleted me from her instagram bio and I felt like I got stabbed in the chest. When I asked her why she did it, she said its just a bio, no one knows its me because I have no pics in my profile so its pointless to keep me there and that she just wants to make her instagram the way she wants to. I don't understand. She kept me in her bio for 3 months. Only her friends follow her, she's not a social person. I don't see why she won't add me back in her bio. I also feel like she did that to test my reaction again and I failed. I don't know what to do now. The fact that she won't add me back to her bio, makes my trust issues 5 times bigger even if I know she's not a cheater. Please help me. I feel very bad. 

I know it's cliche but I can't live without her. If I don't have her, I can't be happy. I can't be happy even if I meet another girl, even if I meet someone better. I only want her. I fucked this whole relationship up with my fears. She was an amazing girlfriend until I ruined everything. I don't know how to deal with this now. I don't want to live
