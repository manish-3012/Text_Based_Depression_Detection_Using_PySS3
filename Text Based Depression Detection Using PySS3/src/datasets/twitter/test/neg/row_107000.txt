I've been dealing with dread and death focused thoughts.Gay teen on my candid account here. I recently just got over my guilt for animal abuse i have committed in the past, and are actively focusing on improving myself in moral regards. But within the past month I have come across an increasingly unavoidable dread. I think about death all day. I cannot seem to take my mind off of death, what happens after death, and the transient nature of life itself. It almost seems alluring like a form of seduction. I'm not certain where to go with my life right now.
