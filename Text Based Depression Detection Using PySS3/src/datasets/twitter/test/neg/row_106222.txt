Suicide Hotline made me feel more suicidalI called the hotline after a pretty terrible night, and the guy who i talked to ended up making me feel so bad. I'm sure they're just going off a script and they're just kind people who want to help others, but I needed an empathetic ear who would understand me and then give me good reason not to kill myself. 

Instead the conversation went something like:
- Well who's your support system? 
This question, and hashing out my lack of support system, made me awful. He asked about my parents. Another source of feeling awful and unsupported. Thinking about my lack of support system put me pretty low.
- What do you normally do when you're having these thoughts?
Distract myself. Watch TV, fall asleep, try to ride out the feeling
- Do you think you'll kill yourself right now?
Probably not, I guess. Or at least I haven't in the past, and that may indicate I'm not doing it tonight. I thought I'd call this hotline instead.
- How would you kill yourself/do you currently have the means to carry out this plan?
Described plan, and yes.

And then I think he decided I'm fine and that I wasn't an immediate danger and that was it.
Obviously I'm currently alive, so I clearly wasn't about to do it. And I guess they want to keep the line open for the most immediate threats. But getting pushed off the suicide hotline is probably the lowest thing I can imagine. After he hung up I just cried for an hour thinking about how pathetic it all is that the Suicide Hotline doesn't even want to talk to me. 

What were your experiences?
