HelloHi. I'm not really sure what I'm meant to say.

I've been thinking about killing myself almost daily for two years and I've reached the point where I think I have to make a decision. I don't feel like I'm crazy; I'm a very high functioning person, and I know I should be proud of what I've achieved over my life. I don't feel any sense of attachment to the people around me and it's just getting too hard to fake being happy. I don't have anyone who'll talk to me anymore so I thought I should at least try you guys.

I'm really sorry if I'm wasting your time. Thank you.
