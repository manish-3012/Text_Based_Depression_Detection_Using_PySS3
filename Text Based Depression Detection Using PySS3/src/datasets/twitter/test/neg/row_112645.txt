I hate my life.My fiancÃ© ended things with me today. Apparently after 3 years plus six months of an engagement it's ok to then decide you're not compatible anymore. 
Cool. I get it. With that combined with an entire lifetime of garbage from being raped for 3 hears straight as a child, to years of other physical and mental abuse, I think I'm finally ready to say fuck this world. I'm too sick of my life being nothing but a depressive joke where I take all the abuse I can until I finally end it.
I'm there now. I'm done.
