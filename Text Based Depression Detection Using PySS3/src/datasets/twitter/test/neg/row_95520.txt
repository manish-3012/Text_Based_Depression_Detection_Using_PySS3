The gun is so close...Just went and held my shotgun. It's so pretty. Took all the will power I have to put it back. I can hear it calling me. Wtf am I even doing. Last week I zoned out so bad I couldn't move. I was around other people. One of the few things I can remember is someone saying they were creeped out by how my eye looked glassy. No one talks to me anymore I think they think I'm crazy. Which I guess I am haha. My parents stole my food again today wuptido. I am so going to snap someday. I feel so close to it too. In class a few days ago I ended up having to walk out everything was just so much. The teacher was pissed about me not understanding shit. Well ofc I don't understand shit my brain won't work right anymore. Worst part is feel like this just makes me laugh uncontrollably. Like wtf. I guess I'm just a selfish bastard that wants the easy way out even though there are people who need me. Or maybe I'm just trying to make myself feel better and no one needs me. Hope it's the later. It's all just too much haha.
