Has the world become more absurd in the last 3 years?Do you feel that world before was serious and real, and in the last years it's become increasingly nonsensical?. And by "world" I mean people; the material constitution of the universe is the same, but people seem more stupid, more hypocritical and in general, less authentic.

I feel like there's isn't any real person anymore, everyone is so fake, and I've caught myself being fake just to fit in. I can't even be myself anymore.

Sorry for the nonsensical post, but, what do you think about it?
