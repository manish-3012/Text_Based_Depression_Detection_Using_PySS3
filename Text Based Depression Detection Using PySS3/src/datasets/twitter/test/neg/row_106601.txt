Can't stop thinking about suicide. The dread of waking up in the morning is becoming too much.Little bit of info about me, 19M my childhood was lovely till the age of 11 when I moved to a foreign country with my family. Ever since then my life has been nothing but solitude, disappointment and humiliation. I sucked at school and could never focus as the only thing I wanted to do was join the military, I always wanted to be a soldier and I  thought I'd love it. 

I joined up last year and it has just turned out to be a nightmare. I'm terrible at soldiering and I don't enjoy it at all, I am still so alone every minute of the day and I can't take this prison-esque feeling any more. 

My original role in the army was as a dog handler, my dream role I thought. Turned out I was terrible at that too. I ended up scraping through trade training but I decided to transfer as it wasn't for me and I didn't enjoy it like I thought I would. I'm now in a different job as a trainee again, so back to being treated like an infantile turd rather than an adult turd. I start my course soon but I'm pretty sure it'll turn out like everything else, and I'm stuck on this god awful camp for a year before I can get posted. The only twinkle of hope I have left is going for airborne squadron as I like PT, but I'm pretty sure I'll fail, I'm not great at it and my hatred for soldiering won't exactly work in my favour. That hope has dwindled very quickly.

I only have my parents and sister, they are amazing. They are all I have, and I miss them every minute of every day. When I was driving back to camp yesterday I wished that a car would spin out of control, hit me and kill me instantly. That's how much of a coward I am, trying to dodge the blame so at least I wouldn't go with my family furious at me for causing them such pain. I feel I need help, I don't know where to go or what to do. I can't take the silence of loneliness any more. I just want to be content with life again, like I was as a kid.
