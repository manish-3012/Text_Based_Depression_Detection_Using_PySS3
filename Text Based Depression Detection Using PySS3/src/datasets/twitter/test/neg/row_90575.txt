A letter just came to my house and now I feel like harming myselfI had an emergency brain MRI with contrast because the neurologist thinks I am leaking brain fluid out of my spine. My spine's burst open basically, and this has led to me being disabled for years. I tried very hard to get doctors to see me and do this type of scan.

So I had the scan on the 22nd, and I requested to get a copy of the MRI images so I could see them. They told me they'd send a letter where I have to sign it, I thought ''okay simple enough''.

A letter came earlier today, and it's a fucking joke. A literal fucking joke. It asked me to give away my driver's license (I don't drive because this condition affects my fucking eyes), my birth certificate, my passport (I haven't flown in 10 years because it's dangerous for me), and a letter from the hospital. I have a letter from the hospital to my address but they're asking for two. I have to give up my birth certificate, passport or driver's license permanently just to see some pictures. What the actual fuck..

So I'll never get the fucking MRI images and here I was thinking I wouldn't be disappointed for the first time in my life. I felt like ripping up the letter so badly I had to give them to a friend.
