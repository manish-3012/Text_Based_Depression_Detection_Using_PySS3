Update: "I just finished all my suicide letters."
I told my husband I'd be home tonight, despite spending a couple nights out for space. Nothing was done wrong except a bad fight. I've been trying to call him to come home. To maybe save me. And he's not answering. I can't find him. I'm sitting here with a noose and I just want him to save me.
