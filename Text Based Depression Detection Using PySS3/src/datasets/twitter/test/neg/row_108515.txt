What's your reason for living?I'll start,
When my depression hits me the hardest and I feel like leaving this place, I go down the list reasons to sTay.

My number one reason is my dad. He's been there for me through thick and thin. I don't know how he would take the news but I think he would take it the hardest.

Next would be my grandma, I'm 23 years old but she till calls me her baby. She's the typical grandma  (think of spongebob's grandma) she's always been supportive of every decision I've ever made. Always saying. "You're so smart you should go to college" or "why don't you have a girlfriend? You get better looking every time I see you"

Last would be my two best friends. Both whom have left and joined the airforce. Leaving me alone in this shit hole town. I think about how they would deal with it. Though I'm sure they're use to not having me around by now.  
So yeahhh.  
What keeps you here?
