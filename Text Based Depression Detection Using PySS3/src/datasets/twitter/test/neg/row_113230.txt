I've nowhere to turn. I was born into limitation.I'm an undocumented immigrant. My parent's brought me to the US when I was five. I grew up as an American with American values and customs.

I graduated high school last year with honors and a 4.0. Life has been meaningless since than. The only desire for living my life was continuing my education. I tried to make the best of my situation by working for the past year to save for college and attend this fall. I was accepted into a small college, and everything seemed hopeful. They even helped me with 1/4 of the costs for tuition.

That is until a week a go. One of the scholarships from a private fund on which I was critically relying said that I would only receive half of what was promised. It is too late to look for scholarships that cater to my situation now.

My world has collapsed. Even if I worked for another year I wouldn't be able to pay for 1 year of college. Tuition is around $30,000 because I have to pay out-of-state tuition. 

I only live with my mother who is also undocumented and poor (cleans houses for work). She could care less about my ambitions of going to college. I can't find a job because I'm undocumented. I can't return to Mexico because I don't know anyone in Mexico and I would be homeless if I returned.

Life seems the same without school or a job. My friends have gone on to college and forgotten about me. For example, I have not spoken to anyone for the past week. I think I last told my mother I was going to my room, or something like that. We barely talk with each other. I am tired of living this way or living like this forever. I wish it could just stop. I don't know what to do. I'm hopeless. The motivation and energy that I had as a younger teenager has completely disappeared.  My yearning for knowledge is slowly dying. That is the only thing keeping me alive.
