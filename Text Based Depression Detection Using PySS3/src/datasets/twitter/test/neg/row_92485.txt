Feeling an intense need to die, but cant even get out of bed to complete my suicide plan.I have never been more hopeless than I am right now. My failed suicide attempts in the past were just me being too afraid to die. After ending up in the hospital and seeing many doctors and therapists the past 7+ years and the medications doing little to nothing is really a bummer. Sucks that doesn't work for me, though Im sure it helps others some how. 

Anyway I have never felt more alone and more purposeless than I do right now and for at least the past week. Feeling this way is exhausting and im sleeping 16-20+ hours on end. There is legit no help, hope, or purpose for me and believe that whole heartily. I am becoming more bitter by the second. Im now learning that I am meant to die young and I peaked very early. 

I just wish I could build the physical strength to go fulfill my suicide plan, though I can barely even make it to the bathroom. I dont even know what else to do with myself other than lay down all my thoughts here anonymously on reddit. Can someone give me some kind of energy source so I can do this? jesus
