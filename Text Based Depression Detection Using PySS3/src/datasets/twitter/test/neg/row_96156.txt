I feel like I'm almost on my limitI don't think I can take it any longer

The last two years were good I wasn't thinking about doing something stupid, but some months ago it all came back 

I feel like hurting myself, hitting myself on the head smashing my head against the floor, I feel like I'm very close to doing something stupid

I don't think I have any future that is worth living in front of me, I don't understand what went wrong or when it went wrong

I can't stop imagining how things could have been if I could just change a second in my past 


It's like I'm in the bad ending of a point and click game 

I've never been diagnosed with anything, I don't know if o have depression or something but I'm tired, I'm tired of all the stress, I'm tired of doing mistakes over and over again, I just want it all to stop, I just want a chance, a fresh start.
