Losing my mind. Albeit slowly.One thing that Iâ€™ve noticed about myself is that I have a feeling of slipping. Like Iâ€™m losing control of my emotions and how I feel about anything. And also sometimes lose control of my actual thoughts and thought processes. There are times when my thoughts are total chaos and the next day it will be a similar chaos but maybe one or two more added nuances thrown in there. Day after day like that. And today I caught myself talking to myself. Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™ve always done that or not. But today I at least noticed that I was doing it and it terrified me enough to calm down for a minute and check myself back a little. Ive heard other stories of feeling chaotic internally and itâ€™s pretty fascinating. Not sure if thatâ€™s another step closer to getting help or not. Weâ€™ll see. 

Thanks,
Me
