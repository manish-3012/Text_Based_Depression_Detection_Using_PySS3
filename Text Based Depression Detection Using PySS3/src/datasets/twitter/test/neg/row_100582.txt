24 years old. A coward and failure.I'm going to hang myself. I don't want to do it at home because I'm not keen on traumatising my younger brother or sister. I've been trying to find a way to hang myself in my car. If I can't, then I'll be slashing my wrists. 

I haven't been formally diagnosed with depression, but I can feel the toll it takes on myself. Medication or support through therapy cannot help significantly; especially since the primary reasons are tumultuous family relationships, hostile home environment, financial troubles and long term unemployment. 

The reasons are obviously linked and there is no single resolution. Long term persistence and capital are needed to make lasting impact, and these are in short supply for myself. 

I should've euthanised myself sooner. The future brings up anxiety and it leaves me immobile. Leaving my home for anything, or even just editing my resume, makes me exhausted. I'm ashamed to face others. 

I don't want to die, but euthanasia is increasingly becoming a single option for me. 

Is there anything I can do to help myself? Is there anything I can do to ease myself into my decision to become better?

Thanks,
