One last tryLong story short. I have ADHD. Everyone includingg school and counsellors would suggest that I have it. I know for sure that I have ADHD. Because I grew up in narsisstic environment I was always minimized and said that I have nothing and that I'm lazy. My Narcissist father was able to manipulate the doctors into believing that I do not have ADHD. Even though the school itself sent me to the tests.  They didn't ask me anything. I was not asked how I feel or what are my thoughts. I didn't get the chance to tell my truth like the kids who were diagnosed. I will not get too into my symptomps because I am tired of explaining how I work. It's like having to say thousands of times that I have dark brown hair. Whenever I do the online tests I always score very high. Tomorrow I will be visiting doctors who will hopefully appoint me with the right psychiatrists. I am very afraid they won't take me seriously. I have read many stories where people manage to get the diagnosis only after millions of attempts. I have already explained this same thing to psychiatris but all I got was "ok, but hey try to find a place where you could have help on monday" I do not have the money or the patience. I WILL NEVER CHANGE. I WILL NEVER ADAPT. So if this doesn't work I'm ending my life.
