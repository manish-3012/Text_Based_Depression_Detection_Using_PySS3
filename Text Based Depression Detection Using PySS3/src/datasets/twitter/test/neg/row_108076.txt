Help in writing a suicide note, please
Sorry for the lenght and my english, it's not my first language.
I need your help in writing a suicide note. Soothing and uplifting as much as possible. I'm not sure if i want to go through with killing myself, but even if i don't it would help to know how to have an honest and least hurting talk with my family.

I'm a long time lurker here on SW and reddit in general, but i can't seem to find a testimonials of surviving members of a person who commited suicide. I would love if you could direct me to such threads if you remember them.

I was weird and depressed since i can remember. I was a toddler philosophing away on a sense of living and nature of cosmos and religion. 
I never felt a need to go on. I was always flabbergasted by people's drive to live. Since i was ten, every year blowing candles on my birthday cake I wished to die, to have brain tumour or something. 

I tried to kill myself 8 years ago with no success. No one knows about it.
I tried to live and work on myself since then, for all those years until now, I tried everything - psychiatrist, drugs, self-help books (I mastered them), soothing arts and crafts, sports (I'm so fucking fit now), alcohol, comedy, music, films, cheerful friends, various consuming jobs, witnessing miracles of nature and so on. I feel like I'm living behind a glass tank. 

Nothing can change my mind.

So I ask you now - all you normal sensible people - If I wrote that I tried to kill myself 8 years ago and that since then I REALLY tried to continue living just for Your well being - would it be a little comforting?

If I explained that I was struggling with a disease that I researched on for years and couldn't find a cure, would you feel less guilty for not knowing about my sick state all along? 
I never confided in anyone, I didn't want to burden them with my fucked up problems. 

The well being of my loved ones is really important to me. As far as I know there's not even a real medical, physical proof of depression, so just please help me comfort my family.

I'll be grateful for every insight and thoughts.
Thanks for your time and effort.
Sorry for the messiness, I'm really drunk right now.
