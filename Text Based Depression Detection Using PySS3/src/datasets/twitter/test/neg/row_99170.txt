there is no one worth fighting for18, pretty depressed, lots of problems. your typical sw poster. there is one thing i was thinking about, there is no one in my life worth fighting for. like i study, work hard and stuff but if i am going to be alone like this all the time, whats the point? i got no one as a motivation. its really making things harder.
