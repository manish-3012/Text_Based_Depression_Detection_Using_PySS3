I am genuinely scared right now that Iâ€™ll kill myself someday.Itâ€™s just so sad. Iâ€™ll die without accomplishing anything in life, while other than disappointing others. I just canâ€™t deal with this right now for some reason. I am going to kill myself, like really die. 

I just donâ€™t know. 

I would miss out on so many things, not that I have missed out my almost whole childhood but I would actually never get to be better person, someone liked by everyone, someone successful. Iâ€™ll be just another suicidal person-dead. 

Iâ€™ll be dead. Everyone would blame themselves instead of blaming me. Iâ€™ll be dead.
