Writing down my thoughtsI feel cold and empty. I want to die in my sleep tonight. I've asked this many times, but please, PLEASE, let it happen this time. The pain is unbearable.

I know my family is worried &amp; I can feel their pity towards me. It makes me sick.

I'm a failure. My life has gone to shit. I see nothing good in the future - life is meaningless. Nothing. Matters. I've spent all of my youth suffering &amp; I'm starting to think that there's nothing else in store for me. I've lost myself.

The intrusive and violent suicidal thoughts aren't going away. Lately they've been getting gorier &amp; harder to control.

Please let me die tonight.
