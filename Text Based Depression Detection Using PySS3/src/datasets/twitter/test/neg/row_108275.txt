c'mon already -_-it's ridiculous how much time I spend thinking and fantasizing or telling myself "once it's bad enough and we can or don't want to face the negativity, then we'll do it" and soo much bad stuff has happened and I just keep using that excuse every time.. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm realizing now that it's no longer an option to keep telling myself to put it off. The reality of it actually happening is quite nerve wracking, but I think I've got it down now finally.. not sure when, but I'm really looking forward to the next however many days. Everything is just too painful and it hurts to think of how much of a piece of crap I am. I don't treat people nice, even lovers... I get irritated and paranoid because of my depression and it's a hopeless cycle.

Well anyway, i'm gonna hopefully sign off here for one last time and start getting prepared.

Thank you to whomever reads this. I appreciate some sort of acknowledgement since I don't want to go on such a lonely note.
