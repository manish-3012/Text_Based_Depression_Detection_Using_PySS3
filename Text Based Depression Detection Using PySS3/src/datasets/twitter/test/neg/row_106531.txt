There really is no point.Weâ€™re raised to consume and hope that someday we may eventually be comfortable. Iâ€™ve got a bachelors in accounting and make barely above minimum wage. I literally never have money despite doing â€œeverything rightâ€. We serve our Bourgeois overlords and thatâ€™s all there is to it. I have no right to complain when there are plenty of people going through way tougher situations. But I donâ€™t care. Fuck the system, religion, and politicians that failed us. My only hope is that thereâ€™s peace in death because living this life is hell.
