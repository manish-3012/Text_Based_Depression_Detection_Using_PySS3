I don't even know where to start...I just feel like I'm falling apart. I used to hold onto things ideas like wanting children in the future to get me though hard times, but they've stopped working. I literally am to emotionally tired for those "tricks" to work. I just want to not exist. I hate every moment from the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep. And then I don't sleep at least not much. I feel like my place in this world has just started collapsing and the place that I fit just keeps getting smaller and smaller until it will collapse completely. I'm scared. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't feel like I can.
