Is it weird if i just want to die after having tons of money for my family, wife, and children?Title sums it up. I just want to get a lot of money so everyone knows im rich and have it all. Perfect life, and invest a lot of money for my children to get his life together till he can be a man someday. I personally do not have a desire to see my future grandchildren. 

Just let my wife, kid, family live their happy live is enough. Then i just want to die and give em all those money i have saved for legacy.
