i want to say goodbyeI don't feel worth my life. I'm a waste of resources. No one wants me around and I'm a burden. So much of me wants to help others and love them but everyone I meet eventually hates me. The only self worth I have left is of an image of myself dead. Being dead is the only way I can help others.

I can't see myself living with distorted reality and being reminded so frequently that the awful things voices say about me are true...
That loved ones whose voices intrude my head telling me how horrible of a person I am are true...
I want to so badly feel like I belong here because of how magnificent the world around me is..
I'm in so much pain that I can't partake in the beauty

I have so many ideas on how I could end my life but no way to really enact my fantasies without preparation, and I'm only slowly working up to these things :(
