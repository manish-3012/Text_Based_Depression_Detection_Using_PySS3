Iâ€™m 16 and I havenâ€™t wanted to live since I was 10.At age 7, I lost my dad. He died. I was heartbroken. 

At 12, the flashbacks started. My father, his pants down, the smell of alcohol, him instructing me how to touch him. â€œSqueeze. You have to squeeze.â€ I can still fucking hear it. I want to stab myself in the fucking ears and vomit when I think of it. I started cutting. 

At 13, I wanted attention from older men. It was disgusting. I cry when I think of it. My depression worsened. I came out as trans. 

At 14, I started doing drugs after losing my grandma. My bestfriend. I was snorting morphine and cocaine daily. Getting drunk on the weekends and during school. I told my sister about our father while we were drunk. â€œHe didnâ€™t mean it. He loved you.â€ Bullshit. I became violent and angry. I thought I was either going to kill myself or kill someone else. My intrusive thoughts drove me mad. The hallucinations and paranoia started. I had a breakdown. I focused on serial killers and gore sites for release. 

Two months before my 15th birthday, I tried to kill myself. I snorted all the morphine I had, which was a lot. I took 5 tylenol 3â€™s. I drank. I woke up and threw up everywhere. I went to school that day, my pupils small, vomiting &amp; crying all day. I got taken to the hospital. They called my mom. My mom cried and I wouldnâ€™t let her touch me. I was losing my mind over being alive still. 

Iâ€™ve dealt with severe depression since I was 11. Being suicidal since that time, too. I experienced heartbreak, I grew up too quickly, I lost my virginity at 13. Iâ€™m failing school. I cant fucking focus anymore on anything other than dying. I quick taking my meds, instead Iâ€™m saving up for the right time. Hopefully soon after I get my next refill. Iâ€™ll take them. The only time I felt okay was when I thought I was dying. I canâ€™t fucking stand myself or breathing anymore. Itâ€™s not going to get better. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m 16 and done with fucking everything. Everything. Nothing is worth sticking around for. I just wanted my story to be somewhere before I go. If I had a gun in my hand right now, I would be gone.
