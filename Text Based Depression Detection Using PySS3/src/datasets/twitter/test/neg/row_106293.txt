The world is evil. I'm gone.I used to remember joking about pedos, I made fun of them by acting like an idiot pedo. Now, that I have seen the news, pedos are not a joke, a joke is when you laugh, pedos aren't laughter, they're evil reminders. I was inspired by u/diamondstuff

The world is evil, many evil people exist. Nazis have existed, they've done unspeakable crimes towards their enemies. I'm not feeling well anymore.

I once made a post acting like a pedo, I wasn't actually a pedo, but acted like one to laugh it off. I was thinking of acting like a murderer too, but I have seen the news, and I wondered, is it morally wrong for me to joke about people torturing children?

The news is a good place for evil to be seen. I don't feel well anymore.
