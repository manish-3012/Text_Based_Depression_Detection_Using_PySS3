i have no idea what i'm even supposed to dohi im a 19 yo trans girl 

i dont know what to do, im so lost and afraid of never being happy with myself, i hate my face and body, some days they seem ok, but some days i look in the mirror and i guess my brain just decides im the ugliest person in the world, i dont think ive ever felt my dysphoria as bad as it is right now, and i know itll be okay but my head feels like its about to explode from the stress, i always try to remind myself how it would affect my friends but i just want it to be over already

i plan on starting hrt in a few months, which is exciting, as well as college, also exciting but i dont know how im gonna handle it
