i have given up on almost everything, at least that's how I feel right now.I have quit school, it was horrible going there everyday while being depressed and all. My parents don't seem to understand me and I am at the point where I feel suicidal and what's holding me back is my boyfriend who lives very very far away. So I'd say I am not directly suicidal, I just think a lot about it even tho I wouldn't be able to do it. All I'd want to ask for here is some good words... I have been in meetings for 5 hours today so I really don't feel like talking about my situation more... I just need some good words to make me feel less like a fail person and maybe a bit more cheerful... I am always so negative, I told my mom that jumping from a bridge sounds more appealing than continuing life, why am I this negative..
