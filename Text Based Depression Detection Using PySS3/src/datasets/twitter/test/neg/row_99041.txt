my life is not getting betterright now im 12, i have almost no confidence or self esteem anymore my life is so shit and i just cant take it anymore, my parents are not together but not even divorced since they didn't marry. when im with my mum we have financial issues and during the week i have to go to school. i have really stopped caring about myself and im doing really bad in almost every subject and then i get all this guilt and on the weekend i have to go to my dads house, and being around him makes me want to die even more as he is either humiliating in public or the worst man i know like when he tells me my mum is going to kick me out when im 16 because he doesn't have to pay for me and i have accidentally told my friends i am suicidal and now they think im weird but i try telling them its a joke so no one cares and although i haven't attempted i have been inflicting minor self harm like burning my hand with a candle until it was really hot or stabbing myself in the leg with a compass that thing used to make circles or something and i have so many regrets and my best friend said it will get better but i dont think it will.
