So this is my plan for tonightMy mother just left to my aunt with her boyfriend, so I have the whole night before anyone comes. Right now I can drink my tea in peace, then finish the letter for my best friend and make some more recordings as she wanted, because I speak better than I write...



Then I should check my belongings and write notes so that people know what to do with them. Give a part to my best friend, some other stuff to burn and the rest to donate.



I should copy all the stuff my mother needs from my computer since I promised my best friend she'll have it and because I need her to send some post-mortem messages. It might be an ugly way of letting people know I died, but talking with them before will only make them feel guilty afterwards. So I have to write them some letters too, and especially to mom.



Then I'll make myself a coffee and finish the cigarettes I kept for this evening while watching the snow in the cold night, listening to my favourite tunes. 



Then take a shower, change clothes, meditate, and die, quick enough to avoid thinking of my only regret, and that is the pain I'll cause to the people around me. 



But...I'm not waiting anymore. In this curiously calm atmosphere I want to stick to my plan. I'm glad this part of the internet exists, because I truly believe it can help people, so thank you beautiful human beings. Please keep spreading love, hope, wisdom, knowledge, compassion and words that can save lives.
