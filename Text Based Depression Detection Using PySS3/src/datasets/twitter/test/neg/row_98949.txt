A Train WreckI'm staring at a date on the calendar, knowing that will be the last day I have a place to call home. My life has been a solid downward slide for, I'd say, two decades now. Each year has gotten worse. Every chance I've taken has ended poorly. I've struggled with being diagnosed as bipolar since I was 18. During one of my manias I was arrested and got charged with a felony. That was four years ago and I've been unable to get a job since that point.

I was fortunate enough to be able to move in with my boyfriend and he supported me for three years until we broke up last fall. For the past year I've been struggling to keep my rent paid and food in my kitchen. It's exhausting and stressful. I've lost an enormous amount of weight and dealt with a fair bit of health issues these past few months. 

Recently I got to the point where my only viable option to make money to pay my bills was to consider prostitution. It was a heartbreaking realization that the only potential means of surviving was to sell my body.

I have no family willing to help, they're extremely religious and believe that my mental health issues are related to demonic possession. My friends aren't capable of assisting me in any meaningful way and yet they've still tried to help with feeding me. I've been a huge burden on them. 

Knowing all these things and getting rejected from yet another job interview made me consider prostitution. I contacted a woman who runs an escort service and she sent a man to meet me and see what I had to offer. The sex was horrifying and painful. When he was finished he informed me that I was too fat and not the pretty kind of fat to make them any money. He told me to try to market myself or find something else. 

I posted ads on various places online where people go to buy sex and waited. I messaged men on forums and waited for responses. Three weeks and not a soul has been willing to pay me. I'm not even good enough to be a whore.

Nine days from now rent is due. I have $11. I have no possible way to make the rest that's owed. I have no way to find someone else to pay it. I'll be homeless during the winter. I don't see the point in living for the sake of just being alive. I don't see any hope or glimmer of a future. I see cold dark nights and a long, drawn out decent towards death. So in 9 days I'm planning to kill myself. 

I'm worried right now about my best friend, my cat, my internet friends, and my ex. I'm worried about them not understanding why I've chosen to die. I'm worried about them feeling like they could have done something more for me. I want desperately to reduce the impact of my death as much as possible. I want to make sure someone who's been trained will be the one to find me but I feel guilty for wanting to foist that responsibility off on a police officer or EMT.

I want so badly to spend as much time as I can with the people I adore but I know if I were to get clingy they would know something was wrong. They all have faith I'll find some solution or that I'll be willing to live homeless. Instead I've been watching them all live their lives. I guess my point to posting here is to justify my choice to someone because I can't do it to the people I care for. I'm sorry for the novel.
