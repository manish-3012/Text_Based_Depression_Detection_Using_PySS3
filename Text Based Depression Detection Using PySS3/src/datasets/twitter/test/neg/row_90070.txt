I am very unhappyI really want to kill myself, My girlfriend tells me that we need to take a break because she is having feelings for her ex, (my own god damn cousin) so this was about a week ago and we still arenâ€™t together, well I talk to her today for a bit and we kinda argue about and it and she just straight up tells me that she wants to go for him and just fucking leave me so I have been contemplating just getting it over with at this point
