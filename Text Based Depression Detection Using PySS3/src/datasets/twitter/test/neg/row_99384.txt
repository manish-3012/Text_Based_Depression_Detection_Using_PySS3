I can't believe I actually have the "courage" to go through with it.I wouldn't call it courage, just a lot of apathy that you don't care anymore about what you'll leave behind. I really don't care anymore, I am just looking forward to dying that I am actually relieved , excited,and nervous. I ordered a rope that should be coming in 3 days right now. 

Is there any business affairs I should get done before dying?
