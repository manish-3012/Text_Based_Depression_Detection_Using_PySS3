I guess I'm in crisisI don't want to be alarming. I've been depressed for about 10 years now and suicidal for about the last 4 or 5. Over this time I was sure with each achievement I made or major life change I'd see some improvement in my condition. That's not the case. I've experienced a growing level of anxiety that is preventing me from participating in my own life. I'm so consumed by the voices in my head I can rarely be present. Writing this post makes me anxious. It's like I've hit a wall where I can't get out in order to fix the problem which just makes my depression worse. I also believe that I may possibly be Bipolar. A big reason I want to end my life is I don't feel like the genuine good person I used to be. Negative thoughts about others pop into my head unprovoked all the time now. Sometimes they can be very mean spirited. What does that say about my character? Do I somehow subconsciously hold these views?   


Things that used to bring happiness seem to just keep me afloat now. I no longer talk to my close friends about whats happening. It felt burdensome after a few years of going through episodes. I have succeeded at appearing happy and fulfilled though. It's draining. At this moment, and many before it, I want to die. I want the emptiness, the shame, the weakness, the anxiety, the negativity, and the paint to go away. It's gotten to the point where I hold a gun to my head a few times a week and close the bolt with a round chambered hoping it'll slamfire into my skull. I guess that way I would feel like it was a twist of fate rather than an act. I don't know how much longer I can do that..

  
 I've pushed away several girlfriends over the years and have seen some of my relationships atrophy. Photography was a passion of mine and I can't bring myself to pick up a camera anymore. I wonder if I'll ever feel happy again. If I'll ever be the person to enrich someone else's life and be able to support them in their time of need. At this rate I only see it getting worse. The sad part of all of this is it's probably just chemistry in my brain playing tricks on me. Maybe the thoughts are internalized hate that have been given some lines.   


Have any of you gotten out of this place? I'm reaching out because I need help. At the moment I'm not the easiest guy to talk to but I would appreciate some advice. How do you go about loving yourself from a place like this? Sorry for the rambling by the way. Hope your day is going well.
