I hate being on the edge at all times.You know how a day might seem that is going okay and you don't feel that bad, and the most MINOR thing that wouldn't really affect other people totally breaks you down? I feel so stupid for it. I keep thinking god am I a fucking baby? No one else's day would be totally ruined, or most people wouldn't end up crying due to this. This keeps happening to me almost every single day.
