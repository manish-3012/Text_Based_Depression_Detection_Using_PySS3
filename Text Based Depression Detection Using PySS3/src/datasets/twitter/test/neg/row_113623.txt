Putting people first even when life and death are on the lineIâ€™m diagnosed with clinical depression, anxiety, and borderline personality disorder and Iâ€™m on meds; however, Iâ€™m going through a rough time for a year now and these days have been the worst, I was starving myself and didnâ€™t leave bed for days and now i just wanted to do it. I have a lot of antidepressants and antipsychotics and my momâ€™s prescription drugs and i was just about to do it but i felt so fucking guilty because my mom is going through some medical issues and my sister is having a divorce and i felt like my suicide would be an added inconvenience. I feel so trapped and sick of living for the sake of other people. Iâ€™m tired and done, the people i feel guilty for donâ€™t seem to be understanding, i hinted to my father the other day that Iâ€™m thinking of death and he said nothing. 
Where i live there are no suicide hotlines, and there are no good psych facilities either, so itâ€™s either committing or sucking it up and Iâ€™m torn apart. 
I donâ€™t know what to do, i just wish i die out of the blue so I donâ€™t bare any of the guilt.
