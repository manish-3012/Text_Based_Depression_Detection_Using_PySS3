I'm not worth the air I breatheI'm not worth the food I eat, I'm not worth the friends I sort of have, I'm not worth the love I want but don't have, I'm not worth the time I take, I'm not worth the time it takes to make all my products, why did I have to be born?! 

It hurts to live. Nothing matters anyway, I will die, and the people who knew me will die, and my name will be spoken for the last time, so what's the point in staying? Nobody else benefits from me being here.

I like sleeping, it's like temporary death. I haven't had a dream in years. And I mean that in both senses of the word-I haven't had dreams in my sleep, and I haven't had any dreams for things I want in life. If sleeping is the sensation of death, sign me up.

Just kill me, please, if anybody scours this subreddit to look to murder people who want to die anyway, I'm in North VA, track my post for specifics, please. I'm the 16 year old boy.
