I was just at a train station on my own and it scared meI was just at a train station on my own, Iâ€™ve been out drinking with some old friends. I was standing there looking at the tracks and a train was coming and I thought I could just do it now. Every time Iâ€™m at the station I think that, but I never do it because Iâ€™m around people and something about that just puts me off waking onto the tracks. 

But tonight it was just me, and a couple other people down the other side of the platform, and I really thought I could do this. But I didnâ€™t, and I got on the train, and I donâ€™t know why but Iâ€™m so scared.
