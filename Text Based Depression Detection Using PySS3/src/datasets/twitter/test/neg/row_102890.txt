Attempted suicide and failed...I'm trying again tonight.My job is sucking the energy and life out of me. I've been trying to get help for my mental health but had to stop after moving back in with my parents. 

Nothing in life matters. I've been trying to kill myself but somehow I keep failing. I attempted two days ago, drank four bottles of codeine but all it did was make me puke - brushed myself and cried my way to work. 

I'm going to try again tonight - I was thinking of od-ing on something first and then try breaking my arm. If the suicide feeling still lingers, I'm jumping out my bedroom window. 

 I'm tired of living like this.
