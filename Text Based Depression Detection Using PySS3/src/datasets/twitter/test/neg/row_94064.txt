What is a good excuse for closing my accounts and withdrawing all funds?I have an appointment with a branch advisor at my bank tommrow morning about closing my accounts. I've recently cancelled all subscriptions tied to my credit card and I would like all savings withdrawn as a cashier's check. All accounts, CC and LOC are to be closed. I have no unpaid debts with the bank. I wont be transfering my resources to another institution so I'm curious what a good excuse is. I'm sure they will ask. 

Do I have to legally provide a reason?
