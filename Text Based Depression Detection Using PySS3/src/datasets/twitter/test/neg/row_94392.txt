Two days, no meds, ready to just stop everything.I'm not looking to die today, not sure where tonpost this though. I'm so done. Im not getting my homework done because my family needs me every minute of the day, were eating PB&amp;J and shitty freezer burnt meat because we're broke and lucky me I get to go sell my blood tomorrow to make ends meet, AND I get to take my infant to class with me, which means I'll learn nothing and distract everyone around me. 

I love school but I'm ready to just give up. I obviously can't do all this and should just bite the bullet and stay home where I belong...end of my rant. Thanks for reading...
