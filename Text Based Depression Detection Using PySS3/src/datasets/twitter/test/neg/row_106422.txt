I want to kill myself because I hurt a friendI will tell you how the story started. I have a group of friends and we play videogames together. The problem is one of my friends always get picked on and harassed by the bunch. I also started to mess around with him and make fun of him but today he told me how he felt about all of us and that he is trying to find new people and that he hates himself for even associating with us. He says that he looks down at his switchblade all the time and that he just wishes he would die and when I heard that couldn't forgive myself I have already cut myself once on each wrist not too deep though because i'm scared of the pain. I hate myself and everything about myself. I have lost one of my best friends. I just want to slit my wrists and bleed out I wish all the pain in the world on myself. I just want to fucking kill myself.. I hate myself. I don't know why i'm writing this. I don't want pity I just want someone to hear me out before I kill myself. Im doing this world a favor. By the time you read this I may be dead. Goodbye I FUCKING WANT TO DIE. I WILL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF.
