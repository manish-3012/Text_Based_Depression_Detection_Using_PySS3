When's it time to give upI've been suicidal every day of my life for 10 years, tried it atleast 5 times. It doesn't even mean anything to me anymore, doesn't scare me, dosent feel like a big thing. 3rd time I did it because I was bored. I stay alive because well, it's just laziness. But how long am I going to keep dragging this on. Its just uncomfortable. I can't feel anything, no sadness, no happiness, no love. Dysthymia/anhedonia you call it. Med's don't help. I have one really nice person in my life, like the best that any human can be and alot of decent ones too. I'm not suffering, I'm not sad. I can't explain why I'm drawn to it, there's nothing I'm trying to escape.

I just feel tired. Done shrinks since I was 13. I'm just deadpan about everything. I don't care about me or other people or the world. Not about being rembered or family or friends. I'm the type who could move away tomorrow to Antarctica and it wouldn't bother me. Don't know what I want you to say. Don't know what I want. I really just completely don't care about literally anything.
