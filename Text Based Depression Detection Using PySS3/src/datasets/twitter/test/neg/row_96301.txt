Feeling hopelessThey say that "it gets better". But it really doesn't feel this way. I have been largely unhappy for a while, but the fact that I don't have anyone in my life that I can speak to about my feelings makes me feel extremely hopeless. I've been doing my best to keep my head up, but it seems that the harder I try, the harder I fall back into depression. I can't help but feel resentful that hardly anything is working out in my favor in life. It feels like the universe is out to get me and make me feel as miserable as it can. I don't want to believe that that is happening, but that's what it feels like. And I feel extremely lost because I don't know who I can go to for help. I've been seeing a therapist but I'm not receiving enough emotional support from loved ones. I feel so trapped and I really don't know what to do. Sorry if this came across as whiny and/or annoying, but unfortunately I can't help but feel like this.
