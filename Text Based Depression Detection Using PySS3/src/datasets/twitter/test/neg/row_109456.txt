I CAN'T TAKE THESE MIGRAINESI'm already severely depressed, but I get migraines almost every day and nothing the doctor gives me works. I can't take it.

I'm 8 hours into my current pain and it's one of the worst ones yet. Nothing works. No OTC painkillers work. Ice or heat packs don't work. It doesn't matter if I lay down or sit up. I JUST WANT IT TO BE OVER. I CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT. Living is not worth it, what the fuck is this constant head pain? There is no god, why would he design us this way?

I know I'm just saying all of this because I'm in the middle of it, but I'm crying from this pain.
