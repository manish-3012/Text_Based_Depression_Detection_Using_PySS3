Will weed make me happy enough to save my life?I am so insanely miserable, I cant stand every minute of my existence. I have never done weed but its legal in Canada now. I am scared of it because I think I will do it all the time. 

But at this point I am about to end my life and maybe if I become a pothead then I will be ok.

Should I smoke weed?
