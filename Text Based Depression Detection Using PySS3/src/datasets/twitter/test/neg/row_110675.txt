spiraling down againi was getting so much better back in 2017/2018 and since the beginning of 2019, all I've been doing is spiraling downwards again. I've started self harming again after 7 months of not doing it. I've gained all the weight i lost and more. i feel like I'll never get anywhere in life at this point and with the whole pandemic going on, it feels like I'll never get a chance. not like it mattered anyways since i don't do shit to improve myself. all i do is stay home, go to work when i have to, and come back to either numb myself with entertainment again or lay in bed and cry. 


my friends have been there for me more than my own boyfriend has and it hurts. i love him so much but it feels like he doesn't care for me as much as my friends do. 


i feel stupid over everything and recently i just keep thinking that i can end it all right now if i wasn't so scared. i remember on my 19th birthday i was surprised i even managed to live as long as i have, given that I've tried offing myself three times in the past. im about to be 20 in a month and i don't know if i can live past my 20s. i don't want to burden everyone with my death if it happens but i don't know how much more i can take. everything hurts and not being useful makes killing myself a much prettier thought than I'd like it to be sometimes.
