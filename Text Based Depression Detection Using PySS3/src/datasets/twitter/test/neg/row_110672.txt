I found out earlyIâ€™m only 16 years old and doing amazing in school, but everything I try socially, fail and have done so my whole life, I have gained a lot of mental diseases, like depression and Iâ€™m one of those people who donâ€™t like doing daily stuff like working and cleaning the house.

 Iâ€™m on the edge of suicide and I canâ€™t get myself to do it, cause â€œdrinking is the solution to all my problems.â€ I have my oral exams in 14 days and I havenâ€™t started yet, cause I gave up a month ago, I also havenâ€™t told my parents that I gave up, I have no idea how to fix this mess
