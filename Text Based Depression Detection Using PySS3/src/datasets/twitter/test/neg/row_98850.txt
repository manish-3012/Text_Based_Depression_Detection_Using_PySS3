I'm crying and shakibg, I just need someone to talk to.Crosspost from /r/RaisedByNarcissists

Sorry for the sloppy typibg, my hands are shakibg.

My mom and I were walking tge dog and she thought it was the perfect time to start screamibg at me - in public, no less.

She told me fhat I'm lying to my therapist (about stuff that did happen, but I never told the tgerapist about), and that I'm lazy and I'm an awful person or something.

She said that I'm lying about childhoood trauma that I didn't even have and even got up in my fsce while screaming - sometging that really scares me and makes me panic.

She kept going when I was sobbing and begging for her to stop and I'm srill crying.

She screamed at me and goot in my face in public and I can't take it anymore. I think I'm having another breakdown but I don't have anyone to tallk to, unless you count my therapist, wwho my mom gets mad at me for texxtibg.

I don't think I'm ggoing to kill myself but I'm freakibg out and could uuse someone to tallk to.
