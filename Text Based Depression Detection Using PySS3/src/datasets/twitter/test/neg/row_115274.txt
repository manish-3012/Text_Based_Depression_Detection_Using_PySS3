After years of lying I don't know what to do anymore.I apologize if I'm not posting this in the right spot.

Anyways, I am a high school student who is relatively smart, but have a very low amount of motivation. This is a shitty combination, because people have high expectations for me that I am not able to live up to. My mom wants me to be successful, and has very high expectations for me, and to meet these standards I have been lying to her for the past few years of my life. Most of these lies are about my grades. At first I was fine with this, but lately I have been doing really poorly in school, and need someone to talk to. I would talk to my mom, but feel like death would be an easier solution than confessing to all of these lies.

To be honest, I've been considering suicide since I was in 6th grade. The only thing stopping me is my mom. She actually admitted to me a while ago that she would kill herself if I did. She is dependent on me (which is why she pushes me when it comes to my success), and I feel like it is unfair that she had me, and yet she is my responsibility.

Sorry if this post is not cohesive. My mind is very foggy right now. Any advice, comments, or questions would be appreciated. Thanks.
