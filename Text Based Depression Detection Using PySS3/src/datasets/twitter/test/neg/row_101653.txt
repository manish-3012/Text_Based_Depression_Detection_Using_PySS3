After my aunt wedding I will kill myself"You are an asshole because you will ruin the best year of her life!" 

Yes and no, I will be a bigger asshole if I done before her weeding. She really wants her family to be there for her, so I will be there. She's got the weeding in september, I will hang myself in octomber.I found a really nice tree on some hills away from town.It's remote, and...peaceful.I even practiced for quite some time the knot.

Why am I doing it? Stuck in foreign country, no job, no money, and my family says that I am a dick for wanting to leave.Even tho I dropped my entire life to come here not for me, but for mom to support her after a divorce. I stoped taking my antidepressants since my family says that I should not take any medicine, because I am fine and I am a douchebag for being depressed, because hey, I don't miss anything here. I started stuttering very, very bad for about 2 months now. I can't even buy cigarettes and dont feel like an autist.But hey, they say it's nothing wrong with me, I am just an asshole who complains.

I feel like I can't breathe and I always smile to them when I cook dinners imagining the day that I would say I will go for a walk and never return.I want these feelings to stop.I want a way out.And I will end this suffering, this year, one way or another.
