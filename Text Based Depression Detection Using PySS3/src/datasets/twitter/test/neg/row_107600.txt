The thoughts.I see many people pull themselves through much worse. It makes me feel like some kind of haemophiliac. Every cut and bruise that everyone else gets heals, but when I get the tiniest scratch I come close to bleeding myself dry. I truly have a weak soul. The situation is nothing compared to things I've read. I've simply been unemployed in the UK for a year, drifting away from all the connections I had and living all too comfortably with my parents. That's it. No abuse or hardship, just a gentle glide.

Why would that lead me to suicide? It should lead me to my phonebook, talk to some friends and some employers... Well...  I chill at the thought. I'll sit there with a text written to an old buddy, and I'll throw the phone away at the last minute in some pathetic fear that always emerges. I've done the same to this very post before. The last job interview was my first. I trembled all the way through, and when I left I was physically sick in their lawn. That was last October. 

I can't help but strongly feel that someone with such an aversion to people, and a lack of drive to change, can ever contribute to society. Of course I understand it's something I could maybe overcome with some help. Thing is, I lack the will to get it. It's as though there's a slope, at the top are things I want, but due to the nature of my problem (cutting off from friends, aversion to people, telling no one) the people who can help me push my weight up the slope are somewhere up and ahead, in the middle of the slope. I can't even make that first stretch. If I can't make that first stretch to them, why not just hit the bottom real hard? Well, that's what I've been thinking about.

I don't believe in an afterlife. I understand that the universe is only going to compile this body once. As a result, only once in the entire history, and maybe future, of the universe will I ever be able to be me. Only once can I experience anything. Ever. This is the same for everyone who knows me. So it's almost criminal to fill the limited experiences of others with the negative emotions my death could bring. That's what kept me alive thus far. However the longer I stretch this thought the more it seems a cop out. Am I really saying I'm alive solely because I don't want to make some people cry? I'm beginning to think "well, tough!" For obvious reasons I was never asked for consent to enter life. If you've got so attached to this unwilling creature as to unknowingly coerce it into maintaining a life unconsented, maybe that's your problem. I don't want to experience the ridiculous thing I am any longer. I almost don't want to improve myself either. I just wish I was never here at all.

That's where the latest thoughts have come in. Recently the objects in my home, locations near where I live, all the deadly things have started to highlight themselves to me. Not a day passes where I don't have a little film play on the canvas in my head detailing one or more of these situations. Sometimes it's reassuring, other times I recoil and wonder why I'd even contemplate such things. There probably is more to say, but I've wasted 5 paragraphs of someone's day so I'll end.
