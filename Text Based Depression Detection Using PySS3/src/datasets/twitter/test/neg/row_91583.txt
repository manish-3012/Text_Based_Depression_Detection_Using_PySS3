Iâ€™m paying off all my debts and then Iâ€™m gone.I canâ€™t hold on anymore. Thereâ€™s not a single person I feel would miss me. Iâ€™m going to pay off my debts from dropping out of university so I have no more loose ends then Iâ€™m out. I really tried but I canâ€™t anymore. The countdown starts today.
