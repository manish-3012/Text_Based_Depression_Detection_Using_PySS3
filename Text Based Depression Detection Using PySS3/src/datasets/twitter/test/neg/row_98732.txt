So, why should I live?I just don't see the reason to live. I'm just going to pay off my college loans then buy myself a nice .44 caliber to end it. 

I'm tired of neglect. I'm tired of live only being about work. I'm tired of paying escorts because I cannot talk to girls properly without being creepy. I just want to drink alcohol. I hate my family. My "friends" don't seem to know that I exist. I'm getting tired of getting flashbacks of a person I couldn't help, I guess this is PTSD. 

I just suffer alone without anyone to talk to. I don't want help. I just want it to end.

I'm not sure why I'm expressing this here, I guess I'm looking any bullshit reason to live.
