nothing i do is ever good enoughi wake up and see no reason to get out of bed. everything is boring and i have lost the energy to continue forward. i want to sleep forever and i want to end it all right here for the better. its hard to do that when i have friends and family who would miss me though. i dont know why they would. i annoy my family to get reactions out of them, i get ticked off when told to do something by them, i try so hard to make others smile yet i seem stupid in the end, the list goes on.

i never change, no matter what i do to try it never works. its not good enough. if i cant change my habits then i dont know what to do. i hate how i act i really do, i wish i could restart this life to make many changes. theres something missing in me that makes me feel so unsatisfied. im empty and everything makes me bored

ive drank alcohol to feel something, nothing. ive self harmed for a long time and i still feel nothing. when i eat i dont feel full. just empty. i act annoying and unbothered to fool others into thinking theres nothing wrong. i cant stop feeling empty

i dont know what im doing on here, oversharing on reddit of all places i could have ran to. my life isnt that terrible so i really dont understand how i complain like this... its my fault. i need to change some things

i just have nobody to talk to about these things.. nobody to give me advice or anything like that. i keep it inside and bottle up my feelings because all the responses ive ever gotten by friends were â€œohâ€ or â€œkâ€.. its okay though right

if by chance you did fjnish reading this i really hope everythings okay on your end too. i hope your familys okay during this time with the pandemic, and that you are well. sorry for rambling i just.. really needed to get this ojt.
