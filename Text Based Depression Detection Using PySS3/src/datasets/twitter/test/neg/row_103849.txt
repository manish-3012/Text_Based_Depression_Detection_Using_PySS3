My only friend Abandoned meI have recently started dating an older guy. He's kind, generous and is a very beautiful human.
He's supported me when I have had abuse at home. My parents were beating me. I made a friend and she has been my life line. She was my greatest supporter and she gave me courage.
I recently told her about my realtionjsip and she went mental.

She threatened to tell my abusive parents where I was living with my partner. She even went as far as calling me dumb and stupid. I don't know what to do. My partner has literally had enough of the whole situation and he announced we would be better off broken up. I feel so suicidal rn.

I just want someone to smother me with a pillow and just be done with it.
