I don't knowI have been thinking about ending it every day for months and on and off for over 10 years, since I was 14. I feel like I let everyone in my life down all of the time. 

I am a terrible parent, mostly because I don't enjoy spending time with my child, I miss him when I am not with him, but get annoyed very quickly. I work very hard not to yell at him and I would never hit or physically hurt him in any way, but spending time with him feels like a second job. I hate it because I know what it feels like to be unwanted by your parents. I do want my son, but just can't enjoy my time with him.

I am a terrible partner. I take out my unhappiness on my partner. I get angry at myself and take it out on my partner.

I don't have any other family or friends. 

I'm okay at my job, but I think a lot of people could do better. 

I just feel like everyone would be better off without me. My partner could find happiness and my son probably wouldn't remember me.
