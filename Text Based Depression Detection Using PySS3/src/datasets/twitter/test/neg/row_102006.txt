Update from my last post in which I said August 1 would be last day (it still will be)Hey, thank you everyone on all your feedback. I guess I wasnâ€™t expecting a response at all. Iâ€™ve been having a really tough time dealing with a significant life change. The truth is Iâ€™ve dealt with depression in the past and I canâ€™t take this endless circle of going back into it. I am told I have very good coping skills (Iâ€™m very active, Iâ€™m a sub 3 hour marathoner, I also eat very healthy, have good relationships with others, therapy, medication) but due to some other personal stuff I keep getting in this rut and push people that matter to me away while I spiral into another depression. Itâ€™s heartbreaking to watch myself do this all and have little no control over it. Bottom line is I canâ€™t go through this again. Iâ€™m ready to die and Iâ€™m not afraid to. I just want to give myself one more chance.
