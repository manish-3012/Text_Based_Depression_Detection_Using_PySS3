Need help finding meaning after my mothers deathMy mother was everything to me she was the only person I could talk to about everything.And she was there for me during everything during school I would constantly text her about everything that was going on in school and I'd tell I loved her more times than I can count and she was always there to pick me up after school and when we were home I'd always see her around the house doing something like cleaning,cooking,reading or doing her make up or doing something with my sister and now im here in the hospital for the second day and I havent gone home and Ive been staying with my uncle because I just cant go home and see that shes not there anymore and theyre saying she'll probably never wake up.And I do wanna make her proud and become a nurse/doctor but its so goddam hard right now and I dont know if im gonna be able to continue to do anything without her.
