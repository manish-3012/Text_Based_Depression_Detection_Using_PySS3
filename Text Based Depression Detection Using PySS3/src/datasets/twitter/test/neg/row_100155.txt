Still Alive...The other night I tried to attempt... didn't work out how I wanted it to and was rushed to the hospital by a neighbor....
The past few days I've been out my parents have been crazy and just been yelling at me about it. They have been telling me it's selfish and that it was the works of the devil in a way... 
My family is Christian and there has been pressure about my beliefs frm my parents since I've;been discharged the other day...
