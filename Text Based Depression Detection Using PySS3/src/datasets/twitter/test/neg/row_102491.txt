Autism makes me feel so disconnected from people, I sometimes feel like im not even humanI cant connect with people not even my own family. I feel so lost and i thought it would get better as i aged but it hasnt. feel like im not a person and i hate it i just want to be normal. im so tired of it and knowing ill always be like this makes me want to give up
