Selling all my stuff to give my kids one last good Christmas.I'm disabled with a combination of mental health issues. Recently I discovered that the administration is going to be looking at kicking people like myself off our benefits. I'm too sick to afford insurance, and my chronic physical pain prevents me from working, I can't even use a mouse. 

My Trump loving parents bought me a tv for Christmas (because who needs medicine when you have a tv, right?) And I'll be selling it and whatever else I can in order to give my kids a decent holiday. Their birthdays are also coming up, so I am going to wait until my own birthday much later in the year to do it. 

I'm just going to get some of that easy to get fentanyl and take it all at once. I'm out of options, I don't even have a working car to live in. 

I'm hoping to make it look like an accident somehow but I'm not sure how.
