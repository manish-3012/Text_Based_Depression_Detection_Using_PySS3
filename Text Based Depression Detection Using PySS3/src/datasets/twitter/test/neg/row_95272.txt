It was supposed to be my best friends birthday todayHe was my only friend. The only one I'm able to talk to, the person who got me through everything is gone. He killed himself almost a year from now. He was all that mattered through out my whole childhood and hes gone. I think I'm gonna be back with him tonight. I'm done here. I hope you all get better but I'm done for real this time. &lt;3
