How do i live without distractionsBeing alone with my thoughts makes 10 minutes feel like an hour.

My phone keeps me up at night, but itâ€™s also the only thing that can distract me from late night thoughts that I donâ€™t want to be thinking.

I would appreciate advice on how to fall asleep without staying on my phone till I pass out.
