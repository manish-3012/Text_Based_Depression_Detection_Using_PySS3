I feel like dyingHi,

My family doctor revealed to my mother that I was depressed and on SSRI medication. I'm a legal adult and expected this information should be classified. Anyways, my mother then told my grandmother, who then told my uncle, who then told my cousins, who then told some mutual friends.  Everybody now knows.

I'm incredibly embarrassed and ashamed. I completely enraged at my doctor; I cannot believe this information got out to everyone. I just want to kill myself.

Is there anyone out there to somehow convince that this might not be as bad as it seems.
