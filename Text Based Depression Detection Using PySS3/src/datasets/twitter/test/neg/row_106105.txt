If this post is several days old, I am probably dead.Iâ€™ve walked down to my favorite spot with a nice view, gotten drunk, and overdosed. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s enough of an overdose but Iâ€™m going to push it as I have more. Deciding whether or not to call my friends or leave them out of it and not bother them. Fucking hell, I love them so fucking much.

Godspeed to the rest of you, hope the world ends up treating you right. Weâ€™ll see what happens to me.
