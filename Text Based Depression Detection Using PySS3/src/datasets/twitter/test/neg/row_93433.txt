I canâ€™t wait to dieEverywhere I look, even if I try to see something, there is nothing.

Im a soon to be failure with nothing to show for myself. Im finally pushing myself to be better but the pain inside is too much. I hate these mixed emotions so much, they clash with me and drive me mad. 

I want to just lay down somewhere cold and die and fade away into vacancy. Iâ€™ll never make anyone feel worth it or good, Iâ€™m just a useless moron, I donâ€™t value myself because I constantly feel inferior to the world, constantly and always out of reach of something that isnâ€™t of this world.

Just to think, only 2 more years of this shit before I might finally choose to the pull the plug. I honestly canâ€™t wait, Iâ€™m so sick this burden. I will drag everyone down with me while iâ€™m here

Iâ€™m not worth love, iâ€™m not worth anything. I want to leave so bad.
