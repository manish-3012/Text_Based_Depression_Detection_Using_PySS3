Never told anyone this before...I shouldnâ€™t be alive today. Remembering this because surprisingly a Rick and Morty episode triggered it. 

At the end of Season 2 episode 3. Rick gets this message from unity that she canâ€™t be with him. Breaks his heart and at the end he ends up trying to kill himself, but at the last moment his alcoholism causes him to pass out causing the laser to miss his head. 

Iâ€™m an alcoholic. And like rick. Iâ€™ve tried killing myself. Iâ€™ve tried ending my life numerous times but fear has always stopped me. 

Well this one night I got so drunk that I didnâ€™t feel much of anything. I didnâ€™t want to leave this world, but I didnâ€™t want to feel the pain anymore. Suicide was my only escape. 

I took this belt and my stool one night and locked myself in the bathroom. My family was far asleep at this time. I felt so empty... everything felt numb. All emotion was gone. And then my feelings disappeared. 

I put a loop in the belt as if you were gonna wear it. Took the end and jammed it between the door and frame. It was very tight and wouldnâ€™t come loose. Put my head through the loop standing up but made it short enough so that when Iâ€™d sit or let my body hang the belt would asphyxiate me. I was almost blacking out at the time. Just a matter of time before my mind was blacked out and Iâ€™d hang painlessly. Die the way I wish, fall asleep and never wake up again. 

Well like that rick and Morty episode where at last moment ricks head drops and the laser misses. Somehow. Someway my neck managed to break free from the knot. So when I fell I just fell onto the ground. 

I woke up very early the next morning alive and sick. Put everything away before they could see what happened. I was astonished to be alive and sometimes feel so guilty. 

I guess what Iâ€™m saying is that the episode really messed me up. I remember watching it and tearing up. Because I know that pain. 

Just needed to get that off my chest...
