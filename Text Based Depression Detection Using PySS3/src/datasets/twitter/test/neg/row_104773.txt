Everybody's turning against me.So long story short I'm in the military and have been struggling after sexual assault and injury lately. My best friend here got discharged and left on Friday. She since then hasn't really talked to me at all. It just hurts because I've been there for here through her mental health issues, a miscarriage, etc all while dealing with my own issues and now that she's out she doesn't need me anymore. I stopped texting her because I don't want to keep bothering her. In addition to this, I found out last Thursday that I have retinal damage and show a lot of symptoms of Stargardts disease (juvenile macular degeneration) so that really worsens it. I just feel like I'm a burden to her and that's why she doesn't want to be my friend anymore, and if I'm going blind I'm definitely going to be a burden to everybody I know. I just don't believe that human kindness is a thing and if I actually have this disease I'm going to be heavily dependent on it. Two of my sergeants have now threatened to have me involuntarily hospitalized, a long with some of my friends here. But for now I just have to hold it off until the weekend. My roommate should be gone all day Saturday so I can finally put an end to all this bullshit on my own terms. I already have my individual notes to my family written out along with a plan. But I can't keep having mental breakdowns 4x a day and cutting myself in the shower. I've tried therapy, and I just don't feel comfortable with my therapist but I don't know how to ask for a new one. But for now I just gotta hold in there until Saturday.
