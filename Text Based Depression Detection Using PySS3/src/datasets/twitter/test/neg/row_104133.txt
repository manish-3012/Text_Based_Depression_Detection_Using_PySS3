hate life
i wish i could say i would feel bad for leaving loved ones behind, but i wouldn't.

i'm selfish. i quit school and do nothing but sleep. when i wake up i stay in bed all day long, not even eating.

no medication works and therapy makes me have mental breakdowns. 

i simply don't like what life is like. the world is rotten and i have no right to be happy at all while others are suffering. my family says i'm a grumpy, miserable person to be around. i know i am.

people who aren't depressed completely baffle me. i'm so tired.

at one point i took so many bottles of pills that i was certain i was gonna die, and i went to bed and cried for hours when i woke up the next morning.

if i had any pills left, i would try again. If I hadn't gotten rid of my razorblades, i would try again. if i trusted a noose, i would try.

feels like nobody gets it to the extent i do.
