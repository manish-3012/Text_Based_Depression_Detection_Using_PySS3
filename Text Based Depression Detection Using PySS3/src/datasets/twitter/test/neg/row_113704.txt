Why does my state have to be one of the few that made extra laws for getting guns.Just why. I could literally go over to the next state and buy, but no. My state makes you wait until you're 21  even though it says you can buy at 18.

Sure you could buy at 18 if you didn't have to get a this extra license(FFL).

How do you get this extra license? You wait until you're 21 and go through a bunch of extra bullshit! Fun!
