I think that I'm gonna kill myself after my dog diesFew days ago my dog had his 11th birthday. I know that most of his life is gone. He might die this year, next year. Hell knows. But he probably won't even live for 4 years more. 

I'm simply done with my life. When my dog dies, I won't have a close friend who could support me. I just want this life to be over. I don't even want to try and find friends. They would just leave me, as everyone.
