Failing college. Don't know what to do. (Long Post)22 y/o. had repeat exams and  I'm sure I failed them. This was the second time I was doing them and I'm not sure if I can get into college. Majority of my friends (&gt;10 people) have left the city to other countries and my parents live 250km away. Can anyone give a good reason why I shouldn't end it now? I have only 1 friend left, I'm so tired all the time and I'm fucking failing in every aspect of my life. I exercise, I eat properly and try and get early nights but I can't ever feel happy. I have no social life, no one I can talk to, my future in college is up in the air and I just feel like I'm stuck in the mud while everyone's passing me by. apologies if I upset anyone.
