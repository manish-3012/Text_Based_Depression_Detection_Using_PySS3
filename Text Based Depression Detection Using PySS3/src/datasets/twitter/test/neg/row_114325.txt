Friend with BPD is starting to give upShe has borderline personality disorder, so she is already suicidal almost all the time. It seems different now. She's not snapping back to her rational self. Her bf dumped her about a month ago and it's destroying her. I've been talking with her almost 24/7 so she wouldn't alone. I think I have until Saturday until she makes an attempt on her life. I'm trying to get a hold of her family. Worried they won't do anything though. I'm not sure what I should be doing and starting to panic.
