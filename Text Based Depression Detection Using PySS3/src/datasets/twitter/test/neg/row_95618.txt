Need to stop procrastinatingI need to do this now. The longer I wait, the worse my life becomes. I can't live with myself, I have ruined every part of my life beyond repair and I just want to die. Suicide is the only way I can redeem myself for everything I have done, if I kill myself I will right the wrongs of my past. I'm just too god damn scared and keep putting it off. I need the strength to do this. What I have to do.
