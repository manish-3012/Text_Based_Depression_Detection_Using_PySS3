Been trying to keep going for so longI'm so tired. I just drag myself through the day. I've lost so many friends. Maybe it's all my fault. I'm not sure. I feel like I've just always been a doormat and many people are cruel. I have a lot of debt. No one told me that medical school is only for the rich. I made. A mistake in choosing to become a doctor but I can't quit because I need to repay my loans. I have 2 good friends that I'm thankful for. I have a boyfriend who would be better off without me. I'm ashamed that at 28 I can't support myself because I'm still in school. I'm ready to go because I see no way out except to disappear or to die and I don't think anyone would actually miss me which makes it a lot easier.
