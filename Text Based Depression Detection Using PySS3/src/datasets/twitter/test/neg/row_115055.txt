I'm a selfish prick drama queen. I hate myself and so does everyone elseInformation on what got me depressed today: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1efl0q/i_23m_woke_up_hung_over_and_kinda_acted_like_a/

I'm an asshole. I hate myself. I feel as no one wants to have anything to do with me because I can be self centered a lot. Which I kind of blame on my parents for spoiling me. I sometimes put the burden of my responsibilities on other people (Ie: I get mad at OTHER people when I lose my things or leave them behind at their house, or if they don't invite me anywhere) and that really annoys me. 

What bothers me even more, is if I do decide to take my life, maybe only a few family members might come due to my actions
