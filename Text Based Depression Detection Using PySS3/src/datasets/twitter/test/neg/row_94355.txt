It just doesn't matterIt didn't take me too long in life to realize (decide?) that life had absolutely no meaning and that I didn't care much for it. Recently, though, I've been feeling even more strongly about it. I'm still young (&lt;21) and I'm sure there are hardships and joys that have yet to be experienced, but it just doesn't mean anything to me.

My goal and drive in life was to become a paramedic and use the life I decided was useless as a way to help people who still held onto their hopes and beliefs. This is a waning feeling. At this point I'm starting to care less and less about the people that I wanted so badly to devote my life to helping. I just don't want to be a bother at this point. The way I'm feeling now, I'll probably kill myself after my parents die to safe them the grief.

I don't want to have to care about life. I wouldn't mind a humble 1 room apartment and a steady job somewhere in EMS, but I just don't care enough to get there. If I was there already I'd just suck it up, but it seems too far off. I don't want to have to work towards it. It's not really the lack of instant gratification that I dislike, but it just feels like wasted time in a life where all time is already wasted.

Just wanted a place to put it all out there. I don't know how to feel anymore. It's slowly changing from apathy to mild depression. I don't even want to care more.


I've also realized that I use the thought of suicide to avoid depression. It's always there, always a way out. It doesn't matter if I don't try hard enough or if I mess something up, because none of it matters and it could all end in an instant.
