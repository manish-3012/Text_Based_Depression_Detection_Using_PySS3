Lonely, Nothing makes me happy anymoreI'm too young to be feeling this tired and alone.  Let me start off by saying that I suffer from Bipolar disorder and I'm in a pretty bad slump already.  Nobody really believes that I'm bipolar besides my doctor, so all week I've just been getting labeled as the whiny, sensitive bitch.  I feel like I've lost all control of my emotions. 
  I've lost pretty much all of my friends.  I barely leave the couch.  I'm terribly awkward in public and slightly overweight.  I have no real talents and no motivation for anything.
  All day I've been calling around, posting on facebook, trying to get somebody to be a friend and hang out.  I get an indirect no from everybody.  The only people that want to come over just want to steal my makeup and dip into my klonopin prescription.  How did I become such a loser?  I have no car, can barely function at work, and I'm drowning in debt.  
tl;dr I'm sick of my life and I feel like it's going nowhere.

I feel like tonight is gonna push me over the edge.  I'm just so done waiting for things to get better.  I'm want to lock myself in my bedroom and never come out, so hopefully my boyfriend won't have to find me.  I feel like I'm suffocating, I've never been so fucking down. UGH.
