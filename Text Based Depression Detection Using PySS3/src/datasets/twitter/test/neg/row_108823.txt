All I've got is...about **20 Vicodin** pills (5/325), **4 percocets** (5/325), **vodka** and a **birthday wish** coming up in a couple days.

*realistically*, **could this end my life?**

Too many mixed findings online. I've read 90 mg of hydro is lethal within 24 hours, yet have heard people surviving 100 mg +.

(*you don't have to read the following; just something I want to get out*)

There's an eerie darkness inside me, a sorrow that shouldn't be there; there's no reason for it to be there; yet it festers... and it grows... and I don't think there's a way to patch up the wounds its created. I've been to therapy, tried medication, tried to help myself... I, like many other before me, feel I'm just not meant for this world.

I've tried to end my life on my birthday twice before (not really; it was more of a *take pills, drink a lot, and see what happens* \- type situation)

Only one person knows of this though, and they kept it a secret if I sought help; which I did, but it hasn't helped... obviously

I've read that the success rate of suicide via OD is anywhere from only 20% to 12%. I'm fuckin' terrified.
