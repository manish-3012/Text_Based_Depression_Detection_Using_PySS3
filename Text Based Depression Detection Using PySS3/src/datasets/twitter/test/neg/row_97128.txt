Maybe you think I wouldnâ€™t miss anything if I killed myself,But I will. Whenever I have a good day once, I think about how Iâ€™ll miss having that kind of fun. Iâ€™ll miss my friends and how I wonâ€™t be able to spend more time with them. Iâ€™ll miss leaving my family behind, never being able to watch my little brother grow up. Iâ€™ll miss all the times when I really loved my family and the moments where I didnâ€™t think about the pain Iâ€™ll experience when theyâ€™ll eventually leave me. Iâ€™ll miss the feeling of finding a song that speaks to me. Iâ€™ll miss the sunrise and sunsets that I used to study through. Iâ€™ll miss the Friday nights and Saturday mornings when I felt like I didnâ€™t give a care in the world. 

Iâ€™ve been trying so hard to put my feelings into words, and although life scares the hell out of me, sometimes I do really want to hold on if I can feel happy forever. If I didnâ€™t have to think about the inevitable things that I didnâ€™t want, or go through another heartbreak, maybe Iâ€™d want to stay. I feel like my existence in this world is too long, and Iâ€™d rather be here temporarily to have the best time instead of trapped with all the emotions I must endure.
