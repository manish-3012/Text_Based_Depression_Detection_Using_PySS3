I reached my goals and became happy and build a stable life. But I still dont want to live for another 50 years of ups and downs.I had a crippling depression and no will to live a few years ago. I climbed out of that hole and build a life for myself. I found new hobbies and became much more active and build a lot of habits.

My life is actually awesome right now and I basically got to a point I could only have dreamed of.   
I did what I felt I needed to do to get rid of the depression, but somehow my will to live hasn't returned. I just don't enjoy being alive even though I am very happy right now. It just feels like a neverending chore with some happy moments sprinkled within.

But now I feel like I am a rollercoaster wagon that went up the rails very slowly and is about to go for a wild ride downwards. 

I really have no more goals in life right now and am so happy. I set myself up for a great career and my music hobby is going off too, but I just dont get it. I kind of just want to quit while on top. 

And it feels like such a stupid crazy thought, but I just dont want to go through lows and highs for another 50 years.  
this is not a spontaneous thought either, I have been thinking about this for a few weeks now, because I am so happily in love and feel like it just cant actually get better than this.

I am so confused.
