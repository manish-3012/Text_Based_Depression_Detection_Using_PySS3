Feeling incredibly alone and borderline suicidal.With the recent pandemic, my physical health has become a huge concern of mine because I suffer from several respiratory issues and allergies. As a result, I've been practically locked up inside my room for the past 3 weeks. I haven't seen my boyfriend, who has since stopped talking to me for a month now, and I feel like we will inevitably break up. My college assignments are all online however I can't find the motivation to do any of them, nor can I bring myself to apply for PhDs because I feel like I don't deserve anything. In addition, my father has started drinking again since he lost his job, and has been physically and verbally abusive. The only person I felt like I could turn to was my boyfriend, but he barely responds to me nowadays.

I just don't see the point of it all anymore. I feel like I'm going crazy being trapped in my room, I have nobody to speak to, and am throwing my life away. The physical and emotional pain is taking a huge toll on me, and I have no idea if I have any other option.
