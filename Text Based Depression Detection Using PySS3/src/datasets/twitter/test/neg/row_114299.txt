Not quite there, but the urge just keeps getting stronger.I have no actual plans to commit suicide. It used to be something that crossed my mind every once in a while. If something really shitty happened, I would just think about how if I wasn't alive, no more mistakes could be made and I wouldn't have to feel this way anymore. But I would just push through whatever was bringing me down and eventually forget about it. But now it has reached a point where even if I just do something embarrassing that might make me look stupid, I have thoughts about wishing I was just dead. Insignificant issues are pushing me to that point now and it scares me. I've even started muttering those words out loud when I'm alone at home. Which I never did in the past. Feels like I'm headed down a slippery slope and something that once seemed like an impossibility in my head will soon become a reality. 

I just don't feel like I have much going on in my life. I'm 28 and can't think of one thing I've excelled at. I'm not good at anything. I'm very unattractive. Never had a girlfriend. Never had sex. Never even kissed a girl. I've never really done anything to be remotely proud of. No achievements or awards to signify greatness in any capacity. I feel like my existence is entirely meaningless and I don't contribute anything to this world. I know my parents love me and they let me know that. But I can't be certain if that's because they 100&amp;#37; value me as a person and the things I've done, or because they feel biologically compelled to care for, and protect, their child. 

I'm really hoping someone who has felt this way but, came back from it, sees this post. I want to read about your experience and what triggered the turning point. I feel really hopeless right now and want to know there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I don't want to feel this way anymore and need to quell these horrible thoughts in my head. I tried checking out some online chat support sites but everything is very specific or only available during certain hours on certain days. I don't feel comfortable calling someone on a hotline as I don't want my emotions to well up and be conveyed through my voice. It makes me nervous and self\-conscious.
