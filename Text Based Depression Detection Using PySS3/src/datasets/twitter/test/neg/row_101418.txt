Iâ€™m graduating high school soon and Iâ€™m going to kill myselfIm graduating in less that a month and at this point I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do. Iâ€™ve been having these anxious/depressed feelings since 9th grade, but theyâ€™ve progressively getting worse up to this point. I feel guilty for feeling this way because my mother is one of the most motivated and well kept people Iâ€™ve ever met and I donâ€™t have a bad life by any means, yet I still feel like I want to die. I know no one has it all figured out when they graduate high school, but everyone knows what theyâ€™re doing to some degree except me. Iâ€™m not good at anything, I canâ€™t talk to people, Iâ€™m below average intelligence, Iâ€™m not an attractive person, and Iâ€™m not driven or motivated. School is the only thing that i live for. I have no friends, no social life or anything outside of school. I wake up go to school and sit quietly in all my classes, come home and do nothing then repeat. Iâ€™m 17 years old and I feel like Iâ€™m being thrusted into the real world with no help. I know there is help out there, but the anxiety and depression is starting to consume my life, I canâ€™t focus in class, itâ€™s all I think about at home, but I hide it and donâ€™t tell anyone. Even if I did tell someone Iâ€™m so stubborn that they wouldnâ€™t be able to make me think differently. I have 19 days left before graduate hs and Iâ€™m probably just gonna end it before then.
