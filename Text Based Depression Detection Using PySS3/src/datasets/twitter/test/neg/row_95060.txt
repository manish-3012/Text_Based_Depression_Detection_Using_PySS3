What are you living for?What are you living for?

I finished uni, I had dreams and aspirations, to create amazing things for people, earn a lot and have fun, travel, date.  So I got a job, quickly switched, and now I've realised what it means to be me.  It means going to work, coming home, sleeping, going to work, coming home, sleeping, going to work, coming home, sleeping... day after day after day after day.  After some time I will hear about the nice things others have accomplished, that they've got plans for the future, that they are working on.  I'll smile and when they ask me, I'll respond - "oh you know, same old...", they'll nod, putting in half an effort to appear empathetic, as it's what they hear all the time - I never do anything.

I'll retire, living in smaller and smaller homes and retirement villages as my mediocre savings dwindle, with no loved ones around me, just waiting for the slow news to reach me that old friend X has passed away, and then friend Y.  But I'll remember that they accomplished the things in their life that they were proud of, they made an impact and always dreamed it might be bigger.  I'll recall my pathetic thing im embarrassed to call 'my life'.  With no one important, or special, and achieving nothing, simply existing and whatching others achieve dreams.

Even with rampant dimensia, I believe I'll still remember that at least.

Eventually I'll die, and if I'm lucky, that's the end of my pitifal existence.

If im unlucky, I get to see a malevolent god laughing and my sorry state, casting me to be forever tortured, my sole wish only to have never been brought into existence at all.

Im not living for money, I have plenty of it being just stupid numbers in my bank.
I'm not living for my dreams, any aspirations I knew I once had I know I cannot finish, or will not succeed, even if so.
I'm not living for an SO, someone to share lifes journey with.  Not that my choice changes the matter, but I think it is good that will stay alone.  The thought of bonding with someone and then dragging them through the mud behind you as they slowly bend and surcumb to depressions bleak and dark existence, that is something I'd like to keep from others.

What are you living for?

My mind is so critical and pessimistic any gently offered beacons of hope are crushed by me and my mentality. There is nothing to say.
