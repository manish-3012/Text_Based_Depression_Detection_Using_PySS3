Stop lying, we didn't do anything wrongI was mad at my friends for ignoring me and treating me like I wasnt worth shit, so I decided to disappear for a week and then not show up at our meeting; surprise me, only one who cared was my best friend. Because it couldnt get any better, I fell off the stairs after confirming this, and once I got up one of them-the one I was especially mad with due to treating my panic attacks like they were my choice to have them- started sending me texts saying I was lying and that they didnt do anything wrong, ever. She even tried to call me to yell at me.

I dont know what to do anymore, I just wanted them to say sorry or at least show they did care for me, but my bff was the only one who didnt guilt trip me and was on my side. I want to die so much, every relationship I have is deteriorating and Im always at fault according to others.

I wish I had just died after I fell from the stairs.

Maybe I should throw myself down them and hope for the best.
