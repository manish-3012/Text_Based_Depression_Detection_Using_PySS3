I'm a disappointment. I have for a long time tried to avoid coming to this. But I'm exhausted. I'm 29, no job, dropped out of college, and in debt. I lost my last job 16 months ago, which was a dead end job anyway, but still paid rent. I had to leave because my mum got very sick again and I had to be with her. I ended up burying her.

I've been trying to find a job ever since, I've had little money that got me through the last months, bills stack up, I'm behind rent bills, people to whom I owed money to started knocking on my door, yet, still no job. Two months ago, I was kicked out of my place, and have been sleeping over at my friends', who have become less welcoming with time. I've been out everyday looking for a job, and I would be denied one every time.

Today, I pulled my last card. I called my father, with whom I don't have a good relationship since the day he divorced my mother. I asked for a loan until I get back on my feet and I would pay it back. His response? 'sort out your shit on your own, you're a disappointment'. I've never borrowed from him, nor have I ever asked him for anything, and now when I needed him the most, he still pissed and spit on me, even though, he has the means to throw expensive parties all the time. I don't blame him, he is right, I'm a disappointment. I should just make peace with that and remove myself from this world.
