I don't want to kill myself...Life has got tough since I entered college, I used to believe I was smart but here I feel miserable, everyone else is having a great time while I'm just here wasting my life trying to do my best. My dad is a great surgeon, he is so smart and I can't believe I'm not enough for him to tell he is proud. I don't want to live on my dad's shadow but today I fucked up in a assignment and I can't handle it any more, I'm afraid to grow older and continue being a piece of shit. The only thing that's in between me and suicide is that I can't think about the emotional harm I can make to my mom, my girlfriend and my two baby brothers but I can't help it anymore, I just want this feeling in my heart to stop being there, I want to stop worrying about my position in life and I want to end it all ASAP. I haven't enjoyed life since I started college and I need someone to please convince me to keep on the road please, my life is falling apart and I can't handle it anymore
