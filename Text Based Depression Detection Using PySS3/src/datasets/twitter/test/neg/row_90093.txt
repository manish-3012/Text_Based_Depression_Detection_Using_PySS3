If I attempt Suicide as a Jane doe can I receive free help?Iâ€™ve been looking for affordable help for years. Iâ€™m tired of being denied and Iâ€™m tired of living. Me and my family canâ€™t afford therapy and I donâ€™t want to further burden them. If I live Iâ€™m a burden if I die i am too. If I slit my wrist and get admitted with no ID will I get help?
