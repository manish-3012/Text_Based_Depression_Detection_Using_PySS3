Feeling worthless and depressedI am a male offspring whose nature didn't give too much to be grateful for. Apart from the face, body shape and iq I have nothing to be grateful for. Maybe for the fact that I live. I have psychiatric disorders (severe depression and multiple personality disorders) and also I'm not tall and don't have a big penis. I've been told countless times by women to  : go fuck myself, leave Europe and move to Asia, I will never stand a chance nor even have the slightest thought of having children. Apart from the fact that I keep decent relations at college and work, I am obsessed with my size, revolving anything around height and penis size. EG: I hear women laugh means they must be fucked by a big dick . I see women happily togheter only with tall guys.(I somehow bypass shorter ones) . I assume that no matter how dumb, ugly, uneducated a man is if he is tall and has a big dick he will have more chances to have an offspring than some educated , gentelmanly, and caring man. As a side-note I also believe that women who comment on the "small penis" and "short" threads are only giving support to their fellow peers because a man with that problems will try to compensate(which is not possibile in my oppinion (height/penis size are physical you can't compensate them with something else than physical)) and be a caring nice sensitive men a CUCKOLD for another TALL and HUNG man's offspring. Those women want to help other women get their nice guys by encouraging them not to kill themselves because (life is beautiful  and other bullshit ) while sleeping with genetically superior guys which didn't work at the provider aspect. I am currently paralized and the thought of even refusing to try is devastating. There are some situations when I see a girl I'd like to hook up and know in my head that I will make a fool of myself and more women will find out about my size. I didn't use to be this way. However after some women (~10) told me in one way of another that I don't measure up I started thinking : maybe I dont, maybe that's why those relationships didn't work, maybe that's why women are laughing behind my back. In spite of all the offenses and emasculating phrases directed to me I kept and still keep my self-respect and integrity and not even let anybody know that I face this challenge.

I UNDERSTAND that THIS IS NOT THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN TO SOMEONE. There are FAR worse things but these are enough in my view to consider killing yourself or at best closing yourself in not going to the parties and social activities.
