Is my brain faking being suicidal as an excuse to feel upset and angry and selfish?Iâ€™m scared, I donâ€™t feel good, at all. I constantly need to apologize to people, I donâ€™t even know what I did wrong, but I know I did something. Iâ€™m tired. I tried apologizing, but the feeling wonâ€™t go away.

Iâ€™m not depressed
I havenâ€™t gotten diagnosed with depression
I donâ€™t have depression
I donâ€™t have anything 
My brain is lying to me
