This SucksFamily has been having financial problems for the last few years. Homeless, but moving into a place in the 15th. The thing that is currently making me even sadder are my dogs. We had to take them to the humane society on the 16th of December because we couldn't afford them (they were living in the car at the time, we lived with my aunt at her apartment so they couldn't come inside). The society said that we could get them back for a fee and that they would tell us if someone adopted them(which I really didnt want to happen), which had me in good mood for awhile, but then the houses we were applying to rent wouldn't accept us (parent's credit is bad). We are going to move in to this townhome-esque community where the dog deposit is 500 per dog, so 1k total. We can't afford that. I just feel so bad for my dogs. We had them all their lives (10 years), and I can't imagine how they feel. I don't want new dogs. I want them back. I hate it. I had suicidal thoughts before this, and I made up my mind to commit suicide when I have the chance to get my hands on a gun or a cliff(brain damage be damned, at least I won't have to deal with life either way). Only a few more years until i can move out of my parents. I don't think I feel bad about it, i honestly couldn't care about my parent's feelings at this point, and wouldn't care if any of my extended family died. My friends could go on without me. 
I can't think of a situation where I will ever feel good( sold childhood home, bank took 400k of the money we were supposed to get, I made my goal in life to buy it back) but now I just want to end it.
