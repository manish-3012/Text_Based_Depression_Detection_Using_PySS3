Want to dispel myths about overdosingI've had a long problem with overdoses; I would overdose when life became too overwhelming and I just wanted everything to stop, and I didn't care much about waking up. I've had many overdoses in my life involving different drugs. But this method is FAR from peaceful and is more likely to leave you with organ damage rather than death.

The first time I overdosed was when I was 13 and had no idea what I was doing. I took some paracetamol from the cabinet and had as much as I could. I went to bed thinking naively that I just wouldn't wake up. But I did wake up hours later and then I panicked. I told my mum and we rushed to hospital. My skin was clammy and jaundiced and my vision kept going fuzzy. It was too late to do the charcoal thing so instead they gave me some sort of painkiller while I vomited up green bile and it was horrendous. The pain was agonising and it was honestly the worst physical pain I've ever experienced. I'm pretty sure they had me on morphine or something because I was high as a kite but there was still agonising pain because my liver was just going insane and I just kept puking. 

Once that passed and my vitals normalised and everything, I went home, they decided a psychiatric unit would put my studies at risk so I didn't go.

Fast forward to me at 20-21 and things are still a bit of a struggle. I knew what paracetamol overdoses were like so I planned something else. I obtained Xanax, GHB, oxycodone along with a lot of alcohol and I ended up blacking out. Fortunately I was found and I woke up in hospital surrounded by doctors. 

The next time I blacked out on Xanax and alcohol which was just dumb really and FYI, don't ever do that, Xanax blackouts can end up with you doing some insane shit while having no consciousness of it. People have ended up in jail and having no idea why, it's crazy.

My most recent overdose was involving opiates, barbiturates and benzos. I woke up caked in vomit and found it hard to move. I ended up vomiting up again and realised that it was the same green bile as before so I was worried I'd damaged my liver. Called an ambulance and I was physically ok, but just felt like death for a couple of weeks. 

Just DONT overdose, people. It may seem like a peaceful method like they show in the movies, but in reality, you're more likely to end up damaging yourself and it may possibly be permanent. No matter how bad your life is, people who have been unfortunate with overdoses sometimes suffer brain damage or need to be put on dialysis and be in care. YOU DONT WANT THAT. I know discussing methods isn't great but this is just a lose-lose for everybody. Plus, paracetamol is commonly found in most homes but in overdose, it's fucking brutal. I mean there should be more health announcements about it, if you don't get to a hospital within a certain time frame, your liver may shut down and it is agonising and prolonged.

Some people may disagree with this post, but I felt I needed to clarify what overdosing actually involves, having been there and done that. Also, look at my track record, and I'm still around. This won't cause anything but suffering, but death? Not likely.
