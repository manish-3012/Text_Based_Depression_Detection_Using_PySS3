My girlfriend says she is always thinking of committing suicideMy girlfriend says she is always wanting to commit suicide but wont because she is Christian and would go to hell if she did... and apparently that is the only reason. I'm not really sure what to do about it because it basically make me think she doesn't give a fuck about me and would off herself if she wasn't a Christian without a single thought of me. I was hoping this subreddit would help because i'm not sure where this kind of thing goes. I might try posting it to ask reddit as well...

What do you guys think about this?
