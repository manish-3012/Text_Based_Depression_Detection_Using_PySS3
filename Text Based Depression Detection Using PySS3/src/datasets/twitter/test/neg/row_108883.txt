Just had a breakdown in the gym.I was working out as usual. Started with jump rope, a mile sprint on the treadmill and started working some leg day stuff. Lately there's been this girl that goes to my gym who looks exactly like my ex. Same exact body type and their faces are almost indistinguishable. I tried not to notice or let it bother me. I just turned up my music. As I was finishing up my workout I started having flashbacks from my deployment. Vivid images of things flashed through my brain like one of those old time movie reals only each slide was a different picture. Pictures of  buddies who were killed, ied explosions, legs/arms being torn off, kids screaming, villagers crying, marines dying. And then I started thinking about the late nights that my ex would hold me during my breakdowns. How I shared with her some of my deepest pains and secrets because she begged for information about it. How she promised me she would never leave me. And now she's gone. She did leave. My legs collapsed under me and I held onto the squat rack. Once my legs stopped shaking enough for me to grab my things I headed straight for the door. My breathing was heavy and I felt like I was going to vomit. I threw my stuff into my car and got in the drivers seat. I gripped the steering wheel as hard as I could and screamed at the top of my lungs for what felt like a minute. Then I broke down crying and now I'm here. Telling you guys. I miss having her tell me everything is going to be okay. To tell me that I'm a good person. Now I go home to a room and will sleep by myself while she sleeps with someone else. I hate this.
