Bored of lifeI think i am going to committee any day now and im a piece of shit for it. middle class, decent job, supportive family/friends, i have a good life i just have slowly lost any interest in living at all. Is it weird that im not upset by that? Other people would love to have the life i live, but i would rather just not be alive at all. I feel like everything is just too much all the time.
