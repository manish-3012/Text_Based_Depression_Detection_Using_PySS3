I donâ€™t know how to describe what Iâ€™m feelingFor the past few months my mental status has been declining rapidly. My finances have become really fucked up, I have a daughter that my ex will barely let me see, and a girlfriend who is dealing with the death of her mother and a grad program. I canâ€™t say that I am overtly suicidal, but I often have the thought that if I had a heart attack and died that I wouldnâ€™t mind so much. It has become a constant running thought in my head, and is something I think about almost daily. I donâ€™t know what to do or how to make it stop.
