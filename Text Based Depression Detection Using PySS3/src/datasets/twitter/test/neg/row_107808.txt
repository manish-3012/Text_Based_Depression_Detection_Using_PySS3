Finding reasons to liveI'm in Sydney Australia.  I want to jump off the Harbor Bridge.  I literally have no reason to live.  I cant bear life anymore. 

It's great on the surface.  I have an amazing job and lovely boyfriend.  I'm pretty and articulate. I laugh at life. 

But truly I can't bear it anymore.  I don't know where to turn.  I just cant be alive anymore.
