I feel like I'm nearing my timeI dont know what to do, I've suffered from depression for a while now, years even. Recently I was in a motorcycle accident, lost my job because of it, now I have no income and owe the company who owned the bike around Â£7000 with interest. Seen as though I have no income they are pursuing legal action. This is not my only debtor and I also have a guarantor so this will also effect him. I need some advice, some help, just something, I have no options left other than to end my own life.
