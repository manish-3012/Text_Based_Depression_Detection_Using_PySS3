Live from Boston, let me know if you need someone to talk to.today is National Evaluate Your Life Day... seriously... look it up.

On my ride home from work today (bike commuter) I had a small incident with my bike that ended up with my shoelace getting snagged and me falling over along with my bike into the busy street. In a position that most people would just stare at me with their best trollface, a woman ran out from the sidewalk and stood in front of traffic to protect me.

In all honesty, I was in no danger... but in an instance where most people think "what a moron", this woman thought "I should help him". This sentiment is rarely shared nowadays. I was browsing SW earlier today before my commuting incident, and after the incident I decided that if anyone should need it, I'll be there to help you today.

Just reply here or PM me.
