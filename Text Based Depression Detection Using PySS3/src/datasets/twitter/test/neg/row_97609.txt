Iâ€™m in painIâ€™m in pain every single day, throughout the day do to a gastrointestinal disorder that I have. Itâ€™s slowly taking everything I enjoy away from me. I canâ€™t eat any of my favorite foods or most food without experiencing excruciating pain during or almost immediately after. My body no longer processes alcohol at all, I canâ€™t go out with my friends, I canâ€™t work on a regular basis, I canâ€™t plan ahead for literally anything. Iâ€™m just so tired of it all. Iâ€™m tired of constantly having to give things up and adapt because thatâ€™s whatâ€™s expected from me. Adjusting my diet, adjusting my career, adjusting literally everything that brings me joy for something that will probably always bring me pain. 

Iâ€™m on my early twenties and I dread the thought of living a long life. I think about dying ever day; especially when Iâ€™m isolated in the bathroom experiencing the worst pain of my life with no exit; No medical remedy and nothing to alleviate this constant up and down pain. I just sit in the bathroom by myself begging for death and crying my eyes out because I know my wish wonâ€™t be granted anytime soon. My health is getting progressively worse and I donâ€™t know what to do or how to cope anymore. I feel like Iâ€™m decaying physically and mentally from the inside out. 

Iâ€™m scared. Iâ€™m exhausted. Iâ€™m in pain.
