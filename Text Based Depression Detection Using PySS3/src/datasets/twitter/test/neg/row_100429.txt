I am becoming more and more cynical. I think I will end it very soon.What is the point of living when there is no good in your life? You can enter eternal peace by taking your own life. 

My life has been suffering with not very many high points. Heart surgery when I was 16(21 now), appendicitis, acne(which I am still scared from). I got bullied throughout school because of my skin condition and because I was shy(I always was kind to people. What did I do to deserve that?). 

I am pretty much a bum now. I live with my parents going on the internet and playing games all day. I think the only way to escape this chasm is suicide.
