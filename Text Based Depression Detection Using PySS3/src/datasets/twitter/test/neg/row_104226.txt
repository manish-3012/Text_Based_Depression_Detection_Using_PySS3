I don't know why i posted thisTomorrow is my last day. I have it all set out, at midnight tomorrow i will walk down to the lake near my house with a few beers for my final drink and enough pills to hopefully kill me, i already have the note written. I'm gonna send two texts to the people who i feel i should say something to. One of them to a girl thanking her for all the help shes given me with my depression and suicidal thoughts, and the other to a different girl asking if she could watch over my ex as she said she would kill herself if anyone she knew committed suicide. I don't know why im posting this i guess just to explain my thoughts of what my final moment will be like.
