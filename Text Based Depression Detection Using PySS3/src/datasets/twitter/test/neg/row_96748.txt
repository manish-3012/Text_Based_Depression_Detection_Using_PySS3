Where do I go from here?I had to take off of work for a week because of a mental breakdown (I donâ€™t even know how Iâ€™ll be able to go back since I canâ€™t get out of bed). I withdrew from all of my classes, cut off from all my friends and pretty much from my family too. I donâ€™t think my medication is working and my psychiatrist wonâ€™t call me back. I have PTSD from the last time I went to a psych ward so I donâ€™t really want to go that route. I really just donâ€™t know where to go from here. Iâ€™m so lost. I also think I have multiple mental illnesses and I donâ€™t know how to get help. I literally canâ€™t stop thinking about wanting to kill my self. What do I do?
