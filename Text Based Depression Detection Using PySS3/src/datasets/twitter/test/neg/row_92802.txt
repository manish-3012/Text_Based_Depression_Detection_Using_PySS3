Hopefully I got bone cancerThe cold this year is really hurting my joints and bones, Iâ€™m 19 and not a senior so unlikely to be bone cancer but Iâ€™m still hoping it is. Canâ€™t bring myself to suicide, euthanasia illegal, this way also hurts family less. I donâ€™t value my life at all so hopefully Iâ€™ll just get worse from here. Just hope it ainâ€™t mistaken for arthritis or something that ainâ€™t fatal.
