bad state of affairsim a normal teenager with a good family, financial situation and in general a good situation. but:


1. The things I've always strived to be and the dreams I've had just seem unattainable and I feel that even if I achieved them, I wouldn't be happy. For some reason I feel that if I was as successful in life as possible, I'd still be unhappy. The world and the way things work is just unappealing.


2. I feel like a machine. I eat because my brain tells me I'm hungry. I masturbate because I can't stop myself. I keep doing things I don't want to do. I want to do my homework, study and be successful but yet I never do these things. I feel like I'm a broken machine without free will.


3. I'm not attractive. I want to love someone and have someone beautiful love me but I know that society is superficial (and so am I, that's just the nature of human brains). If I ever get married, I know it will be to someone mediocre. There are people I have fallen in love with but I know they will never love me.



So I'm just not feeling like going on. Like suicide is just a crazy thought and whenever I think about doing it, my brain just says "no, you're not serious right? suicide is not actually on the table here" but I keep coming back to it. I don't like the world and don't see the harm in not living. If my suicide were done in a good way, as to cause the least amount of suffering to those that love me and the least amount of physical pain to me, I would be able to simply not exist, no bad feelings. Also, I like the idea of getting attention through suicide. I think I'd like to write a long book for people to read after I kill myself. It'd have my life story and the entirety of my thoughts, which is something I feel I want seen.


I don't know what to do. Suicide seems like something I'd never do but at the same time something inevitable. I don't know how I'd ever acquire a gun but I'm sure I could kill myself in a car crash, etc.
