Iâ€™d been deeply depressed for as long as I can remember.My first and only attempt was on my 19th birthday ðŸŽ‚. 
In the 2 months be for my best friend/ roommate was beginning a downward spiral in to a severe schizophrenic psychosis Unbeknownst to me. We had live together for 7 months were things were going well and good. Lots fun weekend  doing molly and such. But honestly just Fueled the fire. 

During that time my other roommate moved out quick as he could. My girlfriend stopped coming over and seeing me all together. I was pretty worried about my friend who and speaking and occasionally yelling and throwing things a things at werenâ€™t there 

So I took him in to a mental hospital hand the landlord evicted him... one of the most difficult things I ever done and I felt so incredibly alone 
And wanted to end my life so I tried and failed. Was sick for awhile but nobody knew. 

In the mail the next day I got a check for my birthday so I bought an OZ of weed and tried to stay calm.

Iâ€™ve never felt glad it didnâ€™t work.

(I went to a vary expensive treatment program that didnâ€™t do much of anything for me.)

Especially upon reflection of this last year. I donâ€™t see anything worth living for

A few weeks I took a bunch of benzodiazepines and just slept for 3 day . 

Im 25 now and I feel that the only reason Iâ€™ve made it this far is because I hate alcohol and I donâ€™t have any firearms in the house
