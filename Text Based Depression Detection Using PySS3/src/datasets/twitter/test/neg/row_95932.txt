hopelessI tried and tried to help those around me but couldn't. I lied their faces again and again to buy time to get back at them. I can't live with those lies anymore. I can't live with this debt that I owe to them. I'm going to kill myself. I'm too stressed, too sad, too stupid. It is inevitable.
