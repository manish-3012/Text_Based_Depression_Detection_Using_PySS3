There isn't a point anymore.I cant take the pressure of life anymore. I'm procrastinating too much. I cant handle it. I have a ton of things I have to do and I cant be bothered to do them. The deadline is around the corner. I had to be moved to home study because I didnt want to be around people. 

I just want to talk to someone.
