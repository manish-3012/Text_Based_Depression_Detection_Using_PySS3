Life is for a select, so I plan to go out in style.So I'm on leave this semester from my school on the East Coast, incidentally for depression. I've been trying to get better, but therapy isn't having a lasting effect. I'm taking antidepressants, but the medicine can only do so much. No, my real issue is with the point I'm currently at in life.

I guess I was smart, but now seeing people go about their lives getting internships and having hundreds of friends and making lifelong memories drives me to panic. I have wanted to do so much, but I feel that with my leave, all these plans will be postponed. 

Loneliness is at the core of my daily life. I'm an anxious person and can't help feeling inadequate when talking to mostly anyone. Going to school at an Ivy League, where people are rich and amazing, is a brutal reality check and reinforces my insignificance.

Despite my efforts at optimism, I really do feel excluded from everything interesting going on in the world. The depression is swamping me, and it's hard to hold back tears as I type this. There is this monster that has ripped me from my tentative spot on a trampoline to success, dragging me down into a canyon of despair.

I feel like I suck at everything. I even feel bad when I browse Reddit, because the experiences of people on here seem to outdo my own. 

I have contemplated a number of ways to end it, and I'm feeling that a train would be the most efficient course of action, as I don't own a firearm. I don't think anyone would care about a collision as much as they would cleaning up my guts if I shot myself. 

My only regret would be not having been born a different person, one with a rich social life, successful academic career, and life prospects. I will never have a wife, nor children. I would be ashamed for such people to exist when I am in this state. 

In my heart of hearts, I know this is taboo, and I'd like your thoughts on the matter before it becomes too much and I go to wait on the tracks.
