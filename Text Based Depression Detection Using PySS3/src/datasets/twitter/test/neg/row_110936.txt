Fired today...I just can't get ahead.  Please help me.I don't want to do it.  I don't want to die by my own hand...and just by reaching out to you guys on here makes that all the more prevalent.  I love so many things about this world including music of all kinds, drumming, and in general, the smells of this planet.  I just don't see any other way out of this meaningless existence.  

I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 13.  I'm currently almost 30.  They were much worse when I was younger, broken by a brief period of "delusional happiness" from the years of 18-23.  (I was almost forcing myself to be happy, despite the world around me.)

I had a child out of wedlock when I was 21.  The mother decided to leave me a year after my child was born and that fucked me up for a LONG time (5 years).  I didn't date anyone and always held onto hope of getting my "traditional family" back together.  Maybe that would make everything all better?

Well we didn't and won't get back together, and I'm ok with that now.  I'm NOT ok with raising my child in a "broken home"...but that's not even it.  My child is mine, I know for fact, but because I don't get to see her but once every two weeks, she has no mannerisms, traits, or anything else besides looks that would make her mine.  She's mine, but she's not, you know?  It's a very selfish thing to say, but honestly she doesn't matter to me in my suicidal-decisions one bit.

My life always takes one step forward and two steps back.  I can't complete college (only one year left), I got a DWI this year, I just got laid off today, and every time something seems to go right in my life, 20 things go wrong.  Every time I get some money saved up, something happens that requires a large amount of it.

I can't do this anymore.  I can't live like this for the rest of my life.  I'm not happy.

This, coupled with the daily realization that none of this matters on a galactic-scale; my life, your life, our interactions...none of it...really makes it hard for me to have a positive outlook on anything anymore.

I never was an alcoholic until very recently.  I don't consider myself an alcoholic, but other people would look at my tendencies and say I am:  I drink when I wake up, I drink when I (got) home from work...I drink to make myself stupid.  I firmly believe there's an inverse relationship between intelligence and happiness.  [Lisa had it right](http://i.imgur.com/WWI2D.png).

I've been diagnosed (by a quack-quick-test in college) as having BPD, but I don't believe that.  I just believe that most things in life are binary.  Most middle-grounds are just someone not committing to their ideas or beliefs and settling somewhere in the middle.

Plus, I don't believe I'll ever find a wife.  I'm a go-no-where single-dad who keeps getting shit on in his life.  Who's going to want to marry that?

...all I wanted was the white-picket-fence and 2.5 kids.  All I got was a shitty apartment in the ghetto and a child that "isn't mine".

Every time something relatively-large goes wrong in my life, I consider suicide.  Is this normal?
