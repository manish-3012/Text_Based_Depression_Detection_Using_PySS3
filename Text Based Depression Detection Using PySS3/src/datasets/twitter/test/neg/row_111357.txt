I canâ€™t make it any moreIâ€™m burned out completely. I donâ€™t see any reason to live any more. I donâ€™t want kids, my career is a dead end, Iâ€™d never be able to achieve my dreams. 

Iâ€™m still alive only for one reason - weâ€™re gonna have a huge event this week and Iâ€™m too involved into it to be post-mortem cursed for an ethernity if I kill myself now. 

Iâ€™m battling my suicidal thoughts by thinking that iâ€™m a pussy and wouldnâ€™t be able to do it but catch this - I had an attempt before. And it was spontaneous. My mind is desperately trying to keep me out of another attempt but there is still a chance that it would turn itâ€™s back around for a minutes and thatâ€™s it. Mom will be sad, dad will be sad, my cat wonâ€™t understand why i donâ€™t visit parents any more, my roommates will be forced to pay more, i mean haha yes. 

Fuck this shit of an existence and fuck my life which I fucked up by having negative traits from the start and making wrong decisions.
