Today will be the dayHello. I'm a woman  from  Brazil, I don't speak English fluently.
Here is a short resume from my life till now: my mother is narcissistic to the hell and genuinely hate me and thinks the whole world has something against or with 
her, if you know what a narcissistic mother is you know is bloody nightmares. I don't have a dad. She (And my grandmother) mistreated me all my life, one sentence I heard the most is: you're a burden. Ten years ago I suffered from intense self mutilation
, I just since then end all this bullshit. But life goes around... I tried my best. I did therapy, I get prescription for pills, try church and volunteer work.
I got a full scholarship in one of the best colleges here, I'm proud of it but I'm also a dropout (she never congratulated me but for sure remember how shit I'm for not accomplishing it). I get broke, we live together.
My grandmother passed away last month (the such disease I don't like to say it's name) and so life has becoming something else... It's painful. Not because I m sad about it but the whole process.
I felt for my aunt and cousin who I love desperately.  They two are the best people in the world. I feel sad for disappointing they.
I'm miserable. Numb. 

I take a medice and my mind is kinda blurry so probably don't expresses myself well. I reserved a hotel room for tonight, got some pills and think about a  wristcutter. Scary the hell out of me if it don't work. No one knows I'm about to do it and the place I'm it's not in lockdown. So today is the day.
