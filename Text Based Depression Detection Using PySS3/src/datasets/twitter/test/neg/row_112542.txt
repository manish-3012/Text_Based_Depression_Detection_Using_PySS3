I just think I'm prone to sadness. I just want to die.Every time I get behind the wheel of a car I pray that some drunk kills me. I don't want to live anymore. No one understands how what it's like. I keep asking for help from my parents to go see a doctor but my dad always tells me I just need to ask god for help. My friends aren't helpful. We're all sad people in our own messed up way, and I get the worst from it. I just do and say things that make me sad. I'm incapable of forming connections with people. I'm incapable of doing the things I want to. I'm incapable of finding love. I want to escape. I want to die. I don't want to exist. And please if you have anything to say, don't talk shit about my dad telling me to ask god help. I've never hurt myself. Never really wanted to. I just want to die. I can't live like this for how ever many years I might have left. I don't think things are ever going to get better. How do people live? I'll never be happy. I'm only 21. I'm just surrounded by so much negative energy. All I can see anywhere is sadness. I've seen what normal was and it is so alien. I just want to die.
