Help with a friendI have this friend who I think is suicidal and she worries me. She's living with the guy she just broke up with, refuses to be homeless, and doesn't have money for a place. She has a pet cat that she won't get rid of. She says he's therapy and that if it weren't for the cat, she would have been dead last night.

She has already had professional help but she "hates talking about it" so that's all I know. She has anxiety issues and has recent history with cutting her arms. She has a vast history of crappy boyfriends who have done various unpleasant things to her.

I wish I could help her but I don't know what else to do.
