GuiltyCan't help but feel guilty for always wanting to kill myself when I have a three year old son deeply attached to me. He's the only thing I am still living for. Not my family. Not my friends. Not my husband. Lately I've been pushed to the edge again and again and again and I fear that soon my sweet little boy won't be enough to stop my self destructive tendencies. I'm slipping and I'm terrified for him. I don't know how much longer I can hold on.
