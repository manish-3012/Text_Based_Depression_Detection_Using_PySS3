I've been feeling intensely suicidal, but only now my emotional state is improving I feel I can post hereWhen this subreddit began I was one of you guys that was willing to offer advice etc. but recently I'd began to feel increasingly helpless, suicidal, and empathising with suicidal posters to the extent that I didn't want to read the helpful advice, I just wholeheartedly agreed with their feelings and justifications for suicide, and I wanted the pain to stop- abruptly!

It's only now that I've improved a little and that I can see how dark the glass I was seeing myself and the world through that I'm receptive again to what I know is sound advice.

I've been self medicating with black market tranquillisers, alcohol, and heroin, and (as the shit song goes) the drugs don't work, they just make things worse!

I've stopped the drugs now and I'm going to start making an effort again. Exercising, meditating, challenging those negative thoughts before they become self fulfilling cycles of despair, and talking to friends and mental health professionals etc.

I'm not sure why I'm posting this now. I just really want to say to you folks who are feeling like shit that you can get better, and that you really have to work at it, even though it may feel like a futile endeavour right now. Also you guys that are here advising, and just listening to those in despair, that you're great, and it's invaluable what you do.

We can all get there!

Cheers
