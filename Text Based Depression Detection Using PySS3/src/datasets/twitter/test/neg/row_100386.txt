Canâ€™t handle itLet me start off by saying Iâ€™m not going to hurt myself


Every time Iâ€™m feeling overwhelmed, my mind goes straight to wanting to off myself. I wonâ€™t do it. Iâ€™ve got too much going on to do it. But even the slightest bit overwhelmed, and I canâ€™t help but start with the suicidal thoughts. I want it to stop. And i donâ€™t know how. I canâ€™t even bring it up to my therapist. Because Iâ€™ve got kids, and theyâ€™ll report it. And itâ€™ll turn into more problems. I need it to stop! Please help. I donâ€™t really want to do it. But it seems like my brain thinks itâ€™s the only answer to any and all of my problems.
