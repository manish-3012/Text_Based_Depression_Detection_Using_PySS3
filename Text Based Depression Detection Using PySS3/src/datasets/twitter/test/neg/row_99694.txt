Why can't I just fix myself?I feel immense anger anytime I have to bother anyone with my issues. It's why I want a counselor, not a friend. They get paid to help me, my friends get nothing.   


So I don't go to them.   


But not doing this means I small little points where I let on too much.   


I babble.   


I reveal my true wishes...  


I just want to be able to fix myself. I want to be able to complete my mission.   


But I don't think I can complete my mission.   


So I don't think I can complete my life.   


  
Then what's the point?   


Why do others believe that I deserve to be a burden?   


Sorry if I don't respond right away, I'm trying not have a temper tantrum at myself.
