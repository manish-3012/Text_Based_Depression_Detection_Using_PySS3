don't feel too goodi kind of figured in the future i'd end up killing myself. this is the oddest and most foreign feeling. instead of really feeling sad or depressed exclusively, i feel also a sense of philosophical rationality that comes from wanting to kill yourself. after all, why suffer for your entire life instead of just suffering a lot for a little now and never suffering again?

my entire life has revolved around me being a failure. there haven't been many times where my life has ever genuinely been good. my coping mechanism with that is emanating a sense of fake happiness and joy through morbid jokes. i'm sure if someone were in my shoes, they probably wouldn't see a bright future ahead either.

i'm depressed and suffering mental illness in my final year of high school and it's likely that i won't be getting in to any colleges or universities. i don't want to do any of it over again. my entire experience in school has been fucking horrible. no matter how hard i try, i always fucking fail. school has been the worst fucking thing that ever happened to me, and i don't want to go near another institution again. i literally don't even know what i want to do with my life and i don't even want to do anything with it. my life has been fucking garbage and i don't want anymore of this. i hope this doesn't sound like anything menial, but i fear for my life. i fear because i don't want to end up in my mid-late 20's jobless (or with a fucking horrible 9-5), broke, worthless, and actually helpless with literally no one, not even my parents around me to help. so i figured if i killed myself sooner, it wouldn't be as bad. i wouldn't have such compounded depression turning even deeper, the utter sense of failure, guilt and regret that comes with living. i've been a relatively high achiever in my life and feeling this low really fucking hurts and makes me question the value of my existence.

i literally cannot connect with anyone. i cannot talk to anyone. i don't want to talk to anyone. it's the same pseudo bullshit from all the hotlines and web services. it's fucking horrible and making me lose faith in humanity and makes me hate my existence even more.

i've been depressed for several years. i haven't gone out of it. i did acid once this summer and that kind of changed my life for the better. but now that the reality of life is hitting me, and a shitty forseeable future is showing once again. ever since i was born, my life has actually been shit. abused as a young kid up til now. immense levels of neglect throughout entire areas of life. 

i want to contribute something and do some great things, but over the past few weeks, i realized that me thinking that i could ever do such a thing was a delusion. everyone around me has been telling me i'm delusional for thinking i can make it anywhere. i realized they were right. i'm sure i wouldn't believe in myself either if i were in their shoes. i really have no potential. i'm just a stupid fucking dreamer. i just wanna help and have an impact. i guess i don't deserve that much.

i'm always known for doing things really extreme and in an insane fashion. i want to go out with a bang and make my chances of living really low. i want it to be quick. this has never been temporary, it's been looming for a long time since i was young. i've tried several support groups, counsellors, and a lot of other stuff. i'm just about done here. unfortunately, i'm really good at lying nooses now and have a proper rope, a long drop system in place, some potassium cyanide pills and a 12 gauge shotgun.

i'm here looking for some help and guidance. i can't really neglect this any longer. i really thought it would fade away.

but i'm also very curious.. why would humans ever feel like killing themselves?.. why don't dogs or animals do that? i mean, humans have a much better quality of life compared to dogs. humans have all the resources they can get. yet they still decide the cost of being alive exceeds the benefit and value extracted from enhanced quality of life.
