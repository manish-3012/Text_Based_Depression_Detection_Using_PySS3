No one cares.Aw hell. My fiancee and I broke apart 3 weeks ago, I moved into a new apartment this weekend. The loneliness is getting to me. I miss being held and comforted. Everybody always says if I need to talk or hang out, just to send them a text. When  I do, either they don't respond or say "Sorry, too busy. Maybe next week?" I feel isolated. No one cares anymore-- my friends, my ex, even my family.  I'm alone, with my pain and guilt, and no one cares. I have always tried to be there for the people I care about when they needed me to be.  Now that I could actually use some help, no one cares. I've hit rock bottom, and I don't care to crawl my way back up.
