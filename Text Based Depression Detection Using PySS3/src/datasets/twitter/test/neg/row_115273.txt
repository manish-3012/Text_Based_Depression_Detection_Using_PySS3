I have multiple disabilities and no attainable goals in life.I've had depression for over 15 years. My disabilities affect my vision and hearing. I don't have friends because I'm too crippled to contribute anything to a friendship. I don't have any goals in life because everything is out of reach for me.

I don't know what to do.
