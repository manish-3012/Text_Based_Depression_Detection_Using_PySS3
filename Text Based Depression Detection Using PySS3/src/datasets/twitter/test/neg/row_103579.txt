Failed the first time now everything is crumbling againAbout 5 years ago i tried my first attempt i obviously failed but looked like an accident so no one suspected. Went through some ups and downs but overall had a fresh take on life. Fast forward a couple year i met the love of my life, jump forward some more we get married and im working a job a love. Why suicidal may you ask I constantly fear the future kids, never making enough, never being good enough. I hide my depression and have a problem with drinking. It has created problems but nothing to big until recently got drunk and hit a mailbox possibly looking at jail time, wife threatened to leave, big disappointment to everyone. I dont know whats wrong with me it seems like every good thing i get i screw up and drag loved ones down with me. Im almost to the edge again and i dont think ill fail this time. Gunshot to the head ive researched it extensively the past few days and i own several guns. I think wife suspects something and i cant bring myself to tell her how scared, depressed, and helpless i feel. She had me take gun i carry in truck out but i have more. Just holding out hope im not gonna go to jail, if im charged im going out im terrified but trying to hold it in. The darkness is crushing me im crumbling as i write this.
