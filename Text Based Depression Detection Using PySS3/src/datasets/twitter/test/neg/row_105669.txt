Mom just told sheâ€™s taking everything away from me . I feel like killing myself right now.Going to keep it short, but basically my mom just randomly came into my room and told me she was going to take away my horse for one month. I started crying, but just nodded and accepted it because usually my opinion doesnâ€™t matter inside my house. 

She started asking me about I felt about this and I couldnâ€™t understand what she wanted me to say. To my understanding it didnâ€™t matter what I said, the decision was already made. She kept insisting and I just told her I didnâ€™t feel like saying and that latter on she would tell me. She started to scream at me saying I was spoiled and that basically she was going to take away everything from me, my horse, my therapist, everything and that she no longer was going to pay for my studies abroad. One of the few things that actually kept going was the prospect of leaving this country and never seeing my parents again. Now that might be taken away from me and Iâ€™ll have to stay 3 more years in this god awful place with this god awful family who just blame me for all their problems. I just want to kill myself and put me out of this misery, then most pf my families problems will go away, no one will blame me anymore, maybe that way Iâ€™ll finally be in peace. 

Sorry for the post, I just needed to vent.
