I feel so lonely right now, I want someone to hear me and what I feel.This month has been a fucking nightmare, problems with my mom, college stress and now my broken heart and I feel that at this moment no one listens to me. My mom got on a business trip all weekend, my friends are busy, and my college friends are studying for Monday tests and I'm here lonely at my apartment crying with my dog and I feel desperate for someone to hear me and what I feel now.

Maybe it's my hearbroken and why I feel shattered that despite all the strong signals that even my mother beleived, he's still straight and I feel no one will ever be interested in me.

I just want someone, anyone,
