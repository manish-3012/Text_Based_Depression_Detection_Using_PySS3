Crisis Center VolunteeringHopefully this is ok to ask about here.

What would be a good organization I could volunteer for? Idealy remotely. There isn't a crisis center near me that wouldn't be a full time job.

I understand that there is a lot of training involved and I'm willing to put in the hours or pay for it if needed.

I struggled with some issues in the past, and talking to the right people helped tremendously. I would like to do the same for someone else.
