Please helpOrangelawn

Is there a country i can go to that i might be able to scrape out a living for myself?

If i stay in this country (america)I have 700 dollars/month disability income and im 100,000 dollars in debt. I have a previous criminal record and feel like i have no options here.

If i have to be homeless where is the best place to go? Im almost 40..i have chronic and severe heart problems and lung problems that i take meds for and have all kinds of specialist doctors and have not physically been able to work for 5 years now. I also have a history of severe depression. I have to leave because my abusive dad is coming back to this house to live with my mom after being gone for 20 years. Ive decided if it kills me im just going to do any work i can until i die.

Yes ive seriously thought of suicide TRUST ME but after nearly dying a few times it changed my mind. I would like to find a way to live and this group....ppl understand real problems.

Any suggestions please share i really appreciate it and need advice. Any sub reddits or anything that could help. Thnk u.
