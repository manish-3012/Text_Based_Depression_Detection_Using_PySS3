No more posts for a while! ðŸ‘‹I'm reaching the point in this journey where I know now that I'll just kill myself when i have the opportunity. I missed this latest one because I really thought my life was going to turn around, but due to COVID that just wont happen anymore. My death probably wont happen until two years from now. Things do not get better. I feel I'm losing every good part of myself but I cant stop. Many of us here are so alone. We work, go to school, maybe some of us even have relationships. We try to get help. But there is no resolution until we are dead. We all reach a point where there's just not a point in fooling ourselves. I mourn the life I tried to have. I hate lying but I can do it. I can say I'm fine. Over and over. I'm not going to reach out to people ever again. I will kill myself. This time I wont make any excuses. The people who care cant really be there for me &amp; it's okay, I understand that now &amp; I think it is pointless to cause them anymore pain. I just have to help my brother &amp; after I've done that ive done all I can.

Farewell you sweet, beautiful, courageous people. You make me feel less afraid to leave this earth. In some way, we are doing it together. I love you all.
