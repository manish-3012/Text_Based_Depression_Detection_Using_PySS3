Why do I want to kill myself?I really don't understand. I'm about to turn 21, 6'4 white male and have a great job as a bartender that I can easily save money with. I've saved a decent amount since high school and a few months ago got a 30,000 CAD insurance settlement for a car accident that wasn't my fault where I ALMOST died(so close...). I used half to buy my dream car, put 10k more into my TFSA and lost 5k relapsing my sweet sweet gambling addiction. I am registered for school in September, I calculated I will have enough money if I keep working through school to graduate completely debt free in 2023 and make $70k-$80k starting salary. I have a trip planned to Amsterdam in a month to see one of my favorite artists with my brothers. I'm a pretty attractive dude(I don't think so, but a lot of other people tell me I am so it must just be another mental illness. I'm 140lbs and look like a disgusting stickman with gorilla hands to myself) I have an ex girlfriend that I am on great terms with who literally begs me to come over and have any kind of sex with her at almost any time of day. I have multiple girls interested in me at the moment. The most attractive girl I have ever seen in my life has a crush on me(it doesn't matter cause she's moving far away soon, but still). I am on track to have an amazing life.

And yet I want to die. My days are like a sandwich of depression and sleeping 12 hours in a the morning, and crippling anxiety at night, with 5 minutes of pure bliss while driving to work and listening to music in my car, feeling mass euphoria and on top of the world. I wake up and will just sometimes start crying. I will get home from work and often start crying. I will be feeling pretty decent and then have 1 small thing go wrong at work, like I fuck up 1 drink in front of my boss and she says don't do that and forgets about it 5 min later, but I'll literally be thinking about that all day. I will tell myself I am going to be fired. I won't be able to sleep all night, even though I know I am a very valued employee. I worked at my old job for a year and a half and still had trouble sleeping thinking tomorrow is the day I get fired. Or I'll say 1 cringey/awkward thing to someone at work and it will RUIN my night, I will literally be mad at myself for letting something so small ruin my mood but I can never beat it. I never feel relaxed, I never feel content, I always just feel like things will fix themselves.

And then I think about suicide, and it makes me feel really good. Researching methods, thinking of what I'd write on my note, the last things I'd say to people, how I'd prepare myself and the location, and just building my notepads in general with huge amounts of information and methods just makes me feel so good. Like I finally have a way to beat my feelings that I can never shake. I don't have to feel anxious about anything or worry about how I treat people or myself because I am suicidal. It makes me feel like I have the upperhand on literally everything in life. I've felt that way for about 5 years now so I feel like I won't actually do it, and I am actually quite afraid of what lies after death, but I still do stupid things like drive 3x the speed limit over bridges sometimes. I really just want to know why my incredibly evolved brain makes me want to do the exact opposite of everything that is evolution when I have such a good life?
