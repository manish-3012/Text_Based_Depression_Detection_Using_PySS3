Culmination of things came to a head tonight20 years really meant nothing, because I just ignored the signs. Tonight my LTR is finally over. It was ugly and physical.
 30 years of fighting these invasive thoughts and I knew they would always win. It's who I am. I'm not going to do it now, I just wanted to say I'm really sad but also want to say how much I appreciate the fact I'm not alone and we're here for each other. No one can ever understand suicidal thoughts/ideation if they've never been here, but we understand what it is. It's weird when the most destructive impulses offer the most comfort.
