All I have is .22What side of my head should I shoot? I want to make sure every part of my brain separates where my whole body just stops working. I don't want to end up like those "I shot myself and survived" people. Is a .22 enough firepower to blast my whole head? I don't know much about the physics of guns. Any help is appreciated. i guess I have only 2 questions that could use some answers to help me be at peace soon. thank you guys
