I just want to die, why can't the world be good for me once, and kill me?I have no reason to live, i hate seeing my past in my head, listening to bullies at school, and fighting with my own mind.

I won't achive shit in my life, i won't leave my country, because i won't ever have the money to do so, i will never have a boyfriend, i just want out, i want to die, but i don't want to leave anyone sad about this, i just wish soemthing happens... So i die, but not from my fault, or maybe once my family will know that I'm gay, they will hate me and i will be able to end it. 

i wanted to die since i was 7, i remember planning On stabbing myself with a knife in the chest, its been so many fuckin years, i hate it, i hate my life, i hate my existance, the only thing i still want to live for are my friends, but this is until they get help, i just don't want to suffer, its so fuckin hard to handle my thoughs, my mind ia fuckin screaming at me, too many things at the same time are happening...

I'm so tired.... I just want someone to hug me, i don't want any therapy, i can't get it anyways, but i don't deserve help... I remember being so scared of death, i had panic attacks because of this fear....
But now? Its a thing that i want to happend, i'm not afraid of not existing, we all die eventually, i just want my fuckin mind to shut the fuck up, that's all, i stole somekind of pills from my mom, so if i'll feel like doing it, i can at least try.
