what i wish i could tell uyeah idrk how long i can deal w this shit. like one second im feeling okay and the next second im literally flooded with these intensely dark and suicidal thoughts. I was literally just taking the trash out and now i cant stop thinking abt how much i want to like, i dont even know what i want to do; i want to do everything. i want to jump off of our balcony, i want to cut myself until i see bone. i think the question really is what dont i want to do. im so messed up. sometimes i just watch the same videos over and over again of ppl hurting themselves bc it makes me feel like im doing it. or sometimes it makes me feel worse bc its not be doing it. i used to save pictures of my cuts because i could look at them later and almost trick this pain because that's my skin, you know? that's my blood. i did that. Thereâ€™s a weird sense of pride, i think, and sometimes i could convince it that i had done it right there and then and then it would go away for a little bit. Or sometimes i feel worse because i did before and now I wonâ€™t, which means im a coward. 

I donâ€™t know what i did to deserve this. I can barely breathe, my whole body is throbbing with pain. Itâ€™s not physical, but it feels physical. It feels like its gorging on my lungs. Its breaking my ribs. My pain has such big teeth. Ive always done my best to satiate it. To satiate others. They always ask for more.

Right in this second, i cant stop thinking abt how it would feel to shoot myself in the head. My dad jokes that you could throw a rock in this country and find a gun. I know its stupid, and heâ€™s not being literal, but whenever i take walks around my neighborhood, i always have a pouch of pebbles, just in case. Maybe god will do me a favor for once. People are scared to kill themselves and i dont get it. It might hurt for half a second, but then afterwards, maybe i could breathe again. For once. Without choking. Without this stupid pain. It would all be over so fast. I know it wouldnt be pretty but i want to be cremated anyways.
