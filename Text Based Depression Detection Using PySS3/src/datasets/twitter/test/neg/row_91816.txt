I think I'm going to attempt tonight.I have a plan that I can't get out of my head. 

I feel so unloved and lonely. So hopeless. I can't stand myself. My life is a mess, and I know it's my fault. I can't even write this properly, I feel so numb. 

I can't bring myself to call anyone or drive myself to the hospital. 

I don't think I'm going to make it this time.
