21 year old male virginSometimes I feel okay, but every few days or a week or so I feel like killing myself because I have never even been kissed. Like right now, I feel so much despair I figure I'll decide to end it someday. I feel like my life is meaningless as a virgin. Tomorrow I might feel better, but this is a recurring problem for me. I feel so sad. I feel like if I killed myself I might finally get attention and validation through my death. The only meaning of life that makes sense to me in this moment is having sex with as many people as possible. I feel lonely and crave validation so I don't feel like crap. It is as if I need a constant chorus of sincere praise. I've been to psychologists, social workers, but they do not know what the hell they are doing when it comes to issues of sexuality. They have no fucking clue how to deal with losers like me who have never even been kissed. They have no fucking training in it. I feel like there is something wrong with me. I feel like my mother does not accept me for who I am. I am very very envious of people who have had sex, who have always had abundance with the opposite sex, who talks as if it is no big deal when they CLEARLY ALWAYS TOOK IT FOR GRANTED. I hate it when people are open and brag about their sexuality. I don't know what to do. Maybe I'll kill myself someday. Maybe then people will believe that virginity is something that can cause depression. Maybe then people wouldn't invalidate my experiences "Oh, sex is not everything," etc etc. Maybe I would finally, in death, get the validation that I crave. I don't think I'm going to kill myself anytime soon, but someday, if things don't change, it could happen several years from now.
