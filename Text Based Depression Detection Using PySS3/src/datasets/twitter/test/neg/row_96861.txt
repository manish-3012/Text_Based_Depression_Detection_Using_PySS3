don't know what to doI live with my boyfriend with his parents and family, after I was kicked out from my mom's house  
I have two dogs and his parents let them live in the garage  
which was horrible, but they're letting me live here, so I couldn't refuse, could I?   
But now they want them out because his sister is blaming them for pooping in her baby carriage, which the dogs had no access too.  
they want my dogs out now and I have nowhere to go   
life seems so hopeless, like nothing is going right   
even though i have been trying, seriously trying.   
I'm 20 with a part-time job, looking for a second job, starting college, things are finally going okay with my boyfriend, but I feel so depressed/anxious, horrible pit in my stomach every time I think about their ultimatum   
what do they expect me to do?? they know I can't do anything with them, that I have nowhere else to go.    
they're 4 and 5 years old, I had them since they were puppies.  
They have been with me through so much. I miss sleeping under the covers with them and feeling their warmth. they have it so bad  nowadays. outside, tied up all day and stuck in a dark, humid garage all night.  no matter how many times they're taken out for walks or played with, they're still trapped.
