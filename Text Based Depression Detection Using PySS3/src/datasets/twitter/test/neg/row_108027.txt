It's all so overwhelming.This is going to be a mistake posting on this account. But who cares, right? It's been on my mind for a while now. I've been think and pondering. I can still be happy but it's always in the back of my head. I see people and wonder how they don't just give up already. Like seriously. How do some people go through this shit? And I'm out here like an idiot wanting to give up over nothing. I just want it all to go away. All of my problemas and worries. I just want to have to stop dealing with disappointment, failure, rejection, humiliation, disorders, all of it. Buts too much to think about. Almost every night I break down. Because it's. Too. Much. I'm break-ins down right now. I wanna do it but I too much of a wuss to even half-commit. But still, it just overwhelms me at night. I'm just repeating myself now. Hopefully no one I know see this. Good luck to everyone?
