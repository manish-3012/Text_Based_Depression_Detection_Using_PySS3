Planning on ending itI'm not sure whether or not I want to end it but I've been thinking about it lately. But I've been having issues with my mother which stem from problems that I created with my absence from school. I missed work but I've passed my assignments that's what I thought was more important as that affected my final grade more, it comes from problems as the way she talks to me calling me useless, a nobody in future and overly just very hurtful words. I see why she gets angry but still, I have grown a deep hatred towards her in fact almost everybody in my life except my friends, times were much more simple when I was younger I'm 17 so this time is the most important as I have my life ahead of me yada yada. I kept my emotions hidden, to be honest, these thoughts only recently arose so don't know why I'm here I'm just venting out my emotions. Think what she said was that "I would be a nobody in the future..." and I agree with her I get decent grades but I don't know what I want to do in the future and if I'm that much of a burden to her I think she should just let me go. I already made a plan that was to take a bunch of anti depressants and jump off a suicide bridge and to watch the night sky one last time. This is only an idea but if things get worst I might have to consider doing it. My only wish is if I had a chance to give my organs to people more deserving I will but I know I'll be detained.
