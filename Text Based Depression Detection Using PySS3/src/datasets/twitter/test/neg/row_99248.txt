I don't know if this belongs here, but I don't know where else to goMy girlfriend told me that she is going to kill herself on new years.

We're in a long distance relationship(~1300 miles apart) and I don't know what to do. No matter what I say, she either ignores me or blocks me on whatever method I'm using to talk to her. I feel so powerless. I can't to anything to save her. I figured I'd turn to here as a last resort. Is there anything I can do to save her?
