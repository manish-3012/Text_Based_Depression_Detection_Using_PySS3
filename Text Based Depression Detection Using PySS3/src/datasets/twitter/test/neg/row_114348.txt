I don't know. I just need to get this out.I'm fine at the moment. 

My bipolar disorder has been really getting to me lately. I'm on medicine that keeps me okay, but it's not perfect of course because nothing is and I'm okay with that. I'm just so tired. I feel empty, sad, angry, frustrated. I think about bad things still like killing myself or hurting myself really badly, but I can live with it. I know that I'm not going to kill myself probably any time soon. I just see it in the future. That could be years or decades from now. No other way feels right. I'm scared for the moment where the thoughts get to be too much and I can't handle them anymore. It sucks because I know that's what will eventually happen. I've been trying to deal with this stupid brain problem for half of my life. I just feel like I'm running on fumes. I just keep telling myself to wait a little longer and that usually helps me get through. But one day I know that's not going to be enough. I hate knowing that.
