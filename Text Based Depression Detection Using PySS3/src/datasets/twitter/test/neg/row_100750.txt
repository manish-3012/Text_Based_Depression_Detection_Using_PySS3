I am successful but it still hurtsI am currently in a situation I should be thankful for:

- started successful business with my best friend
- doing what I love 
- surrounded by individuals who love and care for me

Unfortunately I don't know why but my state has only been getting worse. My supposed best friend has been hurting me more and more and getting out of bed only gets harder and harder. This whole summer I've been traveling a lot so I thought once event season is over and I can settle down -- I'll feel better -- but such is not the case. 

I wonder if I'm just too sensitive or anxious because everyone else in the business seems easy-going. There's so much to improve though and the business is pretty jank tbh. Just now I had to deal with an uncomfortable situation with a customer due to the lack of foresight on my friend's part. 

Idk I'm just rambling...whenever we're on the road I spend hours contemplating throwing myself out of the car, shooting myself, or jumping off a building. My situation is very complicated so most times when I try to find help no one understands or they blame me for the outcome of my choices. 

I guess my final statement is that I am okay with dying. At this point I'm only alive because of my parents, but they don't even support what I do. 

I know there's something wrong with me/my life, but I don't know what, so therefore I cannot find the solution...
