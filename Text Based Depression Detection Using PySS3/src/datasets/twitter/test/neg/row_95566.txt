Tonight might be the night.I don't think anyone really gives a shit, but I don't care anymore. I'm currently sitting at my desk, staring at my math homework that I don't understand in the slightest, sobbing my fucking eyes out. I'm so fucking fed up with this shit.  Every fucking day I get treated like dirt from every single fucking person in my life. My professors, my boss, my parents, even my "friends" treat me like fucking trash and I'm so sick of it. I've tried reaching out to people any they don't give a single fuck because either they're too busy with their own lives or I'm not paying them.  I don't feel human anymore. I'm so fucking lonely, the only girl who ever loved me left me over 2 years ago and to this day I haven't gone a day without crying over her. Last I heard of her she said she was going to do porn because she couldn't find a job. I just want to hold her again but that will never happen. I need a fucking hug. I need somebody to tell me I'll be okay. I just want things to go back to the way they used to be when I was young and clueless. Now I'm in college and I don't even know what the fuck I'm doing.  I'm too fucking stupid to really get anything done right. I'm so fucked up right now and I need help.
