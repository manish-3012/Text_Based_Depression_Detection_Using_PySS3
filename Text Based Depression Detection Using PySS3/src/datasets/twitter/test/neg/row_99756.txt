I'm Seriously Fucked UpI have grades that other people dream of. I have extracirrculars and achievements many wish they had. I have a nice slim build and some strength. I have a good amount of money; I'm not rich, but I'm not poor. I have a family that loves me. I even have a job. 

Yet, in spite of this, I want to die so fucking bad. Every day I feel my stomach rotting. Panic attacks are a normal occurrence, and I always appear uncomfortable to others. I have no friends that really like me; most of them only use me for things they need. I always spend my weekends alone. No girls have ever taken an interest in me at all. I am always anxious about something, and I am fucking horrible at talking to people. 

Everyone tells me to get "help," but "help" has yet to even come close to actually helping. Therapists and psychologists always tell me the same things, and those pills they prescribe me have yet to help me; they only bring negative side effects or worsen me. Once I get a certain type of way there is no stopping me. 

Although my grades and achievements are pretty good, I specialize in nothing. I'm what you may call an above average jack of all trades. In every skill I have, I can name 10+ people are better than me and can easily replace me. That's how I know I am worthless. 

I'm seriously fucked up. I swear I must've slipped into a coma a long time ago because recently my life has been a fucking nightmare. 

Nowadays, I've become selfish; I do not care about the reprecussions my actions will have on my parents and grandparents. I'm sorry, but I can no longer handle the suffering I am going through and have been going through. 

If I can't properly kill myself soon, I'm going to go out and buy some heroin like my cousins did. That'll do the job; it did for them.
