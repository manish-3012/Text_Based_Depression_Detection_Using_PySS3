Subconscious suicide, is it a thing? How can we identify it?I'm a 25 year old male, and I've had 3 suicide attempts in my life: ages 4, 15 and 21. I was able to find a reason to live through my daughter, so I haven't really had any suicidal thoughts since, but I impulsively engage in risky behaviors that can lead to death, such as substance use, alcoholism, unprotected sex with HIV positive partners, and maybe much more. After talking to a few friends who also have suicidal ideations, a few of them believe I'm trying to commit suicide subconsciously. I never heard of this theory. Is there anyone else who can relate? What's your story?
