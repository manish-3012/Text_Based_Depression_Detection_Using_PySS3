Well, I tried...Long story short, was drunk and attempted, ended up taking myself to A&amp;E and the following 4 hours were the most painful, discomforting I've ever had in my life. I then had to have a cannula inserted and a drip put in. Also had arrhythmia of the heart, which according to my doctor, "could well be the thing that kills you". So, my question is: How close was I?
If this violates guidelines, I apologise.
