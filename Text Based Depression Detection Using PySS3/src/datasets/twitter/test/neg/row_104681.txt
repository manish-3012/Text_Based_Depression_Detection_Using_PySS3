For what, why?Why continue living? Seriously, after 17 years I saw so many bad things happening in the world and in my mind humanity is just fucked up. Why would I want to live in a world, where I am being judged, laughed at, bullied, ignored, rejected. Nothing works for me, I feel like I am below mediocre in every category. I hated so many people before and now I begin to hate my parents because they tell me that I have a good life and I should be thankful instead of crying about my situation. Alright parents: Is it worth continuing living with bad grades, being considered an awkward, creepy, dumb, alcoholic, drug addicted, criminal fucker? Should I just, you know, "stand up, work hard and do something good and it will be better?". Well, I was friendly to literally everyone and still there were and are many people who hate me and they did some nasty psychological stuff that made me feel like jumping out of the window in 5th grade. In 6th grade I attempted to stab my heart with some scissors in front of my mum. In 7th grade I hoped to be run over by a bus. In 8th grade I thought about shooting myself in the head but I didn't have a gun. I think you got it...every year gets worse and suicidal thoughts exist since almost a decade. I had enough of this "life" so my plan is to drink some red wine (like a bottle, which makes me really drunk) then I pour water over my t-shirt and then I step outside in the cold night and I lie down on a bench, a mile away from my hometown and I will just wait for hypothermia to kill me. This is supposed to happen on november 8th 2019, after the math exam which I will fail as well, cause I am bad at math and there's no way I can improve. I tried all. Now I will try to take the easy way out. About 10 years ago I didn't understand why a person would want to die, but now I get it. Comments like "get some help" won't change a thing. This is more like one of the last goodbye-posts from me to this reddit community. Thank you redditors, you made me feel comfortable and accepted and you would often make me laugh. I appreciate everything you did for me, there is no way I can thank you enough.
