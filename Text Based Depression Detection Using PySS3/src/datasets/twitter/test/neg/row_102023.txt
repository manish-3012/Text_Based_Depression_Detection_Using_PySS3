"if you want to die, just go kill yourself already!"my forearm is now all bruised and really badly swollen from snapping rubber bands. my whole arm and my legs hurt from literally beating my self up. i dont hold back my punches anymore. i was trying to brrak my arm. if my dad hadnt been in the kitchen i would have gotten a knife and chopped my arm off. so many people here and on the teensw sub have encouraged me to keep going. without that  help, id definitely be dead by now. i dont know what to do anymore. i guess im just oversensitive. i can't wipe out those horrible memories. my mind keeps replaying those moments my parents said "I HATE YOU!" "just go kill yourself already" "my life would be so much better without you" "you're useless" "you're so ugly. who would ever love you?" and so much more.
i cant stop hearing them in my head. it triggers me so badly. i cant do anything. they dont know what im going through and from the way they treat me, i dont think i can ever tell them. the verbal and physical abuse haunts me. my friends dont even care enough to text or check up on me. i feel so alone and broken. i thought i was getting better. i thought i could do this. i realise now that perhaps, i was just being delusional. i dont want to give up yet but hurts so much. 
i already know how this ends but i guess i can try to keep going. just until i finally break down completely.
