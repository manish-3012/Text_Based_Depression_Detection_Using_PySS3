Whatâ€™s the point if more bad things happen then good things17 male here! I really donâ€™t care about anything anymore Iâ€™ll probably end up killing myself eventually. The only reason why Iâ€™m not dead right now is because the feeling of  love that I have experienced in the past from a girl I used to have a thing with . But Iâ€™m trying to decide weather or not going threw so much bad shit is worth feeling love. I canâ€™t think of any thing else that I would miss if I go.I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll make it much longer if I donâ€™t find that feeling again or other stuff worth living for.
