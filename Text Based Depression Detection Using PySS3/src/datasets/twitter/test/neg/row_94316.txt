Life makes no senseLife has been always hard since I was 5. I grew up with an abusive father and a mother that was never there. My dad left at 10 and then my mother turned into an abusive person that always made me feel like trash. I developed ocd at 5 and my mom knew something was going on and did nothing. At 14 I developed anorexia and depression. My friendship were always trash and I only met terrible people trough the years. I never loved my family like I should. I was almost raped by a cousin and a friend, plus my dad almost forced me to do questionable things with him, I canâ€™t me touched because everytime that happens I cry and feel like trash. I tried to end things at 16 and after that I almost died for my eating disorder. After that I have lived my life not caring about anything I made no deep connections with anyone, I hated the world. I studied hard to get to a better place and I got food grades but all my achievements were not good enough for my mom, it never was. I have failed in so many things after that. I ruined every friendship because I am piece of shit that does not know how to handle emotions and love. I lost the only real friend I ever had and now he hates me. I only had my dog, I loved him so much, he was my reason to keep going. I went to a exchange program and I just got the news he died. I canâ€™t with this life anymore. Everything goes worse every time I feel like trying again. I fucking hate myself and this world, I just donâ€™t see a point in anything anymore. I canâ€™t even connect with people anymore, my goals seem so far away from me, I just know I will never be happy. I had to die at 16 and end this shit.
