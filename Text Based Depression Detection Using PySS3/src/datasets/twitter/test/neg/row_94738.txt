My dad said he doesn't love meMy parents were out, os my bro who's 17 years older than me offered me a joint, ofcourse the curious 15 year old in me took it and surprisingly I felt nothing. Then my parents come home, my dad is drunk and then he comes to my room says, hey I got soemthing important to say. And I jokingly say "that u love me?" so then he says Nvm and walks away, at first I thought he was joking but then I said hey i love u, he wouldn't say it back, he says he had a rwlaisafiin he loved me but that was only for a moment, and now he doesn't love me and then he went to bed and as I'm going to be i say gn j love, do u love me? He jsut  scoffs seriously and I leave.

Fuck my life haha :((((
