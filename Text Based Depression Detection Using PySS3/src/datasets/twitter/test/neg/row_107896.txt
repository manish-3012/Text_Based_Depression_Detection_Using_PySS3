Gave up a long time ago, now have no choiceAbout a year and a half ago, I quit my job.  I had only been at the job for 5 months before I started getting depressed and suicidal.  I quit with the full intention of using up my savings and killing myself.  I had planned on going out on a big spending spree.  That never happened.  Instead, I did nothing.  I spent a year and a half waking up to browse the web.  That was, is, how I spend a lot of my time.  

I'm almost completely broke.  I won't be able to pay for rent, or anything, after January.  I've made no real attempt to get a job - I've only applied to 2-3 places in the year and a half I've been unemployed.

There aren't any options for me.  I don't have much hope for getting a job in such a short amount of time.  Even supposing I did get something, I'd be miserable.  Right now, the only jobs available to me would be low end jobs.  With my horrible employment history (having taken a year off of work... had a job for 6 months... then another year and a half off), and lack of references, I don't see much else.

I know friends and family will me.  I don't have many friends, and I barely hang out with the few I do have.  That doesn't mean much when I consider how miserable I'll be having to work, with nothing else to enjoy in my free time.  I'd go to work, be miserable.  On my days off, I'd browse the web.  That'd be it.  I see no other point.  It wouldn't really matter if I killed myself or if I died in some other way- my friends and family would still miss me the same.

It seems like I made my choice a long time ago.  Now see no other way.  I won't have money for rent - no shelter, no food.  I can't live like that.  I can't live unless I have some way of supporting myself.
