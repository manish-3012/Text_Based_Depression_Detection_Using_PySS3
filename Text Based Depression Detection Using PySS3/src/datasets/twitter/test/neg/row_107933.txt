Tired of this bullshit.(sorry for the bad english or spelling) I've posted here before, a while ago. I thought thigs were going better, but it seems not. I'm 15 years old and I know you'll think "oh you're young bla bla bla" and I totally agree. I'm too young to think that, but sadly, in 2012, almost 2013, people are as rude and disrespectful towards different people as in the past. I hate my life, bullying is constant around me, and seeing people fighting over nothing and being all dramatic about stuffs that aren't even important pisses me off. I've been bullied since I'm 9, most likely for my weight, but now I hope these bastards are happy because I'm underweighted from all this insecurity and stress. I hate everything about people my age and I always move, so best friends don't exist for me. I'm not the type of girl who even thinks about relationship. I don't want to live if it's always going to be like that, I have difficulties controlling my emotions and i think the only way out is dying, but I'm scared at the same time. I'm considered very talented, but I always lose motivation. My closest friend turned his back on me for nothing (let me remind you, I move a lot, and my true friends are most likely far from my house) I try to escape reality by going on social places like reddit, deviantart, etc.  but it seems like it failed. I drink, wich I know it's stupid so young, but god what's the point of caring? I'm not going any where in life, I have no future. It dosen't even matter anymore, I want help and the only time I asked a councelor for helped she said "don't kill yourself or I'll lose my job" what the flying fuck is wrong with people? I'm thinking about ending it if it dosen't get better from now to next year. I'm sick of it. Thanks for reading this.go ahead and judge if you like, that's what people always do to me anyway.
