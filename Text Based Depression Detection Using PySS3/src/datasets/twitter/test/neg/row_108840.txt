Iâ€™m so tiredIâ€™m so tired of being alive. Can someone please end my pain. I suffer from ptsd but my medication is not working. My family is extremely dysfunctional, and Iâ€™m dying inside. Iâ€™ve started cutting again to cope with it since itâ€™s the only coping mechanism that works. My mum wonâ€™t even let me close the door because sheâ€™s afraid Iâ€™ll spiral down even though privacy is what keeps me sane at this moment of quarantine. I love my family but theyâ€™re just so irrational and once again, dysfunctional. The only reason why I havenâ€™t attempted suicide yet is because I am scared of whatâ€™ll happen to them if I do. Itâ€™s only a family of 4 and I wouldnâ€™t say I were vital but I really donâ€™t want them to go through more. Iâ€™m just so tired that this decision is so hard to make. Iâ€™m just tired of waking up and seeing that I didnâ€™t die in my sleep. Iâ€™m tired of taking every breath that keeps my life going. Iâ€™m tired of everything and all I ask for is for my pain and suffering to end. Iâ€™ve stopped eating, sleeping, and feeling. Iâ€™m numb from everything and I just wish that tomorrow morning I donâ€™t wake up.
