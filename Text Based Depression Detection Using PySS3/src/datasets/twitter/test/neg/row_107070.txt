what's the point of a lonely existence?I swear I must have autism because my social skills are non-existent.  College is supposed to be a fun sociable time but it didn't do shit for me.  No new friends no girlfriend nothing. 

How am I supposed to get a girlfriend at this point in my life if college didn't do shit for me?  How can I continue to wake up day after day knowing I won't meet anyone new.  Knowing that nothing will come of that day.  Knowing that life is just a grind with no end in sight?  

Other guys make it seem so easy to get a girlfriend.  It is damn near impossible for me to.  How long will I hold out before I realize that life is fucking stupid, and a grind, and that I am doomed to go through it completely alone?  To go to bed alone.  To wake up alone.  To live life alone.
