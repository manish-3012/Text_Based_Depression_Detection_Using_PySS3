Sometimes I just want it to be over....My whole life, has been one giant failure. Every time I fail a quiz in school or try my best it's never enough. For months now I have been thinking of more and more fucked up ways of suicide. Tearing a hole in my face, having a public suicide ( I would go into school and jump onto a lunch table while I paint the walls with my brains) or any other way that takes a lot of thought to come up with. And with finals in school coming up I just want to end my existence. Please I just want someone to talk to.
