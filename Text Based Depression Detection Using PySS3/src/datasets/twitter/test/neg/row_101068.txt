Maybe I guess suicide is the only option leftI cannot take it anymore. I am done struggling with Aspergers and being humiliated because of it. I want to die. I have nobody or nothing with me. I just want to die because I don't want to live the next few years with my past ills and challenges anymore.

I don't trust anybody. The entire world is always seeking some fucking reason to go against me, when I haven't even done anything to them. Yes there are times I've done things to fuck up, but at least I realized it and I apologized to them about it. 

This whole world is against me, This whole word seeks a fucking excuse to put me down and tear me down, and I do deserve better than that. Maybe I shall go commit suicide. Maybe I'll give myself salvation and exit from this pathetic and insignificant world. 

No, I will not call the suicide hotline or the cops for that matter. I called the Hotline 20-25 times and nothing worked since they all told me to go somewhere else. I won't try counseling as that didn't work either. Everything I've tried to cope with the pain has all been wasted with fruitless change. 

Please let me die. I'll beg anybody. Please help me die and give me a better life.
