Life is no longer worth living...I am in my 40s , and have reached the conclusion that life is over for me. Problem is , I am still alive ( but I don't want to be here ).
Without a long , lengthy story to bore everyone with , the bottom line is that I am numb and see no point in carrying on.
Life got really bad for me at age 8 due to my own father sexually abusing me. Then , an abusive stepdad followed and I did the only thing I knew to get out of my dysfunctional home...I got married at 19 to a ( yes , you guessed it ) abusive man.
I finally ended the marriage after 13 years. My children are the ONLY thing that kept me going , but they are almost grown and have their own lives to live. I had to move back in with my mother for now , and she is totally unstable , judgemental , and just plain cruel. Look up the term " Toxic Parent "  and she fits EVERY description. 
I am depressed , basically homeless , and despite a college degree ( that I graduated from with honors ) , I cannot find a job which pays enough to take care of myself.
I feel it is beyond hopeless and I just want out! Anyone else feeling like this in midlife? I have tried every antidepressant known to man , but it just don't work. I have planned my own funeral already ( songs , details , etc ).
