Guilt tripping someone out of being suicidal doesn't helpHonestly it makes me more suicidal. Like I don't already know that that decision would ruin the lives of those who love me. But I already feel useless to them, relying on them and being only the empty shell of the person I once was.

Why even say "the cowards way out" when it's incredibly frightening to make the final decision? It's fucked and extremely counter-productive, anyone else agree?
