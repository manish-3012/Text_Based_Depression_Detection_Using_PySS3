Thinking about doing it this weekendAlthough I am scared of death I just cant live like this anymore.

I've had few pathetic rants on here and I guess that I should end it here.I just kind of felt like I need to let it out.

My life is a fucking shitshow and the only thing I'm doing right now is buying lottery tickets,betting and stuff like that.I don't even think about getting a job or going back to college.Im literally mentally ill,and physically incapable of doing something like that.

I guess I'm wasting my ''last wish'',hopefully I will come back here...
