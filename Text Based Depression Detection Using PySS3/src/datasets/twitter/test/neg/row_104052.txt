I'm giving upIm 15 and i have no friends, my used to be friend group decided to put another's persons problem over mine and not care about my problems which lead me to have major trust issues, I suffer from anorexia and every time I think I'm going to overcome it, I go back to it again. I'm also doing badly in school because I can't concentrate and in every break, I hide in the bathrooms and cut myself.
