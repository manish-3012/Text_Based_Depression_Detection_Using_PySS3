I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m doing anymore.I just want it to be over, i just want to hang myself or slit my own throat.

How do you deal with having lived such a false life.

How can I bear the pain?

Why should anyone expect me to.

I know people have been through worse but what I FEEL I know I canâ€™t cope with it.  It will eat me until I die sooner or later.
