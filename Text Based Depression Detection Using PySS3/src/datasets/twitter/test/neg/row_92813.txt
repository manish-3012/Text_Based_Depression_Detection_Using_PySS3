I want to sleep.I'm broken. Done. My time is up.  


I just turned 28 - and I realize life won't get better than the current, miserable state it's in. I've religiously been doing yoga, working out, hiking - taking care of my body for several years - but everything is an uphill battle now, and the mental state along with everything else, has deteriorated. On my 28th birthday, wednesday 23rd, I cried and drank wine, while standing on my balcony looking down at the hospital I was born in, over twenty years ago. At the same time thinking I shouldn't have been born in the first place.   


My options to go out are many. I am considering it. I've wrote some last few words in a notebook, marked and titled "this is the one", for the people I TRULY care about, what to do with all of my belongings and some last thoughts about life, why it never worked out for me and why I am doing this.  
I have at least 6 oxycodone's - if not 8 - from past surgeries. And 80 mirtazapine's I have as a regular for stress/depression to help me sleep at night. There's trees and forrest around me. A combination of oxy, mirtazapine and the forrest + rope is what I am currently considering.   


Every day I wake up I see more alternatives to go out, than to keep on living.   


Nothing is holding me back anymore.  


I've been following r/SuicideWatch for several months. And now I feel compelled to write my own post. I don't know what life is anymore.
