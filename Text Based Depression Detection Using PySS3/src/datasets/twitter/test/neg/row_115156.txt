"I still love you, but not that way anymore"I cant breathe. I dont want to breathe. I tried to please the best i could. But since i cant do anything right ofc i failed that too! 

I just wanna stop existing. Can i please die now? I cant live another 8 years in this hell im over it. I have nothing going for me anyways and im only a burden.
