No one actually cares about me. If they did then they'd check up on me.Everyone I talk to in real life knows I'm suicidal but no one fucking cares.

A few people have just gotten fed up with me always talking about suicide and now just ignore me.

A few people just ignore me when I try to tell them that I'm feeling really suicidal and struggling because I've already said I'm going to kill myself a lot of times and they think I'm not being serious.

Other people know but think I can handle it on my own but I can't. 

I really want to fucking die. 

There are zero people who care about me and I can't think of the last time someone I know has genuinely asked me if I'm okay.
