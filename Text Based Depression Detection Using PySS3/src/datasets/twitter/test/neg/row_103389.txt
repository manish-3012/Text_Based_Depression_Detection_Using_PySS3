Iâ€™m spiralingIâ€™m exhausted. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m sad, I canâ€™t do this anymore, I just canâ€™t. I cant take it. I want so badly to reach for the noose and hang myself from the shower bar, but I canâ€™t, I cant stand the thought of failure and not being trusted anymore.

There is a lot of reasons for me to stay alive, truly, but I canâ€™t do it, I want to be gone for good.
