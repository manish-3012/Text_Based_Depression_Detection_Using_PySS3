The universe doesn't want me to be here, so why can't I just go through with it?Over the last few months my life has pretty much fallen apart due to a combination of bad luck and terrible decisions.  Everything has gone wrong, I don't have a future and I no longer see a reason to keep going.  I feel like the universe is trying to send me a message - trying to tell me that I'm not supposed to be here, and conspiring to make everything worse and worse until I do something about it. I'm frustrated and furious with myself because I haven't committed suicide yet. I've spent all of yesterday and today researching methods.  I don't really want to die, but I don't see another option other than continuing to suffer pointlessly.  I made a very ineffective attempt the other night, only to be stopped by my partner.  I've spoken to therapists and called suicide hotlines, and the only thing they ever say are things along the lines of "Well, I wish I could help you, but...", or "You just need to take time for yourself."  Yeah, really fucking helpful when I already don't have the time, resources, or energy to finish even a fraction of what I need to get done.  THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN HELP.  I don't know why I bother to ask for it anymore.  I really just wish someone or something would push me over the edge.  I wish a bus would hit me or a rock would drop on my head from out of the sky.  I want courage to get it over with.

I'm in my early 30s, in what is supposed to be my last year of a PhD program.  I've long since given up on getting a job in academia.  I thought I'd be able to finish writing my dissertation this year and just go start applying for jobs at McDonald's or something, as I'm not qualified for anything else.  But so far that doesn't look like it's going to happen because of all the other shit going on.  9 years of my life down the toilet for a degree that, if by some miracle I get it, will make me LESS employable.   

For the last three years I've been working a job that, while I liked it when it started, I'm terrible at it and don't seem to be able to get any better, and it has gotten to the point where it takes up all my time and drains the life and energy out of me.  We're on break right now but I'm starting again in a few weeks, and the thought of going back makes me want to vomit.  Every time I go to work I get so violently angry that I'm afraid I'm going to hurt myself or someone else.  Unfortunately I can't quit, because it's the only job that will pay for my tuition and health insurance and I doubt I'd be able to find another job that pays me enough to live on.

I got in an accident that totaled my car two weeks ago.  Still waiting to hear back from insurance about whether I'll be reimbursed.  In the meantime, I had to put most of my savings - which I'd put aside in hopes of taking time off school to finish writing my dissertation - toward getting a new one, since in the area I live in, going without a car is really not an option if I want to be employed.  So my one source of hope that I might get some break from this shit is gone now.

Decided to move in with my partner a few weeks ago, after debating with myself about it for months.  The thought of giving up my independence was terrifying and I cried the whole time I was moving out of my old place.  We started to move things in and I felt like things were going to be all right.  I was actually excited about it.  The day before I turned in the key for the old place, we found out he lost his job, which he'd had for a month, out of nowhere - no warning, no anything.  

Due to the stupidest decision I've ever made, I'm now stuck paying more rent than I was, to live in a smaller space in an area that's further away from my jobs and my friends.  I swore I'd never live with a significant other, because I've seen based on my parents what it's like to be stuck with someone for financial reasons.  Now I've become my mother and that alone is enough for me to want to die.  If taking time off work wasn't an option before, it's REALLY not now.  I sit here and watch my time drain away, eaten up by pointless busy work and other people's bullshit, while I get further and further behind in my degree.  I'm supposed to be applying for permanent jobs this fall.  I'm supposed to be finishing my dissertation.  There's no time for anything beyond day-to-day survival, and I get zero sympathy from anyone at my school.  I see a therapist and I'm on medication, but I really don't feel like there's anything anyone can do to help at this point.  I've ruined my own life and I just wish I could get the courage to end it.
