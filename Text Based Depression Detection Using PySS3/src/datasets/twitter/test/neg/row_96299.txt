No friends, no girlfriend, no job, no real hobbies, no college education. Iâ€™m at the end of the road Iâ€™m afraid.The title pretty much says it all. Honestly thereâ€™s so much I could write about the reasons I donâ€™t have these things in my life but it would take me a long time and I donâ€™t want to waste your time by leaving a wall of text to painfully read through. 

First off, Iâ€™m 27 years old. Basically Iâ€™m just too lonely and broken and feel like thereâ€™s literally no hope for me in this life. I wouldnâ€™t even know where to begin. I know I should focus on finding a job but honestly Iâ€™m too depressed to perform any kind of work efficiently. Every job Iâ€™ve applied to Iâ€™ve been rejected by, and the old jobs I used to have (5 years ago at this point) my colleagues pretty much saw me as the laughing stock of the work shift. I was there to be made fun of and perform the menial tasks the other workers werenâ€™t willing to do. I was never truly appreciated. 

I donâ€™t have any decent qualifications to my name or any achievements to be proud of. 

I havenâ€™t had a friend wish me a happy birthday in pretty much all my life. Never experienced young love. Honestly even just thinking about it is painful. 

I donâ€™t have any passion anymore. The passion I once had in my early twenties has slowly faded away as my twenties have gone on to the point where I am now where I could be facing my impending doom and not feel a thing. 

Itâ€™s over Iâ€™m afraid, without ever even beginning.
