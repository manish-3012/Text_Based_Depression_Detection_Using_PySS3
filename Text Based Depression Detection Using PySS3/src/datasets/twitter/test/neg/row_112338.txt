I have everything I ever wanted and I'm still not ok. FunnnnnI'm a commercial lawyer making bank and also have opportunities at my firm to do meaningful pro bono and support my people (Aboriginal Australians), which I do on the reg. I enjoy my commercial work also; it's high volume, high importance work that you read about in the news.

I have a wonderful partner who I have been with for three years. He was with me quizzing me while I got my law degree and he wakes me in the morning with kisses and love. I do the same; I truly love this man.

I still hate being alive! I wish I could laugh at how silly  I was thinking it would be different now, but I can't.
