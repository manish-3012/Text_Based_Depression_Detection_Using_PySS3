New year is making me want to kill myself even moreEveryone is so happy and acting like everything will be great now. My parents won't stop talking about a sense of relief and how much better 2021 will be even if its not at first. My problems are not because of covid. I am desperate to die and nothing is making me feel better. I wish people would stop acting like everything is great
