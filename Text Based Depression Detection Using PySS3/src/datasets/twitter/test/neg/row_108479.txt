No point in waking up, no desire to.Just nothing that is worth being alive. I'll ever have another relationship, so no family in my future. My job is a complete dead end and despite interview after interview, I can't get another job. Too old to go back to school and no way to pay mortgage, car, credit card bills even if I worked up the nerve to try to finish my M.S. My entire life has been nothing but an exercise in frustration and depression, sensing my potential and having to endure it being shit on over and over and over, despite my efforts to do right be myself and make changes. I just need to find a way that won't hurt.
