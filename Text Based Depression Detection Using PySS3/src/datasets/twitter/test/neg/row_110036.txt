Last shot at lifeNo matter what I do I can't seem to get anywhere, all my friends have grown tired of me my phone hasn't been rang for over a month and I can't recall the last time I genuinely felt happy.

Each day is a hassle and I'm getting to the end of the line, if this is how the rest of my life'll be I  don't want it. So I've decided; this summer I'll try and make new friends and try to be the opposite of what I am and of what I despise, if nothing changes then I'll end it.

I don't know why I'm telling you guys this, but I guess it's cuz I have no one else to say this to.
