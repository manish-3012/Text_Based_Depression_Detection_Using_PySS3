My friend has just confessed she tried to kill herself last week, the second I left her house for the night. What can I do from now on to help?Title,

I've just come visiter her today and she dropped this bomb. I tried so hard not to cry and she did too. She said she is feeling better than ever now, and I can see it too, but even then, I feel like I need to do something MORE.

She said it was a wake up call, she wants to go on. But still,
what can I do to help her? To those who are having a hard time, what would you wish your friend to for you?

Thanks a lot.
