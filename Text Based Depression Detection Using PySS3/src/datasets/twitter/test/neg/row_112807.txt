I literally almost killed myself.I had everything perfectly planned: clean house, nice music playing, and I had just had a nice dinner with my family. I was sitting on my bed with my pistol and was taking â€œpractice shotsâ€ by pulling the trigger with the safety on. I was about to pull a â€œsafety shot but for some reason I aimed at the floor and the gun fired. I thought it was on safe. I almost just ended my life but now Iâ€™m just sitting on my bed in utter disbelief that I almost died; I donâ€™t even know how I feel.
