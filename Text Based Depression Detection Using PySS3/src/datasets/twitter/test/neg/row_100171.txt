what have i done for everyone to hate me so much?i cant i dont even know anymore im screwing up i dont deserve anything i dont deserve to be here ive tried many times to end it yet never succeeded some redditors think im a liar well i sory if u dont believe me fly to perth and come to my house and ask my sister yourserlf see my hospital review and check the bottle of pills bc there gone i dont think anyone realises how much it hurts to face school have anxiety hit so bad to the point u start crying that u cant face class no one has no clue how much it hurts to get bullied no one knows and not even him i thought would know but i guess not all they care about is what they here about me what other people, redditors say behind my back its hard to get bulied then come on here and see one redditor say im a liar that im an attention seeking leech and a few others but i no longer can do it my bf is the reason for me to live in this pathetic life of mine but i think hes breaking up with me so oh well its just sad how i can now say im cursed nothing ever good happens in my life anymore i cant even think straight no one knows how much it hurts inside to the point i cant put up with it anymore i dont see any point in my life anymore maybe life just isnt cut out for me.
bc honestly i never one deserved to be here thats what everyone says to me these days so i guess thats it.

gotta do whats best. 

gotta do what i need to do and this is my decision noboby cares anyways.
so goodbye i cant fight this war anymore i cant fight the bullying the lies and most of all my personal problems.

thanks to those who hates me and thought doing this wouldn't hurt but it has impacted a lot on me lately so i guess thats all i need to say.

thank u to my bf that loved me and treated me way better then any other guy i love u always and im sorry for being a fuck up u deserve better then having a piece of shit of me u deserve someone better.

im sorry to everyone who cared and been there but its now the day i got to do this me ending my own life is probably the only way out so bye hopefully i succeed, goodbye.

sincerely em.
