It's getting harder to hold onI try to be hopeful. I got a raise at work and am trying to keep up with two jobs. I'm trying so hard but nobody can see it. It's never enough. Just working and smoking can't cut it any more. It's just a constant cycle with too much sleep and sometimes self harm. Every day I manage more I just fall back the next. I've never been as alone as the past few weeks. My best and only friend is gone for good. I miss her so much. Nobody ever talks to me. Nobody truly cares or ever will and I've now realized that. Suicide feels so close and all I have to do is reach out and grab it. I'm almost there.
