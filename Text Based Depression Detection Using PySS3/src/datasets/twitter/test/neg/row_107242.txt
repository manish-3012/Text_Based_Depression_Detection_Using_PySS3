Hey guys Iâ€™m back...Thought I was doing better, and maybe I sort of am. But it sort of... feels good to be here. Iâ€™m in a lot of pain. Tried to post on r/divorce and the shittheads mustâ€™ve skimmed my post because they misunderstood me GRAVELY.

And they told me I was the monster my STBX said I was.

They honestly really did not get the situation at a very fundamental level, so why should I care? I just was hoping for some support. 

If Iâ€™m the biggest fool on the planet for thinking Iâ€™m nice and smart and worth while, than why do I want to live if the opposite is true?

Honestly Iâ€™m fine. *Iâ€™m fine.* Iâ€™m fine. 

I wonâ€™t do anything. 

But part of me wishes I could leave this craziness behind. 

The self loathing either does or doesnâ€™t help depending on your angle.

I hate myself and my situation.

Iâ€™m alone. 

Iâ€™m trapped.

Imagining death feels... relieving.
