I can't take this anymoreIm 19, and i don't want to live anymore. I can't concentrate in school, my grades are falling, finals are coming up and i can't seem to do anything. I've always wanted to die but now i started cutting because i don't know what to do anymore. My friends keep fucking ignoring me or they don't listen to what i have to say. I just saw my ex gfs story on instagram and i started crying, i can't get her out of my head. Worst of all, i am sabotaging my own life: I don't do my homework on purpose, i decline offers to go outside, i keep looking up my ex gf, i don't study, i sleep all day. It's like im forcing myself into a corner that the only way out will be to hang myself and i so want to fucking kill myself, i can't take this anymore. I'm such a mess.
