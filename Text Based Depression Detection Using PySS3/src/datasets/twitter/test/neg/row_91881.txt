I thought I was over my feelings for my friend. Few days ago they started coming back and I realize I can never have what I really want with her. Continuing on seems pointless.My asexual friend and I had a serious rough patch a few years ago. Stopped talking to each other until last year and things havenâ€™t been the same, understandable since I was horrible towards her. She was coming out as ace and all I wanted was a relationship with her, and I didnâ€™t support her. Tried to convince her to just give it a shot, telling her I didnâ€™t want sex, just more like a working partnership. She wasnâ€™t interested in me, explained that she just couldnâ€™t see me in the way, and things went downhill, and I spent a few years in a spiral. Started eventually going to therapy and getting better, and she came back into my life.

Now all these years later, she has a partner and does cam shows. Sheâ€™s not romantically or sexually interested in anyone. But she has the roommate/partner person that I always wanted to be. Even more than I ever wanted because sheâ€™s doing porn. And I should be happy. She has someone who cares about her and didnâ€™t reject her like I did. And now sheâ€™s happy, as far as I can tell. 

I even have a relationship of my own. Weâ€™ve been together for years through some serious stuff. I should be happy with what I have. I should be happy my friend has found something that makes her happy. I should be happy sheâ€™s in my life again at all. 


And Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™m miserable. I thought I was past this. And apparently Iâ€™m not. She has exactly what Iâ€™ve always wanted. And I have no obligation to that, nor am I entitled to anyoneâ€™s feelings. I donâ€™t get to choose who someone cares about. I just wish I could choose who I care about. Because itâ€™s tearing me apart inside knowing that the person who Iâ€™ve been telling myself for years I couldnâ€™t be with because she didnâ€™t want that with anyone; now has someone she wants that life with. And it isnâ€™t me. And Iâ€™ve never wanted to put a gun to my head so badly.
