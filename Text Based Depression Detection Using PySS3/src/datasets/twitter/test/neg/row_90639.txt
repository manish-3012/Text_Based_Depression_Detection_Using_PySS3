My wife attempted suicide a few hours ago, what happens now?My wife ate 20 ambian about 6 hours ago.  I arrived home an hour after she took them.  She could barely talk but she told me she took 20 ambian.  I called 911.  The parimedics arrived and the police.  They took her to the hospital.  The doctors say she is going to be ok.  The police said she is going to be held for a psyc eval after the drugs ware off.  

What happens to us now?  What is tomorrow going to be like?  What about next week?

Also, my wife is from Mexio and she's in the US on a student visa getting her PhD.  I'm a US citizen.  I'm planing on talking to a lawyer on Monday.   Anything else you know about that subject would help.

UPDATE:

My wife is "voluntarily" in analysis / treatment.  This means that she is in a facility that watches her to make sure she doesn't attempt to kill her self again, get her medicated and will set her up with a psychiatrist, therapist and doctor, all scheduled in the next week.  I brought her "street" clothes but they can't have draw strings, etc. so patients can't hang themselves etc.  She should be released in the next few days.

The ER psyc dude explained our options.  We could "voluntarily" enter the program or we could refuse and argue to a judge ... He didn't present it as if we had options.  That said, the little therapy she has had so far has been very helpful, so I think one should welcome the therapy.   

I got to visit her for 1.5 hours today.  I can't visit her tomorrow.  Visitation is very limited.
