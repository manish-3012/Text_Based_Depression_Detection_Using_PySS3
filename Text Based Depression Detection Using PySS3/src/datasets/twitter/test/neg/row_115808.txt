Hang in there folksI feel terrible reading some of the stories here, and embarrassed that I thought I had things bad.  I'm in my early 40s, struggled with depression my whole life, at times feeling almost normal but always susceptible to a trough.
Now through a series of poor decisions I have not just the depression but am flat broke after some truly awful financial moves and very (very) poor career outlook.

And yet- as worthless as I certainly feel, and as angry as I am at myself all the time, I had a good friend commit suicide several years ago and it completely ruined his family.  I just can't see doing that (yet).
I don't know if it would be easier for me if I had someone or something to blame for my situation other than my own stupidity, but I do know I'm not prepared to unleash this on my family.

So if you're thinking nobody cares, or nobody will miss you if you're gone, it's just not the case.  I know my buddy was feeling that way at the end and it wasn't true at all.

Best of luck to all of us.
