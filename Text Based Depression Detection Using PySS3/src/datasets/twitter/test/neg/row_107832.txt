In a matter of minutes, my life turned upside-down ans now I'm hopelessI made an account for this sole purpose. I'll explain what happened and then my thoughts.

Background- I'm a seventeen year old girl. My family is nice for the most part, except my mother sometimes doesn't have the greatest of mindset or ideas of whats best for me. She's a little selfish, but overall I am very greatful for what I have.

Today I was browsing on the internet and happened to leave my facebook open. I completely forgot to log out and the laptop was left unattended until my mother decided to go on. Her, being the huge snoop that she is, decided to look through every single one of my messages. She discovered me trash talking her (as she and I regularly get into fights about which university I am going to), how promiscuous I was, how I recently started talking to a friend that I was told never to speak to again, and how I blaze occasionally.

Now, my household is very matriarchal. I still feel like a baby sometimes as although I know she cares about me, I can't stay out past ten, always have to ask permission to go out etc.

My point being, I will probably never be trusted and allowed to do anything again. She's the boss. What my mom says, goes.

I found out that she saw all the crap I posted by her storming downstairs, saying she'll never forgive me and myself walking out to see the laptop open to my messages. 
Propmptly deleting my facebook account, I began to realize exactly the extent to what I had done.

I am quite a lucky girl. I am very greatful for all the fun things my mother has done for me. Taking me on special shopping trips to the states, fun times reading magazines, and playing animal crossing, and for her to see this. All this shit. I can only imagine. She has her faults but I certainly was irrational in my messages.

My dad told me exactly how I feel. I'm a lying, manipulative, ungreatful person. And I feel terrible.

If my mom is mad, she won't talk to you for days.

Before this she viewed my as a great kid. One whom was drug-free, trustworthy, and sexually smart. 
Now.... Ughhhh

Anyway, I haven't hit rock bottom before like this. I'm not sure what to do. I don't think I can face what is to come and I feel like I failed the ones who love me.
I'm to scared to apologize to her and on top of that I'm very lonely.

Over the years I've alienated all my friends and nowadays when I need them most, I have pretty much none. This incident is the cherry on top. Like I've stated before, it's showed how much I have failed. The only thing that's keeping me holding on is the sheer love for my pet cat, but I don't know if that's working anymore.

Please help. I'm in desperate need of advice and I feel horrible.

It's funny how a mindless action can result on what wouldld've been a relatively pleasent night turning in to the worst one of my life.
