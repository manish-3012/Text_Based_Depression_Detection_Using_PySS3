I want to die.Life's terrible and unfair for me. I have involuntary tantrums even though I'm 15 when I don't get my way. I'm autistic, obsessive compulsive and legally a midget. I have no friends and people treat me like shit. I have intrusive thoughts that keep me awake at night and keep me crying during the day. I have a terrible life and want to die. My family constantly mocks me when I cry or have a moment. God made me unfair. Why? I don't even know.
