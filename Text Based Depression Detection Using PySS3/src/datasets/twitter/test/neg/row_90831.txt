I AM NEVER ANYONEâ€™S FAVORITE PERSONNO ONE EVER CHECKS UP ON ME, NO ONE MESSAGES ME FIRST, NO ONE ASKS HOW IM DOING, NO ONE EVER LETS ME VENT TO THEM WITHOUT SAYING THAT THEY DONT CARE, SO WHY DO I DO THAT FOR THEM? IF I KILLED MYSELF THEN MAYBE THEY WOULD CARE, MAYBE THEY WOULD THINK ABOUT HOW THEY COULD HAVE JUST TALKED TO ME. WHY A, I SO DESPERATE FOR ATTENTION? AM I THAT SHALLOW?

edit: fuck it iâ€™m just gonna go to bed and try to forget about everything.
