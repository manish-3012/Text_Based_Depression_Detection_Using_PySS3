A ludicrous yet serious story that is cause me anxiety and sadnessI don't know how many of you will read this, but I really feel the need to write because I think I am on the verge of a mental breakdown: 
I am a guy in my early 20s and sometimes I have considered committing suicide beacuse I feel stuck in a meaningless life, and I cannot see a ray of sun in this darkness.
A couple of days ago, probably out of despair/depression, I decided to tell a girl a follow on IG that she is the most beautiful I have ever seen; actually we don't know each other and she lives far from me; without (high) expectations I asked if she would consider having a coffee when she travels somewhere near me (she travels frequently) and she politely declined (understandably I guess).
I realise this whole thing is ludicrous and pathetic, but her reply caused a sadness that is shattering me; I don't know how to explain this feeling but I experience a growing sense of anxiety, and I don't know how to deal with it.
I don't even know why I am writing this post, maybe because no one knows me deep inside and no one could even conceive all this, given the image that I have given of myself
