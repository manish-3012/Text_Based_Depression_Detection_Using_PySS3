I realized something this morningI shouldn't torture my friends to figure it out with my stupid game that's tucking ridiculous and would be another reason to kill myself. Instead I'm going to come clean today and tell them I'm suicidal but if they (or you guys) can give me a true reason to live (other than the super basic ones) I won't end my life. I wasn't thinking properly last night and just realized how bad an idea it was. To torture my friends with the fact that I'm the one who wants to die

Thanks for listening

Yours truly brandon
