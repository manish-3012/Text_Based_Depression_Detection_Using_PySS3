Hellhole of a household.Hey guys, I'm Jerry and I'm from the southern US. I'd like to say I have a good life, and there are alot of good things in it, but the truth is I don't. I have autism as well as depression and anxiety and sometimes I experience sensory distortion (color patterns in the form of hallucinations) I live with my aunt and uncle and they're pretty alright, albiet they have no knowledge of what I struggle with even though they know I have these disorders. My brother is a habitual drinker and he can be very threatening and upsetting. He's physically assautled me before for standing up to him about him bullying me and confronting him about it. Almost everyday I hear "kill yourself" or "you're the reason for the problems in the family". I'm a very peaceful person and I don't bother easily, but having to live here since I haven't gotten my social security after being denied several times and dealing with my brother has made me seriously contemplate suicide. He has no accountability, is completely alien to anything being his fault, justifies his actions by explaining them away or gaslighting and even believes his own lies he tells himself about how he's fine and we're the one with the problem. My aunt and uncle are in old age, and whenever I confront him about his threatening, violent, or insulting behaviour they construe that I am the one causing problems. I've asked them to kick him out citing his violent excusive demeanor and they tell me just to ignore everything he says and they tell me also to stop causing problems. They see me and him at fault for the arguing, yelling, etc. They even think it's my fault I got hit because their motto is not to realistically deal with issues. He makes our life a living hell and they see me as to blame as well, and tell me just not to bother him. He hasn't hit me in awhile, but they can't stop making excuses for him and keeping him here. I tell them if you let someone off the hook all the time with no consequences it will only get worse (and it has). All I want is to live in peace by myself, get my social security check, and continue my daily routines not bothering anybody. Tonight was the same, he got drunk and started calling me and my aunt "bitches" cause he couldn't give cigarette tobacco he didn't pay for to someone else. He made the threat that "we would see one day what being bitches like this would cause" making threats again. I told him he was acting drunk, and I was telling him the truth. Boy can he not handle the truth. He started screaming at the top of his lungs he wasn't acting drunk, started telling me to kill myself again for the 10,000th time, and started telling me I was starting a problem and causing an issue when all I wanted was for him to realize he was acting drunk trying to do something with someone elses stuff he didn't pay for. Then he started screaming he did nothing, I think he's drunk so much he can't even realize anything could be his fault. I'm debating calling 911, killing myself in the shower, or begrudgingly waking up to another day to deal with the next round of bullshit from a man who can't even realize he did something wrong and needs to be accountable and gaslighting from an aunt and uncle who think the only way to solve this problem is to ignore it. They didn't care when he hit me, they don't care he makes threats, they don't care about how he complicates my illness at all. To them, silence and apathy is the key to peace in the household and I try to tell them you have to confront his behaviour with consequences but I don't think they ever learned how to actually deal with someone like this. I don't think they think about me or care about me enough to do something about him. All they care about is silence, the bible, other family members that get more care and attention then me, and what's on the television and when I will shut up. So what do I do, you decide. What is the right thing to do?
