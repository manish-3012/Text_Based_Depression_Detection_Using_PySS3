Today my daughter should of been bornHere we are 21st of September the day my daughter is due, honestly I didnt think id be alive to this day. It really bothers me how no one else remembers her all I've done is cry today I'd give anything to trade places with her. I wish someone would just hold a pillow over my face or strangle me I wanna be with her I wanna look after her. I love you Olivia â™¡
