I'm sorryI've stayed in my bed all day I can't cope with this pain and my thoughts anymore. I know most people say suicide is selfish and I'm not saying it isn't a selfish act but when you know your Son would be better off without you it really does feel like the best thing to do. I love my Son so much I wish I was a stronger person and a better Mum. When I was growing up I always wanted a happy family something I never had. I thought about alot and not once did I ever imagine I would be in this position that I am now. William you're my angel and I'm so proud of you I love you so much. I'm sorry for leaving you like this.
