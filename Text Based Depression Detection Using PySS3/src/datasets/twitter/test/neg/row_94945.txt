A little help(possibly)I know this isnâ€™t how this really works but if youâ€™re feeling like shit just imagine anything that makes you superior to me, ok. Iâ€™m a virgin, Iâ€™m very weak, I have MAJOR ADHD, Iâ€™m extremely ugly, I have cheated my way through all of school because I am too dumb to actually understand any of the work(even if itâ€™s super simple, and I have no skills and am just a complete failure that sleeps my days away hoping to find more joy in dreams than I do my life. So if you want something slightly good to feel better about, think of anything that makes you, not me.
