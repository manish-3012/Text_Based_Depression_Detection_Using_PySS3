Wise Words from Seneca"There's no point in thinking one person will say I lacked courage,another will say I was too impulsive,and still another will say a different kind of death would have shown a more noble spirit.Think rather what other people say is irrelevant to the proposal at hand.Your sole objective is to wrench yourself free from life with the greatest speed.There will always be people who will disapprove of what you have done."
