It is my last day here!Iâ€™ve reached a point where Iâ€™m more scared of living than Iâ€™m scared of killing myself. Iâ€™m gonna bike to a nearby bridge tonight and jump. I canâ€™t keep up with anything anymore. Nothing is fun and I think Iâ€™ve genuinely forgotten/donâ€™t know how to be happy. Iâ€™ve been going back and forth with suicidal thoughts for almost 5 years now and Iâ€™m not gonna see tomorrow and honestly that feels amazingly peaceful and Iâ€™m excited for what all I donâ€™t have to face. I have made peace with the fact that Iâ€™m being selfish by doing this and my parents and friends would go through shit because of me but I donâ€™t owe anything to anyone. Nobody really cared about me and once Iâ€™m dead, they better not pretend to.
