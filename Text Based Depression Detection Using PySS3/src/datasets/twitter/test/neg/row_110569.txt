what is there to do?im fucking tired. i want to die. i wouldnt feel guilty leaving my friends, family, anybody. its not getting better. i dont think it will, either. every waking minute feels like hell. ive told my parents i want to die and theyve done their fair share of yelling and punishing me for it. ive begged them for help during suicide attempts, and was ignored every time. literally ignored. they fell silent until i stopped texting, stopped reaching out. proceeded to yell at me when i was conscious again. forced to go to school like normal. forced to pretend it didnt happen. i even forget about it sometimes. 
ive reached out to schools. my middle school made me get an evaluation two times at this mental hospital- my feelings werent so severe in middle school but i was recommended therapy. my appointment day came, parents skipped it. if i ask about it now, they say â€œwhat appointment?â€ then it all went back to normal. school thought i was helped. i wasnt. 
high school. counselors cut me off because my thoughts are too scattered, tell me to come back when i know what i want to say. counselors tell me that i just seem tired after i tell them my suicide plan in detail. the last thing i need is to sleep more. schools have called CPS too, nothing ever happens.
nobody believes me. i was kicked out of my house once- i called DCS and they sent a cop and a worker out. they didnt believe i was kicked out. my dad said i ran away. they believed that story. 
how can i just keep going like this? im seen as a trash human being- everyone knows my business and for no good reason. i cant help myself anymore. i dont even want to be here but my friends want me here. i cant call for help or ask nicely or scream for it because im blocked from it or told i dont need it. literally WHAT IS THERE TO DO. im stuck, ive been stuck for too long. i feel like im going crazy.
