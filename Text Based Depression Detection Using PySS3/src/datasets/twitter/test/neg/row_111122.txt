Whatâ€™s the point?I really just donâ€™t even wanna go on any more. I donâ€™t see a point to sticking around. I feel like Iâ€™ve already come to terms with death and knowing Iâ€™ll probably kill my self eventually I just donâ€™t know when. I wish someone would just kill me or I die in an accident so I donâ€™t have to do it myself. I feel like that would hurt less people. Who knows???
