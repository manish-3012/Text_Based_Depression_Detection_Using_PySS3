A fakeEaster long weekend and I haven't said one word out loud. I haven't left my house. I haven't seen anyone or felt the sun on my skin. I just don't have a reason or an urge to. "Friends" fade away. Family just don't care. 

Yet come tomorrow,  I'll go into work with a smile on my face, pretending everything is ok. I'll say "fine" when ppl ask how I am when I am not. 

I need help.
