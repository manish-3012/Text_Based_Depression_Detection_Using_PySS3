I may kill myself soon?First,thanks to those who take the time to read this. I ask for sympathy not pity. Please don't cite religious crap to me. God hates me if he's real. 


I'm 18 male. Mitochondrial disease has destroyed my body. IS IS GENETIC AND PERMANENT.I have many symptoms...MANY. All are 24/7: fatigue,dizziness,migraine,pressure in head and aching body,dry eyes,eyes sensitive to light(as in pain with migraine and everything is always too dark or bright for perfect comfort and it gets worse and better randomly),brain fog,reynauds,anxiety,depression,bad joints,weakness from exhaustion,anger,lung collapse issues,etc etc 24/7. I am not exaggerating,but I am UNDERexaggerating. I believe most likely there is something after what we perceive as death. My body is a piece of shit. 

I've cursed God and karma (I don't know if God is real. It in case ) (I have real bad luck. I can't describe it all but I sense it...I'm not crazy in that way I have bad things happen nonstop lever and over at the weirdest times nonstop. I'm positive there is some force whether it be physical or spiritual that is doing this to me). I don't want to live. My Dad is working from 8-4:30. On mondays and Thursday's,my Mom takes my siblings to taekwondo (which I used to do before my illness got EVEN worse!! I was a black belt!!!! Damn it all) which gives me a chance to kill myself. I force myself to go with them so that I don't kill myself at home. But I may just stay home this Thursday. Hmmmmmm....


I don't drive. I bought a car and got my permit,but almost ******* crashed from brain fog. Don't tell me it was just a  "beginners mistake". My fatigue and brain fog actually got worse. I quit driving and my car taunts me every time I go outside. My brother is better than me . I am full of hate and God hates me. I curse and threaten him(too mad). I want to cease to exist so bad. But I love my family too. I have a method and it should work. I refuse to live. My brain has gone crazy. I can't take true stupidity. I hate humanity(my body included). I have no friends. I dropped out of school. I'm in my room most of the day looking up suicide,playing clash royale,or thinking about how scared I am, yet how desperate I am to die. 

I just can't do this. 


I'm sick of being told it gets better.  If you were going to tell me that,reread my message! Permanent does NOT go away. 

Don't tell me to live for God. I would never live for anyone in pain,especially for someone who allows so much pain. (If He's real.) 

Thanks to anyone who cares enough to help. I am at rock bottom. I think about suicide nonstop. I hope to die soon :) :) :) :) it makes me smile and jump and dance(I don't dance or jump normally) when I think about suicide. 

Thanks
