Please someone help me.I can't do this anymore. For months I've been suicidal. Every day it's getting worse. I'm terrified bc I might do it. I'm on the edge. I just don't want to feel depressed anymore. I want the pain to go away. No one in my life will help, they call me overdramatic, pitiful, and too negative whenever I try talking about how I feel. I need someone to help me before I do it. Please. I'm so scared right now
