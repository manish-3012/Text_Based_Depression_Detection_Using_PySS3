I know how I'll do it.Pretty much a throwaway here, I just want somewhere to post this. I don't know where, when or even if I'll go through with it. But I am going to go with something I read up on that seems pretty swell (not posting it here, i think its worth knowing i mean its given me peace of mind but i respect the rules and the reasoning for them). It's pretty nice to know that I have a potentially easier way out that I could just get up and do pretty much any time. I'm tired and life is absolutely pointless. Things that get me excited or make me happy or nice things I just don't care about. I haven't even lived through things that are that bad at all in comparison to things you hear everyday. But I don't care, i just cant convince myself there is a point. The thought of leaving this place, this entire existence, helps me relax a bit sometimes. It's all I can really hold on to. But im not always in a state of mind where I feel like that, sometimes I feel quite happy. But being happy really isnt all that special to me. And when things happen to make me feel like I want to die (or i think about them) the thought of being happy again really does not register as something I want at all. I just want to be done with pain and done with everything. Honestly nothing seems worthwhile, fleeting moments are not enough for a whole lifetime for me. If I fail at life, then poverty and unhappiness perhaps await me, if Im successful in any way there will still be other things im missing or wish i had. And after all is said and done we die anyway. Well if dying is just nothingness then whats the point to all this?? why should I care?? To be honest i hope thats what happens though. An eternity of existence is the most frightening thing I can imagine whether its heaven hell reincarnation or whatever. So please I know this is a little off track now but what is the point? Or how do i get to be that i dont care anymore and am satisfied even with things going downhill now and again (at best only now and again). 
I hate these fleeting moments of life I hate loss I hate pain I hate my stupid brain for being so stupid and I hate myself for being and thinking this way. I want out and Ive wanted out since I was 10. I had a nice childhood, experiences people wish they had (not rich or partying or things like that, just a fun, enviable childhood for most of the world) but ive always wondered why I ought to care, then couple that with being enotionally crushed in various, seemingly insignificant ways at first to bigger and bigger ways. And the worst part is that I realize that I'm so overly sensitive and I hate myself and have no self esteem and I just want to die. But everyone else sees a tall guy that enough people think is attractive confident and smart and wouldnt believe that im just broken inside. I want to rip my face off every time I see a mirror i hate myself so much and i want to ruin everything about myself. I dont care what people think i have going for me, i hate that i cant talk about how i feel if i even start to bring it up its all about 'you know what people would do if they had your brains your looks your blah blah blah' well I dont give a FUCK they can TAKE it I dont WANT it. But when they say things like this I cant be honest, I cant take what people say when I start to talk about things like this, its always so judgemental and it hurts me so much i just immediately get mad and shut down. Anger is one of the only emotions i feel that i feel truly confident and strong again but its such bullshit, i see right through it and i know its just cause if i act like that people will either back off or feel like im not worth their time so its just comfortable to me. It feels good to get it off my chest this way. I just dont want to talk to someone in person in full detail, i feel like i would truly truly go over the edge and do something if i started having to face this. Fuck this bullshit goddamn im so stupid i just want to write this down and get it off my chest and somehow, someway, finally admitting this is a first step towards something different because im done. Fuck this shit and fuck me. I hope someone comes into my house and murders me tonight, better me than someone who doesn't want it
