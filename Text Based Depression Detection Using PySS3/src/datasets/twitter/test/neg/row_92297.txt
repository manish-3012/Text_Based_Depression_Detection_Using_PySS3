I'm losing hope and my "scheduled date" is approachingFirst of all, I'm in a very abusive situation.
Too long to re-write. Just go read my previous post on my profile. 

Second of all, I would do anything, anything at all to escape this hell I was raised in. I wanna leave and never come back, but I'm afraid of not making it in life. 

My date for ending everything is on the 19th of this month. I just worry that I'll end up still alive and monitored even worse.

I'm unsure of being able to succeed with anything. Whether it be escaping and living or staying and dying.
