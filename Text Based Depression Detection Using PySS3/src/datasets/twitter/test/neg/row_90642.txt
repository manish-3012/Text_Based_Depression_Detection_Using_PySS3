Life is boringI know this is going to sound weird, but i don't know how else to put it. I'm always bored. I try to find things to keep me busy, hanging out with friends, going to school, reading ect. But it's like it's only keeping my body busy. I feel distant, like I'm not really there doing these things. I occasionally have thoughts of suicide, but i'm never sad, or depressed when i get these feelings. I'm not even anxious, just bored. I never took these thought too seriously because i've had them for years, but i saw this subreddit while browsing new and thought i might as well post this.
