How do I tell my husband?Firstly, I am not suicidal. I hope it's ok to post here still. 

I've struggled with self harm in the past, cutting particularly. 

Life is hard. My husband and I have been married 6 months and right before the wedding we moved across country, from Washington to New York for his work. I still haven't found a job. I hate it here. I hate the pace, I hate the traffic. I have almost no friends. I miss my family. I'm constantly getting rejected for jobs and it makes me feel like crap. I'm so lonely it hurts. 

I feel too guilty to go out and do things because I'm not earning any money, even though he is adamant it's all our money and I shouldn't feel guilty spending it. 

My thoughts keep going back to self harm. I want to try to beat it but it's often all I think about. 

How do I tell my husband? I don't want him to worry too much in addition to his job. I don't know how to say it...
