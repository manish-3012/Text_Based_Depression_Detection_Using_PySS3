A life of false hopesHi so

I am 17 years old, I have been depressed for 8 years, and suicidal for 3. I have a good life, but my brain is just fucking retarded. 

&amp;#x200B;

My life has been a series of people trying to help me just to leave and abandon me at the last minute. I always am just about to finally get the help I have been waiting for all these years, just to get hit with a wall of "fuck you" right before it happens. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of my friends abandoned me throughout high school, prob at the fault of my own brain doing dumb actions, and the few I have maintained that know about my mental state now view other things as a priority over me actually being alive

&amp;#x200B;

I have though about suicide so many times throughout my life. I do not know the exact number but I know last year I attempted suicide 23 times in the duration of 2 months (I am considering an attempt as me about to kill myself, but pussying out at the last minute). I am at the point now mentally where I am not suicidal, but I wish I was dead. I wish all the stress my well being causes on my friends was gone, I wish all the drama in my life was no longer, I wish I didn't have to deal with the stress of finding a college, the stress of high school. 

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't a suicide note, but I have a feeling it will most likely be linked to one soon. I have been depressed for over 1/2 my life, and suicidal for 1/4th of it and I wish that I could just get help. Either professional help or by ending my life.
