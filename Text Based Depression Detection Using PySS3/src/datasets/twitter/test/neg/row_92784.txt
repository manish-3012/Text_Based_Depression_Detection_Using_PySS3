I regret so many decisions I take..I just don't think I can trust myself with decisions anymore. I think about the decision quite a bit before taking it
.. then I realise I should've thought more about it but only when it's too late. I broke down and cried for a long time today, which is not something that usually happens(usually I do cry alot but it felt way different this time). There's a person that has hurt me alot but everytime they do hurt me it always feels like a "that's it I hate this person now" moment but after some time I realise maybe it was me that hurt them and that made them hurt me in return.. and alot of times I act out of emotion when they do hurt me and it's almost guaranteed at this point that I do regret it. I can never seem to remember the bad things people have done to me... only remember the good times we've had which just keeps adding to the pain. I just wish I hated them so badly at this point.. but I can't.
