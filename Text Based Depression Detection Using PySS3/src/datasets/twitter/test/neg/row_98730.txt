I am at peace with my death.I have given myself a little plan to complete before I kill myself on the first of September. 

I work a useless job as a housekeeper, just turned 20, had to drop out of HS because of failing health and feel as though I am a background character in everyone's lives. I come home tired every single night and it tears me up because I have nothing to show for anything but bruises on my shins from turning over bedsheets and smiling fakely for guests who will never remember me. I'm gay but can't come out to my parents or they'll throw me out.

So, here's how its gonna go.

In August, I'm taking a cruise, because I've never traveled anywhere and they're pretty cheap. I've booked it and everything.

The week after that, I'll binge on all of my favorite shows and foods for two days, and call in sick to work those days as well. I'll hug my Dad and kiss my mom and go to the amusement park with my sister. After I've had all the fun I can stand, I'll wait until everyone is asleep, and on that night, when the heat is winding down for the fall, I'll walk at 3 am to a bridge and take a leap. I'll dress in my pajamas and carry my stuffed bear in my pocket, and just go. 

I feel that although the world never cared for me, it can at least afford me the chance to leave it. 

People have told me before that I'm a fighter, and I'm strong, and I can only hope I am strong enough to do this. 

I've mulled it over in my mind for months now, and for the first time, I've set a date. 

This overwhelming sense of peace that it will be over soon has taken me by storm and I cannot understand why.
