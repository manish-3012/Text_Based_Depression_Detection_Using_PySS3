TiredI'm tired of anxiety and life setbacks putting a break on my energy. I don't got energy to begin with and there's always shit around the corner I'd rather avoid altogether. I think I've been unconsciously sabotaging my own suicide plans because I still don't possess a quick and painless means of exit which is only thanks to my own laziness. And I'm tired of this planet. The internet is nice, but real life is like nothing but captchas. Sometimes like now it's difficult to tell anxiety from physical problems because I'm hypochondriac even though I also want to die, I just don't want things that suck like dentist but, because I've been sabotaging my plans there is always that one more appointment around the corner... or having to temporarily move out because of a water leak.. or running out of money way too soon to the month etc. etc. I know it's called life. But life kinda sucks in the long run. But I'm not sure.
