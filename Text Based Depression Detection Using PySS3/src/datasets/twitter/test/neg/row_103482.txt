Why am I Writing This?Let me be absolutely clear, I know this will devastate my family, I know this will devastate my friends, and I know this will devastate my community. Let me also be clear in saying that depression has made me look at all those horrific consequences and realize I simply do not have the willpower to live my life solely for the benefit of others. 
Tomorrow I am going to drown myself in a lake. It will be cold and painful and perfect, a quiet end to a quiet life. Perhaps if I lived longer I would find something to live for, perhaps I would make something of myself, perhaps none of that would happen and a year down the line I kill myself anyway, having let the cruelty of hope drag me down into another painful year. I know that all my problems lie intrinsically within myself, and I simply cannot bear it any longer. It's sad that at only seventeen years old I'm going to hurt my family in ways even the most vengeful person couldn't dream of, but this has to be done. I am sad and tired. Goodbye.
