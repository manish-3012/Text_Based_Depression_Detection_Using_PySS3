I'm going to kill myself by the end of the year, I just want to go awayI can't take it. I really will finish up my writing projects...disappear and slit my wrists. The only thing that keeps me alive is the idea of contagion. My friends/ family are strong af, but the idea of a cluster scares me so much. I'm the fuck up. I'm not the victim. 

I'm a 23 year old gay man, diagnosed with anxiety. I can't find a nice long term boyfriend. I bounced around from odd job to odd job. My parents still voluntarily help me out financially. I'll always fuck up. I won't be able to face people if I make one error. I've confided in some friends...but they shouldn't have to worry. I'm a fuck up. I try to be considerate, but I almost wish I had isolated myself because they would have drifted away from me. I guess I wanted my friends/ cousin to think that they at least were kind to me in the end...instead of guilt that they never reached out.
