i need a friendAll ive ever wanted in live was a friend is that so hard to ask for? Ive never really had anyone, everyone ive ever met hates me i dont know why i don't know how to change it, i do know one way out which is killing myself. (before you talk about family; family don't chose you. Tbh i think my family would be happier with out me.) i'm really at the end off my line here
