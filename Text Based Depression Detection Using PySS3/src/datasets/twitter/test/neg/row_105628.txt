Alone and readyI have been on and off cold turkey on my meds, this pandemic actually has some bad triggers I donâ€™t want to hear, and Iâ€™m alone, told ppl on social media Iâ€™ll die and even close friends donâ€™t care ... I wanna either od or get myself sick and die from symptoms. What should I do
