numbi am a pathetic person. i'm 22, and have wasted the last 12 years of my life sitting in my room alone playing video games. i gained an extraordinary amount of weight, lost friends, and completely isolated myself from everything. my father has been out of my life since i was about 3, i think he's in prison or something currently. we have no relationship. my mother has always tried to give me whatever i wanted in life, but never cared that i did nothing with myself. everyone i've met thinks i'm "smart" as i didn't fuck up in school. i did what was required of me, even though i've always despised other people and hated the majority of what i had to do.

after countless years of wasting away, i was finally forced to try and make something out of my life. i was sent to a shitty TV college. i sit on my computer all day, so hey, they figured i was a technical genius and could make a career out of it. i did the schooling, learned absolutely nothing i didn't already know. i made no new friends the entire time. i graduated with extremely good grades and everyone thought i had a bright future ahead of me. i lost over 100lbs over the course of about 8 months, trying as hard as i could to better myself. 

but i can't do it. i cannot be a normal person. i cannot speak to other people without feeling like a complete and utter fool. i am a social reject. everything i attempt in the real world crumbles. i've had job interviews and have completely ruined all of them, including one about an hour ago. 

i used to be extremely depressed about everything, i was a whiny little cunt. then it just stopped. i don't know why, but i just stopped feeling everything. i can't cry anymore, i can't feel anything. i'm sick of being a disappointment to everyone around me. my mother has remarried and had another child(we are 15 years apart). my little sister is the only thing that makes me happy anymore. i want to try so bad to fix whats wrong with me, for her. nothing works. they want me out of their house, and i don't blame them. i have no where to go.

sorry for lack of punctuation, and the insane wall of text, but i just needed to vent. i think of killing myself every single day. i wake up and just want to go back to sleep. i don't know what to do anymore.
