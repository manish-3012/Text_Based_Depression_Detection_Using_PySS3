I can't fight the pain anymore.
Nothing will ever get better.
 I'm so tired. Everything I do, every word I hear exhausts me to death. I can't deal with anything. 
Things go wrong as every decision I make.
Forcing fake positivity is fooling nobody but myself. I know for a fact that nothing will ever get better. 
I won't get better. 
I have known this all along. 
Thoughts of death gives me maximal comfort. 
I only feel hope knowing that some day I will be free, from this seemingly endless torture. 
I hate people around me treating like a fool. But they're not wrong.
I hate my parents spending so much money on me but can't get the result they wanted. But they are not the ones to blame.
I hate myself for being such a useless, ugly piece of shit. Its like when I breathe I pollute the air.  I feel so fucking guilty for simply being alive. 
I need someone to kill me right now.
