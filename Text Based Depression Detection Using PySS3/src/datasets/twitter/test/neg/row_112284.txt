i can't save anyone, i don't understand why im trapped here.i can't save anyone, i started to feel better

i tried to help someone close back on their feet

im scared, cause theres a chance i might attend their funeral, before im supposed to.


ive said everything, ive tried all i can, ive tried to be a good person

ive tried to help them, ive tried to help them find meaning, a point, purpose.

i put all my needs before theirs, i put all my wellbeing in helping them.

im trying. 

if this doesn't work, ive lost my own purpose

cause this is my purpose, i dream when i blink, i gather up ideas all the time, they're always the wrong ideas. im gonna change it to fit that person. 


power to the local dreamer.
