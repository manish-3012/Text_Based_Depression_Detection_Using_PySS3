Can't cope with thisI live in New Zealand and i'm failing College (Which is High School for us) Grades are terrible i don't learn anything even if i give my 100% my Mother is disappointed in me she hoped id be the smart one (My Older brother has made nothing of himself) all i can do is play games to pass my time, when i'm not in game i just feel so overwhelmingly disappointed and disgusted in myself  where i start crying. The one time i told my Mother about this she thought that it was attention seeking and depression is nothing, i have tried multiple times to kill myself by hanging myself but i'm too tall for the rope to snap my worthless neck. In New Zealand if you don't pass the piss easy NCEA (Our qualifications) you'll basically be flipping burgers for your whole life because your a fucking idiot to society. I confronted my best friend he said "Suicide is selfish" and i'll get over it, It's like no one cares sure they will probably be a tiny bit sad for a week but then it will be like i never existed. What's the point of living when i have no future and no one will care?
