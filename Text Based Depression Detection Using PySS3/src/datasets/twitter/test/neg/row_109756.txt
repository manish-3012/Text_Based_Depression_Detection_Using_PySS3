filling the voidcan't say I've ever posted anything of this nature online but here goes...

life in general's good,i'm 19, got a stable job, friends family and the like. but there's something missing that i just cant place almost like a void that i'm uncertain how to fill it. I've been alone for quite a span of time but its never bothered me until recently and suddenly i find myself feeling more lonely than ever,whereas it's never bothered me before all of a sudden there's a huge gap in my life. this isn't a desperate cry for help as such,just wondering if anyone here's experienced anything of a similar nature and has any wise words or anything that might help out,thanks.
