Just needed to vent.I know no one is going to read this but I'm writing it so that I know I told someone.Â  (If that even makes any sense)I'm a female and I'm 14 (almost 15)I just need someone I can tell my feelings to.Â Â I'm not the greatest writer but I'm gonna do my best to have this all make sense.  


My Story  
I was adopted at age 2 &amp; 1/2 by my parents I have today.Â  I don't know/remember too much about the whole adoption thing but I'll say what I know.Â  My parents told me I was found (not by them) near a police station.Â  I had been with my birth parents for about two months.Â  In a way I feel rejected by them.Â  Like they didn't want me so they got rid of me.  On top of all that I have this thing calledÂ MÃ¶bius syndrome.

Here's a brief breakdown of what it is.

MÃ¶bius syndrome is a rare congenital neurological disorder which is characterized by facial paralysis and the inability to move the eyes from side to side. Most people with MÃ¶bius syndrome are born with complete facial paralysis and cannot close their eyes or form facial expressions.  


Â Honestly I look like an absolute weirdo.Â Â A few years ago I struggled with self worth.Â  I just felt like I didn't matter.Â  That kind of went away for awhile until this year.Â  This year it has hit me a lot harder.Â  I feel depressed 75% of the time.Â  Now more than ever I'm considering suicide.Â  I have started cutting myself and I've been getting high.Â  Getting high takes me away from reality for a while.Â  No one really cares about me, so they wouldn't notice if I left.Â  Seriously, they wouldn't.

I don't want to die.  But I don't want to life feeling depressed and worthless.  I just can't..

If anyone actually read this in its entirety, THANK YOU!  

I mostly wrote this so that I could get my feelings and thoughts out.
