Why can I not?I hate when people look at you concerned or worrying. I hate when people say, "But there's so much more". I hate when people think something is wrong. I've done counselling I've let everything be known, I've let everything out. Why can I not just die. We let sick animals die all the time. We literally take them to the doctor and say," take em out it's misery". Why can no one take me out . I'm nit even miserable. I can see a better day but tbh I don't want it. I no longer care for living. There's literally zero point to life. Make other people happier, see the world? Get out of here. I understand what life is and it's pointless. Kill me now please, I will literally pay to die. I just can't do it myself. Haha I'm religious. That's the only reason i don't.
