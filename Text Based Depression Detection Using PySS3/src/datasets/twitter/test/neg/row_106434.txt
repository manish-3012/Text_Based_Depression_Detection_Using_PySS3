I promise my mother that I will never attempt suicide again after all these incidentsA few weeks ago, I attempted suicide. My mother and father manage to stop me from jumping from a high floor down to die, but I told my mother that I could die in other ways by having an overdose of medications, slash my wrist, or others.

My mother called the police as she was really worried that I would commit suicide. I was emotionally unstable as I crouched at a corner of my room.

A few minutes later, the police came and seeked to enter my room without my permission. My room's door was left open. They were just worried about my condition so they came in to take a look, but I treated it as entering my room without my permission. I became violent and assaulted one of the police officers. They pinned me down and handcuffed me. I was still very unreasonable and made things really hard for the police officers to handle me.

They brought me to the police station and put me in a temporary cell. I waited for a few hours, but I broke down mentally eventually and had a violent outburst at the cell. They asked the Investigation Officer (IO) to interview me quickly. After the interview, I was sent to Institute of Mental Health (IMH) Singapore.

The police officers were around when the doctor was seeing me, so I did not feel comfortable to tell the doctor about my problems. I was then warded at the hospital.

During my first few days in IMH, I was very quiet. One day, I sat at a corner and I was observing a boy. I was peeping at the boy. I thought he has limited social skills like me, so nobody will like him. Surprisingly, the patients there still talk to him. They saw me peeping at the boy and thought that I was a bad person. They said words that hurt me.

Another day, one person is talking to this boy, and I thought that this person was trying to hurt me by playing and being friendly with this boy in front of me. I punched this person from behind 2 times at the front of his face and hammered 1 time on his upper back muscles. I was tied up and the nurses ask the people in the ward to try not to agitate me by acting friendly with each other in front of me.

The doctor knew that I had punched a person in the ward and he had me hospitalized for an even longer period. I threatened to harm myself, but I would still be hospitalized for a longer period despite my threat.

Once people start to know that I am actually very upset to have no friends talking to me, one of the patients in the ward approached me. He was friendly to me several times and I was really happy.

I was then sent to another ward. I requested it. I am no longer scared that people will bully me. A new place is a new beginning, so no one knows me, unlike in the previous ward, whereby everyone knows about me and my weakness.

I was finally released. However, every month, I have to go back to the police station to report to the police officer, until one day the police said that I do not have to come to the police station anymore.

I promised my mother that I will never attempt suicide again after this. This is because when you are about to commit suicide, your mood is already very low. If you did not complete the suicide, they would sent you to a place like IMH Singapore where the living conditions were far worse. Every month, you will also have to report to the police.

I attempted suicide, but I am afraid to die. I don't have the courage to die. If you were me, you should transfer that courage to die to courage to live instead. Don't try to kill yourself. Every person's life is precious.
