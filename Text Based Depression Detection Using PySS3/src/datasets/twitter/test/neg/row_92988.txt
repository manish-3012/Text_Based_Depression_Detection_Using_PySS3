I just want to end this.As a kid i found my mom dead (brain tumor) been in and out of foster homes since i was 6. 19m now. My dad has been difficult since bouncing between girlfriends almost on a yearly basis and today i was just told that as much as they are concerned im dead to them oh and to top it off i found my little brother literally balls deep in the love of my life. Its almost like life is trying to tell me that i have nothing/nobody that even give the slightest of shits that i kick the bucket tomorrow oh and to make it better because i confronted my brother about it im now homeless with no job and very little to no will to live
