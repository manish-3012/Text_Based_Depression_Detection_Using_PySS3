Does anyone know of an app that would trigger an alert in the event that I'm suicidal?I'm just looking for an app that maybe creates a loud alert or rings really loudly if I hit a button that goes to some people who don't want to see me do it. I would need it to be available on Android and iOS. If any of you know if one that would be greatly appreciated.
