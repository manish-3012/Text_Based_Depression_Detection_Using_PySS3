So fucking tired of thisSame old shit day in and day out, scared to end things but I sometimes wish I just fucking could. But nobody gives a shit. Nobody anywhere gives a shit. None of you care. Part of me wishes someone did but I'm just one in millions and ultimately I don't matter to fucking anyone or anything in any capacity. My existence is fucking infinitesimal. I'm to a point I just don't even care. What's the point of holding out like things are gonna fucking get better, because they haven't, they won't, they never had. Fuck everything
