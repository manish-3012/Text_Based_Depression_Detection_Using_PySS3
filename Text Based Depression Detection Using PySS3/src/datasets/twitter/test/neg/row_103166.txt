Iâ€™ve come to sincerely realize the unimportance of my existencethrowaway


I have come to notice that Iâ€™ve been texting my friends and boyfriend first... like always. At least 90% of the time. The other 10% is just my friends venting about their lives or complaining. Which is fine, I love them, but they never want to have an actual conversation anymore. My own boyfriend never calls or reaches out first. Iâ€™m always the one to do it. Iâ€™m always the one to make plans. Iâ€™m always the one checking up on everyone while no one checks up on me.

When I DO text my boyfriend, Iâ€™m lucky if I get more than 3 words from him. It wasnâ€™t always like this. I donâ€™t know what changed. This happens with all my relationships. They always stop trying while I give most of the effort. More than half. So I tried something. I would stop contacting everyone first. Itâ€™s been 4 days and Iâ€™ve gotten nothing from any of them. My boyfriend doesnâ€™t even tell me he loves me after 7 months.

Iâ€™m forgettable. Unwanted. Replaceable. Unimportant. Iâ€™ve been this way my whole life. I will never have friends who respect me. I will never have a partner who wants to stick around. No one will want me. I canâ€™t do this anymore. Itâ€™s a lonely existence and I donâ€™t want to live that way. Thanks for listening.
