fuck itI've lost everything that mattered to me. I haven't talked to any of my "friends" in weeks other than small talk. Grades are awful, parents are pissed, I'm depressed and my family won't get me help. There's literally no reason for me to live anymore. Well, if you are nothing, you can do no wrong Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ I've been planning to end it for a while, and now might be the right time. But knowing me I probably don't have the balls to follow through.
