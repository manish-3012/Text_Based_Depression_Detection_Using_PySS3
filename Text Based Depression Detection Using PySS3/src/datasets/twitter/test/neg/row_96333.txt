Does life feel like a nightmare to you?OK so.., the other day..., I felt like I was having a nervous break down,.. because I love my family and I'm responsible for taking care of them.., I do have a dad but he's been away since I was 15 I'm 23 right now..., but let me get to point.., I don't know why but I feel dead on the inside and have no motivation at all to do anything I hate it!, it feels like a nightmare to live because..., I got on probation.., because of some Jackass scammed my family out of car,.., and I took them heat.., I was lucky that I didn't go to jail because of their scheme, selling us a stolen car,.. which I took the blame for..., and now am on probation because I couldn't pay the fees..

So now I have to waste my time doing community service for unpaid.. work!, and am only working a few hours at my other job where I get paid and its not enough..,

I have a lot chest pain almost everyday and almost feel like I'm going to a seizure or nervous break down everyday, because I can't fully support my family and take care of them.., I really just want to end my life and say goodbye to life.., but I have hope that things will change.. has anyone been in a situation like this and how did they get out?.
