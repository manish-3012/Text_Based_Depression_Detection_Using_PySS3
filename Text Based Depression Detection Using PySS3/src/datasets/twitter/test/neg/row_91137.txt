I just need someone to tell me that Iâ€™m worthless and Iâ€™m useless and the universe would be better without meIâ€™m tired of liars. I only want the truth. There is only one person who was ever honest with me and I want that person back because they treated me the way I deserved to be treated. Iâ€™m not supposed to be here. Iâ€™m not supposed to be alive. None of this fucking matters. I just need to be told I should be dead because I keep being a coward and Iâ€™ll be nothing but a coward for the rest of my days. My parents want me dead. My family wants me dead. My so called friends want me dead. The people at my work want me dead. I keep hurting all of them by not giving them what they want
