I finally realized I shouldn't be here, I was never meant to be.I finally realized that I'm not meant to be in this world, I don't deserve to be here nor do I want to be here. Everyone who gets close to me gets hurt and I can't watch another person close to me suffer so I can live my miserable existence. For 14 long years I've struggled against the simple fact that I'm bad code, a glitch. It's with a heavy heart that I inform you I've finally found the courage to take myself out of the equation. This courage, like the knowledge that we're all headed for darkness alone, is bittersweet. I was never meant to grow old, nor to be born. To those who will undoubtedly have their world broken and shattered with news of my death and the method of it, you'll make it through to the other side. Don't weep, but instead celebrate. I've crossed over to those pearly gates and I'll be watching over all of you, even those who caused me harm or grief. I've often wondered who I would think of in my final moments. If I'm right, then my thoughts would be of my soulmate, my love lost to the winds of time and change. Honeybee, you've always had my heart, even when you broke it. That day you walked away was the day that I lost my fight. In a world without you by my side, I couldn't survive. This is not your fault, please do not feel guilty. I want you to be happy and feel loved and cared for in ways that I could never give to you. To my family, we were never very close but I would have died for each of you. Mom, if I truly had 1 best friend in this world, you were it. To you I could lay my soul bare and unburdened. My oldest sister, I've never said it but I have always been so proud of you. You were the one I looked up to, my role model. Dad, this isn't your fault. You didn't drive me to this, this is my decision to make and my cross to bear. My 2nd oldest sister, we were never close, but I was proud of you as well, you didn't let anything knock you down. Take care of Bella, my dog and best friend when I'm gone, undoubtedly she'll be depressed. Comfort her and each other and you'll make it through. I must admit I'm afraid of what's on the other side, but not death itself. I haven't chosen my method yet, but I've narrowed it down to a few options. This will be my last message to you, I have to leave now to meet my fate.

Goodbye. As I stare into this abyss, I answer L'appel do vide.

Veni Vidi Vici, Fracti Moriar
