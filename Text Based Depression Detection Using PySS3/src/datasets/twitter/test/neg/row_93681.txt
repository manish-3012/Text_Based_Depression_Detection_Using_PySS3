I don't want to go back to workI loved my job yesterday and thought it gave me purpose. Today my boss was screaming and throwing shit.  I didn't even really do anything wrong.  He blew up several times without allowing me to explain myself and was pretty rude and short all day.  I really don't want to go back if this is what my job will be like and honestly this job is the only thing between me and complete failure.  I'm afraid I'll get fired if I even have the courage to go back.  I feel so shitty and it would be so much easier just to drive into traffic or jump off something.  I know this is kind of a retarded reason to commit suicide but I really don't have much going for me and home life sucks.  I'm trying to move out but I'm a failure at saving money, like in most things.  I think I should just end it and save myself and everyone around me a LOT of suffering.
