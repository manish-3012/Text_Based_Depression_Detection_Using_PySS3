Considering to kill myself, yet, again.Long-story short, life went downhill from July 2017 to now, i'm taking 225mg of anti-depressives everyday with little to no effects,  i'm kinda forced to do a college i'm hating due to lack of options and i have a lot of debts i'm unable to pay because i work on weak part time job. None of this would be an issue if i wasn't actually alone, i have no friends, no one supports me, i live alone on a rented house which the owner doesn't allow me to keep a pet to give me company, with my mother calling me nearly everyday to complain and curse me because of my current situation , i see old "friends" growing up on life ,getting married, having their children, and altough this doesn't get me more depressed, it makes me incredible envy, i have Asperger Syndrome and i have a really hard time having a conversatino with anyone, which furthers empathizes the fact that i'm likely dying alone.

My last suicide attempt was months ago, but since i don't have acess to firearms, it's a 50/50, otherwise i would have killed mysellf from now. All i want is peace and silence, since i believe that asking for material things is selfish of my part. I'm at the point of a mental breakdown and i'm accepting any suggestions from you guys before i try anything.
