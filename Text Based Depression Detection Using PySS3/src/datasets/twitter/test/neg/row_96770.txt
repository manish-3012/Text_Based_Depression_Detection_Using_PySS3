I've tried. I've experienced. I've lost the war. I'm not looking for support, I don't want to waste anyone else's time. I just want to write my words and say goodbye. 

I've been fighting all my life. 

I fought for 17 years. The enemy was severe depression and extreme sleep issues. Introversion and awkwardness supported the opposition. I had a plan to join the military, though, so I won the fight in the end. The casualties were my will to live and my fear of death. I also lost people at this time. Two close friends, and the only person that ever actually raised me. I love you, grandpa. 

I fought for 4 years. The enemies were Taliban insurgents, and radical nationals. In total I spent 18 months overseas, there was no winner. Casualties were countless. To the few that went through it all and are still with us, stay strong where I have fallen. 

I fought for 4 years more when I got out. The enemy is vast, and I'm surrounded. The casualty will finally be me. Though not in war, I will still go out with my boots on. That, I can manage. 

I've got no one to write a letter for, this will serve as that letter. Public servants will be notified of my remains. My funeral will be an unattended government service. 

I will finally lie at rest.

I will finally meet peace.
