Giving up on myselfHi,

I don't even know why I am writing here. I guess I just need someone to read it. 

I'm nearing 26, abandonned a private college computer networking course a month before I was to obtain my diploma because everytime I opened my computer during my internship, I wanted to throw up. My family think I graduated and if they knew the truth, they would probably throw me out of the house so I keep it under wraps and will probably take that secret to my grave. I am now hugely indebted thanks to that gigantic mistake.

Hopefully, that debt is on hold as long as I remain in school. I went back to my original plan to become a teacher and started my bachelor degree 2 years ago. Ever since, I have felt way too stupid to be there, some teachers talking about some concept which I barely grasp as if they were as easy to understand as the rain cycle. I don't find any motivation. My results are fairly low, nearing failure, my attendance is poor and all my projects are done last minute. I have an 8 pages paper dues tomorrow 12pm and barely wrote a few line of it and 2 more paper due monday. I don't even know how I could manage to get it done.

My sleep schedule is erratic, living by night, sleeping by day. I play video games for hours long since it is one of the very few things I am good at. Outside of my cousins, who are like brothers to me, I know almost no one. My social circle is almost barren and my lovelife innexistant. I procrastinate as much as I breathe and I feel my survival is only based on luck.

I thought I was a lot smarter than I feel I am right now. I feel like a shadow of what I once was. I feel utterly irredeemable.
