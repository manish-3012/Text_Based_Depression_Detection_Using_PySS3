Whats happening to me?If you have the time to read thank you. Please don't judge my english its not my first language.




Why sometimes, I'm suicidal and then later on motivated. Im having severe mood swing, i tried to commit suicide 2 times, hanging ang Cutting.

Everytime i feel overwhelmed with emotions of negativity i listen to sad song and become suicidal and another one is i watch some gore video (bestgore.com) to void what I'm feeling.

Ive been watching gore video for a month


And when time past by, im getting angry and frustrated to this world. I want to burst my emotions to the fucked up world. 


Everytime i feel overwhelmed with emotion and negatively, i will do two things. I will become suicidal and listen to sad song, and the other one is watching gore listening to dark rap (Ghostmane, Behemoth)  burst my angry to this world like punching someone else or .


Please dont judge me i cant even understand what's happening to me
