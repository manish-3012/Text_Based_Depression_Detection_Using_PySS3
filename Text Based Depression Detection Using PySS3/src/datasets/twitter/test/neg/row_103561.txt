Im not suicidal cause of my depression, I've never had any other reason of wanting to kill myself until today, and it's not major. I wanna stop it before it gets worse.Please don't read this if you are suicidal, Im not sure but this might make you feel worse so please don't.

Earlier today I found out about rorochan_1999 which I don't know if anyone on here knows about them, but it 2013 they livestreamed their suicide. And since I found out about them I've been trying to find the original video since then, but I've only been able to find a short gif. For some reason a part of me is extremely worried about not finding the video and wants to recreate it so people can see a video of it since I can't find the original.

I know I shouldn't do it and I wanna stop myself from doing it, I doubt I actually will and don't think I could recreate it cause of where I live but I really wanna make sure that I won't.
