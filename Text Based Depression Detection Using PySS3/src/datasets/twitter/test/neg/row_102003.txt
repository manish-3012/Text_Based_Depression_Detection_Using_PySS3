I think itâ€™s timeIâ€™ve been dealing with heavy depression and anxiety for the past 6 years. I always thought to myself is not a matter of if but when Iâ€™ll go through with it. One thing that will just finally make me snap. I think Iâ€™m about to snap. Thereâ€™s so much problems piling on me too much to handle I have completely nothing going for me in life. I said that the thing thatâ€™ll probably push me over the edge is losing one of my dogs. One of my dogs has a spinal cord problem and we simply canâ€™t afford to get him fully tested and treated. I donâ€™t know what to do. This is years and years of issues finally being too much and this just tops it off. I think Iâ€™m finally going to lose. I canâ€™t take this anxiety anymore. Iâ€™m so tired. Things never got better. I tried therapy. I tried to get help. Most people just abandon me.
