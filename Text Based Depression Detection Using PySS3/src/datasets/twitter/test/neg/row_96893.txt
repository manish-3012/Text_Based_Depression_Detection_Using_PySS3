Killing myself is what I'm supposed to doI have nothing to live for. I'm a waste of space and resources. The world would be a better place without me in it. Everyone is better than me, I'm simply subhuman and unworthy of life or love. I only deserve pain and a slow death.

I wish I could kill myself but I'm a massive coward.
