Iâ€™m not conventionally suicidal.Iâ€™m a new poster to this sub and I apologize if this is against the rules and that Iâ€™m wasting peopleâ€™s time. But with Masshealth I canâ€™t find a therapist so I have no where to turn.

I feel worthless all I do is disappoint those around me. I have consigned myself to realizing that I will never feel love or know the feel of a womanâ€™s touch. But I also know that deserve it. I am a worthless human being that deserves death. 

I donâ€™t have the courage to kill myself because that will be a final disappointment to all those around me so I just wait for death to come to me.

I donâ€™t know what to do with myself and I just wanted to vent my frustration that I am and will continue to be a worthless human being that wonâ€™t provide anything to the world. Even as I write this I will know that my mind wonâ€™t let me do anything to fix it. 

I thank you all for the support in advanced even though I think I donâ€™t deserve it.
