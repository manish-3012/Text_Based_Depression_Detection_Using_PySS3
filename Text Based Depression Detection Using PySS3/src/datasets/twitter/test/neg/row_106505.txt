I feel like an ungrateful and useless person.Hello reddit community, I must say that I have not been as involved in reddit as I would have liked to have been. I don't know much about reddit, but I know you guys listen and actually respond, and I need that right now. This is the first time I have ever put my feelings on the line, I'v never attempted suicide before, but I have considered it... a lot. I am currently considering ending my life, I have a gun by my bedside, and I think I might use it. Sobeen diagnosed with depression before but I don't quite think that is it. I just see life as a rat race, I get bored, I'm not sad...just...indifferent.I'm going to tell you my life story now, as this might be my last words to...well...anyone. I am 17 years old, I'm not a notable individual, I've never done anything worth mentioning. I was born to a mother who cares about me immensely, but knows nothing about me, and a father who supposedly molested me when I was 3(I do not remember the incident and cannot attest to the fact) my mother shortly moved out with me in tow, I have not seen him to this day. I have no reason to be depressed, I've never been abused, I've never had a traumatic event happen in my life. When I began school I had no friends and I was nearly mute, I preferred to observe than to speak and was very bright for my age. I never played during recess because of my depth perception problems and instead stayed inside and read. I quickly surpassed my peers in reading. I had no friends until until 1st grade when I was put by an outgoing and intelligent kid(we will call him Jeff), Jeff soon became my only friend and would speak for me, I love him like a brother still to this day. When I entered 3rd grade I was diagnosed with ADD due to my disinterest in class work and I was also given an IQ test to see if I had a learning disability( I reportedly scored a 147) and I was put on Ritalin, my grades improved. By 4th grade I was reading at high school level and had surpassed my teachers in reading speed and refused to partake in outloud reading in class because it was "too slow for me" I now read at 1000+ wpm. I maintained a A average for the rest of Elementary (which isn't that impressive, most kids do). In 6th grade I was recommended to a counselor because I refused to do anything in class and had a disregard for authority and had frequent outbreaks of severe terror during thunderstorms.Â  I told her that I saw no meaning in life, it was pointless and existed only for members of the human race to procreate. I was institutionalized for "suicidal thoughts" a couple days later. When I was in the hospital I saw kids who had anxiety issues, I saw kids who were suicidal and "heard voices and talked to satan". I was in the hospital for 4 weeks and was then released because they saw no reason to keep me any longer. Flash forward to middle school, I was bullied and a social outcast excluding Jeff who was popular and kept me around because he knew another side to me, he thought I was cool. My grades plummeted, I was nearly held back a grade if it weren't for my test scores(which were high). This went on until my junior year when I begged my mom to let me switch schools. Best decision I ever made, I have friends now, I'm semipopular, I'm not seen as weird or lame. For once in my life I'm cool, I even have a girlfriend now...but I still can't shake that darkness that is eating away at my soul. I have a GPA of 2.3 and I'm signed up for Navy Bootcamp as soon as I finish school. My life should be great...right? But I feel unfulfilled...I feel like it means nothing...I feel like suicide is the only rational option. What is wrong with me?
