I feel like Iâ€™ve missed out. Everything in my life is falling apart.Iâ€™ve missed out on a couple great opportunities in my life. I didnâ€™t take action due to fear, overthinking and being a mess. My life is getting progressively worse and more meaningless. Iâ€™m 22, never had a relationship, havenâ€™t had sex. I feel as if Iâ€™m going crazy. Can anyone relate? I feel like such a failure.
