TiredI don't know why I'm even posting on here...I figured no would bother to read, just some kid who thinks he has it rough than the rest, maybe so. I'm 28 years old and I'm just tired of being worthless, forgetful, a bothersome. I can't do anything right. I don't what afterlife or black void there is but I hope every pain in my body is gone. I fail at everything I wanna to accomplish even I hear it over and over to try again but it ends up the same....a pathetic man that still thinking like a teenager and hasn't grown up yet. My whole existence is a joke and I just hope that maybe if I do reincarnate as someone else, that my motives, confidence, just straight up attitude becomes a positive, a better person not some unplanned kid that should have been aborted because right now  I can't.... I'm tired.
