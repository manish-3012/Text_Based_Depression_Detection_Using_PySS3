Constantly thinking of committing suicide (Backstory - I grew up being physically and mentally abused by my mother. During her bad days, she would threaten me with a knife, throw plates and mugs after me for no reason, make fun of my stutter and my appearance by making "boom boom boom" noises when I walked around, and call me a fat useless whore and whatnot. The abuse began when I started living with her as a 5 year old, and it got so bad that I tried to kill myself for the first time, when I was 12, started cutting and harming myself in other ways when I was 11)

I am 20 years old. Recently moved to Brooklyn. Since I was 11-12, I've thought of killing myself and tried (and obviously failed) to commit suicide a few times. But now it has gotten really, really bad. I don't feel worthy of living, and I don't even know how to cope with life itself. It's simply too overwhelming. It's gotten so bad lately, that I'm afraid of going outside my apartment because I can't stop thinking about ways to kill myself, when I'm outside. For example, while I'm waiting for the G train and I see a train quickly approaching/passing through, I have to hold onto something because I fear/hope I will jump out in front of the train. 

I don't want to live, and I don't know what to do about it - besides committing suicide. I just don't feel like there are any other options left. Besides, feeling lonely in a city where you don't really know anyone isn't helping - especially not when the people closest to you are 3000 and 8000 miles away.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to live, but at the same time I'm afraid of dying.
