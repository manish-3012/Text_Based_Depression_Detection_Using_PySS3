I feel like I'm drowning but I can still breatheRecently only about half a year ago I was diagnosed with severe depression and extremely severe anxiety. Since then I've tried suicide twice once by hanging and once by cutting myself so deep that I passed out. I got put on meds about 2 weeks back but they've made me feel worse and as I sit here and type this I can't help but think how ill I try to kill myself next time and hey can't I just succeed at one thing in life. My anxiety has stopped me from doing my school work which resulted in bad grades and this bad grades made me feel even more depressed. But I feel guilty my parents perfect son killed himself cause he just couldn't deal with life's hardships. I feel weak my girlfriend broke up with me and then a week later asked me how she could ask this boy out the first time she talked to me since breaking up with me. She talked all about him how he is depressed but he is trying to deal with it himself. She told me to my face she broke up with me to get with him basically and I feel useless and weak because he can do it alone yet I have to see 3 different doctors a week. Being honest with myself I don't want to be alive in a week. But I don't have the means to kill myself people say this is a temporary problem but I have a fix that'll prevent it from coming back. I'm just getting a higher and higher dosage of meds and I've done my research ill take a whole cartridge of them and then I'll probably die i wish. I guess I am useless and fucked up worthless. Anyway I wanted this out there even tho most people in my life knew this already.
