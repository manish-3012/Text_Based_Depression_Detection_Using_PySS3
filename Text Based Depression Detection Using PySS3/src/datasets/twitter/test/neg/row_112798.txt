Off my meds and sinking into hellI have a criminal record. I have horrible credit. I have major depressive disorder, bipolar, severe anxiety disorder, and other neurological disorders stemming from a brain injury I sustained at birth. I am an alcoholic with only about 45 days sobriety. My wife left with the kids, our anniversary is coming up. She got a restraining order. She's been denying me visitation but there's nothing I can do about it because I'm not supposed to communicate with her - fell into that trap when she started communicating with me (on a side note, I do believe her when she says she loves me, and others have talked to her as well and she says we just need time apart so we can both clean up our acts but she got the restraining order because she knows how obsessive I am and really wants us both to work on ourselves). I get to talk to my kids every night on the phone but all I hear about is how great everyone is doing without me. I have no job - can't even get a job at the stupid convenience store. 

I have no desire to move forward anymore. All of the garbage I've been carrying around for years and years that I tried to kill with alcohol is surfacing now without the sweet comfort of booze. I got myself a sponsor in AA, he started smoking crack. I got another sponsor, he keeps blowing me off too. I got a counselor and he keeps rescheduling appointments so I got a different counselor and she spends most of her time on the phone with her boyfriend/husband/whatever. I went to talk to our priest the other day and he kept falling asleep while I was talking to him. I spent so much time at the beginning of my relationship with my wife devoting myself to being a family man that I lost a lot of friends. The final years I spent drinking with lowlifes that I know I shouldn't hang out with anymore.

I am alone. I live in the country. I can't even afford gas anymore to go into town to look for a job. I can't stand this anymore.

I stopped taking my medication yesterday. Where I *was* feeling hope but sever pain and uncontrollable crying, I am starting to feel myself sinking into the encompassing numbness that I know will eventually give me the courage to kill myself. Fatigue has already started to settle in. I know that in a day or two I'll be strung out on an unexplained rush of energy and then I will crash into a depression so deep and so numbing that I won't be able to focus on anything except death. I won't be able to leave my bed. Then I'll be able to do it. I don't want to feel anything anymore. I have years and years, decades worth of shame, guilt, fear, and hurt built up inside me that I have previously used alcohol to squash. No more booze means that all of this is rising up at an uncontrollable rate - and every time I reach out for help everyone turns their back. My wife will speak to me one night, then tell me she won't talk to me the next - this will last about a week. My counselors are ignoring me, and apparently my problems bore our priest. I've even driven one AA sponsor back to drug use. 

Goodbye, everyone. Tomorrow when I wake up I'll have less coherence (I can already feel the familiar fatigue that signals the onset of an emotional relapse into darkness), so I probably won't be able to reply after tonight. 

I don't know how I'm going to do it. I just know I can't continue. Love and peace to all of you. Stop praying for me, my soul is already dead.
