My mother will lead me to my death.Let me emphasize, I know that my mother has had a tough childhood and even adulthood. Sheâ€™s been through a lot and during our argument Iâ€™ve stated that and said that I completely understand that her life has been â€œtougherâ€ than mine. But because sheâ€™s an immigrant she thinks that my life in a better country is perfect and full of no problems. During my youth sheâ€™s kicked me out of the house for minimal things. The one that we just got into an argument about, just a few minutes ago, was whether the time she kicked me out of the house for not washing everyoneâ€™s dishes the day before my high school graduation. To clarify, I washed my own dishes as per our agreement. I just came home and I instantly did my own dishes. She then assumed that I was mad at her for not washing everyoneâ€™s dishes and just my own. I didnâ€™t talk to her yet but she just assumed that I was mad cause I was doing my part of the agreement. Now she argues, after years after the incident, that washing everyoneâ€™s dishes is the â€œcommon senseâ€ thing to do. Let me just say that this wasnâ€™t the only time Iâ€™ve been kicked out. Iâ€™ve been kicked out for two weeks during Christmas twice because I wouldnâ€™t plug the colour-coordinated plugs in the T.V. when she was standing right in front of it with all of my extended family members. You know the ones that literally has the same colours as the plugs they go into the T.V. None of my family members even helped me. Iâ€™m so done. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Itâ€™s so infuriating to be told that cause â€œmy life has been harder than yours, all the stuff I do to you is nothing or was your faultâ€. 

She acts like sheâ€™s intelligent but all of her knowledge comes from Facebook. Iâ€™m so done. She doesnâ€™t know how to parent. If I do continue to live, I sure do hope that the children I rise will feel appreciated and loved. Not like how I was raised.
