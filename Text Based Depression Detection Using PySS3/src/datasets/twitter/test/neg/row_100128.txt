I've become what destroyed meMy fiance (ex?) has been pulling away for 4 months, this pandemic has made it worse. He stopped talking about the wedding, then stopped touching me, then stopped hanging out with me, and now can barely talk to me. My depression has been severe since I was a child, and he is/was the only person to ever make me feel happiness. He brought me back from the brink. 

My young adulthood consisted of rape, abuse, and being isolated from anyone who cared for me. I almost ended it very often when I was with my ex. It broke me into less than a person. I went into a long dissociative episode and lost the ability to feel anything. My fiance made me human again.

I've been very patient for 3 months and this last month I was quarantined away from him. I was lucky if he would give me 5 minutes of his day. I blew up on a phone call to him after him ignoring me for 2 weeks, I yelled "fuck you" and hung up in a fit of rage/sadness.

Last night he told me that I'm toxic, and worse than the girlfriend who used to hit him constantly. 

I can't be the thing that destroyed me. I can't be an abuser. I've decided that once my mom is better from her surgery I'm going to take some medication I'm very allergic to. If I can find the other kind I'm allergic to I'll take them both at once, just to be sure. I stole some of the lesser kind and hid it. I would feel bad but it's not used to save lives or keep anyone sane. 

I'm not going to become what destroyed me. I'll destroy myself first.
