Before I go, a word of advice about hanging yourselfThis isn't a post informing you how to hang yourself but how it feels and what the pain is like but if this gets removed, it won't matter. I'll probably be dead already. This is, I guess for educational purposes, for anyone considering hanging themselves.

It's not pleasant but you've guessed that already. You're probably prepared for the pain but I can tell you that the pain is much different then you imagine. It's the weight of your whole body on the upper part of your neck.

Breathing isn't hard at first but you will gasp for air anyway, making the pain on your jaw and upper neck worse. The pain is horrid. You will start to struggle, even if you don't want to. You will try and get loose. It hurts and you're still conscious, you just want to be over but you're still very conscious.

People say you think about loved ones when you are dying but when you're hanging you just want to breathe. That's all that's on your mind. Just taking a breath and stopping the pain. You feel something break before you'll hear it, a small pop or even a crack.

That's when I got myself down, permanent damage to my throat and bruising all over my neck. Hanging is fucking painful.
