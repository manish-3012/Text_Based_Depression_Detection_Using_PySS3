Help..Iâ€™m 22. Iâ€™ve been struggling with and trying to treat bipolar since I was 12. Iâ€™ve dealt with a lot of rape, abuse, and adversity in my life. Itâ€™s been a very tough battle. I have so much self hate. I canâ€™t see past it. It feels like I canâ€™t breathe. I canâ€™t remember the last day I havenâ€™t cried. I cried for 7 hours yesterday. I canâ€™t go in a grocery store, a drive thru, barely the gas station Bc Iâ€™m afraid. If the love I had for everyone else could suffice for the lack of my own love, wouldnâ€™t the world be so different. I am in blinding pain and Iâ€™m scared to hurt the people I love.
