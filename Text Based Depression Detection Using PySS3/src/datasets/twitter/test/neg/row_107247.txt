I'm a burden to everyoneI have been sleepless for almost 3 days now, so forgive me if what I write here makes no sense. 

Since I was a kid, I just felt I didn't belong anywhere. I never had real friends, never enjoyed relationships or sex. 

My parents could see there was something wrong and thought I would eventually grow out of it. I didn't. I'm 21 now and I still can't find a point in life. 

I tried therapy and I took anti-psychotics for months. It didn't work in the long term, I'm still in the same position. 

I don't want to start taking pills again, they made me sick, that's why I pretend to be okay so that my family won't pressure me to go to a psychiatrist again. 

I feel like I'm a burden to everyone. My parents don't like having someone like me as a kid, I can tell. I think if I killed myself, they would feel sad but in the long term everyone would be better without me. I'm also a bad influence to my little brother. He used to be social, but after a couple of disappointments with his friends, he seems to become more and more asocial, like me and he sometimes copies the things I do like I'm some sort of role model (I'm not). If I died, maybe he would live his own life again. 

I'm writing here to get it off my chest because I have nobody to talk to. I don't plan to kill myself right now (even though I should) but I will definitely do it in the long term.
