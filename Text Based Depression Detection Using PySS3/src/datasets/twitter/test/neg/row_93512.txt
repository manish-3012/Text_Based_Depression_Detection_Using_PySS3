I Always Have This Feeling ?hey guys , I mean Iâ€™m not sure if it would be even worth it to post it on here but I always have this nagging feeling for not belonging or I wasnâ€™t suppose to be born and it tears me up a lot and I also have this feeling for slitting my wrist and it feels long over due but idk why my family although not accepting of my mental illness or any part of me that I could possibly express and my friends are tired of me and my suicidal behavior ,the cutting and everything , idk short post , hard to concentrate over the thoughts
