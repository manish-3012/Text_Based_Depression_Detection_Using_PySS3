Iâ€™m going to kill myself in about 4-7 yearsThatâ€™s all. Right now Iâ€™m kinda uninterested with putting up with life because it seems a lot easier to just become nonexistent but I have a few people that I really want to soak up whatever time I have left with them. In three years weâ€™re probably gonna split a bit but itâ€™s possible weâ€™ll be together for a fourth year and/or keep in touch virtually with some get togetherness after that. Once thatâ€™s over and theyâ€™re done with me I think Iâ€™ll be ready to be done with life with nothing else too pressing that Iâ€™ll want to continue on with. Itâ€™s not so sad to me although I wish we had more time together and life was easier overall, but the idea of being done within seven years isnâ€™t too tragic to me. To be honest Iâ€™m not sure if anything will exist after Iâ€™m dead because I sure wonâ€™t, and the only thing I can prove real is myself. It makes me have fewer qualms about leaving family behind. Itâ€™s also not so much that I actively want to die as it is that it doesnâ€™t matter to me and it seems easier than struggling for no reason. Thanks for reading I just felt like I had to get it out.
