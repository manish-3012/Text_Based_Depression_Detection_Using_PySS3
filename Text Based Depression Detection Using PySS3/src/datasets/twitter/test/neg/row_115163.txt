I'm pathetic, don't waste your time reading this.Every day I only have two options. Either go into work and pretend to give a shit about a job I hate and the people I work with. Or on a day off, stay in bed as long as I can, and then just watch the clock until I can go back to bed again. I used to have lots of hobbies to occupy my time, but I've lost enjoyment in everything now. I haven't got any friends anymore, and my family try to say as little as possible to me so I spend my 'free' days by locking myself in my bedroom smoking pot and getting drunk. I've reached a point where I can see that this routine isn't healthy and needs to change, but I don't see any way to, so ending it all seems like the only option right now.
