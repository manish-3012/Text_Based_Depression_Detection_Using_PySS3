my expiration date is next weekLast week I decided that 08/18/2020 will be the day I end my life. Before I continue, I just want to say that I have made up my mind, gone through all the pros/cons/who this will affect etc. And for context, I am 19F and have been dealing with depression since I was 12 years old. This past year has been absolute hell for me, and as selfish as some may say it is, I would be most at peace if I cease to exist. I have 5 days left on this earth, and have been struggling to figure out how to say goodbye to my loved ones without them realizing that Iâ€™m saying goodbye. I have been making â€œfriendship braceletsâ€ for my friends and family as a parting gift, but thereâ€™s so much left unsaid that needs to be, so I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to properly say goodbye. I was thinking of writing letters to be found after Iâ€™m gone but I am welcome to any and all suggestions. Thanks
