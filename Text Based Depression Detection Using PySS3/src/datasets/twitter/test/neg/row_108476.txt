My sister tried to commit suicide last night and confessed she was raped.She tried to commit suicide last night by taking a bunch of pills that really slowed her heart rate down. The doctors said if she wasn't sick a while after she took them she probably would have been dead, she still had to be resuscitated though and had her stomach pumped. She is still currently in hospital.

Shes obviously very depressed and says "I doesn't want to be here anymore" which is worrying.

She's just confessed to me that's she was raped 2 years ago by someone she knew. This was the beginning of downward spiral for her. She found out she is going to have great difficulty conceiving a child if she ever can. Her relationship is in trouble. She's distanced herself from family and doesn't feel like she belongs anymore. She's just locked herself up, and we can't visit her because she stays with her BF who still stays with his grandparents and is controlling and possessive.

My fear is, I may wake up one day and she may not be here anymore. How can I be helpful? What is the best thing to say in these situations when someone is so sensitive, stuck in there ways not really open to a healthy change but also acknowledges they need it?

How to help her frame of mind? She doesn't feel like living anymore. There is only so much people can offer around her what if that isn't good enough?

This all so emotionally tiring and I'm 7 and half months pregnant and I have a four year old. I can't dedicate every waking minute to her but I feel like she's at risk to herself rn. I wish I knew what the right thing to do was.
