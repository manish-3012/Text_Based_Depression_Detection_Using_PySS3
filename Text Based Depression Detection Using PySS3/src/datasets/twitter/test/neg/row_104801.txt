last postCan anyone ever really give a good reason for not ending it all? We can talk about love and family and shit, but honestly we have no *legit* reason. I drive away everyone who's important to me, and now I'm left here with old books and alone. 

Family is all gone. Friends don't care anymore. Partners are all gone. I am a horrible person and deserve this all. Its 6pm and March, which means a long night. I won't survive this one and no one cares anyway.

We are all cells in the shape of people. And I.... I am especially horrible.
