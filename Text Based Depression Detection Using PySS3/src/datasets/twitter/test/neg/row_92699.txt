Did I get raped as a kid but either forgot it or got drugged?I will shorten this story and only tell you the most important things. I am 21 years old and the following happened about 10 years ago.

When I was in 4th or 5th grade I slept over at a friend house couple times. His mother died and his father was arabian and couldnt speak alot german ( I am from Germany). He always cooked us food and was quiet but very nice. We used to play Playstation the whole night and eventually go to bed at 5 or 6. One Night a friend of my friends father also stayed overnight. I only remember that both of them already slept when we went to bed and fell asleep.  My memories from now on are VERY foggy. I only know that I stood in the living room, it was bright outside already, and I was crying. His dad came and tried to comfort me and told me I should go back to my friends room and try to sleep a bit more. Normally I would say i just had a bad dream and was sleep walking ( I sleep walked alot as a kid) but I will explain you why I think I might got raped 10 yrs later.

When i hit puberty I was always VERY scared of my dad touching me or being a pedophile although he never ever did such things and is a great dad. I also used to be a funny clown always making joked and I had ton of friends in middle school. After puberty I was very quiet and shy, still had friends though. Since I was a kid I always get overwhelmed with emotional and sad/depressing thoughts. I still often just sit around and loose all patience for the real world and I am in my head. But overall i am not weird from the outside, never had problems at finding freinds etc. Since one year I suffer from depression and low selfesteem.

I do not remember anything from what happened that night, is it possible that my brain just deleted disturbing memories? Or did they give me pills to forget everything?

I highly doubt that I was raped but maybe my depressions and weird thoughts could be a result of being raped?
