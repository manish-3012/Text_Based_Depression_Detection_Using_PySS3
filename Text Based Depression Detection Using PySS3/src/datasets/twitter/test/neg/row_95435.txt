I want to either run away or die.I barely have any money even though I try so hard to save up, but I have a lot of expenses. I live at home, where i am accused of attitude when I do ANYTHING. I am told I have the attitude of a 2 year old in the body of a 20 year old who's the size of a cow (yes I am fat). Bad enough I hate EVERYTHING about myself, now this... I am a waste of life and oxygen and I don't want to be here
