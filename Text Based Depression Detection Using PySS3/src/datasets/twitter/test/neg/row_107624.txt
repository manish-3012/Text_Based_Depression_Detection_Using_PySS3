HATE LIFEGod I never felt this alone in my life. In all my life I never knew this is how I would be. I remember looking in the mirror seeing this sweet little girl who wasn't afraid of anything. Didn't care what people thought. Always smiling,laughing, being kind. Now I look in the mirror and see scars. I see ugly,stupid,freak,afraid,never loved,never wanted,a mistake,rude. That girl that I use to see is no longer here. She's dead. Long gone. She's never coming back. I wish she would though. She was the strong one of us. I don't even know what it will be like to live life. Everyone around me always tells me I'm a failure. I won't go anywhere in life. I'm worthless and nothing. I shouldn't have been born. I cause people pain and fights. That's why my parents are divorced.
