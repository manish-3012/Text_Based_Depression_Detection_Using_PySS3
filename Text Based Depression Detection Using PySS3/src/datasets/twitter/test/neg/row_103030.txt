Thank you Keagan.(I could change his name but in a world of 7.7billion people, noone would know who I'm talking about.) I don't know, why I'm writing this, I'm feeling happy right now, something i haven't felt in awhile.

I have a friend named keagan, he's honeslty the best to have around. Idk what to say but i wanna say something.
He's been there for me for more than a year now, i was a social outcast and he befriended me. He was there for me to talk to when i had a problem and same with him to me. 
7 otta 9 attempts to kill myself, I'd take my phone and text me and that always cheered me up and made me forget I'm a failure even when it comes to killing myself. I almost ran away from home and he told me i could live with him, i ultimately pussed out because i knew eventually I'd go home and my mother would give me shit. Lol i also gave him "dad" as a nickname and he calls me "son" and that also makes me happy.

There's so much more he does for me. And he gives me a will to live, I'm going to stay strong, I'm going to stay and I'm going to see him everyday. That's my goal. 
No homo, if you're reading this buddy(doubt you are):3
