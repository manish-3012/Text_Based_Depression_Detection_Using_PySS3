I pretty much got fired todayWell the title says it. I was training to be a server today and since I can't carry trays well I fell down in front of the entire restaurant. Yet another thing I can't do. 

I really don't know what I'm doing here. I have wanted to die for awhile now but I just can't find the balls to actually do it. I gave myself yet another chance, but I ended up failing and embarrassing myself as always. I really don't know how I can get past this yet another failure.

I have done nothing but let everyone down. I'm a burden to my husband who has to pay for my constant therapy appointments and medication. We have no money and are living off credit cards. I can't even fend for myself.

I have to go back to school next month and have no idea how I'm going to get through it. I can't even wait fucking tables to pay rent. I am just so done with myself. I just keep wondering when I will have the guts to just fucking end it already.

My coping mechanism is sleep so I will be taking my sleeping pills so I can sleep for the next few full days. I tried taking a knife to my wrist but I just can't cut deep enough. Plus, that method usually doesn't work. I wish I was at my parents house right now with my father's shotgun. 

Again I don't know what I'm doing here. Maybe I just want to exclaim to everyone that I'm done. I don't know what else to do.
