i wanna kill myselfthereâ€™s nothing stopping me. iâ€™m not sad. iâ€™m happy. but i just donâ€™t wanna be alive. i dream of slitting my throat. i feel like itâ€™d be so peaceful. all the blooding just pouring out as i lay unconscious. i think itâ€™d be beautiful. but iâ€™m too scared to be dead. i want my body to die. i want to be a ghost. die and watch over my family and friends. i want to be able to walk around and look down at my dead body.
