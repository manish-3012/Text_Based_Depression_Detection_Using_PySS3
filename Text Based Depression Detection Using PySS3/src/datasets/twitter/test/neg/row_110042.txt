Post natal psychosisI have been diagnosed with post natal psychosis for the second time. When Iâ€™m lucid I feel miserable, when Iâ€™m not, I am a danger to my family, myself, and I am vile to my husband.

I canâ€™t control it and I am bringing everyone around me down. I think the world would be better without me, but because I tried to kill myself last time I was diagnosed, everybody is removing the risks.

I feel like nobody hears me anymore, they just see me as a problem to be fixed or boxed away.
