My brother is dead and I feel so aloneMy brother died back in 2018 from an overdose, and I've never felt truly happy since. He was in rehab and promised to get better, but still ended up losing the battle. He and I used to text each other and have conversations and it would not make me feel stressed out about school and other things.

Now that he has passed, I never found out how to cope without him. I've been really sad, but managed to survive without him, but this year has been so awful and stesses me out, and no one else in my family will listen to me. And I feel like I'm going to lose the battle with depression.
