ContemplationI have everything I need to do Its jut at that point Of going through with it im kind of scared to do I keep thinking about everyone in my life how they will feel and react and what might happen after I die just feeling like a fucking failure like ill die a nobody and everyone will forget me it makes me sad but makes me want to kill myself even more i feel all my friendships have faded out and I lost myself completely to schizophrenia I cant connect with people anymore and not even in reality Im not me anymore my soul is gone I just need to go through with it
