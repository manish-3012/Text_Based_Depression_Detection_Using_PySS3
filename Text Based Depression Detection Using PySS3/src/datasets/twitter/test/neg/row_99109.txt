Still alive3 weeks ago I tried to kill myself but haven't been successful with it. I tried to overdose with sleeping aids, I thought I I'd fall asleep and never wake up but no I did wake up, apparently I didn't take enough. Damn killing myself is really not easy. I must have been really "lucky". 

So that was pretty stupid, they put me in a mental hospital for a week or so and 2 days ago I was released.

Thinking about it its probably good that I'm still alive.
