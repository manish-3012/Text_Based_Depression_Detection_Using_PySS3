I've deteriorated into thisSorry for the wall of text. I'm drunk, I'm desperate, I need help. At the tender age of 20 I've realized life is not all what it is portrayed to be. I have trouble in social contexts, literally misinterpreting social cues, and leaving others dazed by my often bizarre actions. I'm sure if I had money and went to a psychiatrist I'd be diagnosed as Asperger's, but even if I had money I hate the idea of labeling people, so fuck that. I've never had any true friends in life, no one to call when I've needed it the most. What I do have thankfully is a loving family who does care about me. Over the past year I've declined mentally, abusing weed and alcohol to dumb the very pain that eats me up physically and mentally. I've stopped smoking but continue to drink from time to time. I've dropped out of university and entering into a practical nursing program. I honesty am not enjoying it that much but it's only semester one so things may change for the better... I was practically forced by my parents, even though I suggested to them that I wanted to learn a trade, or work up in Northern Canada (mining, drilling.. they have a certificate program that I've been interested since I've left high school, but they feel the work is beneath me and are strongly opposed. I really feel the need to leave my city (population of 500000 and live the rest of my life in the country as city life stresses me out beyond belief.) I have nothing to lose so why not? I also feel I'm mentally ill. I'm severely depressed. More frighteningly I think I might have earlier onset schizophrenia. Every so often (not all the time) I'm starting to see things out the corner of me eye, occasionally hear my name being called by people, and am intensely paranoid that people are all secretly out to get me. Nothing seems real either, almost like a derealization or something. I really want to someone I settle down with (girl) in the future but that seems unlikely as all the quality girls seem to be taken. (cliche I know but pretty accurate). What the hell am I supposed to do?!
