If I fail any classes this trimester I'm gonna fucking do itI can't work at home and I've never been able to work at home 

School was hard enough already but now I can't think properly 

I have an F in all my classes 

I tried to write down all my missing assignments in my sketchbook but despite writing small I couldn't fit my last class onto the list 

I've emailed my teachers trying to apologize for all the late work but they don't seem to understand how deep of a pit I'm in.   They all just say "get it done!" 

I can't do this anymore I just want to go back to school and do things normally
