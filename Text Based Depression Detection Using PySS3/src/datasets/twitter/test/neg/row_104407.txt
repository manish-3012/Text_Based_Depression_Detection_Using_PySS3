SUICIDE NOTE  

I have been pondering over this question again and again why do we live. We live to make a difference, to make our lives better and to prosper. I have been thinking what I have achieved so far. I have achieved regrets, worthlessness, self-pity and remorse. I had not done a single right thing in my life but I am changing that right now. By ending my life, I am rectifying my 24 years of mistake. I am very happy to do this. This is the best decision ever I could take in my entire life (well, my life was very short!). Ending my life gives me the greatest pleasure ever. Reliving the pain daily hurt so much.

I had many ambitions, too many desires and many more hope. I desired to reach the stars. But I have hit rock bottom in my life. I am just a wasted opportunity. I am deep in debt, got my injury in back and has a job I am afraid of the most. I do not want to live just want to end it all. I have been fighting severe depression for the past 1 year. No one really understood my changed behaviour (well, I cannot blame anyone as everyone has their own life to take care of) but I expected someone to help me. The end is near and I am at a loss of words to express myself. All my life I strived to be a better version of myself and I could not think I would die of hypoxia!  Let us discuss the reasons why I took such a severe step as a suicide note is supposed to do: (this is a general rant of things happening in my life, you could skip if you want)

1. **Back Pain:**

My first suicide attempt was when I got my back injury. I just wanted to end the physical pain then but was not well researched(silly me!). I thought of jumping in the open sea and thanks to God, I did not do it. It would have been an agonising pain of 20 minutes.

Well, the most important cause of my suicide is my back pain**.** Had it not been there, I had not lost hope and would have worked something like I always do. I tried treating it at various facilities but with 0 success so far. I do not remember a single day I was not troubled by this pain for the past 2 years. The driving factor and the motivation for my suicide is my back pain.

2. **Financial Condition:**

I belong to a family where you can only afford one chance to succeed. There is no retake, no revised script and no new cast! I am dirt poor, had been since my dad retired. He has been dead for a year now and I have been struggling to make ends meet. From my college days, I became independent financially due to the undeserved scholarships I got. But I miss my father. Maybe after I got injured, if my family had some money, I would have been treated better, maybe I would have an alternate career trajectory. Maybe I would have committed suicide in that scenario also but definitely not now. So money became the immediate reason of my suicide. I am bankrupt and I know my family cannot even afford my last rites.

3. **Education Loan:**

Had I not been in such debts, I would not have blinked an eye and would have thought of something. The education loan is the ticking time bomb in my situation. It actually gave a time frame that I have to die before this time to never face the huge debts.

4. **My relationships :**

I never had a successful relationships. I tried so hard but maybe I am not the type. I have some major personality flaws and I always accepted that but the other party never really understood that. I do not blame anyone for my suicide but this is the part where they could have saved me. Nobody really tried, telling a depressed man everything is going to be all right is never going to cut it. He has already lost hope and there is no chance he will listen to your blabber. There is no man up and face the situation, he had already accepted he lost the battle. The only way to revive him is get him to an infirmary and treat him like a patient. At least give him some love. I never got any love from my loved ones when I told them I am struggling in my life. They all told me I have to face this alone but I cannot do it alone. It is impossible for me to face the difficulties if I could not face myself. The list includes all my family members , friends and my loved ones who could have saved me if they would just listen and not give any advice. I never needed any. But I do not blame them. I know everyone is struggling in these troubled times and this decision is mine only. I have not taken it under any duress. It is just a planned attempt. I tried telling everything to various person but they never listened. I thank one person who was always there for me thick and thin. He or She(I have left it to your wild imagination) always stood by my side and was always there. Thank you my friend, I will always be indebted to you.

.**TL,DR**  I got a physical injury which I never recovered, am in a very bad financial situation, too much debts and failed relationships. This is the short version why I am committing suicide.
