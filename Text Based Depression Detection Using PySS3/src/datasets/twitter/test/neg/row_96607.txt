Always the bad one - I feel like I don't deserve to be alive nor do I even want toThere was some work drama on Thursday and on Friday I stayed away from everyone.  Today I went to a co-worker to *apologize,* and I stupidly thought she would forgive me, but instead she laid into me for 15 minutes about how "off putting" I am, and I seriously had NO IDEA.  I thought people liked me.  Now I feel like a horrible bitch for apparently putting people off and not knowing it, like I have that huge of an ego.  This sort of thing has come up at previous jobs, at school, and with my family.  When there's a group of people, I always end up feeling like "the bad one."  I talked to my boss about how I felt like people hated me and he promised no one hates me but how does he know that?  My husband keeps telling me to find another job, but it's like this *everywhere* so it must be me.  Plus I have a seizure disorder and my benefits are really good at this job but my husband's aren't.  In addition to the seizures, I have crippling migraines on an almost daily basis, and when they're bad enough I feel like I'd rather be dead.  Every breath I take I feel is a waste of oxygen.  I have several handfuls of Xanax, Tramadol, and Topamax at my disposal.  I went home early from work because I was getting a migraine and I just couldn't handle it.  Now I'm alone in the house and afraid of what I might do.  Of course my natural instincts say I don't want to die, but I feel like the world would be better off and I wouldn't be in pain anymore.  Somebody help?

EDIT: I looked up "how much Xanax does it take to kill you" and I don't have near enough.  I still have plenty of other methods though.

EDIT EDIT: I talked to my therapist and I'm feeling a lot better now, but I just have to ask, why would you downvote ANY post in /r/SuicideWatch?  These people are coming here for help.  I understand the need to have downvotes allowed because of trolls and such, but seriously, who downvotes a cry for help?
