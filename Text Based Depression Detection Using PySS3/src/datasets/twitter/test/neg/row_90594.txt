Starting to think my death would help people understand I'm actually really strugglingIt's embarrassing to even say it, but yeah. I've been thinking about it more lately. Like maybe then people would be like "oh I guess she really was struggling." I try my best to appear okay, mainly so I do well at work and be functional. The problem is they have no idea how much I suffer before and after work/socializing. I try to talk about it here and there with people, but they don't need to hear that all the time. What would they even do? I don't like conversations with friends like that. My therapist helps, I made an appointment to get meds, but in the meantime I'm just hurting and feeling like I'm alone
