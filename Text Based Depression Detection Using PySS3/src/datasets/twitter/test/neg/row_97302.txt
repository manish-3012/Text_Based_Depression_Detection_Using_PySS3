im fucking losing it lolive been spiralling more than ever and i cant talk about it without being seen as a freak or a fucking lunatic and i guess its true? i got into a fight with my childhood rapist (father) because he found out i was suicidal. and he pinned me to my bed and started punching me and pulling my pants down. it was such a fucking thrill. it felt so fucking satisfying. my face is still really tender and my arms burn from pushing him off. he said he wanted to split my skull open and ruin me. i resisted and i dont know why. i think i pulled a muscle or something while failing around. im so mad i fucking resisted im so fucking mad... ive been really craving being harmed and the second i got it... i blew it. im so angry at myself
on top of that ive been in a catatonic state for fucking days. im tired. and i keep ticcing. and im always watching my actions through a screen and im never really there. ive been having intrusive thoughts. i keep seeing scary things. i jacked off to the thought of someone plunging a knife into my stomach. i fucking came to the thought of being fucking murdered.  im at my breaking point and i want a rest i want a rest so fucking badly i just wanna off myself
