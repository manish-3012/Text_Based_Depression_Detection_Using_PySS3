What is the point of living?I don't know, I just don't think there is any point in me continuing to live.

My friends I realise aren't really friends, I don't think they really give a shit about me anyway, I don't think if I wasn't there it would be any different to them.

My family, I love a lot, but I am just a burden to them. My mother supports me at university while I'm trying to study (let me get to this point) and she can hardly afford to live her own life, which kills me because she deserves to. My sister worries just about us too much, and it drives her mental, literally she has mental disorders from it. I can't bear to hurt them anymore for my uselessness. Not to speak of my father, who the piece of shit was a cunt at every stage, I don't even talk to him, it's been 2 years.

I try and try to get jobs but I can't, resume in person, online don't work for me, and this is the reason my mother supports me. I can't continue without getting one, and I fear even with the qualifications I have I can't.

University is a I don't even know. I got into architecture last year, and wanted to do that with my life, but I hated it. Decide to go after military, but was told because I quit uni I couldn't get in, and if it had of been before then I would have. Now started game design, but I lack any drive to do it, I am just lazy.

Physically I am fat and ugly, I try to make efforts to get fit and exercise and eat well but I can't lose weight and I just get sick of trying. I never excelled at sports and was only average at what I put my hand to. The only sport I ever really loved with a fiery passion was karate and it was taken away from me by a person who didn't like me and got me kicked out of the club. ruining what now seems in reflection my one chance I had to redeem my body and soul but I couldn't.

Relationships are fruitless because of the said physicality and even then I can't talk to girls irl, maybe a bit online but not properly.

Which leads me to my personality, I think I am a arsehole. I try to be nice, but no one appreciates my conversation, my debate or my jokes, I think maybe I am just a bad person.

Which leads me to the conclusion, why continue living, at least with my death i unburden my family, I allow my friends to be rid of trying to fake like me, and I don't have to keep making attempts at living life that I can't follow through on.

I don't know whether this is the place to discuss, but I don't even know, I'm afraid of death, and I don't even have the small good in me to end myself so others can be free of shit I put them through.
