Random bursts of being suicidalIn general, Iâ€™ve wanted to die for a long time. Being suicidal is nothing new for me but I get these random bursts of suicidal thoughts sometimes. I could be happy or okay but then itâ€™s just like, â€œwow wish i was deadâ€ and I just fall into a bad mood. Thereâ€™s no trigger to it, it just randomly happens and I was wondering if anyone else experiences this?
