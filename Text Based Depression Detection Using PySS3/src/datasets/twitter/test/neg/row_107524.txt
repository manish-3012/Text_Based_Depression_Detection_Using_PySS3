I want to kill myself. And i know for the sake of my family, i can't. And that makes it worse.Death is no stranger to me. I have seen my sister literally lose a year of her life in pain and agony after her BF passed away from cancer. I have seen it all around me.

Anyway, now 18 years old, i've been depressed for around 4 years. I can't take it anymore. I really cannot. Even 2 years ago, when i was feeling shitty everyday, i was still at top of academics. Now i can barely reach 75% when i used to soar above 95%. I gave one of the most important physics exam for my LIFE yesterday, and....ugh.

I wont get a college. A good one. I'll be stuck in this city. I know it. So do others. I want to end it HERE. Now. But i can't, for this will WRECK my family more than it already is (it is really a lot).

I wake up every day praying i get hit by a car. At least that'll take away the aspect of choice.
