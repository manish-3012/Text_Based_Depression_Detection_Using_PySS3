8 days to go until I get some peace.Yeah 8 short days. I'm looking forward to it. I've planned who gets what, like things I won't be needing anymore. Such as money, games, other stuffs like laptops, pc, clothes and shit. 8 days until freedom. I'm happy and at peace with myself and no-one will be able to change my mind.
