My biggest fear is that people I love will come to see me the way I see myselfI've told people that.  And once in a while someone promises it will be okay, promises they understand, promises I won't lose them over it.  Then I inevitably do anyway.

I used to believe I have value beyond what an emotional wreck I tend to be.  Not so sure anymore.  I'm tired of having to sequester off such large parts of who I am all the time because the real me is always "too much" for people.  I know I'm a lot.  I know I'm a complicated person who takes a lot of patience and understanding.  I hate it and just wish more people would like me for me, or actually meant it when they said they were willing to take that on, all of me, 100% of me and all the real emotions and passions and feelings I feel.  Without giving up.

I want to be better and get better so I'm not so overly pathetic and sensitive but it's just so hard to do it alone.  Without friends to guide you through it and hold your hand be there for you, rooting for you.  And I can't do it without support.  Some people can, some people are great at being self-sufficient loners without friends or a support system.  I'm not.

I'm not upset out of self-pity, blah blah woe is me I'm such a mess I hate myself and I hate being alone, blah blah.  I mean, that's true, but that's not the point.  I'm just tired of hurting people, and I'm tired of having to be alone so much as a result.  I never mean to.  I never ever ever mean to hurt anyone.  It's just so few people have the patience to work through the layers and get to the point where they realize that.  I'm not a mean, spiteful, manipulative, hurtful person and I never ever have been.  I don't ever mean to hurt anyone and would never ever do it intentionally.  The only person I'm ever really mad at is *myself.*

So the fear comes true again and again.  People come to see me the way I see myself.  A broken disaster they don't want to deal with or be around.  And I can't handle it anymore.
