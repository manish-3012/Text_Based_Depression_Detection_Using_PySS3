I cannot seem to raid my spirits.
I can't get myself out of the rut I am in. 
My life just seems to be one failure after another. My family is breaking up, my mother and father are getting a divorce and causing everything to become very confusing. The best relationship of my life has just ended, this was the relationship that felt right, I screwed up before but I lied to fix it. I have lied and lied but now my house of cards has fallen down and I am left with utter emptiness. My school work is falling into a bad state, my marks have fallen to a level that is well below what I can achieve. 
I feel that ending it would just be the best option at this point. Just end a life of suffering that I know I am headed for. I could just use some help...
