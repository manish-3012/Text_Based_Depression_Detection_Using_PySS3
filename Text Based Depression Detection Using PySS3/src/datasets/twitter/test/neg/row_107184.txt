I don't know what I'll do this weekend.I have no greater joy than being with friends. However, after I see them I get this intense depressed feeling, because I fall back into shutting myself inside. One thing that helped to override that feeling was knowing I had a friend who lives only 5 minutes away by foot. 

But he's just started university and now lives an hour and 40 minutes away with another friend who moved about a year ago. So now I'm stuck here in a small town with no friends. 

My social anxiety is so intense I'm too scared to try anything. Even if I do try something, I fail. People tend to not like me, the only friends I've made was because I was forced to be with and interact with them. 

I just told my friend who moved a year ago that I'm now officially alone. He said they might be coming over tomorrow. 

I don't know what I'm going to do if they come over. I'll have nobody to fall back on. I know I can't move on because I've tried. I'm too weak and scared. I can't stay motivated for more than an hour, a sense of incoming failure forces me to quit.
