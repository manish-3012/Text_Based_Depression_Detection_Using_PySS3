Don't want to die but feel like death is the only optionI have a lot of things going on. I'm in a really tough graduate program. Other people seem to be doing fine but I hate it. I'm not good at it. I feel like I don't have any friends who love me. My dad died 6 months ago. I have to be the strong one for my mom and I cant. She deserves better than that. I'm being sued for a car accident I was in last year. The people are claiming they are seriously injured from it.  If they are I can't live with myself knowing I hurt them. Everything seems to be falling a part. I've deal with suicidal ideation since I was 16. I just feel like I can't keep fighting anymore. I feel like the best thing for me to do for everyone is to just end it.  Talked to suicide prevention 3 times. Don't know what else to do.
