i need helpim honestly quite new to being depressed. ive been depressed since february. but it came in a really bad wave. im not sure why i became depressed, but i did. in late february, i made my first attempt bu drowning. i told my newly made best friend about it an hour later. she said she would always be there to support me. and she was. at one point, about july, i had become too much for her though. she said she couldnt deal with it anymore and i was causing too much stress in her life. i respected that and stopped relying on her. then in mid august, i made my next attempt by od. went to bed, woke up sick. i didnt tell her about that one for a while, but i finally did mid september. she said she wished i told her sooner so that she couldve prevented it. from then on, i began to get better. ive been doing really well up until today. so ive been known for not having the â€œtrendyâ€ political views. im total conservative in california. last saturday, i fucked up and made a post thats downright horrible. and today, i got a call from my hsâ€™s vice principal. somebody apparently reported me. she said that if i go on with saying things like i did, ill be expelled. and now i have really bad anxiety that ill be expelled. which is really bad. i have a 4.6 gpa. i cant lose that. ive put my life into school. i cant be expelled. i just cant. and ive been talking to my bestie about it and she says im at fault. she wont even acknowledge my anxiety and says its all my fault. and shes the only person i can talk to my problems about, and she doesnt even care. she said that i am really offensive in general and that ive always been which i never knew. and now i think im a terrible asshole. and i feel so alone now because i have nobody to support me and im so lost. in 2 hours, i plan to take a knife to my arteries. i want to send my bestie a text saying how much ill miss her, but i fear sheâ€™ll call for help before im gone
