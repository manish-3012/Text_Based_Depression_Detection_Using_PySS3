I've tried meds and therapy and I still feel terribleEvery time someone posts here it seems the suggestions are meds, therapy, reaching out, starting a family, etc. I've done all these things and yet I still want to die. I've been in the mental health care system for more than eleven years. I've been in therapy for the past 18 months. This therapy is purportedly the best for my diagnosis, yet I still feel terrible. Since I've been in this therapy I've actually become worse. I've decided on a plan (gunshot to chest) and I've become preoccupied with drinking, though I only do so twice a week. Meds are out because the side effects are even worse than the original problem or they don't work at all. Everything seems hopeless since the things that help other have not worked for me. I don't really want to die but I know my life will continue to be fucked up and I will never get what I really want.
