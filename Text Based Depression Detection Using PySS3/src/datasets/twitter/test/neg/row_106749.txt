I keep finding myself trying to "get things in order"Planning to give away my favorite clothes, throwing away artwork I've done, separating myself from the things I own.  

I don't feel suicidal *right now*, but the last time I started sorting my things out like this, I was.  It's just weird.  I don't know why I keep wanting to do this.
