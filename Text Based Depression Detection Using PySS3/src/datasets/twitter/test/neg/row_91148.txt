Sitting in a waiting room for a mental health unit, not really sure why I haven't left.I tried, I really did try to be better. I tried to make friends, have hobbies, lose weight, succeed at my degree. I fought and fought for 14 years with my own head. But its been made clear to me that people don't want me around. They don't hate me, but they wouldn't miss me. I'm just not enough for anyone. I try to reach out and connect but no one seemed to care. When I talk in a group I get ignored mid-sentence or just looked at. When I try to deepen friendships I get brushed off unless its for exam prep. I must be doing something wrong but I don't know what. I'm angry, that I'm apparently not enough, no matter how well I seem to get. And I don't even know who I'm angry at.

I'm sitting here waiting to talk to a psych registrar which will take a long time. But what can they do? What can I do? I can take a hint that the world is not interested in having me in it. I've stayed alive for so long, convinced I wouldn't feel this bad again after the last time. But here I am, feeling miserable just being me. It feels like it will never get better, it hasn't so far. That I always start at the first step, and I'm so tired of climbing. I don't know anymore.
