Please, I need advice and I'm not sure what to do.So this morning I was determined (GMT) and I went out and bought 5 boxes of ibroprufen (200mg 16 pieces a box) from three different retailers. I took them all, 80 tablets in total, 16g. I then took 5 7.5mg pills of meloxicam and 5x 500mg of naproxen. Im feeling under the weather, cold, having toilet troubles and nausea. Is it worth going to the hospital or to see this through. I'm split. Because I wanted to do this, but my natural instinct is kicking in and telling me to do something about it. I'm torn and I just need advice.
