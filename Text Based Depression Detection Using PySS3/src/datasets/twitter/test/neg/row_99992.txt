Im sick of being uglyLooks DO matter, even if they didn't to others, the do to me. I'm sick of waking up and seeing my ugly face. I wish i can hide my face. I'll never find someone, no one compliments me or has a crush on me. 

People only tell me I look okay with make-up on, which doesn't make me feel good at all, because that means I'm naturally ugly. 

I fucking hate my face and am sick of seeing myself. I never take photos, I fucking hate seeing myself. 

"Everyone is beautiful", no not everyone. Fuck off. I just want to rope myself and never see myself again.
