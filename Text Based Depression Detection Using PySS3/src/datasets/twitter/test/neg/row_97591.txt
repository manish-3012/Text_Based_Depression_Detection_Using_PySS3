The urge to cease to exist

I am not suicidal. I am far from it. The idea of suicide terrifies me; not only because I can't imagine causing harm to myself, but also because of the pain it would cause my family. Instead I envision myself just disappearing, with no one having any recollection of who I was. I do not like the person that I am. I haven't for almost 2 years. I don't show it or talk to anyone about it, but it is starting to take its toll on me. I have developed anxiety over the past year and I have started experiencing panic attacks on a semi-regular basis. I honestly have no idea what to do. I started writing in a journal to help express my thoughts but I stopped. I don't know why I am posting here. Maybe in the hopes that someone has felt this way before.
