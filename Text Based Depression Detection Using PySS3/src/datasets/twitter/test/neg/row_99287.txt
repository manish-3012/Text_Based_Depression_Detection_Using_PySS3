My last month before I decideSo i have the whole summer holidays before i contemplate whether to kill myself. I really think i should. I'm ugly as fuck(the most ugliest 17 year old guy you could imagine) and cannot instigate a proper conversation for more than 20 seconds. I'm joe average at everything else. I try my hardest in academics but still get mediorce results and having to deal with atrocious aftermath of poor mental health. Why should i bother trying to improve education when the first thing other people see is my shit visuals.( i have a shit ton of moles and big pores).
Life is a pile of horse manure. Everything is only getting worse. Be it, harder education, trash parents who never teach jackshit, and a face aging quicker than the speed of light.

A month later, i will ready up and buy a rope if i need to and decrease the surplus population. Obviously, i'm not good enough for natural selection.
