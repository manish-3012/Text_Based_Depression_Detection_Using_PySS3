I'm screwedI had all the opportunities and support I needed to succeed and I've squandered them, through sheer laziness and addiction to porn, gaming, and pretty much anything on the internet. I'm slowly failing univeristy, my parents love and support me but I clearly don't love them because I'm wasting everything.

I used to be a decent student in school but everything has gone downhill, without the authority of my parents to keep me in check I've slowly turned into a lazy irresponsible imbecile. My grades slip lower after each semester and now I'm finally failing more than half my courses. I felt divided and bad about choosing my original degree and changed to another I thought I would find intresting and commit to fully, but I'm doing even worse now than ever. Despite all the advice I get I keep making the same stupid choices. It's like I'm stuck in an inevitable cycle of thinking I'm making it then failing and getting miserably depressed., and just getting moe and more reckless.

I hate that I need meds to cope and get 'special treatment' and still can't seem to make it here, others seem so much more deserving than me and destined for great things, that they can do everything I do and far better without the kind of support I get and come from their own broken families/poor economic situations. I hate myself; and seeing the success of others just consistently reminds me of how pathetic I am.

My motivation has dried up, I don't really care what happens anymore but I also don't want to suffer in a low pay working class job(as much as I deserve to), even though I don't put in the effort. I had all these great plans for my future but I'm unwilling to put in the required effort, I just fantasize about what could have been.

So I've been planning on killing myself for a while now and researching the various methods. Now I've found a way that seems comfortable and accessible enough for me. I feel bad that I may be missed by a few people, but I feel like nothing really matters anymore. Everything just feels so pointless. Like whether I die of old age or right now, I won't remember anything .

If I'm dead none of this would matter to me anyway.

Sorry if this is all convoluted and stupid, I have an exam tomorrow that I haven't even begun studying for and am procrastinating here by typing all this. Might not even look at this post again. There's a bunch of other stuff I haven't talked about and I have this entire journal of crap that I sort of based this on. Probably not gonna kill myself just yet but I might later in a few days. I don't know.
