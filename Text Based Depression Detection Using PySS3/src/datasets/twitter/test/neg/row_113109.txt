I'm tired and I want it all to endI'm just so tired of it all, encounters with people feel meaningless. I sleep the days away to escape it all. There are so many things that contribute to it, abusive parents, low self esteem, being prone to anxiety and depression to the point where I've been crying every day, wake up anxious and nauseous, wanting to end it all. 

I'm 26, and have never been kissed, or held, have never held hands with a guy. 

One of my issues is that I have excessive facial hair and body hair. Face, boobs, stomach, back, legs, arms, everywhere. I saved up money over some years for laser hair removal for my face and neck, because at least I can hide the rest, but I did 5 sessions and there's still so much hair. I'm hairier than most males I see. I can't even go outside without being worried that people will think I'm a freak. I know I should just get a job and save up money to attempt to laser it all away but I can't even get out of bed most days, and when I can, the last thing I want is to be around people because they might notice. No one will ever love me.

I've completely isolated myself from my friends. I don't leave my room. I'm crying right now. I want to scream, I want to be normal, I want to be dead, I'm so so so tired. I hope I don't wake up in the morning
