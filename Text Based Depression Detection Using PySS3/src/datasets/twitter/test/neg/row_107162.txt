It has been 2 years since the shit happened (15yo Poland)It all started when I realised that girl who i had crush on would never like me. She is  my friend since my early childhood. I didn't wanted to lose her so i never told her about my feelings. I told myself to stop liking her, and it worked. This started the whole shit. I were always the quiet kid in my class. Never really noticed by anyone. I always wanted to do some art stuff but I am dysgraphic. Tried 3d designing but I can't afford any printer. I argue a lot with my parents and autistic older brother). Since I were a young kid I had a shitload of fears. I cut myself since 2017. My parents once found my scars but they thought I wanted to gain their attention. I study in a really good private school, and I am a quite good student but I am really tired with everything. I have never been on any therapy. My mom is a psyhologist but she would never thought that I am suicidal. To be honest the only thing keeping me alive is the thought that i am gonna escape from Poland and find people who like me. Today I told my friends that I struggle with depression for 2 years and they doesn't want to accept it.

I am really sorry for the mistakes
