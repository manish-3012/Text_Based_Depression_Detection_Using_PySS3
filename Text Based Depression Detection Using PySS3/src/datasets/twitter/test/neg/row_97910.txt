I dont deserve anything and i ruin everyone's livesi hate myself so much. i havent self harmed in 32 days and i want to keep that up but fuckk

my mom took my phone away and she says i lie to her but whenever i tell the truth she hates me even more. im scared she knows im a lesbian because she read through my notes. fuck my life. why does a phone have so much power over me? am i really just that fucking weak?

my best friend emailed me on my school email and i was bitchy towards her because my mom will use it as a way to say "look you ARE talking to her behind my back!!"

i hate everything about myself. i want to die. i want to starve to death and my mom to find me and realize how terrible shes treated me.

i hurt everyone around me.

i got sent to a mental hospital in February. everyone in my family is normal so why cant i be like that? why did god choose me to be the broken one? why do i have to be the burden? i want to shoot myself.

why me? why am i the disappointment? why am i garbage?

its never going to get better. my mom will never let me live. she wont approve of who i like, she wont approve of what college i want to go to, she wont like anything i do. its a running joke that my sisters could do the same thing as me and mom would only yell at me, its not a fucking joke. she wants me dead.

i hate my stupid fucking therapist. how did she even become one?? she just says "were here to control thoughts not emotions." fuck you. i cant control either and repeating that over and over wont help. i feel worse whenever i visit her.

 i hate my life so much. but i think everyone thinks im being dramatic because im a stupid moody teenager. i never asked for depression. so why does everyone act like i chose to be so fucking broken? i dont want to do it anymore.

im done with my stupid mom and my dad who essentially fucked off with his foriegn girlfriend and my stupid school and stupid fucking life.
