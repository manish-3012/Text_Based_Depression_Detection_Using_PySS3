I'm a loser, I want to end it allI am honestly feel like I'm a loser both socially and life-style wise. I'm 21 years old, I have a very small circle of friends, some of them don't really talk to me unless I have something to offer. Also, some of my hacking and spamming activites have came back to haunt me and I'm going through some federal felony charges. So I probably never be able to get any job, especially with computers because "i'm a no good fraudster".

I go to therapy and my therapest thinks I have traits of a narcissist, but instead of self-love its self-hate. 

Long story short;
No one will ever like me, no one will ever hire me. Why should I live?
