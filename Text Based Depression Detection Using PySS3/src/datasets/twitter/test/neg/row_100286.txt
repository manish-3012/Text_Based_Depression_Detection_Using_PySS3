I'm alone all the time - even when I don't want to be. I am repulsing people and I can't do any more years of near-complete isolation. I want to die.I am always alone - I have tried and failed to sustain friendships or relationships or anything. I have reached a point where watching couples or families walking down the street is making me miserable. I can't go on trains anymore. I was taking a gradually increasing course of Effexor and seeing a psychiatrist and I am finally thinking to myself that I don't want to turn 26 and still never have any physical contact besides being bumped into on the trains. 

I've always been repulsive to men and even my friends and faimly have moved on. I've always wanted to be the kind of woman that other people would watch out for and want to love. But I've never been that girl, and I've grown into a woman that nobody wants anytihng to do with. 

I've tried to start over tons of times with different goals in mind and I tell myself this time it will be different. I've joined groups, volunteered, joined tons of organizations and tried and tried to find a place where I could fit in and somehow feel like my presence was really, truly worth something. I've tried psychiatric drugs and the health route and told myself that this time, this time I would fix it. I've failed. 

I can't do anymore time on this Earth feeling like I'm serving a prison sentence for a crime that I didn't commit. I feel trapped and like I can't even think of something that's worth doing or somewhere I can put this crushing feeling or all the love I wanted to give to another person and I really feel like the kindest thing my doctor could do for me would be to give me a course of pills that would let me peacefully move into non-existence.
