That moment when the realization hits you that thereâ€™s nothing you can do but pointlessly struggle like a caught fish on a boatJust realized Iâ€™m going to fail my math class which will cause me to be kicked out of my major as a computer engineer since Iâ€™m on academic probation. I canâ€™t withdraw either because Iâ€™m required to pass. When this happens my parents will stop paying for college. So now here I am, laying in bed at 3am with a couple bottles of pills. I doubt Iâ€™ll take them, but I like to think I will.
