I survived todayToday was pretty dark. Lots of suicidal ideation. It was barely all I could do to stay at work. I wanted to leave and go drive my car into a nearby river. Or check myself into a psychiatric hospital. 

Instead I got dinner with my sister and talked to her about it. I've agreed to see my doctor and set an appointment with a therapist. We talked that the doctor might send me to a hospital. Ready for that if that's the outcome.
