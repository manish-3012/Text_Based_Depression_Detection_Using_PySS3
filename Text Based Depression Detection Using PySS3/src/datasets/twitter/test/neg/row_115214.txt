No optionsEverything is so boring. There is rarely anything to look forward to and the day is lonely and sad. I donâ€™t want to go to college because I donâ€™t want a career. Thereâ€™s nothing I want from this world and everyday is just lonely and boring. As soon as I turn 18 I want a gun because I canâ€™t take this anymore. Waking up every morning is painful.
