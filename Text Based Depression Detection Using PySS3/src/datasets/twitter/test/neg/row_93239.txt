I am gunna flyAfter deciding my time and date Iâ€™ve had a lot of spare time. I fell over pretty bad the other day through some scaffolding. My ankle and leg is very deformed Iâ€™ve been in nothing but agony since and cannot walk. My family refuse to take me to the hospital. Iâ€™m hoping now itâ€™ll drop off and Iâ€™ll die. I havenâ€™t stopped sweating since and honestly Iâ€™ve never felt so ill. Iâ€™m loving it, drifting in and out of consciousness. It feels like death is approaching, only a stone throw away. I keep hoping itâ€™s close. It certainly feels so.
