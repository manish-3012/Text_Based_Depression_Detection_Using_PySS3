Maybe I'm here to suffer for the life my parents lived, and if I kill myself I'll just have an even longer stint in hellI'm not religious but when you think about suicide for 20+ years, the afterlife is a default consideration. I have never been able to jump because *one* of these always gets me: When you are on the precipice, your mind forces you to look at the big picture. Who are you leaving behind? What'll happen if you fail? If you succeed? 

I wonder if I need to move to a country where I can get hold of methadone easily or something. I'm not going to sit here like a sitting duck waiting for life to strangle me. Failing that, a steel cable is good to have around if a nice opportunity for decapitation shows itself. Gas just doesn't fucking work for me. Either they don't sell them with the contents they say, or my physiology is unusual. I should not have to associate with dangerous criminals to end my life. Fuck society
