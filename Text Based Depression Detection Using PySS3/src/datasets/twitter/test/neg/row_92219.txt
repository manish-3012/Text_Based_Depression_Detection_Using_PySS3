Why is it wrong?I'm just curious and no i'm not considering it now.

My Grandfather is 92, many say it's amazing he's in his 90's and can still walk around and speak. Not to him, he's in pain, can't move his hands, can't see, can barely hear and it hurts his jaws to speak. 

So far old age looks horrible to me, before this my grandmother was living with us. She passed away earlier at a much younger age of 83, she had Alzheimer's. 83 years old but when I spoke to her it was as if I was speaking to a 10 year old kid. She had forgotten basic things like using the toilet, couldn't pick things up as her finger joints were stiff.

Now my father, he passed away at the age of 60. He was a doctor, he was showing strong signs of Alzheimer's, he too was sometimes dropping things since he couldn't hold them properly. He was well aware what was in stored for him, he was a proud man and well known for giving free treatment to the poor. He didn't want to ever end up like my grandmother, all his life he has been the one to take care of others and been the one to save lives. He didn't want to end up wearing an adult diaper with a servant tailing him all the time because he can't take care of himself. So he OD'd himself many months after he was sure he had Alzheimer's, it was when the muscles in his body started aching(not sure if that's related to Alzheimer's but he would complain about it often during those last few months). My mother and sister hated that decision of his, no one knew he was ever planning it. As for me, it was a shock to me as well but I understood why he did it. 


I would do the same thing if it was me, I wouldn't want to live like that. My Father didn't either and that's why he did it.

 So why is it wrong to commit suicide when you know very well what's in stored for you? Don't get me wrong, my dad was an Atheist so he knew well you only live once, he wasn't expecting to go to heaven or anything for all the good he did in his lifetime. He was very well educated, even the dosage he took was properly measured to kill a man of his size. 

My mother and sister won't explain to me, only says he was selfish to do so.
