How do you stop the urge to self-harm?I don't have anyone I could confide in during times like these. I feel antagonized by everyone and everything. That I should just keep to myself. That everything I do is wrong.

I'd overcome it before, but everytime I fall again, it just gets harder and harder to stop the urge. The better I feel, the worse I get when I fall down again. I'm scared soon enough I can't save me from myself anymore.
