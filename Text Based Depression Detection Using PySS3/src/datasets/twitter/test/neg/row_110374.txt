Feel a bit hollowLike the title says, I just feel a bit hollow. This past month has been rather rough for me academically, emotionally, and physically. I'm only in Junior year in High School, but I've been depressed since I was twelve. I have OCD that I have to take medication for, and anxiety as well as anorexia. 

This past month I've taken the SAT (and probably failed), been broken up with by my boyfriend (who I felt was the only person who understood what I was going through) and lost about eight pounds. I can't eat. Everything makes my stomach hurt and I just feel listless and sick. 

I'm constantly crying for no reason at all, and I can't stand much more of this to be honest. I have a therapist that I see once a week, but I don't feel like it's doing anything for me. My parents are very supportive, and are trying to give me all the help they can. I feel like a burden, like I'm not contributing anything to anyone. I just feel so hollow and caved out and I don't know what to do with myself anymore.
