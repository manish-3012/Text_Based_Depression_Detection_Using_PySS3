Do ppl ever just leave the second they know u suicidal?I wonder whatâ€™s so scary to ppl about being suicidal or having such thoughts.

The ppl who leave are always arenâ€™t attached to u anyways and have zero intentions or having any real bond with u.

At first uâ€™re the best, then uâ€™re just a psycho?
