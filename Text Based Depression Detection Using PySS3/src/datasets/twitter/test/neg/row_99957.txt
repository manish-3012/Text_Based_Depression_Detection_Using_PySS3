Too afraid to fade awayIt's been four long years. I feel compelled to kill myself, like it'll be the final climax, like it has to happen and once it happens something will be complete. Or that something else is ordering me to kill myself. I haven't self harmed in almost three weeks and everyday I am so close to breaking it. I just want to get a sharp and go crazy with it. I want to see the blood so badly and feel the high. I haven't felt happy in so long, I just want to experience it for a bit. I'm so tired all the time and of all this stuff. I would have already killed myself, but I am so afraid of not existing anymore. I get this feeling that it's the right thing to do.
