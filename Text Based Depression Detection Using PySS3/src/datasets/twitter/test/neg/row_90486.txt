It is the sleep that makes me alive at this pointHello, 26-year-old male from southern Europe here. I have had depression and anxiety ever since I was 15 years old, and life has been pretty much a roller coaster ride of experiences and emotions. In January of this year, I was submitted to a psychiatric hospital for attempted suicide, and I spent around 3 months as an inpatient there. I have been out of the hospital for 3-4 weeks now.

Currently I have no job, no friends, no partner, and a dicey relationship with my family; my mother, brother, and sister try to speak with me, but things are a bit awkward for reasons which are too complicated to explain here (to tell you the truth, I don't feel like typing the reason here). Life is hell at the moment, and my doctor just found out I have an abnormally high sugar content in my blood, yet another reason for me to panic and yet resign myself to a life not worth living. Today I picked up cigarettes again after a week of abstaining, and I am a caffeine addict and a borderline alcoholic, in the sense that I don't drink daily, but when I do I binge. Tonight I'm feeling particularly negative, due to the doctor's blood results, my inability to stay off the cigarettes, and pretty much my inability to find conversation with anyone. I don't want to call the suicide hotline because they will refer me to the hospital again and I don't want to be stuck inside there again.

Sleep is the only time I feel alright, because time passes by without me knowing. I sleep for around 8-9 hours at night, and will probably do another 2-3 hours during the day. My medication makes me tired, which helps me sleep especially at night. I use a CPAP to sleep, and I hate it but I need it, and if it weren't for the pills I would probably stay up with my legs shaking in anxiety and me fidgeting and worrying about dropping the CPAP machine on its side by mistake. Thank goodness for those pills. At the same time, fuck those pills.

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel lonely, people have tried to reach out but something in me just can't accept that. People should not spend their time on me. I'm just ranting here because I am venting out my thoughts here and this post will probably be lost here. I'm not worthwhile, I never have been, and I don't think I will ever become something worthwhile either.

Thank goodness for sleep.
