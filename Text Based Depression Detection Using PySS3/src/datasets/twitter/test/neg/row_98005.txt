Incoherent rambling about my predicamentCan't sleep-in pretty much a mental storm.  Honestly it feels like being stuck underwater and aching for air, I can't think of anything except offing myself and a hurricane of negative emotions and thoughts leading up to that. Decided to just â€˜stream of thoughtâ€™ my problems into a semi-coherent post here as a brief alternative.

Fuck me. Got into a great college, did a decent/mediocre job there for 3 years (I look back in absolute disgust-I just straight up wasn't mature enough to handle it), got suspended for a year because of cheating. Yeah, Iâ€™m a bastard, but I honestly I have no idea why I do it. I have memories of cheating all the way back in first grade, on learning multiplication tables-how pathetic is that? So I fucked myself over to the extreme disappointment of pretty much everyone.  Went into a huge depression over it-letting down family, fucking up â€˜the pathâ€™, etc.  Mind you I have always had some level of chronic depression, but this was insane. For a year, an entire fucking year of my youth, I did nothing.  I dropped of the face of the Earth. I was faced with challenges and the opportunity to do some nontraditional path, and I curled up into a ball.  I just couldnâ€™t mentally handle it.  I filled my days with literally anything to stop this tide of horrible depression and suicidal thoughts from rolling in. I had a few sanctions to complete before being allowed to re-enroll after a year, couldnâ€™t even extract myself from my own asshole to do them until like last September, because even things like thinking about my shitshow of a life was enough to bring panic attacks out of nowhere.  This was some bad shit.  As fucked up as I am now, I can look down on the thing I was then. One of my biggest regrets is actually getting offered counseling way back then and not taking it. As it stands, Iâ€™m trying my hardest to get registered and amass an unfathomable amount of money/promises for money. Iâ€™m very late in starting to make arrangements (again, head in ass, difficulty getting shit verified). The more I look over it the more I realize just how screwed I am. There is no fucking way I can come up with all that money. In all seriousness, this fucked up tide of feelings is over the mere *possibility* of me not having my shit together for the semester, what really frightens me is what I might do if things donâ€™t pan out. It might just be too little too late.

Goddamn, was I a different person in my last year of college. I was more active, had friends, hell-I even got married. Right, I had a good friend since pretty much day one of college; international student that after a year and a half or so I agreed to marry so that she could stay in the country afterward and actually stand a chance at acceptance into grad schools. Holy shit did that relationship go tits up. 3 years of great friendship, 1 more of living together (to trick govt) and being â€˜more than friendsâ€™, and now I havenâ€™t seen or spoken to her in 4 months, and I hate her almost as much as I hate myself. I canâ€™t believe I did so much just to be treated like dirt. Yeahâ€¦some unresolved issues there and a sea of bad blood, but someday soon Iâ€™ll just file for divorce and screw her over for good.

And thatâ€™s only the shit-covered cherry atop the towering cupcake of cunts that is my social life.

Living in a spare room at a family friends place, through sheer force of extreme kindness and pity (I moved in some time ago after the whole â€˜living with wifeâ€™ thing went nuclear and I needed out). Honestly these guys are so kind and generous and I owe them so much I would literally kill a man if they said they would like it better if I did. No job now since seasonal shit ended, though I do have some savings that can act as chunk of tuition. Youâ€™ll be proud to know that I actually started seeing a psychologist a month or so ago. All my family tries to be supportive (even though only one at most even has an inkling of how messed up I am-she practically shat herself when she had me fill out a PHQ-9), but the disappointment just canâ€™t be hidden. It just makes me feel worse, like I donâ€™t deserve encouragement, or kind words, or love from my family. Itâ€™s difficult to put into words. Iâ€™m just a long list of fuck-ups and closing doors. Existing like this is just awful, and an escape sounds pretty nice.  Like a refreshing, deep, breath of air.

Anyway, how are you guys doing? I have many more stories of fucked up shit Iâ€™ve done, people Iâ€™ve let down, times Iâ€™ve been in ambulances (both emt and passenger), lying to the government, and the like; if anyone is curious. Iâ€™ll probably be up another 9 hours or so stewing, hell I might even respond to any questions/insults/replies I get. I've pissed patterns in the snow more concise and informative than these paragraphs I've vomited out.
