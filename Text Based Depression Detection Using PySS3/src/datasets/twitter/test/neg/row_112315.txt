shit I'm sad againI posted in here some hours ago bc I basically feel stupid and worthless and the only thing I receive is shit from the people I rely on, I really hope this sadness stops soon because I'm not usually someone who is this sad but I guess it's the cost of having a mental illness in the past. I would appreciate a lot if someone isn't bothered with me and could maybe talk for a little bit
