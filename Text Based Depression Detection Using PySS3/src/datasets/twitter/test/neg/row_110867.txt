Why canâ€™t I just do it? Why is there so much hesitation when I finally am ready and then I stop myself?The thought eats away at my mind constantly. I am so tired and ready to be done, but when barrel touches my temple I canâ€™t will myself to pull the trigger enough. 

The one time I was drunk enough and ready to my friend had to come over and outside at that moment and stop me.  I am tired of the day-to-day monotony of life and sick of being forced to live a life I never asked for.  I feel like the passenger in a vehicle that I wasnâ€™t ready to get in, and the drive jumped out.  

So why canâ€™t I finally do it? What the fuck is stopping me.
