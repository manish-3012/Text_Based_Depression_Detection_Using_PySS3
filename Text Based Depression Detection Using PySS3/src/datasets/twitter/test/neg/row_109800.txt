I am 16 years oldEducation is hurting me and I want to kill myself. Recently in my junior year im being stressed out to perform my best to take the hardest classes. Im being compared to my friends saying im not the smartest. Im expected to be equal or greater than my brother. I cheated in my spanish test today and I wanted a second chance. I never got it. I couldnt explain myself. I cant recover and this grade is going to stain until the end of the year. I dont want to go on with 5 hours of work everyday. I barely get any sleep and my only exit is gaming which I can barely do. Im confused and lost. I dont know who i want to talk to. i wanted to see sympathy from my spanish teacher but instead i broke down. i cant keep going like this. Im currently typing this from school but im afraid of what ill do once i get home.
