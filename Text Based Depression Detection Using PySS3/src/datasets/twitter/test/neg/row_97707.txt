My anxiety has turned into suicidal thoughtsIâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts in the past, but they were never anxiety-related. But lately they have been. My anxiety has been consistently so awful for two months now, and it literally makes me want to die. Iâ€™ll sit in the same spot for hours with debilitating fear and I canâ€™t bring myself to do any of my hobbies. I feel constantly in danger and it makes my brain shut down completely. Nothing makes it go away and my family doesnâ€™t believe that my anxiety is as bad as it is. I just want out of this.
