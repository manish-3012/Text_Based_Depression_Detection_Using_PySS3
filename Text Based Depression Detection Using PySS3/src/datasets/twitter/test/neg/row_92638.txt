limboI often feel like I'm half dead already, like one foot in the grave. My whole life has been underscored by the deaths of loved ones around me and I did a lot of drugs and illegal stuff in my high school years for escapist reasons. I was forced to go to college (really glad I was) because I had money from my fathers' life insurance. I learned a lot in school and started taking an interest and initiative in my life but that only lasted about a year. I enjoy things and have hobbies that I'm passionate about but I can't motivate myself to do anything. I've always vowed against suicide as that was how I lost my dad but it feels like I've subconsciously already set myself up for that, or that it somehow feels inevitable. There's a looooot more to my story and  idk what I want from this post. Mostly to air out these emotions that  I dont feel comfortable sharing with my fam or gf because it might scare them. I dont want sympathy or to be told everything is going to be okay. I want someone to tell me why life is worth living, how do you wake up and be happy? Its only happened to me a few times and I love that feeling. Thanks in advance y'all.
