a premature funny letterim not quite sure where to start, so im just going to. im just your regular ol person. i didnt ever open up to people because its kind of dickish to bog down peoples moods, and all my 'problems' are me being melodramatic. my brain feels like its been in a funk for forever. im just mad tired and dont feel like hangin about.

yatta yatta theres a lot more i could elaborate on, but the further i go the more asinine it all seems, so ill spare you the details. i love you &lt;3
