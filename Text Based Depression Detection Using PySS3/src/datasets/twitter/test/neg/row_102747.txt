I need reasons to live.I'm at school ready to cry. I don't know what I'm still here for. everything on my list has been checked off. please give me reasons. I wrote a note last night and everything. I don't want to hurt my friends but my selfishness outweighs that feeling. I had a few reasons a couple days ago. things to finish for others. now though, I have nothing. I have a map part that I can abandon. I have money in paypal that my parents can just have. I don't see a point.
