I don't know what to doI have severe body dysmorphic disorder, anxiety, and depression. 

Having body dysmorphic disorder would be bad enough, but giving this mental disorder to someone who is extremely short doesn't have a good outcome. 

I am forever trapped in this prison that is my body. I cannot do anything to improve my situation. This mental disorder makes me fixate on this flaw intensely. I am undesirable, bullied, and hated. I have never had a girlfriend. I don't resent or hate anyone though. Truthfully, I only resent and hate myself. I only wish to be killed quickly and painlessly so that my suffering will end. In addition to all of this, no one will even sympathize with me. None will even allow me to be upset about this. No one will say, yeah that sucks. The blame is all on me. 

Why can't I just endure? Why can't I just live being a 5'4" male? Why can't I just find a girlfriend? Why can't I just be confident? Why can't I just be respected? 

I CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE THINGS!!!!! 

I can't escape this body. I can't escape my thoughts. I tried to get help from a therapist, from a doctor, but they couldn't help me. They can't fix me. I am so alone. I have no one to go to. No one understands. I am so scared. I can't stop crying. I wish I could fix myself. I wish someone could fix me. I wish someone could help me. I don't want to die but that is the only escape from this nightmare. I'm so scared. 

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK 

I'm so alone. Why doesn't anyone love me.
