Has anyone else ever dealt with this?I don't know why, but I seem to be incapable of making lasting friendships. Everybody turns against me one way or another. And I can't figure out if I'm just a bad judge of character, so I bring shitty people into my life, or if I'm a shitty person, and people leave because of that. I tried killing myself during a particularly bad breakup with a friend, and she told me I was just trying to manipulate her into staying. Has anyone else ever been accused of being manipulative in your suicidal thoughts? I Googled it, and literally all I could find was "How to tell if your friend is manipulating you". There's not much sympathy out there for people who are accused of manipulative behavior. It's lonely.
