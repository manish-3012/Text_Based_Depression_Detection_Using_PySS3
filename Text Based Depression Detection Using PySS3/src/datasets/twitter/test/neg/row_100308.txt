I give upMy dad beat the shit out of me yesterday. My mom disowned me and my siblings. No one cares about me. I haven't cried in 3 years because I bottled up all my abuse and pain for 6 years. I'm gonna find a way to kill myself peacefully. But before I do I'm looking for something....anything worth living for. Someone help me see something worth living for.
