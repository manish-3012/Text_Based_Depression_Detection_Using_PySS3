I made a friend and he left meI made a friend a little over a week ago. We clicked instantly and I enjoyed talking to him so much, we had a lot of similar interests and I woke up and texted him every morning. I donâ€™t know. Today he told me he wanted me for himself like romantically and sexually and I told him I didnâ€™t want to lead him on and that I liked my boyfriend a lot. He said we should call quits on our friendship and later blocked me on all social medias etc. It seems hopeless. I lost all my friends and now I thought I had made a new one and he wasnâ€™t even interested in being friends with me. I couldnâ€™t stop crying for 6 hours, my eyes burn. Maybe Iâ€™m destined to be a lonely person and shouldnâ€™t make friends. Maybe Iâ€™m not meant to be friends. Iâ€™ve been lonely for such a long time yet I donâ€™t know how to cope
