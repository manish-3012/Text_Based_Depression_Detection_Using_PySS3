Feel my fingers slipping..Hey all, my first post here.

Had a lot of things building up the past couple days. This morning is hitting me hard. I've been up less than 2 hours and every little thing has added up to cause me to fall over the edge. I am trying to hold on hard because this is a time I can see the fall almost happen.

My normal circle of support is both in upheaval and apparently 100% unavailable. The new person to my life, my love and my light, doesnt know how to handle these moments and is in another city and so I cannot call on physical comfort and being "sat with" a normal fixing issue.

The issues built up regard my ex, an abusive narcissist that I was with 11 years. No one i know seems to understand the big league chess match skills that go into talking to a narcissist. No question is innocent from them.

Questions welcome. Didnt want pointless information being spewed and overwhelming anyone who'd be able to just.. talk to me. I need to get past this but I am on my way to work and am unsure how long work will be today.

"Big pictures" arent good for me. Seeing the big picture scares me and makes me see my insignificance in it and.. yeah.
