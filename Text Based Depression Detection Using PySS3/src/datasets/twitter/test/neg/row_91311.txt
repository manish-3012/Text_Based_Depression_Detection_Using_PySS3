This is gonna sound fucked up....Anyone just wish they had some terrible horrible disease? Like an uncurable one, and you die no matter what? You wouldnâ€™t have to worry about anyone who cares about you at all, they wonâ€™t think they messed up, it will just happen. Like some sort of cancer, idk it sounds messed up to me. But I want something like that.
