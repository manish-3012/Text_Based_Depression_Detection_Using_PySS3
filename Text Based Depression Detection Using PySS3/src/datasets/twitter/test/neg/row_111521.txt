IdeationI can't stop knowing that it would be better if I were dead. 

I lost my husband. I am having severe dysphoria from bleeding. I am having bodily side effects from bleeding heavily. I had suicidal ideation before my husband died and we managed it, while waiting for therapy, by talking about our life together but he is dead now and I should join him. 

I am going to the doctor today. With my symptoms it could be a lot of things. I have been praying that it's serious and I can just decline medical intervention. I hope that happens. 

I have been trying to get help but no one is available. I even fixed my health insurance situation but I can't find support. Yesterday I hung up on an intake person when she kept insisting I was a straight women and I ended up yelling "I am a homosexual" at her because that's not gonna be a good place for me. 

I just. I don't have a plan but I want to be dead.
