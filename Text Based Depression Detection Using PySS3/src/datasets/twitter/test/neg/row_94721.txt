motivations for suicideI feel like one of my multiple reasons that makes suicide just be a thing that lurks in the corner of my mind for me is vindication. Like its so fucking spiteful and petty and cruel but I feel like people would only care abt me when I'm dead. Like only then will they be like 'oh fuck, we had this person in our world' instead of idk. Not giving a shit about me. I know no one owes me their time but I feel sad when it feels like my friends just. don't care for me. I don't feel like a part of anything, and it kills me. I sometimes wish I could just cut out the part of me that feels so I don't have to deal with this terrible and empty feeling of loneliness, its like something that fills you with rage but you're also just....so depressed.
