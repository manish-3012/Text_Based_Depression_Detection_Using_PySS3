I don't know why I can't shake this.I keep thinking I'll get better.  That I won't feel like shit.  Sometimes I do feel better but it never lasts. I don't really hate my life.  I have everything to live for.  Other than being ugly as shit and losing my hair.  I just don't want to feel like this emotionally anymore.  I've been Having suicidal thoughts for 3 or 4 years now and I don't know how much longer I can do this.  Can anyone talk to me?
