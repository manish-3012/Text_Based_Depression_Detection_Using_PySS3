I realized that Iâ€™m stuck and Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™m going to ruin ChristmasIâ€™m 19, this is a separate account because my girlfriend and I send each other posts on reddit and I donâ€™t want her to see this and worry. 
My names ben, Iâ€™m a sophomore in college. I want to be a teacher, I havenâ€™t started my major classes and this is my fourth switch. I really think Iâ€™m good with kids but Iâ€™m scared I wonâ€™t cut it because I have a man bun and Iâ€™m really skinny and Iâ€™m not sure if they would hire me. Iâ€™m not gay but Iâ€™m very outspoken and I have a unique style and stuff and I just think people regard me as an intelligent quiet weirdo. 
Anyways Iâ€™m also bipolar and Iâ€™m from a family tree Iâ€™d have a hard time explaining but I have 8 siblings. I just feel stuck, I cane to college on a whim and Iâ€™ve never been good at anything but video games and art. Two programs they donâ€™t offer at my college and either way Iâ€™m trapped underneath a lease and utility billl of 680 a month and I canâ€™t afford it. I have to pay November and December and I donâ€™t have the money and Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t have the money because I am unable to work at the Salvation Army where I work because Iâ€™ve reached the limit on work study hours for the semester.I canâ€™t find another job because I donâ€™t have a car.  I donâ€™t want to ask my grandparents for help because I wanted to be self sufficient and I have been for a year and a half. But Iâ€™ve recently acclimated credit card debt buying my girlfriend and my siblings gifts when I came home for fall break which I paid off. 1452 dollars, now after contacts and food and reckless spending Iâ€™ve managed to accumulate another 1000. So thatâ€™s 2500 dollars on accident. Of which I still owe 1000. But my bills are coming in this month for my house and I donâ€™t know what to do. My current plan is to sell off all my stocks and eat ramen and I just canâ€™t afford to buy any Christmas gifts for anyone but Iâ€™m worried everyone will hate me and I usually go Elton great lengths to pick out great gifts and I just canâ€™t. I canâ€™t make anyone happy and itâ€™s making me dissapointed in myself for how I spent my money and I just am such a fuckup. I canâ€™t make it to class Iâ€™m so stressed, I havenâ€™t been to my classes since I found out I canâ€™t work. I canâ€™t wake up to an alarm. Iâ€™m a mess, please give me some advice because itâ€™s so hard I want to give up
