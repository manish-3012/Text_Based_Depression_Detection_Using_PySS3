I wish I had the courage to end it. I hate my life and I don't want to be hereEveryday just merges into one. I don't find happiness in anything anymore, even when I went on holiday doing things I enjoy all I could think about was how I hate my life. 

I have everything I want, I'm young, have a good job and money, nice car, place to live, dogs and all the other stuff you treat yourself to. Sometimes it's as if the only thing that loves me is my dog.

Nobody notices me. I have no friends, literally no one. The only people I talk to are colleagues and it's a work conversation. 

I just wish someone would notice me, or someone actually wanted me. Everyone I've ever known has fucked me over and I really don't know what I've done to deserve such a shit life. I bet no one in the street thinks twice about looking at me, no one thinks wow she's pretty. No one I've known ever actively seeks my company it's always me who had to start any conversation, but everyone is all gone.

I have nothing to live for, nothing to look forward to and no reason to live. If only I could find a way to do it painlessly but I'm too much of a coward to do it anyway, so I'm doomed for a good 60/70 years of feeling so utterly worthless, shit, ugly and numb.

No one would bat an eye if I dropped off the grid. I didn't choose to have this life and it's so unfair.

I hate my life. I am so alone, loneliness is what's gonna kill me.
