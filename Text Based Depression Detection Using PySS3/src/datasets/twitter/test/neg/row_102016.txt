I genuinely don't knowYall im so fucking miserable like what did I do to deserve this. I swear I try i really do but it's just the same shit.  I'm so sick of trying to preserve. Most everyone I know has something at least going for them.
I have shit all 
All I do is sit n suffer n want to kill myself
Im tired of relapsing im tired of going on
I really have no reason im sick of telling myself oh I have to live for my friends
Well fuck my friends they don't mean shit half the time anyways 
Don't understand anything about how I feel or what im going through 
Everyone is on a different wave length n im sitting hwre wanting to fucking shoot myself
