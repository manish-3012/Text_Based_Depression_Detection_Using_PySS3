My recent ex girlfriend is fucking my friendI knew my girlfriend for over 8 years, since kindergarten. She was fucking perfect. We started dating about 2 years ago and my life was finally in order and about 2 weeks ago she broke up with me because she wanted to be alone and wasn't happy with herself. We were both sad and clearly still loved each other and the idea of getting back together was in the air. We still talked, but after a few days the responses became dry texts like "yeah" and "okay" and then just no response. She started avoiding me at classes and the route we walk together she walked with my friend instead. About 4 months ago, this "friend" apparently said "I'm just waiting for ___ and ___ to break up so I can fuck her" and I didn't want to believe it (found out from a reliable source and best friend) and today at work, he came in. And she stopped working and just talked to him and talked and we closed and he left and he just waited outside and when we got off is instead of going to her car she went right to him, who was sitting in the back of his truck. I left before I saw anymore and I am fucking heartbroken. I honestly have lost my happiness and my will to continue is slowly dwindling. Not exactly suicidal, not yet at least. But I just can't take it. Fuck.
