Tonight I'm going to do itI can't take it anymore. The lonliness, the sadness. It never ends. My family hates me. I went to a funeral this weekend. I tried to socialize with my family. It made me realize that talking about my situation only makes my situation worse. There's no point in talking about it. The whole time I was there I was watching the corpse. Where should I cut myself so it won't show? Left jugular. I'll bleed out in seconds. Where should I do it? The park, in the cold. So my family won't find me. I have a razor. All that's left is to write my note, nuke my computer and phone, and go. They don't love me anyway. My family wants me to be independent. I don't want to be independent, I want to be dead. No more suffering. No more trying to understand. Who can understand me when I don't understand myself? Who can love me when I don't love myself? I. Am. Done. Gallifrey falls no more. This is my last resort. This is my nuclear option. I don't want to fix this. I want to die. Soon. Five hours. That's how much time I have left. That's how much suffering I have left. Help me pass the time. A little more interaction before I go.
