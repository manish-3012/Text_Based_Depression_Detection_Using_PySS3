Loneliness is killing meOver the years I've had friends and family members distance themselves from me because of my issues. I have constant anxiety, depression, OCD and ADHD.

I've also been a heavy drug user to cope with my issues but I'm slowly stopping and cutting back on everything. I hardly ever see anyone and I'm too anxious to talk to my co-workers most of the time.

I constantly feel lonely when I'm sober which is 95% of the time, even when I'm in a room full of people. I try my best to be positive and good company around others but my issues can get in the way of this. 

It's eating me alive and I've considered suicide many times because of this, I've been in a psych ward twice in the last year for suicidal thoughts.

I've tried many different medications with no success. I see lots of people getting into long term relationships and having kids at my age but I can't see any real chance of me doing anything serious anytime soon in life because of my problems.

This constant boredom and loneliness mixed with everything else is driving me insane
