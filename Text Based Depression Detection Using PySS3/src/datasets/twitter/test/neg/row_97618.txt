I'm just so tired and lonely. My self esteem is so low.All I seem to do lately is wish that it was all over.  Being so consumed by these thoughts is so discouraging. 

And of course there's this tiny part of me that looks for the positive subconsciously.  Really it's just suspended disbelief that maybe things will get better.  But nothing good has happened to me in a very long time.

I hate getting my hopes up watching life and people pass me by.  I don't have much support.

It feels like I'm so far gone that I'll never pull out of this or be able to relate to normal functioning people.

And I can't blame anyone for not wanting to interact with me given the state I'm in.  I'm a mess and I'm so lonely, which obviously isn't very attractive.

I've tried to pull out of it. No one is going to save me.  No one is going to give me a lifeline to help me save myself.

All I'm left with is this terrible depression.  Wishing it was over and just waiting for the next shitty thing to happen..
