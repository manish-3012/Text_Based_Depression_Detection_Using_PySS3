I can't take it anymorePosting this on a throwaway account because well, I don't want to share my main.

I'm 16 years old and I've been depressed and suicidal for the past 2-3 years or so. I've cut myself, burn myself and so many other shit that. Recently it's been getting worse though. I lost a lot of friends (who, turns out, weren't my friends at all), This straight guy has been sexually abusing me at school because I'm gay, my parents don't seem like they care about me (even if they know that I'm depressed, they just tell me to take my pills and that's all), I'm failing school and I just genuinely feel lonely. I want to kill myself but I don't know how. I went to a psychologist twice since the start of the year and they said they'll call me in 2 months because my case isn't high priority or some shit like that. I don't know what to do anymore, I just can't take it anymore.
