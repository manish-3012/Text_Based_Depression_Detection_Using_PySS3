I hate being such an idiot and being so stupidIt became obvious to me today that Iâ€™m an idiot who canâ€™t get my words out and canâ€™t express the way I feel correctly. Not only that but I say things too bluntly and sometimes donâ€™t say enough. I noticed it when I was talking to this girl I like, which was a sort of big deal for me because itâ€™s not every day which I talk to someone new and I screwed it all up by sounding like an asshole even though I was just trying to be funny. Iâ€™m tired of being me I hate hearing my own name and I hate existing. 

Iâ€™m not super hurt about the girl calling me an asshole but because thinking back I am an asshole and most of the time I donâ€™t mean to be one. I tried fixing it by saying I didnâ€™t mean it as an insult but maybe she doesnâ€™t believe it or just doesnâ€™t care and honestly if I would have thought twice about the shit I said I wouldnâ€™t have been here.
