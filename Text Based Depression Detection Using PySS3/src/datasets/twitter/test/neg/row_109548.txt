Suicide has been on my mind a lot lately.And it's difficult to talk about with people I know,  because it will hurt them. I have moments when I'm ready to take my life but then I don't.

I was in hospital last month for my suicidal tendencies. I cried so much because everyone was so kind to me.

I just wish I could rid myself of this horrible feeling in my stomach. Dread or something, I feel nauseated at the thoughts that run through my head.

I just don't want to hurt anyone but... I don't know if that reason will always stop me. My thoughts have worsened since I was suicidal last.

Now it's much more intense, it's much harder to occupy myself with anything. 

At the same time I think people I love would have a much easier life without me. And that thought has been occupying my mind so much lately.

Idk if anyone is up to talk I'd appreciate it. I won't talk about my mental health, if that makes you uncomfortable.
