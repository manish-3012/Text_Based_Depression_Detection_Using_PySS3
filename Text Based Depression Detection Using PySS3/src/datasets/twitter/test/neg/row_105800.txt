Iâ€™m so downI am so so depressed right now. I have an 8 month old baby who has practically never left my side. Babyâ€™s dad is trash and left us on motherâ€™s day behind on rent me without a job or vehicle for his ex who heâ€™s been sleeping with our entire relationship. His weeekend is full of the bar scene and dancing etc etc with money to blow as I just continue to try and breastfeed our son with my milk dwindling to nothing from the stress. I put out applications around town. Only to avoid responding back when they sat a date for the interview. Bc I donâ€™t have a vehicle. And can I bring my baby to the interview? I have been clean off drugs for 18 months now. I really donâ€™t want to go back down that road. Ex bf completely isolated me. He called this apartment my prison. It is.   Iâ€™m going to lose my apartment. Itâ€™s impossible to get on my feet. Impossible. Iâ€™ve lost all 3 of my other children and I know Iâ€™m going to lose this baby Bc I canâ€™t provide for him. I was so gullible to stay a stay at home mom to avoid daycare and formula cost. Bc all I really saved was him and not one fuck is given by anybody for me. I changed my life. I changed my ways. But Iâ€™m still suicidal like the good old days
