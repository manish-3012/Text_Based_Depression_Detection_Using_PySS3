DazeI am in agony. This day just continues on and Iâ€™m so broken. I am angry at myself and itâ€™s starting to seep out of me. I am very off putting to people and now, I donâ€™t really even care. I am in pain and I have nothing in this tangible world to keep living for. I canâ€™t commit suicide due to me not wanting to add more stress to the family. I wish there was a way to escape this hurt without drugs. I just want to bleed out. I just made some art and it only brought me pain. I thought it would be good for me but in the end, I felt so much sadness and wanted to rip the paper apart. Now, I have get back to my school work. An endless cycle that I can only break with a bullet. Why canâ€™t I have one day of happiness?
