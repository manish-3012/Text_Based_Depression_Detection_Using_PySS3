don't see the pointhello. I do not have friends or people to talk to so decided to post here. I have been severely depressed for a long time and deal with horrible self-esteem. I don't feel like I can continue living this way. I have tried the usual tricks of distractions, I write and play music to take my mind off of things or indulge in photography, but it does not make me feel better for long. Additionally, it is hard to leave my house because I don't like how I look, and it is becoming stressful. I just don't see the appeal of living in this world anymore for someone like me. I have nothing to offer and truly do not make a difference in this universe.
