The void impossible to fillHi Iâ€™m a 31 yo man and I live at my dads home, a huge house.
I have no job at the moment and I have lost all my friends. I have a shitty relationship with all the members of my family especially with my little sister who seems to have lost her mind since 2016. Each day that passes I feel weaker and I feel less and less Ã©motions. Iâ€™ve been smoking a lot of weed these past months/years to numb the pain but Iâ€™ve stopped since my body got used to weed and it wasnâ€™t doing anything at all at the end.
 Iâ€™m struggling to keep a healthy body weight because Iâ€™m never hungry. I used to be an athlete but now I feel like I have no energy to get out of my bed. My father is a doctor and Iâ€™ve asked him a couple of time for help, not as a cry from the heart but Iâ€™ve still told him that I was depressive and itâ€™s been months now. I donâ€™t know how I can or why should I continue to live this empty life.
