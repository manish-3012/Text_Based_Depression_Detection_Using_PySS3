I was just released from a Behavioral Health facility, but nothing has changed.On Thursday (January 29), I was sent to a hospital for telling my school counselor and psychologist that I wanted to kill myself. I've been sent to *that* type of hospital 4 times prior to this time. Keep in mind that this has been going on since I was 13 years old (I'm 16 now). 

The reason that those places never work for me is because my mother won't let them treat me medically. They're not allowed to give me any psych medication even though it is highly recommended because I have anxiety, major depressive disorder, and insomnia. Nonetheless, my mother approves and there is nothing that can be legally done because she's my mother and has the right to choose how her child is treated.

She is under the impression that I'm a rebellious teenager who hurts herself when she doesn't get her way, so she thinks that the facilities are teaching me to cope with my anger that does not exist. In actuality, they're teaching me to cope with my mother because she's a particularly difficult person, but nothing I try works. 

Honestly, I just don't want to try anymore. I don't want to go another day with the small voice in my head telling me to just kill myself. I can't deal with my mother who often calls me fat, ugly, worthless, a bitch, and even telling me to go kill myself. It's too much weight and I have the strength of a kitten. 

People always tell me to think about the people around me, but I do all the time and I think that it's time that I think about myself. I want to be selfish for once in my life. I want to be treated like someone on their deathbed: with respect for this wishes...

Is that so much to ask for?
