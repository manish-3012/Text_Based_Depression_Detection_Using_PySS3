Getting ready to goI'm really not sure how to start, what to say or why I'm even posting.
All I know for certain is that I can't do this for much longer. But it's also a comforting thought, knowing I am fully prepared &amp; ready to go at a seconds notice. I'm not here to ramble on about wanting to die. Fact is, I want to live. There is so much to love about life. But I am not living. I've seen every doctor possible &amp; tried every medical &amp; alternative therapy to no avail. There are no options left except shock therapy. I would do it but I just no longer have the strength. Anyways...I hope I posted this in the correct manner. I don't know if this even makes sense. 
Later....
