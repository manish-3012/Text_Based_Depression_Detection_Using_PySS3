Iâ€™m a complete and utter failure.I donâ€™t have any friends. My family hates me. My siblings canâ€™t stand to be around me and my parents think Iâ€™ve failed them. Everything I do, thereâ€™s just immense pressure on it. Every time I try to turn to religion itâ€™s like it pushes me away. My mom is a narcissist who hates me (per her words) and my dad is never around to stop her from saying anything. Everything I do, I fail at. Every time I try to do something, it crashes and burns. Iâ€™ve applied to over 100 jobs, with a total of 4 different resumes and 6 different styles of cover letters. Not a single interview. And I have the experience too. Every time I try to learn something or do something, I fail at it. School, relationships, anything. I canâ€™t even cook a fucking hotdog without setting fire to the kitchen. 

I have a congenital heart defect that leaves me in perpetual pain. I feel like Iâ€™m dying but god wonâ€™t give me that luxury. I havenâ€™t slept more than an hour or two in years.

I donâ€™t see a reason to stay any longer. If I knew this was in store for me, I wouldnâ€™t have wanted it in the first place. Why should I stay when everyone wants me to go?
