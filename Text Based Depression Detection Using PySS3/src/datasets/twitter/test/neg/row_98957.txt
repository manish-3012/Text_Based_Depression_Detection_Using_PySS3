It is so hard to live.I am so broken.  I am too afraid to kill myself but I donâ€™t want to live.  My husband left me for someone else, on my birthday and I am just lost in grief.  

I am devastated.  I have lost all will to live.  I just exist.  I donâ€™t enjoy anything I used to love.  I barely eat.  I barely get out of bed.  I donâ€™t enjoy anything at all.  I watch tv just to try to down out the loneliness and silence.  I do work two days a week... and so far Iâ€™ve been going to work.  But I used to love my job and now I hate it.  It feels meaningless, Iâ€™m just going to avoid becoming homeless.  I am so overwhelmed with all the choices I have to make, and none of them have been easy.  

I feel like Iâ€™m on the verge of a breakdown.. and I have no safe space to land.  It feels like there isnâ€™t a place for me in the world.  Death feels like the only place that I belong.
