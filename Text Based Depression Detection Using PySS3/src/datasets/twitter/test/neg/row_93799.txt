please someone help me die. give me courage.im on a decline.

it started with depression.. and now im becoming paranoid, psychotic, and unfunctional. i dont wanna live with humiliation and delusion. i dont want to be institutionalized. i dont want to be like this.

i try to hang myself every day and a few times, i get really close to passing out. but my survival instincts kick in and i get terrified.i have no courage to resist. i have no courage to try any better methods and no access either. i want to just pop a pill and fall asleep and never wake up again. someone help me
