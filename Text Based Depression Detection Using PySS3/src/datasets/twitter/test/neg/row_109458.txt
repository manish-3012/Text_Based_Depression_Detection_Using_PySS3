I tried to kill myself last year.I posted this as a reply to someone. I felt like maybe I should share as it's own post as well because tonight isn't a very good night for me. Writing this was a little therapeutic because I haven't told the story before. 

I put a handful if pills in my stomach a little over a year ago. I asked my mom for something to help me sleep knowing she'd give me something quite powerful. She asked if I was OK and I lied. I told her I was just having trouble sleeping and it was starting to really affect me negatively. I went back home; I was living with friends at the time. I didn't want them to find me dead on the couch when they got up for work so I went for a long walk by the river. I was talking to my kids' mom the whole time, arguing mostly. I told her I was better off dead and that this would be the last time she'd talk to me. I said goodbye to the one person I wanted to say anything to. I put the whole bottle of pills in my mouth and swallowed them dry. It kinda hurt. I turned my phone off and threw the bottle in the tree line. I walked a while and I don't remember going back to the house. She called the police and they found me passed out on the front steps. I don't remember walking home, I don't remember turning my phone back on and typing jibberish and sending it. But I do remember a feeling of regret, but somehow an overwhelming sense of calm. I was afraid but I felt so ready. I woke up in a hospital bed with my mom next to me. Shortly after I got a barrage of questions from doctors. I tried to play it off like it was an accident but everyone knew, I know that. Here I am a little over a year later. The same problems I wanted to end my life over are still here, even more so. I think about that night everyday. I think about it more than once everyday. There's times I wanna try again, there's a lot of times I don't and I feel crazy for thinking it. I feel as low tonight as I did that night and I felt the need to share. I'm going to wake up tomorrow, you should to.
