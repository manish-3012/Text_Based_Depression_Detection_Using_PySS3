Actively Preventing Suicide ?I had a brief conversation with someone who I think is going to commit suicide. I made some arguments about how oblivion or hell is absolutely worse than whatever he's going through, but he wasn't convinced at all. We shook hands and at the end I told him it's his life and his choice ultimately.

The question is, should I have alerted the security personnel right next to us at once and prevent him from doing this ? (I reckon they'd take him into custody or something, I really don't know.) Is it even among my rights to forcefully prevent him from doing this ?
If we are not allowed to take another person's right to live, are we not also allowed to take their right to die ?

edit1: Just for clarification, this conversation wasn't an abstract and philosophical one; he really was emotional.
edit2: I did not know this person, this was a out of the blue conversation in public space.
