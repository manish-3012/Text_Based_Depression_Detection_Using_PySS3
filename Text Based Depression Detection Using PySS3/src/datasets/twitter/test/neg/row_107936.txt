I can't tell anyone else.I've been going through a great deal.  My boyfriend's health is in a major decline, a friend I help's gone straight downhill as well.  I'm always worried about them, always worried I'm going to wake up to a corpse or come and find one of them dead.

I feel like I'm always worrying, always taking care of them and doing everything I can beyond my best to make sure I have them, but I'm getting quickly to the point where I'm feeling like I'm a slave to their poor health.

I've tried talking to my b/f about his weight, tried and tried for years to get him to drop some.  Tried to get him to diet, tried to get him to exercise.  He remains close to 500 pounds.  I'm doing all the cooking, all the cleaning, all the shopping, helping with shoes and socks, helping him get around when his leg pain kicks back into full force.

I'm stretched too thin and I've neglected myself for so long, kept putting myself off over and over again, non stop.  I'm unhappy, miserable and I see no end in sight.  I don't have family I can go to, they disowned me after learning that I'm gay.  I don't really have many friends, none that I feel I can talk to or get help from.  I just don't seem to have any support for myself even after all this time of supporting others.

I've tried so hard to make everyone else around me happy while completely ignoring my own happiness.  Now the only thing so far that's been preventing me from exiting is copious amounts of posts from /r/watchpeopledie but now I'm starting to get extremely numb to it.  Now when I see it, I long for it.  I envy the people in those videos and images being murdered and killing themselves.

I feel I have nowhere else to turn, and having been helping these two so much and neglecting my own needs so much, I feel I don't have them to support me either.  I feel used.  I feel abused.

I haven't decided on how to die, nor when I could even do so.  I'm thinking a nice poison will do.  Preferably when I'm on my way to bed, so nobody will be wise to it until it's far too late.

I honestly just don't think the people I've been helping out so much and supporting so much really even care about me.  I've never felt such pain, I hurt.

I'm sorry for dumping this here, I honestly got no clue where else to turn and hoping, just hoping that I end up with some sympathetic ear.

Edit: I went out today and sought professional help for myself.  I now have a therapist I can talk to every week, not on any medicine at the time, but I at least feel better having a sympathetic ear that I can talk to and tell about my worries and open up.  I'm feeling better and safer.  Thanks for letting me vent here, I really needed it.
