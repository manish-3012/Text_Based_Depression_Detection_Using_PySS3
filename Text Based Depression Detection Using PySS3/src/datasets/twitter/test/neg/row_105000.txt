Suicidal thoughts have now turned into plans in 2020. Not because of just COVID and what it has done to society but more trauma and hardships.2020 will by far be the worst year of my life. Lost both of my jobs due to COVID found my dad lying on the floor lifeless from a disease he had suffered through for years having to decide whether he peacefully pass or resuscitate to let him suffer more. Yet decide to resuscitate him and let him suffer because I would not be able to handle the backlash and disownment of my family for letting him go. I gave up my education for my masters degree to take care of my father to only have a meaningless Bachelors degree. I had to decide whether my unborn daughter to live and my girlfriend to die because she has multiple autoimmune conditions to where she would not live after the birth of our daughter. Not only do the hardships of caring for my girlfriend she has had severe PTSD episodes to where I am holding her off from killing herself or harming me. To then having to send her to the hospital after holding her off resulting in concussions and multiple rib fractures each time leaving me to sob thinking I beat her. Not only did I love her unconditionally and wanted to build our relationship to marriage she decides to break her promises to leave because she canâ€™t handle our relationship. I no longer have friends or meaningful relationships because my father was my best friend and my other friends have their own lives too busy to be spending time with me nor care to invite me even when they do. My father now is in hospice waiting for his time to pass while Iâ€™m home alone with nothing but my trauma and heartache to sulk in with no hobbies to engage in due to COVID-19. My suicidal thoughts have now gotten to the point that I plan on ending my life after I pay off college debt so my family doesnâ€™t have the financial burden of paying the rest of it. Life is just too much and too meaningless for me.
