My organs should go to someone more deservingMy story is a long one, so I've decided to just list the facts:
-Have had OCD since childhood, went under the radar and only treated once I started college

-Now in 5th year of school. Already had to drop one semester and only completed 6 hours last semester

-My parents think I am registered for 14 hours and am graduating when really I am only in 3 hours (1 class)

-I'm finding it hard to do the little things like brush my teeth and I just feel like a piece of shit. How could I do this to my parents? TO MYSELF? 

-I wish so badly I could trade places with someone who wants to live and is dying. I've really messed this up and after so long, my heart is just not in it. My organs should go to someone worthy. 

-I have been given help and medication and support for the past 5 years yet I'm still unable to tell my parents the truth when they are paying for my school. They've done so much for me. They have asked me how everything is going maybe 100 times and I haven't spoken up.

-I can't tell them. It's killing me

-My psychologist thinks school just isn't for me, but I am so close to finishing and I go to an extremely good university. Any future I have, I do not want to not have my degree. 

-I feel like I have these bursts of happiness or feelings of normalcy followed by feeling PMS/extreme sadness. A good chunk of the time I am just neutral and don't care about much but eating, sleeping, and reading. I won't even change clothes.

-All I do is lay in my bed and read 

-I HATE using my stupid illness as a fucking excuse. I feel lazy and pathetic. Even when I have energy, I don't want to go outside and face the world. It's the strangest feeling. It's not like I'm depressed all the time. I'm perfectly happy reading my books

-At this point, what kind of future do I even have? Not a great one

-I've dug myself into a very deep hole and I don't know how to get out. I wish I could say I have tried, but I know I haven't

-Have already been hospitalized for one suicide attempt two years ago. My parents found me passed out before the drugs fully made it into my system

-I keep writing these stupid suicide notes to my parents and my sister. My sister is my best friend and I promised her to never do this again, but I can't live for her. Staying alive so they can be happy is not fair to me. It's not like I'm some joy (see above posts)

-I feel...resigned. Even more so than last time. Almost peaceful. But I keep looking at this stupid frame of me and my sister and I owe her to at least make my feelings known somewhere to someone to show some semblance of effort

-Have been so good at lying to my family, friends, and even myself. So even if I tried to address this, it will be a "not again" situation and will completely come out of left field. I will also look like a total compulsive liar.

TL;DR:-Friendships have been tarnished, grades down the shitter, lying to my family, financial burden, no bright future, and unless I'm laying in my bed with a book, I'm usually miserable and plagued with OCD shit that makes me so paranoid I have to take ativan to sleep. Basically have been pretending everything is fine and am aware of this fact, yet have done nothing or don't have a desire to fix it.
