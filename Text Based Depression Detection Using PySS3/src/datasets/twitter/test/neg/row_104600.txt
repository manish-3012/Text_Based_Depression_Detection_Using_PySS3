almost killed myself yesterday for no reasoni've not been happy recently, nor particularly unhappy, just quite neutral. i've got some really cool things coming up in the near future, all my relationships are going well, i'm spending this half of 2019 travelling through france. 

i was taking a walk through a really beautiful mountain range yesterday. i was the happiest i'd been in weeks. i came across a viaduct with a high fence blocking access to the sheer drop off either side of it, but there were gaps at each end that i could easily get through. i was completely fine, but something in me decided at that moment that i didn't have to carry on. i started to climb through one of the gaps with what felt like a completely clear and rational mind. i was half onto the ledge on the outer side of the fence when i heard a family coming down the path. i felt like it would be embarrassing for someone to see me climbing out, so i stopped. i got back behind the fence and continued my walk. i went back to the house i'm staying in and had a normal evening. today i've had a normal day. i've been thinking about self harm a lot, but other than that moment i haven't been even slightly close to suicide for years. it's not a big deal, but it feels stranger to not say anything about it at all. 

i don't know what responses i want from this.
