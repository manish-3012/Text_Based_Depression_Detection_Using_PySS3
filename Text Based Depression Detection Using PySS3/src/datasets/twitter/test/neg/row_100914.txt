From bad to worseSo I lost my job AGAIN. About to be homeless in less than a week, again. And just now, I've been busted by the cops because my vehicle is unregistered and I have no car insurance, so they're taking the old plate I was driving around on and now I won't even be able to drive to job interviews or a job IF I ever get one. 

The best part is how everybody's going to tell me that it's not that bad and all I have to do is get a bicycle or something. Is there a good reason not to just walk in front of a truck at this point? I've proven repeatedly that I am a complete failure at life.
