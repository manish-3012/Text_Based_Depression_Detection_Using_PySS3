Serious issues with feeling like a disappointment every time someone tells me they think I'm smart, but when I try to talk about it, I get told to stop worrying.   Basically, I somehow manage to sound really intelligent to teachers, who then put me in harder classes than I can manage despite my protests.  I don't want to be in these harder classes because they move at a faster pace than I'm comfortable with and it's hard for me to learn, but when teachers hear that they just assume I'm being shy/modest until it becomes obvious that I really do have trouble taking harder classes, by which point they tell me I've disappointed them.  This has happened so many times that every time someone calls me smart, I start to freak out thinking about how I'll inevitably disappoint them like I have so many others.  It's a bizarre problem, and one that makes me sound like I'm trying to humblebrag, but I need you to believe me when I say this shit is making it hard to keep living, because I now view myself as innately disappointing and every time I try to talk to someone about it they tell me some variation of "being smart is a good thing so don't take it so hard" or "clearly you actually are intelligent if this many people think so :)"  
  
  Why do people assume that just because my problem stems from something that society says is a good thing that somehow that gets rid of the consequences?  I'm dealing with real pain and problems as a result of these issues, but every time I try to bring them up people make it worse by telling me my problems shouldn't exist in the first place.  It's making me feel like life isn't worth trying to live through if I can't get help because my problems are too "special".
