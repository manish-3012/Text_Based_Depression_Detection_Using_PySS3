my mom and my brother keep me aliveif it werenâ€™t for my little brother And mom i would have killed myself ages ago i canâ€™t bear the thought of either them in pain since i honestly believe that they love me unlike anyone else in my life i only continue so that they donâ€™t have to suffer itâ€™s almost as if there saving my life in a way everyday i wake up i live in a cycle of eternal sadness and boredom no one cares for me  iâ€™ll never have true love and in all honesty iâ€™m a useless person i contribute nothing to society iâ€™m tired of life but i canâ€™t bring myself to do it soley because of them
