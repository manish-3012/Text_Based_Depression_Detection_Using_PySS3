Have any tips to distract yourself?For the past few months Iâ€™ve had this strong sense that Iâ€™m not meant to exist anymore. Iâ€™ve made a lot of mistakes in my life and itâ€™s become clear that Iâ€™ve sort of backed myself into a corner. Every day feels incredibly difficult. Iâ€™m also nearing the age that my mother killed herself at, and I feel a strong sense that she and I werenâ€™t meant for this world. I have responsibilities though and not sure how to reconcile this strong feeling with them. Is there any tips on how to stop this feeling or distract yourself? Iâ€™m scared to tell a professional about this. Iâ€™ve never posted about this before and it took me weeks to work the small courage up to write this so thank you for reading.
