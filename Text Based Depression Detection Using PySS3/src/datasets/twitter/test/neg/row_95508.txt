I can't decide what to do. Is it normal to go from "yest I must end this" to "I can hang on" in a span of 2 minutes?Lately I have been collapsing in a heap of tears and terror because I absolutely cannot imagine existing, only to recover in a minute. I have struggled with depression but never told I was in danger by a professional. My suicidal thoughts only last from a range of 30 to 45 seconds. On one hand i think it is serious but on the other it is brief. Yeah, it is intense, but it's so short I worry that asking for help makes me look ridiculous. Do I need help? Is this something I should bring up with my biweekly counselor? Should I call 911 next time it happens?
