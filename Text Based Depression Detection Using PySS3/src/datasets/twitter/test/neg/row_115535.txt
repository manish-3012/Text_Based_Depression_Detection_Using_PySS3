I don't even know what to say other than I just tried to cut my wrists and failed but I'm still thinking about trying again tomorrow.Hi.

So.

Uh..

Okay. This is going to be a lot.

So I won't say my name, but I will say that I have always been "a fuck up" for my whole life.

I'm forgetful. I'm clumsy. I'm overly sensitive. I get jealous of others easily. I have a lot of self-esteem issues. I am oblivious to things others find obvious. I ruin long term relationships of pretty much any kind. I procrastinate. I can't stick to my own plans for myself. And now I just got fired from a great job I loved that pays better than any other job I've had except maybe the army if you include the benefits.

I'm 30 years old. I live with my father as of 3 months ago because of financial reasons that I did to myself. I cant go back to school because my loans are defaulted because I ignored them the LAST time I was in a dark place. I can't commute easily because theres very little for public transportation where I live and i dont have a car yet. I have no boyfriend or girlfriend. No friends that I regularly talk to. And I just generally feel like a fucking failure.

I feel like no matter how much i try i will never be good enough and I'm so exhausted of my own shortcomings.

I just want to die already so I can be at peace. 

I'm going to root around in the medicine cabinet at home tomorrow and see if I can find something that looks like it might kill me if I just take the whole bottle. 

Maybe I'll just take everything we have here.

Idk.

I just know that I'm fucking sick of this bullshit life. Why am I like this? What the fuck?
