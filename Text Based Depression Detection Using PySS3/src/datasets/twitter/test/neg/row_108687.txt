Iâ€™m not sure how to startI had somewhat of a trouble childhood, body issues, self worth issues, Iâ€™m sure like most people experience. Iâ€™ve thought about suicide on n off thru out my life. Iâ€™m been in bad relationships n had bad moments/ difficult moments thru out my life.. so I donâ€™t want to share too much this time but I fell in love with a guy I went to school with, when I moved back to my hometown a few years ago.. heâ€™s great n I fell hard. 

Unfortunately, my past relationship had been haunting me for years, ruining my future relationships. His name is Justin n I knew going in that it was going to be complicated. We reconnected in September 2017- Snapchat, Facebook, texting. February 10th I got pregnant n without giving too many details, we had to end what we had n the safest option we had was an abortion. I literally feel like Iâ€™m dying.. Iâ€™ve never been in love before n with my past ( mental health-suicide-cutting) Iâ€™m having a difficult time. Iâ€™m in so much pain.. and I know this will pass, more fish in the sea (all the positive-move on with your life type stuff) but they arenâ€™t him. And after this (unwanted) abortion, my world is crashing down around me. 

Justin is still messaging n I love him so much n it hurts knowing this has ended.. he has been supportive but Iâ€™m still completely devastated..
