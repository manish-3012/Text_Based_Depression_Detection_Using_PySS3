I failed himI failed someone I loved. I basically ghosted him. He pushed me to do better and all I did was run away. He told me that he felt like a hobby rather than a person than the end of our friendship. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had told him I'd never abandon him when we started talking. And then I did. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I asked him if he wanted to try again, he took a few days before telling me he didn't wanna try again. That maybe one day we would but not now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't believe it'll be the case. 

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm worse off than I was. I take less care of myself, I do almost nothing all day and really, I don't even know if this is because of everything with my friend or just because I am the way I am.

&amp;#x200B;

All I really wanted to do as I got older was destroy myself for "being evil" and now I can at least see how selfish I am and how I can't really seem to get out of this cycle of selfishness and laziness. 

&amp;#x200B;

I  keep wanting to die and hoping that everyone would be okay if I did die. Maybe better than okay. I want to slit my throat. I want to stop existing. Yes, I have good days. But on the whole I want to die. Or at least not be anymore. And since this happened with my friend, I've only wanted to hurt myself more. 

&amp;#x200B;

He let go of me because I abandoned him. And it's kind of driving me insane. I know it was my behavior that brought me here. I know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know. I want to punish myself before disappearing. At least I think I do.
