I wish I was happyI wish I was more useful. I wish I was smart without having to work for it. I wish I was good looking. I wish I was funny. I was I was interesting. I wish I had friends. I wish I had confidence. I wish I was loved and loved back. I wish I was lovable. I wish I had a good family. I was I could help people on this subreddit that need it. I wish I had the knowledge to help. I wish I was rich. I wish I was well-known. I wish I had hobbies. I wish I was tall, well-endowed and handsome. I wish people wanted to be with around me. I wish school was easy. I wish I wasn't alone. I wish I never needed help. I wish I was happy.

Actually... scratch all of the above. I wish I never was born. Why was I created? I don't want to be here. Now I'm scared of death and scared of life. Why do people keep multiplying? Why keep this cycle going? I wish I was never born. It was so much better before when I didn't exist. Despite the lies people telling themselves, in life suffering is guarantied while happiness is never.
