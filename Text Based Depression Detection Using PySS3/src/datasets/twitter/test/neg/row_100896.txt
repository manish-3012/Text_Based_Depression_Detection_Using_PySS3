I'll just end itI had my second recover recently, another psychotic break. I'm on latuda, en, triazolam and akineton right now. My parents always says that I will die from my meds and im afraid of that. At the same time I'm tired of struggling. I suffer with bpd but my psychiatrist says he doesn't want to label me. But how can I feel better without a diagnosis?

I'm being followed by the public service. Saw 4 private therapists and did nothing. I do like my new public therapist and my psychiatrist even tho he's not perfect. He prescribed me latuda without telling me I need to take it with almost 300 calories.

The point of this post is that I've lost all my dreams. Wanted to help people and studied to become a social worker but now I don't like it anymore. Wasted 3 years of study then??? I feel like I'm a burden and people hate me even my psych, when I call him I always say I'm sorry for bothering you.

I have a bad flu right now and it's making me feel depressed maybe that's why I feel hopeless right now. I always have images where I jump from the bridge. I think if I get stuck, without work, I'll end my life in that bridge I know that it's famous for suicides. Could it be the antipsychotic tho and its side effects. I can barely eat bc I feel nausea.

I don't know how can I function in society, with a job? My therapist mentioned volunteering and I'm waiting to start but I'm afraid I'll be the only one crazy there. Afraid of messing up. What if I experience crisis there? Or I get really anxious? They will think im not productive (my parents told me that they will ask me to leave).

No one is helping me my parents always tell me to stop the meds cold turkey but I can't bc I want to listen to my psych! They say I'll die in 3 years due to damages probably the liver.
