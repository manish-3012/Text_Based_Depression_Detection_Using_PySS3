AloneIâ€™m so tired of being alive. I hate my life. Iâ€™m never happy. The worst part is I canâ€™t even talk to anyone about it. My family and friends would just stress the fuck out and throw me in a hospital. I just want to be heard while being trusted to not hurt myself. Fuck, Iâ€™m tired. I donâ€™t even have a reason to be tired.
