I only have to be here for another 8 years.I am going to kill myself at age 30. I've been wanting to die for as long as I can remember. I'm not even depressed anymore honestly. I know what choice I am making.

Jokes aside, I'm pretty sure my parents dropped me on my head when I was younger or something. I've had extreme short term memory loss since I was a kid and its seem to get worse, I'm 22 now. I grew up with a learning disability (ADHD) and I'm honestly just a fucking retard, I've always felt different than everyone and I knew something was wrong with me. I don't want to live like this. I've talked to people about my thoughts before and they've given me the best advice they can give me but nothing works.

Short term memory loss and a learning disability have rendered me quite useless at times and I'm just done, I gave up a long time ago. My mom was my best friend growing up and I watched her die at the age of 13 so death is desensitizing to me. After that I got into smoking weed and drinking lots of alcohol and that was definitely detrimental to my brain and mental health. 

I have a few good people in my life that care about me, so this is going to shock them when I do it. I got a few years left, so I'll just keep this up until then.

Why am I going to leave at 30? Idk, thats your prime so ill go out with a bang, I've had a detailed plan that ive played in my head over and over.. I plan to hurt no one besides myself.  Everyone I've met has realized my memory is fucked, its so bad I can't remember how to do things I've just done and adding on my ADHD and learning disability makes it worse.

I've talked to a few friends about me killing myself years ago and although they think im better they have no idea that I never changed my mind.
