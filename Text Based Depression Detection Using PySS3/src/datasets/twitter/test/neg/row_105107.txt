Iâ€™ve fallen apart in two years and now Iâ€™m ready to die but Iâ€™m only 20Things went south when the girl I love decided she didnâ€™t wanna be friends with me anymore. That made me lose all my confidence and then I lost most of my friends and now Iâ€™m an alcoholic. Iâ€™m gonna keep drinking every night until I hopefully die because I canâ€™t live without the girl I love. I messed up my whole life and now Iâ€™m ready to drink myself into death
