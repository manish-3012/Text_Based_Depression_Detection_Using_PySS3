I think I won't make pass todayI can't even start to explain all that is wrong and all that makes this pain inside me grows, but I can tell that I'm alone. I don't belive in the future, and I hate the pass. the present just gives me anxiety and depression, and the worse pain I have ever felt. 

I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think and even breathing is hard, ia like someone is already with their and on my neck making harder and painful to try to just stay alive. 

My pain come from being alive, and I'm more convinced by it then ever before. 

I just want the pain to go away for good, I don't want more promises, more work, more expectations or trying.  I have done all, things that they told me that would work, things that I shouldn't have done, things that I didn't wanted to do and things that I thought I wanted or need to do to be happy and better.

So I don't know what is going to happen, I just know that I need to kill this tha lives inside me since I know myself. I'm not living, I'm staying alive for the pain to consume me everyday. So there is no point more
