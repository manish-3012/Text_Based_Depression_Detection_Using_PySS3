Don't even know why I'm on here.You've probably read posts like this thousands of times but I don't fucking know. I'm a dead soul. It's getting worse, my 'depression'. Why am I even on here? It's like I'm expecting this to magically fix everything. Oh yeah, hi, I'm 17 years old. 
   
I've been told I'm depressed, I've been diagnosed with depression, I don't believe that horse shit. I'm a sad excuse for a human who can't take anything for granted. 
This morning I stood next to the highway near my house and just looked at the cars racing by, how nice it would be. This morning I put a blade to my wrist in the shower, I was *this* close. Instead I just cut the letter F into my hand and arms because I'm a failure.   
  
This is going to sound like one of those shitty 'my girlfriend ____'. But please, this only adds to my depression. I wish I never met her for her own sake. I met a very cute and smart girl online and I thought my depression would vanish. We talk for hours and hours. But last night I couldn't take it, I cried through skype and she just watched. I feel a pit in my stomach. I don't deserve her. She doesn't need me. I'm just going to bring her down with me. She's funny and laughs a lot, why would anyone want me? Everyday I think about talking to her after school. I think about how she's wasting her time with me. I think about how she loves something with an empty soul. She tells me I'm handsome and cute. I'm never going to get anywhere in life but she still loves me *so* much.  
  
I tried getting help online and talked to someone for two hours. They tried to help me. At the end they said "I'm not going to talk later with you. Have a good life." and left. Fucking left me. I was destroyed.   
  
I don't know what's wrong. I can't see the light in anything. I want to be alone in a dark room forever. I'm about to break.
