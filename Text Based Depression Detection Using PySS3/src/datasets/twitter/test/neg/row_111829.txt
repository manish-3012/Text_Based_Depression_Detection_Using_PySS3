I know how I'll do it too :~)There's one bit I havent figured out yet and its how I tie something heavy to myself.  But I could take a raft out to the pontoon close to where I live, load a big rock or mass of bricks or anything - and then jump off.  I'll suffer too, which I deserve.  I feel so weird because sometimes I'm fine and then there are times like this where it's SO CLEAR all I need to do is go kill myself.  I need to.  It's not voices in my head it's my own drive but it comes out of nowhere.  I haven't fully listened yet - but fuck.  It's SO SO SO loud and the drive is so strong.  I'm medicated for depression which is good and bad - good because im not 24/7 suicidal, bad because I can't predict my drops anymore.  It feels like I'm having a heart attack and the only thing that will stop it is dying, but life's not bad?  I don't need to die?
