family hates me, never work once, virgin, never had a friend, never finish high school.I'm a 21 years old French Canadian, I never had a good life and I have enough of it.

From the age of 3 to 7, I was beaten up by my father until my mom and brother manage to run away with me

From 7 to 10, I was a problem child quick to anger, because of that I've never been able to make a friend and I was put into a class for "semi-mental" people, I had never been able to cop out with the life I had with my father at this age.

From 10 to 18, I was taken by the children social service because I wanted to kill myself, my high school life was filled with bullies(not the one who only insult you) and adult telling me I was a liar and I act depressed to be the center of attention. I've never been able to finish high school because the "semi-mental" class delay me from 1 years in my study, even if I was the top of the class in all subject by a large margin even with my short attention span, the direction never accept my request to skip a year. I've never been able to make friends because bullies keep making false rumor about me.

From 18 to 20, I've been put into an "assist" apartment for mental people because I was still heavily depressed. I got out of it with the help of my mom and live with her now.

Now, I don't have a good relationship with my mother anymore because my depression makes me unmotivated to finish my studies or look for a job.

All my life I've been rejected and I have enough of it.
