i just had a breakdown and have no to talk toitâ€™s currently 4am and i have no one to tell that i looked all throughout my room for pills so i can overdose. i didnâ€™t even have anything high enough to hang myself. i wanted to cut myself so bad, on my thigh where no one would see. i feel like iâ€™m on fire, i want to peel my skin off. it all started with me having a panic attack about school then morphed into something bigger. i donâ€™t know what the fuck to do. how do i stop this? this is too much. i canâ€™t handle this.
