Iâ€™m only alive because Iâ€™m too scared to kill myself. I just want it to be over and Iâ€™m way too scared to use any of the methods available to me.I just feel like Iâ€™m being tormented by life. Iâ€™m unable to be happy. Iâ€™m unable to enjoy anything. I cannot be in relationships and my life feels like a prison.
