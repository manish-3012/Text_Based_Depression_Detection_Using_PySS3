Never ending dreadEven when I was a little kid I remember dreading going to school everyday because I didnâ€™t want to go to a place full of strangers/bullies doing boring shit all day. Yay that sounds like so much fun right? I would get this intense nervousness in the mornings when my parents dropped me off, but as my day went on it would only get worse because at school, I felt like Iâ€™m always on guard mostly from bullies and bullshit.

Fast forward to now, itâ€™s still exactly the same. When I have to go to college/work itâ€™s the same dread that has always followed me and I would say it has intensified even more because not only do you have to deal with the bullshit from grade school, the stakes are waaay higher so if you fuck up itâ€™s a painful fall into chaos. I will always hate work and school because to me there is nothing good about these things. Youâ€™re just a fucking little slave and nothingâ€™s changed throughout your life. And the fact that society will let you die in the streets if you donâ€™t want to live a humiliating existence of wage cucking really shows how vile society is. Why the fuck are we still playing by the rules of the jungle when it comes to survival? Everyone deserves at least the basic necessities of life if youâ€™re going to give birth to people without their consent or. Shit seriously needs to change because at this rate I donâ€™t even want to think about the future at all.
