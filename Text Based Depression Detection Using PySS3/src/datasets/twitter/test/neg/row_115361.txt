I'm so tired of depression taking from me.I used to feel so satisfied when I'd improve in writing or drawing. I remember posting my horror short stories to r/nosleep and seeing them gain popularity and feeling validated. I used to love rubbing my fingers across the ink lines on my paper and thinking "I made this" and feeling so good. I chase these feelings everyday but they feel farther and farther away everytime I try.

I used to be really really witty. I remember I could spit out a pun or ad lib some bat shit story that would have the people around me doubled over in laughter, me included. I loved bringing a smile to everyone's faces. Now I can barely formulate a sentence, and my mind feels like it's in a permanent fog. I feel retarded. 

I used to feel intensely all the time. My highs were high and my lows were low and they both felt beautiful in a way. Laughter and crying didn't just feel like something I did it felt like a spiritual experience that enriched me. Now I feel nothing most of the time. When I do feel something it's feels hollow and meaningless and it's gone and forgotten before it even settles in.

This illness is taking everything from me and I hate it. I want to bang my head against a wall until I'm retarded so I don't have to think anymore. Living feels like a chore, even worse it feels like a chore that I don't have to do. If it wasn't for family I would have gone away a long time ago. How do I get out of this?
