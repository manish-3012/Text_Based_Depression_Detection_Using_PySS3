Thinking about jumping off a bridgeBeen feeling for years to kill myself but now that Iâ€™m 19 the hardships of adulthood really hit me (plus this pandemic) and I really just want to die. I have shut myself off from everyone and the thought of dying and not feeling the pain of living is the only thing that comforts me.
