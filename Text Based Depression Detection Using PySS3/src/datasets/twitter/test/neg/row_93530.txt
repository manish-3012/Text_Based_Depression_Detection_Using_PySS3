Why should i keep pushing? Just why?I just can't anymore, my friend that been supporting me to this very moment, she is really kind and I am sorry for what I am about to say but I just don't see the point why shouldn't I just kill myself. I am giving up I just can't bear this anymore. The pressure is too much and I am just so tired of trying over and over and over again. Whatever I do whoever I try to ask nothing will happen. I just don't really see the point why should I keep pushing and keep trying. I haven't slept in days, didn't eat or just did anything productive like homework I have to do. I just don't really see the point right now. Why? Please tell me why? Why?! Nobody cares! My family doesn't I care! I don't have any friends! I am all alone in this! Why am I the only one that suffers! I am always the blamed one! Just... WHY. Nobody can help me. 

I am all alone in this deep shit. 
I have no idea what to do next in my life. There is no point no reason nothing matters we all are going to die so why to live in the first place?

I am sorry
