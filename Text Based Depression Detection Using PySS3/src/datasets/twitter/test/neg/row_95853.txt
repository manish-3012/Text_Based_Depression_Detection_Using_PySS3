When I was 17 I was confident, smart and funnyThree years later and I am completely the opposite; scared, anxious, slow, quiet, weak, suicidal. A drug addict and an alcoholic. A rape victim. There is nothing left of the person I once was, I watched my ideal self burn until there was nothing left but a fragile shell. I don't even look the same. I try so hard in school, socially, and to improve myself. But I am shut down and fail every single time either by my own fault or by something I can't control. I  pills so I can OD, I can't see the storm settle anytime soon. 

My 17 year old self was so carefree and cool about everything, I thought I was going to be that way forever. She loved attention and the spotlight but now I just try my best to disappear. I wish, I wish I could be that girl again. I wish she could walk through the door and say "I'm back! 20 year old itsdolan can leave now, I'll take it from here :)".

Instead I'm stuck being someone I hate down to my very core. There is nothing left of me worth saving. I feel completely worthless.
