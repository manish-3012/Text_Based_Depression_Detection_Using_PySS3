I think its timeI post on here a lot

I know, I say I want to do it a lot

But I reached out those times because I didnt want to, I had something to look forward to.

I thought by posting on here I'd come across another reason to live

Maybe the kind strangers that check up on me

The guy who messaged me about his fat cat to distract me

Or maybe even the girl that just talked about how much she loves her girlfriend 

Those became reasons for a while but they slowly faded

I looked forward to homecoming, sure I knew my "friends" wouldnt make plans with me. And I knew the one that did would cancel. I looked forward to just wearing this beautiful dress, I even thought it made me look beautiful. I got told today not to go, that people dont wanna see my ugly face there, someone saying if i go they'll beat my ass..

I have this teacher mom, and she is great, but I realize as time goes on, its gonna be very toxic if I rely on someone that will only be in my life for 2 more years to feel some sort of happiness. 

I should just get it over, no one cares for me, not even my friends, and I doubt my family does. They will all laugh together, but when I enter the room its silent

I bet they wouldnt notice if I hung myself tonight until like 3 in the afternoon tomorrow
