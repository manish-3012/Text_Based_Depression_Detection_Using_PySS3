Can a victim of sexual abuse ever fully recover?(Posted on a depression sub and got no advice)          
(16f) I fear everything. My boyfriend gets upset when he cant touch me at all. Due to ptsd. Every noise makes me tremble. And i always think that something bad will happen. I feel like ive been through so much i can just turn my numb button on. How i am now affects all my relationships with people. Even if im sitting in a car too long i get so scared someone will hurt me or do something that i always have to be aware of my surroundings. If you might get triggered by sexual abuse, i strongly suggest to not read the rest. Not going to go into a lot of details but about a year ago, i was sex trafficked. I always seen girls on the tv and thought it was 1 in a million and could never happen to me. Until it did. And when it did i became aware of how big it actually is and how often it happens. After i had managed to escape last may, i was in impatient hospital care for 2 months to help with the ptsd but i dont feel as anything worked. My parents didnt know how to react so they werent as close then. I dont blame them because i feel like no one is going to know exactly how to react in a situation like mine. I dont feel like i could ever be in a relationship because the guys I've been with after couldnt understand or even try to understand when id jump or flinch or tremble when theyd even touch my arm or anything. I dont like being touched anymore. I dont like going out. I have no friends because i just have periods where i dont talk to anyone for long periods of time. And going to court is scary. I have to go again soon and face my perpetrator. Sometimes i want to run far away so i will never have to see him again. I just wish i can live like a normal 16 year old girl who likes to hang out with friends and go out. I dont want to be like this when i get older and start a family. I dont want my future kids to fear the world like i do. And the people in it.
