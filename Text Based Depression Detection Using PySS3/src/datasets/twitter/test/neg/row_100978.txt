I just want to feel something.I feel as though I'm numb. I don't feel sad or angry.. happy or anxious. I don't love, I don't hate. 
I cut myself everywhere from my wrists to my stomach to my thighs. I've cut veins and cut so deep I needed stitches. 
I want to feel something.. 

I can't stand this feeling.
