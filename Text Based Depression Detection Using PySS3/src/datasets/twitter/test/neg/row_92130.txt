Serotonin/alcohol overdose a good way to go?Hey, I was thinking if overdosing on Sertraline, Venlafaxin and Quetiapine would kill me. About 50 tablets of Sertraline and 100 of the others is what I have. Also I would drink heavily at the same time.

Will this be fatal? I donâ€™t want to suffer non-lethal damage.

I dont know if this is the right place to post, sorry :(
