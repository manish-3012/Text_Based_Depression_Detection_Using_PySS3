I'm at the point again where I have everything planned...... and honestly not much is holding me back. 

I live at the perfect place with around 15 floors it would be a long enough fall to definitely do it's job.

And with the lockdown I'll be able to sort my things without being too noticeable. 

A few walks around the block to throw stuff I don't want to be found un random trashbins and a few hours to mostly delete or make my internet persona inaccessible. Other things can just go into the house trash.

I want to make sure what I leave, (which is precious in any way) is secured. Give it to whoever would like it most and my left over money I'm going to use to ensure my pets will be taken care of. At least until the person looking after them can give them away. 

Otherwise there isn't much to do. No letter to write, no need to explain.

I just want the pain I feel to stop. The feeling of being trapped to go away. The feeling that the situation won't change and that life won't last long anyway to subside.

I can't think straight. I feel disgusting. 

Maybe I'd leave a note that I want to be cremated and don't want a grave or funeral. It seems to be far to useless.
