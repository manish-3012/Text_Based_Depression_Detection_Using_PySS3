I feel so uselessduring the quarantine two of my friends started studying so hard, and now they're so close and debating art theories, cinema, photography and I just doing some stupid things, like listening to music all day, sometimes I watch some movies they watched months ago. gosh they're buying important art books and I'm so shy to ask one of them to my mom. we study art at college.
and I started to think that I will never be able to get a job, be able to pay my bills, buy a house, etc
sometimes I want to kill myself for being so lazy and useless
I like to imagine that in the future I'll find something that'll make me happy and rich, but it's almost, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
if my parents find my dead corpse they'll say I was weak and dramatic... I don't know what to do...
