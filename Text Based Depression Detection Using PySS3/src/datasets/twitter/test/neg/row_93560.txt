I'm just plain lostI don't know why I can't do it.

I've gone to counseling of the bat

I struggle with my identity I feel homeless and lost not accepted anywhere. Raised on my parents second language. Struggled to make close friends and keep them. Struggled to get into uni. Struggled to maintain the sports in good at.

Yet I'm wondering why it's even worth it just to have a good life? What is a good life? What does it all mean once you for? It all goes away poof like that meaningless. So why don't I leave
