Does minocycline cause suicidal thoughts??I've been feeling really really suicidal lately, my mind just keeps going back to the thoughts of "you're such a burden on everyone and everything, everyone would be better off without you" 

My life is still the same ish, just more stress that's kinda caused by those thoughts, leading me to have 0 motivation for schoolwork, but it's the same normal life I've had.  Maybe these thoughts are because of these minocycline pills I've been regularly taking for acne since around december?
