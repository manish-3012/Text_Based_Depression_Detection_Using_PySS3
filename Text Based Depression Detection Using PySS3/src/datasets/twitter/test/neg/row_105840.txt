I'm losing the track of why I shouldn'tLife is just an endless series of tearing your corpse out of bed every morning, only to spend the day doing stupid shit you don't want to do, then going home to do more stupid shit you don't want to do, just waiting for it to either be late enough to get drunk or for your sleeping pills to kick in and pass out, only to do it again tomorrow.

for decades on end.

why? why do I have to? whom do I owe that to? Why should I?
