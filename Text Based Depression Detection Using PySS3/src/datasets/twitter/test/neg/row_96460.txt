Lost everythingI had everything you could ask for this past year.  I based my career on a rule and moved halfway across the country to do internationally impactful medical research.  I was patient and took my time to make sure I was prepared for success.  The problem is, a policy change made it nearly impossible for me to succeed.  I spent four years of my life based on this policy and I was on my path towards becoming a doctor.  I left everything to pursue this.

I had a perfect career path, beautiful girlfriend, great reputation, and was on my way to completing all of my dreams.  I was one step from success but I quit and now I have no chance of getting it back.  I have 100,000 in debt, no job available, and I'm in an impossible situation.  The rest of my cohort has gone on to medical school, and I'm 28 and stuck in my parents house settling.  I had everything I wanted but I lost it.

I moved halfway across the country with no research experience and ended up in a position where I was breeding rats for brain surgery and subsequently decapitating them.  I went from an immensely happy individual with emergency services experience to a sociopath breeding and killing animals in the middle of nowhere.  All for a paid masters degree that would have led me to medical school.  My classmates projects entailed growing cells in petri dishes while I'm doing intense brain work with lab animals.  

I left everything to go back to school and this policy eliminated absolutely any chance of success.  I'm so depressed and dysfunctional.  I was a chubby kid growing up and had worked myself into a six-pack, great grades, and the world at my feet.

All of that until someone changed a rule with no warning.  I have constant thoughts of suicide.  I was removed from my program for mental health and all that did was make it worse.  I can't think anymore.  I'm trapped in the past because my dreams were taken from me.

I just wish there was something to blame.  A sickness that took everything from me, or an accident.  But its simply that a policy was changed and destroyed my career.  I was the happiest asshole on the planet, now I'm so depressed I can't function. I lost my job, girlfriend, reputation, career, and I'm now in immense debt.  

I want to live, but I want my dreams back.  I want my health back.  I am in a program to complete a lesser version of my prior goals, but its settling for less and I'm so depressed that I can't think.  My performance is great, but I'm so alone I can't focus.  My depression makes no one want to be around me.  

Throughout my life, I've become bilingual, saved lives, built houses, and held just about every job looking for my purpose.  I found my purpose and had it taken from me.  I was in love with who I was.  Now, because someone changed a rule, I can't function.  I was in a master's program performing well until this rule was changed.  I started having meltdowns and my mental health caused me to burn bridges.  Ultimately led to suicidal thoughts that had me removed from the program.  I hastily went to another program without seeking proper treatment and the new program is incredibly stressful.  People are failing out left and right.  Basically the hunger games version of academics.  To put the cherry on the cake, there is a discrepancy on my application that could lead to rejection.

I'm paranoid someone is out to fuck me over, I'm in debt, and I'm in a furnace of stress.  I want out, and in today's world it seems like the only way out is suicide.  The memories, the what-ifs, the what should-have-beens, are all destroying me.  Its the first thing I think about when I wake up, and I cannot produce anything aside from ruminating.  

I'm dead inside and I feel like a joke.  I had everything, and I lost it all.  I had my career ruined by someone changing a rule.  I'd love to go do something else, but 100,000 of debt doesn't really permit it.  I have no emergency fund.  I have multiple plans of suicide.  I'm immensely ashamed of myself.  I basically got fucked because I tried to be patient and it cost me everything.  I'm a quitter now.
