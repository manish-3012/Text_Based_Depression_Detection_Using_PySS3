Everything hurts.Not just mentally, but physically, too. I want it to end. 

I'm pushing people away. They do not want to hear it anymore. I can't say that I blamed them. And now I've pushed them all away because I cant take care of myself. 

I was never meant for anything. I lived to die. What a waste my life has been.
