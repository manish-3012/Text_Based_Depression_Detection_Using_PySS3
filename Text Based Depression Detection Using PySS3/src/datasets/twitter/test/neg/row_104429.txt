You know that feeling when you are sure itâ€™s time? The deep pain in your chest?You know that feeling deep in your chest when you are suicidal? The one that tells you for sure this is the right decision and every time you breath it happens? I have that. Iâ€™m ready. My deep pain and sadness is manifesting in this deep feeling in my chest that itâ€™s my time. Every time I get this I try to commit suicide and fail. I canâ€™t fail this time. I have to die I canâ€™t go back to another psych ward. Iâ€™m ready to go. Please donâ€™t tell me not to. I hope the method I have chosen is fool proof because I am in so much pain I canâ€™t keep doing this. I was holding out original for aug 2nd and made it but a breakup and having no one at all now really fucked me up. I realized my soulmate is married my life is in the ground and I canâ€™t continue to entertain the chronic pain I am in. I just hope this time is it.
