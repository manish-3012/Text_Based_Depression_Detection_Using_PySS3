Lost at 28, hate what I studdied as a carreer, have no interests or goalsLately I have thought a lot about the past. I dreamt my sister was little again, huged her a lot. Woke feeling good, in the middle of the night. Lately I have thought about not existing anymore. Since I was little, knowing that someone had commited suicide "hurted" me a lot, I felt really bad for those people. Now I think its becouse I knew thats how I'm leaving too. I have been sleeping a lot, 12+ hours daily. I feel too exhausted to go swimming, but I have pushed myself to keep going. Now I kinda hate going. Nothing interests me. I feel I need to grow up.
