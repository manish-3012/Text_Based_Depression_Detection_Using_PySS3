The idea of waking up every day is sickeningI end up staying up until the crack of dawn almost every night because I canâ€™t stand the idea of waking up. When Iâ€™m not at work I canâ€™t bring myself to do almost anything other than rot in bed and prefer sleeping the day away. 

I just want these feelings to go away.
