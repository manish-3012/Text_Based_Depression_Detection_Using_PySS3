Being busy to distract myselfa few facts:

* have been more or less planning a copycat suicide of sorts since about 2016
* i'm heavily involved in activities throughout the year but i still have thoughts of wanting to end my life and self harm in my spare time
* i'm giving myself until i turn 21 or maybe graduate art school
* a big part of it stems from the anxiety that i won't be able to do anything with an art degree. i'm a writer and an illustration major so i feel those career paths are too competitive given my low self-confidence
