My son died on Friday and my husband left me on Sundayread post history if you feel so obliged. 

if my husband doesnâ€™t respond today or refuses to meet, i can keep persisting.

if he agrees to meet and he doesnâ€™t change his mind, iâ€™m going to end it. not sure how, but itâ€™s not the first time iâ€™ve attempted and iâ€™ll make sure that this time will work. i want to show him and i donâ€™t want to live in a world without him. i can join my son too. 

if he agrees to meet and he changes his mind and stays with me, my faith will be restored. iâ€™ll be able to heal. i canâ€™t go through losing my baby and my husband in one week. thatâ€™s too much a person to handle. so yeah. 

if any friends or family members look at this later, iâ€™m sorry. i just couldnâ€™t do it and i needed to be with my son.
