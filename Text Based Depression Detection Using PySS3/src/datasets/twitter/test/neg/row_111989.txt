I relapsed today after not cutting for a yearToday I lost my mind and slipped up... i cut myself after being clean for so long. iâ€™ve been trying so hard to leave that part behind me but today ? i just couldnâ€™t help it anymore. i have a knife collection as well cause i really like pretty knifes so the temptation was knocking. iâ€™m in a toxic ass relationship and we got into a really bad argument over something pretty serious... and i just broke..ik itâ€™s my fault cause i have a collection and i shouldnâ€™t have picked it up but i just wanted to focus my pain elsewhere. my boyfriend loves me and i love him but we both know weâ€™re not good for each other and after today i think iâ€™m finally ready to admit that. i felt so terrible after. it hurt and i couldnâ€™t believe i used to do it so much deeper back then. i thought it would had helped the pain in my chest in some weird way like it used to but it didnâ€™t...now i feel even worse cause i canâ€™t even keep a non-cutting streak. this is my 5th time starting the streak over. iâ€™m starting to wonder why i even keep trying
