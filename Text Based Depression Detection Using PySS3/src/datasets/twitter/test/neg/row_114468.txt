Feeling lostI feel as if I reached a point where my life is no longer worth living. I say that because I deal with so many things that are just not in my control and I have such little moral support I am grateful for people such as my daughter, mother, father, sister and a few people I vaguely know who tag me in memes on Facebook too boost my self esteem. But overall my Hopes/dreams have crumbled in front of me and now I'm left with an unfillable void that's far too heavy too carry. I havnt had "a good day" in over a year and I just want too escape. The only time I feel "ok" or life becomes tolerable is when I'm fucked up matter fact let me take that back it only works 50% of the time. Not too mention I have too do it in secrecy so I'm not hated amongst all. Honestly I've fucked my reality up so much that the only thing my conciousness wants too do is escape it. I used too enjoy life and wake up smiling with Hope's &amp; dreams but end of the day you only get one soul and I didnt take good enough care of mine.
