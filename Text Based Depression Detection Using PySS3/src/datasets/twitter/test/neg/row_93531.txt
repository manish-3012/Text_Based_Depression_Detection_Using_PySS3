I'm sorry I just don't really have any to talk to about this.I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for the past 6 years. My self esteem has been pretty low for awhile. I feel like a complete failure at everything. I've been dating this really awesome guy for the passed year but now things are looking like they're falling apart and I just can't deal anymore. I'm tired of failing and I'm tired of being a loser.
