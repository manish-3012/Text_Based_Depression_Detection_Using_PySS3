Brother ended up in the hospital last night. Don't know how I should act or if i should help. please help.My brother ended up in the hospital last night after cutting himself and supposedly taking pills. (he texted a mutual friend mentioning the pills, my brother and father did not mention it.) I spent the night crying, and today he told me he was back at home (mother and father separated). I went to see him, and couldn't help telling him that he had done something horrible to the people who love him. Was this very wrong to do? He was acting so cavalier about the incident, brushing it off, and telling me not to guilt trip him. My father touted the hardships in my brother's life as if he were some tragic hero from a dostoevsky novel. Apparently my brother has been telling a fair few people about what happened to him, rather than keeping it quiet. I ended up in hysterics when I went to see him. It was so painful watching him be completely unapologetic, rationalizing his actions, and speaking with the tone that he understood and had the situation completely under control. I am really scared, and I don't know where to turn. God if anyone can give me any help, i would do anything to feel better right now.
