Dealing with huge stress at my workplace. Thinking about suicideIt is not the first time, but the idea of â€‹â€‹committing suicide has ceased to be a joke and has become a reality for me. Im 25 years old, I cannot complain about my childhood, even though I have problems never solved with the man who assumed the father figure for me, since my father left me when I was 5 years old. However, somehow I believe that my childhood, which is divided between the bad relationship with this man and the excess of care and affection for other members of my family, turned me into an adult unable to stand on my own.  

Currently, I have a large part of everything I ever dreamed of. I have been dating a wonderful person for almost 10 years, even though we only see each other on the weekends, I have a good car, enough money to feed me well, maintain small luxuries and have some kind of fun. And more recently, I fulfilled the dream of getting a public job, which in my country means the most stable type of job you can get, since it is very difficult for you to get fired in that position. I have been selected through an exam in which Ive competed with +5000 ppl, and now I'm working at this new job, 200km far from my hometown.

And when I thought I was entering the happiest period of my life, problems got worse. I was put to work in one of the worst departments among the possible ones, dealing directly with other workers payments, with great responsibility and problems that do not depend only on me to be solved. The pressure on me is high, and I was put in place of another employee who was in that position before, and since he cannot be fired, he was placed in another department. 

This person visibly wants me to get screwed, wants me to do something wrong and makes it clear that he doesn't like me. Whenever possible, this person tries to hinder my work. This, added to the daily stress of the workplace, has been draining my energy. I took a leadership position, where I need to make decisions on my own about things I have never done before, and I'm terrified of doing something wrong.  I have a lot of anxiety, fear of making mistakes in my work, fear of commiting serious mistakes that could justify my dismissal, etc. 

Whenever a problem arises at work, I have anxiety attacks, I can't reason properly and I feel an overwhelming desire to force my move to another workplace - which, in turn, can put me in a bad situation with my superiors.

Today I am here, in a city 200km far from where I grew up, away from my family, in my own home, where I thought I would live the happiest period of my life, thinking about taking my own life because I can't stand the stress of work.  On the one hand, when talking to my colleagues and immediate superiors, I realize that I may be exaggerating, and that everyone is seeing my effort and good faith. On the other, the fear of being boycotted, harmed in some way is literally killing me. I'm ashamed to think about taking my life, but I can't help thinking. 

I don't expect anyone to read this until the end, but if anyone does, I would appreciate any word. I needed to get it off my chest.
