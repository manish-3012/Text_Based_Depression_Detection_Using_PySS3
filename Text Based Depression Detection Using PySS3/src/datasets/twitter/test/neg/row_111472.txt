I have never admitted to this anyone but I think about killing myself 5/6 times a year.I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s normal. I have never tried to but have thought about it for the last 8ish years. Iâ€™m mid twenties now and my life is so good. I have everything anyone would want, no trauma or anything. Literally everything negative that happens to me comes from inside my own head and sometimes (especially during arguments with my significant other or when work has really got me down) I think that I donâ€™t suit this world and I weigh up killing myself. I never do it but I have never expressed to anyone that I have thought like this for so long. Is this normal behaviour?
