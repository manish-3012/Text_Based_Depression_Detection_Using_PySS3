Struggling.Iâ€™m just here to vent, iâ€™m struggling so badly and i cant find anything to cope.

Long story short about me, iâ€™m a 22 year old with 0 friends, a shitty uni degree and a history of major abuse.

I just give up, every friend i try with i end up fucking it all up. every relationship iâ€™ve been in, theyâ€™ve cheated.
my ex, before my current girlfriend abused me to fuck. threatened to kill my whole family, sent me death threats, got her brothers to beat me up, and abusive texts from 100s of people. wanna know why? because i caught her fucking her 50 year old boss and dumped her. 

Iâ€™ve never had a stable relationship, iâ€™ve always been cheated on by every single fucking relationship iâ€™ve been in. every single fucking one.

6 months ago i thought i found the right girl, we both fall deeply in love to the point in the first time in my entire fucking life i let someone in fully, give them my all and cherish every moment with them, but guess what i find out this week?
yup. she cheated, multiple times. i donâ€™t know fucking why i have this girl everything. iâ€™ve not stopped crying all week, iâ€™m so emotionally destroyed iâ€™ve ruined my 12 months being sober from drugs, iâ€™ve self harmed and iâ€™ve not stopped puking(i puke when iâ€™m severely stressed). I cried to her and told her how badly she hurt me, and i just wanted a explanation, and for some reason sheâ€™s been arguing with me making out like itâ€™s all my fault? iâ€™m so done with everyone. iâ€™m so fucking emotional over all of this i canâ€™t handle it, i cant get the thoughts out of my head of the love of my life being with some random dude. i cant cope anymore. 

Iâ€™ve got nothing, no friends, no loyalty in any relationship, nothing.

I just give up. iâ€™m gunna fucking drive to the nearest motorway and end it. I donâ€™t fucking know. everyone in this world is a piece of shit.

thanks for letting me rant reddit.
