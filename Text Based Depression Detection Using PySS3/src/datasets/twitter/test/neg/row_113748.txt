You can cry for help as loud as you want, it doesnâ€™t work if no oneâ€™s listeningI want to hurt myself badly to communicate my pain because no one is listening. I want to slash open every blood vessel and cover every inch of my house with blood. I want to scream until I vomit. I want to break every one of my own bones with a hammer and smash my teeth in. But no one will see besides the paramedics. No one I want to care will care. 

I just need someone to see my pain and care about it.
