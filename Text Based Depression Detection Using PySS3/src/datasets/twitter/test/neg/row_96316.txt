I only live for othersI really just want it all to end. I know I shouldnâ€™t, I know I have been given so many good opportunities and that I am loved but I still want to just end it, I have a plan and everything. I canâ€™t do this to the ones I love though. Plus I built what I call â€œBlocksâ€, things or people that will prevent me from doing it. I refuse to go therapy or tell anyone who knows me in real life about how I feel and how depression is affecting me. I would rather them think me as lazy than them failing to give me a reason to live because itâ€™s my fault. Everyoneâ€™s been so nice, Iâ€™m the only fault.
