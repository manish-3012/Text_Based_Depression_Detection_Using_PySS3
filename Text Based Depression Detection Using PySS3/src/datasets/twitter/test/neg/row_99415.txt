HelpHello 

Iâ€™m 17 years old and I feel I have nothing to live for. I suffer with severe anxiety and depression with basically keeps me in my room 24/7 when I was little my brother and my moms girlfriend used to abuse me which lead to me being in a mental faculties 3 times now due to suicidal thoughts and bad behavior.

Iâ€™m to scared to do it but I feel itâ€™s whatâ€™s best for me. I donâ€™t want to feel pain. Iâ€™m tired of being a shell of my former self. I miss having people who cared. As I feel now Iâ€™m all alone. I canâ€™t tell people how I feel in fear of going back to a mental ward. And when I try to open up to my mom she argues with me. 

My anxiety makes it almost impossible to make new friends. Iâ€™m scared to go up to new people in fear of what they would think of me. Iâ€™m scared of rejection. Whatâ€™s the point of being alive if I know Iâ€™m just going to be alone my whole life. Iâ€™ve tried therapy for years and nothing works. Theirs nothing worst then a person who comes once and week and tells you how you SHOULD feel.

I need help. I feel so alone. But I canâ€™t tell anyone because of what Iâ€™ll be seen as. A coward. Iâ€™m a year behind in school so itâ€™s already hard enough for me to feel comfortable. But as of now we are moving Friday away from the only friends I have and Iâ€™ll have to start all over in a new school. I just canâ€™t deal with the pressure of that. All I want is friends. Just people who care about me. People who wonâ€™t judge me for my problems. 

If you read this, thank you for listening.
