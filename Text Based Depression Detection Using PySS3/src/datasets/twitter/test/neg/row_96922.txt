I want to die only because I have autismI've always felt like my autism was worse than other people's autism because other people unlike me can actually keep their act together. I've always wanted to die because I've felt like a failure but I've realized I'm not a failure I'm just letting my autism get the best of me. I don't know how people don't let their autism take over because I feel completely helpless when it comes to speaking with people. I've closed myself off and drifted away from society and haven't eaten a good meal in weeks, maybe even in a whole month. I've let myself become isolated and I plan to die isolated too. My therapist hasn't been helping me and my parents think my Aspergers is just fake and for attention. Im dying tonight because I've been such a jerk to people and I've been so inconsiderate I have no reason to go on. It's just the truth.
