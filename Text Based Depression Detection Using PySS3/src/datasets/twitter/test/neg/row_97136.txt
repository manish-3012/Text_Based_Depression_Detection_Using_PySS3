Need some support.Hey All,

First off, I should say that I am not considering suicide.  But I do need some support from people in similar situations; please excuse the graphic descriptions this was my literal experience.  I feel that if I share it with others it will help me cope with it.  Believe it or not the story does end well.

About a year ago my parents went out of town.  My brother and I were staying at the house together and everything was going well.  My brother suffers from schizophrenia/bipolar disorder and has been in and out of mental hospitals about three or four times.  He had never made an attempt on his life up until this point.

The weekend was going well.  We were having fun and he was acting like himself.  By the end of the weekend he was very non-responsive.  I would ask him questions or try to interact and he would not respond; just shaking his head no like he was having some internal conversation with himself.  Since he had never tried to commit suicide before I just shrugged it off.  I contemplated calling my parents and telling them that he was not doing well; but I did not.

I went to sleep on Sunday night as usual and heard our cat being unusually active; walking around and jingling her bell.  I heard it and went back to sleep.  Next, the door to my bedroom opens and my brother comes in.  He says â€œI need help.â€  I reply â€œWhatâ€™s up bro?â€ in a dazed confusion.  He said â€œI tried to kill myself.â€  I said â€œWHAT?! Hold on.â€  I instantly jumped out of bed still in my boxers and turned on the lights in the kitchen.  â€œWhat did you do?â€ is what I asked him.  He showed me what he did.  At the time I did not realize how serious his injuries actually were.  He tried to slit his own throat, that was the most obvious wound.  I was shocked, he was covered in blood and veins, so I told him â€œshow me everything you did.â€  He pulled up his shirt and I saw eight slits on his chest and abdomen.  I thought at the time that he had just cut himself on the surface.  He looked very pale, and I could tell he was suffering.  All of this happened within about a minute but it felt like a lifetime.  So I instantly called 911.  The operator stayed on the line with me until the sheriff and ambulance arrived.  I cannot say exactly how long it took for them to get there I am sure it was within five minutes (again this felt to me like an eternity), and I told my brother to sit down in a chair.  I kept looking outside waiting for someone to come and he told me to come to his side.  Of course, I went to him and he told me to hold his hand so I did.  He kept saying to me â€œwhy is my heart beating so hard, I can feel my heart.â€  I told him â€œdonâ€™t worry, just hold on you will be fine just wait.â€

The sheriff arrives and I instantly open the door as I was anxiously waiting for him or anyone else for that matter.  He asks â€œwhere is he?  Does he have anything that can hurt me?â€  I say â€œno he just needs help NOW.â€  The paramedics show up moments after and take him to the nearest hospital.

So now it is just me and the sheriffs in the house now (another one has arrived by this point).  They ask me to take a look around the house and I say fine whatever.  They went upstairs to my brothers bedroom and see the chaos and come back downstairs immediately.  The first sheriff that arrived told me where the hospital was and he said to me â€œbe safe, drive carefully, you need to be there for him.â€  I am concerned about the cat and wanted to make sure she was in the house, so I go upstairs first.  I look in his room and I see a pool of blood that fills the room and two bloody knives laying on the floor.  At this point I am completely destroyed, not even thinking and just acting off instinct.

So I drive to the hospital where he is, it is 6:00 A.M. in the morning.  I show up and I am greeted by a (I do not know what you call them but they are like religious or something) and she tries to comfort me but I am completely numb at this point.  I call my parents, tell them what happened, and they are on their way to the hospital (3 hour drive, but dad made it in like an hour in half so he was hauling ass like there was no tomorrow).  The doctors told me to come in and see my brother (I think they thought this would be the last time I saw him) and so I went in and saw him, held his hand again, and said â€œI will see you soon, you are going to be fine... donâ€™t worry.â€

And then he goes off to surgery.  Because of his wounds they wanted to check his liver and heart.  About an hour later the surgeon comes to talk to me in the waiting room and says â€œhe will be alright.â€  Then, once my parentsâ€™ show up... after hours of confusion.  The surgeon comes back and says â€œhe missed his heart by millimetersâ€ from his stab wounds.

They stapled his neck and he did not hit his liver.  After his wounds healed he spent some time in the hospital and now he is back living with my parents.

Currently, my brother is doing great.  He is himself and I have my brother back.  He had a wake-up call from the experience and I doubt he will attempt to take his own life again from what I can tell (we have talked about the whole situation extensively).

I struggle to understand why he tried to do what he did.  But I saw a post on here that explained it pretty well.  I will try and summarize it.  If you are in a tall building and the building is on fire, jumping out of the window seems less worse than burning to death.  The burning is the voices in his head and jumping out the window is the knives.  It seems strange but having voices in your head is not something everyone deals with.

So now that I have explained my situation, I am trying to find constructive ways to deal with my PTSD from the experience.  Please help and share your thoughts!
