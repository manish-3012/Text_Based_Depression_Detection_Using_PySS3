Iâ€™m completely broken after break up and gonna kill myselfMe and my boyfriend agree that we are too different people (culture, race, language etc) and the relationship didnâ€™t go well actually. But I do really love him so much, he wouldnâ€™t know how much i love him and I can do anything for him. my heart is so broken after he told me he wants to break up with me. I canâ€™t stop crying and throwing up i feel like i lost everything i have. we were not matched but he was my everything and the only reason iâ€™m still alive. Iâ€™m in so much pain, i canâ€™t handle this pain anymore. I hate the way I am, how i made our relationship ended, i hate myself so much i want to kill myself as soon as possible, no one would love me, i wonâ€™t be able to find better boyfriend. Iâ€™m going to buy a rope and hang myself in the mountain soon. Iâ€™m sorry mom, dad, my sisters, my supportive best friends and my boyfriend.
