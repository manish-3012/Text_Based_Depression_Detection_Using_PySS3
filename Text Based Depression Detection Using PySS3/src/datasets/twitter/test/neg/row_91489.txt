What's the point?I'm 20, live at home with my mom, haven't even finished high school. Fucking hell. I'm fucking stupid. I've got ADD so I cant focus long enough to write up a real post. I just don't care. I can't keep a job, I've has lots but I always end up quitting because I have really bad anxiety problems. I get through one or two days of work and then I have a panic attack and just stop going. Im depressed all the time. I hate everything. I don't even know why I bothered making a throwaway account to post this. Its not like I care. Whats the point? Nothing matters. I just want to be happy.
