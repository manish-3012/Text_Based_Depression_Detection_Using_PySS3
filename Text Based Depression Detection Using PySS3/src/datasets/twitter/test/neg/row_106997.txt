How do I provide support?Saw this place, found interest, decided to check it out because hey why not.

I had a friend some time ago. Good friend, fun to be around for the most part. Kind of a bad influence, he wasn't productive at all and kinda pressures others to be unproductive with him in his own way, still fun when he wanted to be though. Anyway, he commonly had depressive episodes and would turn to me and vent his heavy heart out, and after a while I couldn't think of what to say to him. My first instinct was to use logic and optimism to try to show him that life doesn't have to be the way he saw it. That lead to plenty of philosophical debates and discussions which only made him feel worse. I don't understand how that happens, but it happened. A lot.

I didn't how to support him other than to just say "good luck" whenever he tried to suicide. I never tried to talk him out of it, I at least recognize that's not cool. If he wants to die who am I to hold him back from his goals? But aside from that, I don't feel like I'm much help.

He and I split up. Admittedly, I'm glad we have, so I have one less major influence holding me back from my personal goals, but I still have friends who get depressed and I doubt I'll never have another friend like him again. As it stands, a lot of these posts kinda sound like him, which makes me think maybe people of his mindset are more common than I thought.

So, even though I'm not currently in a state where I need this info, I may need it in the future should I have friends cry to me. And you seem like a knowledgeable enough bunch. How do you support a depressed or suicidal person during one of their episodes? How do you make them feel better, even if it seems like every word you say is either disregarded or overturned in a negative light? What are your strategies, tips, tricks, methods?
