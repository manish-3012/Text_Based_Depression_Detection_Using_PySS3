Hello beautiful people, I might try on mondayI was recently trying to hang myself but the rope ended up being too elastic and I standed on the floor while being choked. 
I'm quite sleepy and relaxed, I don't feel emotional. Why do I want to try again? I don't want to participate in this life anymore. I'm not fond of going to school in this body, cleaning, cooking, socializing. I have no reason to do these things, I'm dead meat for myself since my first attempt. The hatred eaten it's way through me, it's too late. Years too late. 

My family members could actually miss me, I thought about it. But what does it change if they can't treat me like a human when I'm alive? I won't think about mourning while being 6 feet in the dirt. 

I had plans for my life not so long ago, but I got a conclusion that I should wait for a better body to host. If that's possible - if not, I'm not even mad.
