I don't know how to help my friend anymore.For weeks now I have been trying to help my friend who has constant urges to self harm, and for a bit she got slightly better, then something happened and she became far worse, she's having suicidal thoughts, and she's isolating herself emotionally and doesn't know how she feels anymore. Her therapist isn't helping, her father who knows about the cuts told her if she did it again he'd put her in a mental institution, and I'm struggling to get her to ask for help and talk with people on here. What do I do
