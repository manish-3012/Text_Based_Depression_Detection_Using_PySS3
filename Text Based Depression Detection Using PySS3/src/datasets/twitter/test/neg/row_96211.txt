Ive been suicidal since i was 9and I feel like im nearing my end. 
the biggest thing thats been killing me is school. my grades have blown to shit because of my relapse in my eating disorder, and my self harm tendencies. my grades are dropping and i know my family hates me. my aunts pushing me because she thinks my lowest is a c, which in actuality thats my highest grade. im just a fucking retard who cant do shit. 
on top of that i came out as trans to my trump supporting family and they...dont support me at all. 
only thing im good for at this point is to laugh at
