I don't see my life ever getting any better.I've never gone to a doctor over it, but I truly believe I've had some type of depression for most of my life. Around the time I was 10, my grandma tried to get my mom to take me to a therapist. She thought I had depression too. But my mom didn't want me to get hooked on some prescription drugs that would just numb me. And maybe that was for the best. I'm usually able to keep it under control and hide it. These past few days have been different. 

I think this is about as bad as I've felt in my life. I blew up on my best friend for the second day in a row today, and I feel bad. Tonight he told me it's pissing him off.

I work two jobs right now. One is a shitty part time retail job making $8 an hour. I'm also in the national guard, and that's my other job. I'm in training right now, working on base 40 hours a week. I live in the middle of nowhere, so the military job is a 1 hour commute each way, 30 minutes for the retail job. Basically my entire life is work, save for the gym which pretty much eats up the rest of my freetime.

But my military job ends after next week, 3 days before school starts back. I'm doing Econ right now (1 semester in), but I'd like to switch to ChemE at a better school, and eventually do pharmacy. I don't wanna say where I go to school, but it is literally the worst university academically in my state. 

Problem is, I don't think I'll be able to transfer. I failed college algebra in my last semester. This honestly isn't because I'm bad at math. I was always great at it in elementary school, but I was homeschooled starting in middle school, and quickly found out how to cheat the system and not actually do any work. Even with that handicap, I was able to get a 25 in the math on the ACT just from cramming in the week leading up. So I'm not dumb (or at least unable to learn). Unfortunately, I had a full time job, a 16 hour courseload, a terrible teacher with only a very basic understanding of English, and almost no experience with Algebra. I gave up on the class a month in. The other school is much more competitive, and although I got A's in my other classes, I think this one will stop me. 

But maybe it wasn't how busy I was. I'm honestly probably one of the least motivated people I know. If I would've actually tried in high school I wouldn't be stuck at this shitty school, and I certainly wouldn't have skipped out on doing math. 

So to sum up the above, in all likelihood I'll stay at this shitty school in it's shitty business department, and probably have a shitty job to match once I graduate. But that's not what bothers me most.

I have never met a soul with lower self esteem then me. I can rarely work up the confidence to make eye contact with a pretty girl, much less tell her how beautiful I think she is or ask her out. I don't think I'm a bad looking guy. I'm in shape, decently lean, and besides my fucked up teeth I don't really think I'm ugly. And I'm not a boring guy around my friends. But all I can think about when I try to work up the confidence to talk to a girl is how creepy she'll think I am, how unwelcome anything I said would be. I've had one girlfriend, and she dumped me because I was "too much like a friend." I didn't even have the balls to do anything more than hold her hand. I've never even kissed a girl. 

To be honest, I think that was what started this. My buddy was going on a date with this girl he met on tinder, and I was supposed to go out with her friend. According to him, this girl's friend cancelled because she got in trouble with her parents. But I'm pretty sure he told her my name and she looked me up on facebook or something and cancelled. I was so happy just to go to the movies with this chick, since I don't have the balls to ask a girl out myself. And those plans got fucked last second. 

I am a pathetic, unmotivated, overworked, underachieving piece of shit. I don't see myself going anywhere in life. I can't even picture myself with a girlfriend. And I can't talk to anyone about it.

Honestly, I would never kill myself. I'm too chicken-shit scared of what's on the other side to even do that. But some days I truly wish I were dead. Some days I honestly feel like a waste of space.

I don't know what I'm looking for here. Just some kind of support I guess. I can't talk to a therapist and risk getting discharged and losing my scholarships. I can't talk to my parents either. I love them, but I know they'll judge me and try to shove Jesus down my throat. I can't even talk to my friends, because I don't want to aggravate the few I actually have.

Some days I just drink until I forget about my problems. But that never lasts long enough. I wish I could smoke weed. I know it's not for everyone but I really think it could help with this weird fucking anxiety I've got. But I can't even do that with these random drug tests I get. I just don't know what to do anymore.

Hopefully I'm better once work finally slows down.
