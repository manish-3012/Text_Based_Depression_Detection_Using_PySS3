Is life worth living without sex?I have been single since I was 19. I am now 28. I have not had sex for 3 years. I have tried everything to acquire sex but to no avail. I am having suicidal thoughts because of it. Visiting a prostitute is not an option because I don't want to do anything illegal and my high sex drive means the lengthy hire would be too expensive anyway. I have tried roughly 20 dating websites and they have not worked for me at all. I feel I will never have a girlfriend or wife. Please help me. I am a 28 year old man and I literally have tears in my eyes at how horny i am and my lack of relief for it. Thats coming from a guy that is usually unemotional. So should I just end it all?
