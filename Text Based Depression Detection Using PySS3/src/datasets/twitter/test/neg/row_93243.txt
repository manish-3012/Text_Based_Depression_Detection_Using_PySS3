I've taken 500g x32 Paracetamol. I needed to tell someone.I feel worthless. I can't cope with life and I think it be for the best if I was gone. I don't contribute to society and I might never have a job. I have a 2nd year college project and I cannot figure it out. I hate myself and I don't see that changing. I don't want to be here anymore and I think the people in my life would be better off without me.
