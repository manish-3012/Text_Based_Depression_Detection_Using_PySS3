I think itâ€™s time to give upIâ€™ve been struggling with depression and suicide thoughts for the past 5 years. Past 2 months I was actually happy for once. But with in the past week everything fell apart. It just feels like every thing is against me being happy. I donâ€™t see myself ever having a future. Maybe itâ€™s time to finally throw in the towel?
