Just doneIt's been a rough past week. I'm ftm, and my fiance and I broke up. It's like she didnt even talk to me when we broke up. I told her I "just dont know what else to do" and she responded as "I'll start packing". I was in shock, I didnt know what else to say to her. Apparently my year and a half of attempting to talk and all didnt do anything. I'm just at a loss. I feel like shit, I dont really have any friends or anyone to talk to. I saw it as an upside at the moment but she literally left me with the house and 2 dogs. The house is filled with memories (especially since she hasn't picked up the rest of her shit).  I just feel so hurt. I gave almost 5 years to her and she tossed me away like yesterdays garbage. I have no one to talk to. Idk what to do. I'm miserable. If I had a gun I'd end it now. I just want to distract myself
