AlmostI have no one in my life I can talk too who I wouldn't A: scare, or B: Get an apathetic response. So I'm just going to post my thought here because at least someone will hear me. The US is going through a cold spurt if you haven't noticed. Where I'm at it's 2F and it's only getting colder. Right now at this point in my life I have been seriously suicidal since I'd estimate spring break. One of my greatest fears is growing up, and living the average day to day life. All the while slowly looking into the mirror each and every day slowly starting to see wrinkles until you fall into Alzheimer's. I've been depressed since I was 11, probably because that was when I started seeing the world for what it is. Which was probably a result of seeing my parents fight all the time and being labeled the weird kid growing up because I was the chubby over hyper farm kid with no friends besides their sister. I guess I matured over time and grew out of that kid phase, but I have serious issues  relating to people now that I'm 17, almost 18, an "adult". My dad keeps saying I'm a loser, that academic honors isn't shit, that I'm less of a person because I'm not a guy. My mom is the most apathetic and ignorant person you can imagine when it comes to world views and mental health. She's a penny pincher and I know if I ask for help she'd just tell me to get a job. I lost two jobs because I've been suicidal and need time away for a few months, and since I'm a kid I figured it wouldn't hurt me. My sister, my twin sister who I was so dearly close to threw me away so fast for a guy she met. They've been together for a year now. I know that I should be focusing on life right now instead of romance and stuff, but I just can't help thinking that I'm not going to find anyone. I'm asexual, and a little less feminine then I think I should be. I am heavily logic driven, and I never legit smile anymore. I think I'm blabbering now. My point is, I truley don't want to grow old and die, for my occupation I was going to become a scientist and do whatever I can to figure out how to slow or stop the aging factor in dying. All I want is to help people. My heart aches terribly when I think about people suffering over lost loved ones. I just want to get into the tub, and have a long nice bath. Then I'll put on some comfy Pj's or something, put in my earbuds and listen to a music playlist I like. Then go outside when everyone is asleep and just walk in the frigid snow, just walk until I can't feel. Then go to sleep and not wake up. My birthday is arriving soon. I want to die a kid, before I turn 18. Sorry, I just needed to vent.
