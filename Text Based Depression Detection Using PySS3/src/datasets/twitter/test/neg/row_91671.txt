Feeling sad and empty even after happy daysIdk, I'm getting real tired of this feeling, every day when I go to sleep i have this feeling of emptyness and at a lot of thoughs telling me I'm worthless how I'm a mess, making me feel lonely even thought I have friends.

It doesn't matter if I layed all day on bed or if I met with friends, laughed and had a good time. At the end of the day I still feel like something is missing and a hard desire to cry, to just stop trying.

I really want to kill myself, I want to jump in front of a train, I just want to stop talking to people who doesn't care, talking to so much people online telling me that they'll offer and ear for me, to listen. Only to get ignored after telling them all my problems over and over again with different people. I've tried talking with over 50 people in a week i think and everyone ghosts me after a "tell me your problems" or just ignore what i said. I feel used. I just don't care anymore, it doesn't seem to matter if I tell anyone my problems no one cares and no one will care when I die, It'll be just another sad moment in their lives that will fade with time. To me, it will be finally my way out of this mÃ­sery thoughs.
