What do you do to outweigh the positives of killing yourselfI'm having a hard time convincing myself that it's easier to keep living. I've got a life insurance policy that pays out close to 600k and a history of reckless driving. My parents and siblings have money issues and honestly it's something I keep thinking about. My own life has become extremely lonely as I've watched the people I considered friends move away and become distant. How do you manage to convince yourself that moving toward is the better option?
