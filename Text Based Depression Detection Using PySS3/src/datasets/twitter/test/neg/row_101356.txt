My life: my confessionSo Iâ€™m a twin and he was my best friend in the world until I was 20. When I was 10 years old I used to cuddle with him. Iâ€™m a dude. Only problem was I started getting aroused. I never directly sexually abused him. But it was disgusting. I didnâ€™t understand what was happening at the time. I didnâ€™t even know what sex was. But it was completely wrong. Looking back, I was innocent: I had no idea what it meant or what I was doing.  But when we got older he remembered and now he hates my guts. 

When I was 16 I lost the ability to maintain arousal. Since then I have been in relationships with about 7-8 women. Iâ€™ve never been in a relationship with a dude. Now, Iâ€™m 36 and I no longer can function sexually with women. Iâ€™ve tried just about every type of porn and nothing turns me on now. 

When I was 23. My brother turned on me and started making fun of me to the people I thought were my friends. They all assumed I was gay, maybe he told them what happened. This was in the 90s and people were really homophobic back then so it was a big deal of embarrassment for me, not because I was gay but because I didnâ€™t know myself whether I was.

So I got really depressed. I started dating women. I ended up getting schizophrenia.

From 23-26, I suffered from schizophrenia. I became religious, was delusional. I kept dating women. Sometimes I had function and sometimes not. When I was 28 I met my ex wife. We had a son. We had a really fulfilling sexual relationship.

My son was born with birth defects. Heâ€™s a beautiful boy and I love him. But he will never be independent. He doesnâ€™t speak. He will always wear diapers. 

Our marriage fell apart. I developed a sex addiction. I was very demanding sexually on my ex wife bordering on abusive. I take full responsibility. But Iâ€™m a shit human being. She wanted out. We broke up. I had a psychotic episode and began an addiction to prostitutes. 

Now, Iâ€™m 36. I have lost all function. I call escorts weekly but canâ€™t do anything with them. I pay them for letting me try. Iâ€™m a sex addict. 

Looking back on my life. I realize that Iâ€™m scum. And I need to die: Iâ€™ve always been scum.
