My Mom has cancer and I'm not sure what to do.My mom (48) went to the doctor to get a cyst removed earlier last week, and just had her stitches removed. The doctors ran some tests (I'm guessing because of her age) and they've come back with a result of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

After being told what to look for, my mom is now certain of 5 pea sized lumps in her tissue that she has found. She's going in this weekend to get further tests to find out what stage it is, how many more smaller nodules could be there, and how to plan for treatment. The doctors are hopeful, and my mom is optimistic that they'll be able to remove it all proceed with radiation to keep her as safe as possible.

I don't know if I could see my mom die. I know it happens, and I know it's something I'll have to live with, but I'm 22, and I expected to get at least another 20 years with her, since all of the women on her side live a very long time (my great grandmother is 93 and my grandmother hasn't aged at all and is 67). My best friend died in surgery for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva when I was 15, and things looked so dim that I swallowed our medicine cabinet.

I'm not rude enough to have my mom experience outliving her son if she DOES end up being on the short stick, but afterwards? I would lose a very large part of my world again, and I don't want to have that pain a third time.

I'm not even sure if I'm posting any of this to the right place. I just feel trapped, and I don't know where to retreat to where the ground isn't collapsing under me.
