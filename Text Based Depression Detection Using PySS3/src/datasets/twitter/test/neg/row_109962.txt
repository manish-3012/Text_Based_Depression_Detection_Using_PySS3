HelloHi, I posted here multiple times under other accounts month ago. But It was more like I wanted attention. Anyway, I fucked my life up, like I never thought would be possible. Now all my meds are laying beside me. There are more than enough to kill me, also a few drugs and wine. I don't weight much, I am weak anyway. I guess a bottle of Vodka would do the trick. Ha. 

My problem is that I am a lesbian. But I didn't realize it. I have a boyfriend, or more like a friend, slave rn? I can see all the hate I will get for that haha. I don't mind anymore. I told him I think I am a lesbian, that I don't love him. But he doesn't want to believe it. He fights so hard for me. He is such a good guy. I want him to be happy. That I go and he can live the life he deserves. He says he want me to be happy too. 

My situation is really tricky. I guess. I were in a mental hospital, my family said I should go there, and I guess they were right but after a few days I got my things at night and said I want to go. Now I have diagnoses like I am super crazy, and thats what I am now, too. So that fits. I can't go there anymore and I don't want to, they wanted to help but I didn't believe them. It's always the same. The Dr. there told me it was my fault for getting raped because I went to a party and drink alcohol, he said it was my fault as a kid to not scream loud enough to get love. I'm just bubbling stuff, there is no sense in me. I don't know what I want from here. I am just desperate. Thanks for reading.
