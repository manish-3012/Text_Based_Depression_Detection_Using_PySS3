I like to play with my own lifeThere are multiple ways I do it:

I am not really careful when it comes to traffic and stuff like I would not jump in front of a car but I don't try to be safe and protect myself from possible accidents...

But what is way more stupid is that I let my life go down the drain watch everything fall apart because I just don't do anything until I get to a point where there is no way out.

And the point where I started planning my suicide is long gone. I just wait if anything changes or anything happens but if I keep not doing anything in about 2 months my situation should be heavy enough...


The heavy part about is that I enjoy it... I hate to imagine leaving anyone behind and some people where really nice to me for the last months but honestly I won't care anymore soon enough and I really enjoy seeing my life going down the drain until there is no way out anymore...

I'm such a piece of garbage
