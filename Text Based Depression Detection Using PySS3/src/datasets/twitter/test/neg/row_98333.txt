I don't know how to keep doing thisI spend all my time completely alone. And even when I'm around people no one talks to me. I don't think I've had a conversation in weeks. I'm tired. Last time I posted people just kept telling me nothing was wrong. I don't want to keep sitting alone waiting to die. Death sounds so much better than waiting.
