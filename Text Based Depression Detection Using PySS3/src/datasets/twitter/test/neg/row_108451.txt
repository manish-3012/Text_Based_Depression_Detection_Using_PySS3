Iâ€™ve taken up dangerous hobbies.Unless Iâ€™m thrill seeking and pushing things too far Iâ€™m so depressed. Iâ€™ve purchased the gear to start ice climbing and mountaineering. Iâ€™ve had several close calls during other activities but every time I go into survival mode and refuse to let myself die. I basically only have the will to live when Iâ€™m close to death. 

I suspect as my physical ability declines my depression will worsen. Iâ€™m considering leaving my girlfriend so that once my parents die there wonâ€™t be anyone left to mourn my death if I were to have an accident.
