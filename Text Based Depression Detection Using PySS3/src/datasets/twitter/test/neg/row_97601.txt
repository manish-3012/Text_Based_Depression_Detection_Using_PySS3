Self-hatred.I've been feeling terrible. I feel as if my anger is from being bottled up inside for several years and I'm taking it out but there's always more because ive been bullied since elementary. I don't know what to do. I do see a therapist, but idk if it helps much. Recently I've been feeling like I want to punch/kill something or someone, and the thought of the moments of me getting bullied in middle school makes me just want to beat the person up, stab them and grab a fucking knife and slit their throat. I've also had issues with my family too, and they tend to make fun of my appearance and mock me. They're mentally and verbally abusive. Growing up I've been hit alot (with a shoe/object) as it was discipline, and had child services show up a few times, but I don't want to move to a foster home. I don't know what to do.

I'm stuck here, I'm scared on what to do when I become a adult someday, living in a house alone.. like all that fear.. of what if someone broke in? You know?

Ive lost my interest in playing video games a few years ago, I keep feeling tired, and I tend to question my existence. 

I want to die, but I know it's painful and I don't want to do it at the same time. I don't know what to fucking do anymore, I don't have any friends (my online friends don't give a shit about me, and I don't have any real life friends either) and I hate my family.

I've been through a lot (and like online but idk why the words get to me).. I don't know what to fucking do with my life.i hate myself and everyone else
