Lost one of my employees to suicide.I realize there is a suicide bereavement reddit page but that only had 11 users online and the suicide watch reddit has 416 users online. This terrifies me.

I lost one of my employees to suicide two weeks ago and I am still reeling. I can't begin to understand the pain or depression she must have been experiencing. By all accounts, no one knew she was struggling with suicidal thoughts or depression. There was no indication that she was hurting so badly and she left no suicide note.

I am posting here to BEG anyone reading this to not do what you are considering to do. You may not feel like anyone cares about you but I can guarantee someone does. It may be a coworker sitting next to you, your manager, your casual acquaintance, or even a distant family member. It may be an old friend who still thinks about you from occasion to occasion, or it may be a fellow Reddit user.

I am not here to judge or to make assumptions. I can't pretend to understand even an inkling of what you must be feeling by even visiting this reddit page. But if I could communicate one thing to my employee before she killed herself, it would be this- if you feel like you have nothing to live for, you are not seeing all the things that I see. I am so sorry that I did not make you believe how much you are valued as an employee, as a person, and as a friend. People keep telling me that you were sick and you were on a mission and my actions couldn't have changed the outcome if I had known how you feeling beforehand. Maybe one day I will buy into that, but I haven't yet. I still believe that if someone, anyone, had made you believe you had something to live for, we could have had you longer in this world. You will always be known to others as the girl who killed herself, but I know I will remember you as so much more than that. You will be missed so much.
