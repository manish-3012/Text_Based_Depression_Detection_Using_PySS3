Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t want it to stop.Recently my family has received a contact tracing email about how we were exposed to the plague from a guy we gave pie to on thanksgiving, during this time Iâ€™ve realized something. Iâ€™m scared. I am absolutely terrified and I want to hold onto that for as long as I can. Now this is really a will to live but fear of death is a start, we all start somewhere.
