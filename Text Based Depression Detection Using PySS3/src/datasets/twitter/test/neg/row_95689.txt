Its getting to be too muchEveryday this is getting worse. I have no hope for my future and I almost never enjoy anythinv anymore. Everyday I feel extrememly sad most of the day and my anxiety is making my stomach and chest hurt. My parents dont seem to give a shit about this and they usually just get annoyed when I try to tell them about this. I dont know what else to say. I could go on for hours but whats the point. If you even took the time to read this,which nobody is probably going to,thank you.
