I'm a mistake that I don't have the confidence to fix anymoreI don't even feel human. What kind of god would have made me like this and expect things to be okay? Dysthymia with poorly timed severe depression, anxiety, PTSD, and now we're throwing in an adulthood diagnosis of autism. (It explains a lot, which is nice, but it's daunting to think I'll have zero social skills for the rest of my life.) I've been stuck like this for nearly ten years. I'm on autopilot 24/7 just to get by, and if my attention slips I burst into tears.

Some of the hardest things:
- My family doesn't understand mental illness at all
- If I go back to a ward I'd probably lose my job, future chance at careers, and the only person who loves me
- If I die I also lose the only person who loves me (but hey no more working)
- The plans for my last attempts, although deleted, are too fresh in my mind

And now realizing,
- Everyone here has been through so much. I feel like a wimp. I'm so ready to die, but what for? What's making me feel like this lately? Not much.

Things have been so good lately. What's wrong with me? Am I just permanently broken? Did I lose the ability to be happy no matter what good comes my way?

I am happy sometimes, often even. Why doesn't it stay? Even when nothing changed between last night and today but my own thoughts, why do I want to die again?

It's just been happening so much lately. I can't take it anymore. This shit eating goblin in my brain wants me dead and god dammit I just might have to give it to him to shut him up.

But I'll go out on my terms. Donations and vacations, I'll use what little I have left to do something meaningful.
