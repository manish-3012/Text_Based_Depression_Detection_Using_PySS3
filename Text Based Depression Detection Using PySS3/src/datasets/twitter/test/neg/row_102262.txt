Was about to kms but didnâ€™t. Got my phone, talked with my friends as if nothing happened.Here I am right now. Laying on my bed with my phone. I was dead set on killing myself. But then when I was about to do it, I felt like I was gonna be a bigger burden if I died than if I was alive. So I stopped midway, opened my phone, chatted everything as if nothing was about to go down a few minutes ago.

We talked about wanting to get wraps tomorrow.
