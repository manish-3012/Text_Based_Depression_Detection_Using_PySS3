All of my favorite bands are going on tour this year and Iâ€™m not going to be able to see any of them.Obviously thatâ€™s not the only reason Iâ€™m suicidal but itâ€™s honestly up there. Even if I could afford it, I donâ€™t gave anyone to go with because I have literally zero friends. And none of the shows are in my city and I have really bad anxiety about driving in high traffic areas so just imagining trying to drive myself and find a parking place and everything is too much. 

All I want in the whole world is to stand in the crowd and see MCR sing Thank You For The Venom live and itâ€™s never going to happen because of dumb shit like money and anxiety. Iâ€™m sick of my life being pathetic and boring because Iâ€™m poor and have fucked up brain chemistry. Like it sounds like a small thing but every single aspect of my life is so much harder than it should be and Iâ€™m so fucking done.
