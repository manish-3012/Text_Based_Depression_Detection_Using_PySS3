Just on the brink.First off, this is a throwaway account because my roommates and some of my friends use reddit and don't want them knowing it's me. It may sound silly but I don't need them calling my parents, who have never been able to be supportive (i.e. preventing me from doing anything) of me over something like this.

I'm a senior in college, taking 18 credit hours this semester and I'm just starting to feel... again... that it's just not worth my time. I've attempted suicide (four times) before as a teenager so this feeling is nothing new to me at all. I put on a smile on campus because it's the easiest way to distance myself from people and not get them involved. I hate talking to people (especially my friends) about this for the fear of being called an emofag or being called an attention whore or things like that.

I'm failing all my classes right now and am just on the brink of just ending it. I'm going to have a massive debt to pay when (if) I graduate which will most likely never get paid off. People often look at me differently because I'm not attractive like other men are and people (especially females) look at me like I'm a rapist if I try to offer help which only makes me feel even worse. The pressure of being the first to graduate from a real university in my family is surmounting and my father only cares about money and not my education at all. I have no money/insurance to see a therapist at all to see if I'm clinically depressed or bi-polar because this isn't the first time I've ever felt like this... it's just the one of many.

The pressure is just getting to be too much for me and I feel like I'm pushed back into a corner with no other option. It's the worst I've felt in years. My friends often call me charismatic and easy-going but deep down I know no one on campus or anyone else close to me would give a shit if something were to happen to me tomorrow or the next day or the day after that.

I just feel so worthless and useless and that it would only improve my friends lives if something happened to me. I know they find me as an annoyance.
