The idea of having upvotes and downvotes in a sub about suicide seems really dangerousFirst off I get it - this is how Reddit operates. The more popular threads are more upvoted, same with the more popular comments. And I'm not proposing a solution, because I don't have one.Â 


But this is a place where people come and pour their heart out, come begging for help, come often as a last resort, and more often than not their posts go unnoticed. Can you imagine a suicidal person seeing this sub and thinking "well at least this place is somewhat of a refuge," and then their post gets two comments and three upvotes in five hours? How is that person not supposed to feel even worse? This has happened to me and it feels TERRIBLE. Hell, this post may very well go unseen too.


But for anyone reading, the purpose of this post is to tell you not to judge yourself based on Reddit's reaction to your post. Sometimes certain posts are just more popular. I wish there was something this community could do to change that.
