I have no idea how I'm still alive.I've been depressed for years but these past couple of weeks have been complete hell for me. I've cut my arms to help distract me from the pain, but it just comes back in a couple hours. I'm so tired all the tine and I just feel like such a failure. I keep feeling myself getting closer to the edge and I honestly believe I won't make it to see Christmas. Maybe even sooner. I'm tired of being a failure and I just want it to end. I don't know how I've got this far but I feel like I'm just about to end it all any day now.
