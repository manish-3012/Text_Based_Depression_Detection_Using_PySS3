AnhedoniaI feel nothing. No emotional pleasure. No physical pleasure. I have to remind myself, that when my favourite team or sportsman wins, I'm supposed to react passionately. 
I feel like a broken machine. I only exist, because I still believe so, but my derelealization is getting me down.
I'm wondering when I will lose my mind completely.
