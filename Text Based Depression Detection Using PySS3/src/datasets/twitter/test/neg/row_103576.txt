im bad at titleswell! today's my suicide date. i said i'd do it before school, and fuck, this is before school.
im not sure what i'll do.
fuck, i don't even know if i'll be brave enough to do it.
im very fucking tired of being alive.
my boyfriend hates me. my family has practically disowned me. the only things that care about me are the crows i feed in the park. the little guys even follow me around and bring me beads and shiny things sometimes. i'm gonna miss them.
i'm not really sure if i'm seeking help here anymore. i'm so tired. i just want to die. i want to die i want to die i want to die. i'll probably go out and see the crows one last time, maybe give a few some names. go inside and feed my cat. tell my boyfriend i'm sorry for being a piece of garbage.
goodnight reddit! :v
