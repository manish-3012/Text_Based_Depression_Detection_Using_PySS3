Please let me dieEveryday is horrible. No one likes me and Iâ€™ll never mean anything to anyone. I am completely worthless and Iâ€™m reminded of that everyday. I spend all the time I can sleeping because I donâ€™t want to deal with my life anymore. I have failed at everything Iâ€™ve set out to do. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m still not allowed to die.
