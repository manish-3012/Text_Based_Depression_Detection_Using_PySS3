Fuck thisLooking back I see this pile of shit. I slitted my wrists, I lied to everyone, I was jealous of most people, I flopped a suicide, I willingly had sex with pedophiles, I took up smoking, I started with drugs... I can't see much that I've ever done for anyone or myself. I've kept myself in this meditative bubble of numbness but maybe reality wants me dead.
