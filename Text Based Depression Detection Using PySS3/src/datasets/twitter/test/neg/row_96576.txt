I've got nothing left...I know that I do, but I feel like I don't. I've been depressed before, but recently have been doing better, though I've always struggled through college. I was told at the beginning of the year that I had to raise my gpa in my major in order to graduate. I thought I was on the right track, but I got my grades today, another D. Now I cant graduate, I won't be able to raise the grades enough, and my scholarship runs out at the end of this coming semester. My family can't afford another semester, and they've already sacrificed enough for me. My girlfriend has had to balance her own life and troubles in addition to mine. I feel like I don't have a future, I won't be able to graduate, and I'm not even sure I can transfer credits in my major to another university. I'm a burden in everyone's lives and and people have made enough gambles on me that i havent returned on. Lately I've been feeling like they'd be better off without me. This is the first time thoughts of removing myself from the equation have entered into my head in a long long time, but its starting to make more and more sense. They'd all be better off without me, my girlfriend wouldn't have to deal with all my emotional shit, my family wouldn't be throwing thousands of dollars down the drain because of me. I don't know, I'm not sure I even have enough courage to do it, I just want to fade away and not even be a factor in anyone's life anymore. I dont know what to do
