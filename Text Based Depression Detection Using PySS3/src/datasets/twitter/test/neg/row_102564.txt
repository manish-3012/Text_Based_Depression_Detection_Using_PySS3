TaMarried, almost 40, alcoholic piece of shit (somehow I hid it from my wife until now). She wants to work through this, but I don't want to keep disappointing her and my son. Me out = her better chance of meeting someone else. Considering a last beer with my besty, grabbing a bus and hopping off the bridge. Not ready for winter anyway.
