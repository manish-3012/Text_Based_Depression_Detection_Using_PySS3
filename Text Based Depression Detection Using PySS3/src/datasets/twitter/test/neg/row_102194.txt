I have no oneI tried once before, things didn't work obviously, I curled up and felt nothing for an hour and until asked my best friend for help and bawled like a baby... only they bawled too and since then I've been too worried about hurting them to try again.

Now I'm struggling so fucking bad, I have nothing, I have no one to turn to anymore. The old friend seems so disinterested in my problems. My skin feels too tight and I just want to rip it off. I just want everything done, I just want to leave this earth or stop everything. I can't keep up with my own damn life. Everything hurts, my head hurts and I just want this over.
If I lose this friend I lose everything, I have no other friends and I can't rely on my family. After the last time they forced me to go on medication, but that made me numb and want to end things even more. I just don't feel like I have anyone to turn to anymore and I guess that's why I've ended up here. 
Edit: P.S.

What is wrong with me, what is so fundamentally wrong that I cannot find help, that I cannot help myself and no one cares. I'm lonely and I'm desperate for an ear to hear me out. I'm just so fucked. I feel grotesque and ever since I was a child I was made to feel stupid. I feel like I don't have value and to be honest, even when I'm not thinking of suicide I don't think I have a future at all. I have almost made peace with the fact I will die alone whether it be soon or 100 years from now. I'm just not compatible with the human race. I don't know what I've done to deserve this, I just want it to stop. 

edit2: sorry if this post is ranty/incoherent.
