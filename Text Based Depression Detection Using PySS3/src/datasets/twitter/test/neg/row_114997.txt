Depression destroyed my social lifeI have isolated from the few friends I've made, I have distant relationships with all my relatives, and I nearly never go out or interact with people in a meaningful way. The pandemic has further reduced my social interactions to occasional video calls for meetings, or using chat while gaming.

I realized that suicide is a large part of the reason. Every relationship is the opportunity to hurt someone if I do end up disappearing someday. I'm still arguing with myself about whether a few good memories can be worth tons of pain.

It has always helped me to understand more about myself and why I'm struggling. It allows me to find the spots where I can start improving, even if taking that step is another challenge on its own. I hope some of you can identify with this and get the same value from it.
