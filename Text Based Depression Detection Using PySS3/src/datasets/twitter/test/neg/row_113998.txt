Does anyone know how much Depakine is fatal?his is what it says says on the boxes: Depakine Chrono 500 mg (Slow-Release scored film-Coded tablets)

&amp;#x200B;

How much does a person need to Overdose? if it doesn't work is there gonna be any organ failures? Does smoking some Marijuana before the attempt makes any difference? (I tried googling these stuff but I did not find much)

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks
