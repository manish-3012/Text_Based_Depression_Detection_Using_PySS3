Where do I need to stab myself to die and not fail.Please donâ€™t try to tell me I have so much to live for because I donâ€™t. Everyone I care about leaves me. I donâ€™t have any dreams or goals. I have nothing to live for. I just need to know which vital spot I need to hit, how big the knife and how long do I have to wait.
