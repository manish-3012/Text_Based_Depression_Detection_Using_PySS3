I am so broken. I don't think I can take this for much longer.*I am not a native English speaker, but I really need to vent a little bit and the idea that no one I know will read this, makes me feel safe.*

I don't know when it started but I always felt different, not in a cool way, but in a horrible "i don't belong to my own skin" way.
I am 25 now and honestly I don't know how I made it. If you ask me what did I did for the last 10 years I would point 5 ou 7 things and then theres nothing, either because my memory is deteriorating slowly or either because I didn't live much experiences.
I am gay. My family is very conservative, not because they are the traditional alt right family, but mostly because they are rural workers who got a really hard life when they were kids, so I don't think I can blame them. We all are fucked up in some ways.
I hide myself for so long I can't socialize anymore. 
I went through some really tough shit back to elementary school, I got scars I don't think will ever heal.
I am been treated for 3 years and I am still falling apart.
I am really, really lonely. And it fucks me up because I do wanted to live, but not like this. I feel fine for 5 or if I am lucky maybe 15 days, and then I am broken again. It comes from nothing, its just like it isn't me if I am not sad, and I don't want to be remembered like that. Someone who couldn't be happy.
In fact, I wish I would never be remembered, I want to vanish from this world.
I've read someone saying they once got asked "for how long do you want to be dead?" and this question made them realise they didn't want to really die, but I do. My answer would be: Forever.
I wish I could travel back in time and take care of my mentally health when I was a teen. I would probably be in a better situation right now. 
The only thing that made me give a step back today, was the fact that my mom is really ill, she can barely walk and it would be fucked up to let her with such a trauma.

But at this point I am pretty sure I won't make till my 30s. Definitely. I am a goner.
