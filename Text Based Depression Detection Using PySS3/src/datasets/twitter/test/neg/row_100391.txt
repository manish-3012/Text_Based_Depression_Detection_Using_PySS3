Last night, I dreamt I finally committed suicide and descended into Hell.It was the best dream I've ever had. I was in a car with my sister and dad, slit my throat, and then my soul left my disgusting body and soared through the sky with two demons. 

I was then brought down to the Earth, and just as I was about to cross into Hell and into Satan's arms, I woke up. 

You know those dreams that leave you wishing they were real?

I just want to die, I just want to be at peace, whether it be in Hell or in a silent and eternally black void.
