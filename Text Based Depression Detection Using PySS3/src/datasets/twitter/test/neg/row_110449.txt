Can't possibly afford to go back to my community college, can't get anything right.I went to my dream school in Boston for two years before completely destroying myself while suffering from depression. I ruined everything and had to leave the school on a medical basis as I really couldn't function at all. I was cutting myself and couldn't leave my room without having a full on break down.

I get back home and start going to my local community college. Things were going great, then I just felt like I wasn't going anywhere. I felt like I wasn't capable of focusing like other people were and I just kept getting lost in my own thoughts. I'd come home and lock myself in my room to cut myself off from my family.

I'm turning 21 and I don't have a license. My parents and my GF have to drive me everywhere and I'm just trying to get my permit so I can start moving forwards. I'm working a shitty minimum wage job in which I have to pretend that I am okay. I'm not okay. 

I owe my community college $1000 for the past semester. I would be fine paying that off with the amount I'm working now- but as my loans have entered repayment and I'm paying $500 a month into them while earning about $500 a month (when payroll is enough to even get that many hours), I can't save up fucking anything for it. All of my wage goes right into my loans and I am in this horrible fucking circle of waking up and thinking that I just want to go back to school to try and get my life back on track and then realizing it's fucking impossible with my income and spending.

I have no friends anymore as I don't talk to any of them. My GF is the only one that I can talk to. I've never loved like this and I love her more than I can ever put into words. I feel like I'm just a burden onto her at this point and I'm scared of pushing her away because of how distant I get. All these thoughts cloud my mind and I can't talk. I'm just silent when I get home. 

It's been like this for months now. I keep trying to push it all back but I really can't anymore. It's all way too much and I feel like I'm just a major disappointment to myself and everyone around me. It feels like I can't do anything about it at this point and that I should just give up. I just want to give up.
