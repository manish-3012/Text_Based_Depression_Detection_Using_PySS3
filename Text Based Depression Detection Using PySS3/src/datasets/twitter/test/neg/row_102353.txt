Hopelessness and apathy are dangerousThere are just no words for how hopeless I feel. I want to leave my country so badly (preferably forever) so I can get ketamine treatment. But I am trapped, thanks to my mother who wonâ€™t let me get on a plane cause of COVID (I dont buy this) and the financial shithole we have fallen into since my dadâ€™s death. Her brothers are rich as fuck and she wonâ€™t speak up. We are owed money from my dads side but again she wont speak up.


Today Iâ€™ve slipped into crushing hopelessness and depression because being close to people hurts too much (I have BPD) 

Last time, I saw the signs and tried to warn others. After the hopelessness comes the apathy. And the apathy is dangerous because I will stop at nothing to end my life.

Iâ€™ve survived two suicide attempts this year. 

All statistics, as well as risk factors, and my failing brain point to suicide. 

The micro amounts of joy I feel arenâ€™t enough to sustain me. 

I predict another attempt in the next few days or week. 

Feeling unheard hurts. BPD hurts. Depression hurts, therapy hurts and Iâ€™m over it.
