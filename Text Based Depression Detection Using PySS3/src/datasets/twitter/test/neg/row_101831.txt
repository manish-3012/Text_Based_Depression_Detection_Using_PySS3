Should I keep living?I believe very strongly that I'm what people call a sociopath. A while back I abandoned reveling in what I was and I developed a code for myself. I based it on the morals of those who I envied most... the purest souls I've encountered. Im always bending that code... and changing it. But for the most part, I keep true to it. But I dont feel good about any of it. I feel like I threw away all of my confidence in order to support this code. The only thing I felt good about is gone. I dont feel anything for doing right. I'm becoming resentful of the people I based all these morals on. I'm blaming them in my mind now for not feeling good about myself. If I abanden my code I will feel better again... I know this. But if I dont, then I'll just rationalize one day and still ruin someones life around me. And then my faliure will be that much worse. Because I tried. What would you do. If I want to die without making life worse for those that I respect, would the most rational course of action not be to end myself. I feel like I'm a bomb in all these people's lives. And the whole world seems to be in agreement that my condition is incurable. I thought I had cured myself with my code, but that only took care of my symptoms. And am I even deseased. Is there something wrong with me. Everytime the universe bends for me someone around me has to be the one who pays for it. Is my fleeting happiness and sense of self worth being a tumor upon everyone who knows me. I really dont know what to do? I wish I did'nt know anyone. I'm so damn envyess of everyone. I swear I can see whats missing in me in almost all of them, except the ones like me... and none of them have a code to live by, so how could I ask them for advise... I know what it would be. Is there anyone who can make sense of this to me? Anyone in my position?
