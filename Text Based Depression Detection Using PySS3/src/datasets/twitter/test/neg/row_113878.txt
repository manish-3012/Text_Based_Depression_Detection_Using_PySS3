Iâ€™ve been suicidal for years and no one knowsThe existential dread set in at about age 12. Iâ€™m 28 now and itâ€™s only gotten worse. Iâ€™m so intensely miserable nearly every waking hour, my only respite is sleep, as itâ€™s unbearable to be alone with my own thoughts. 

I feel like a failure, but what even would be the point of success? To thrive in this fucked up world filled with awful, selfish, apathetic people who benefit from othersâ€™ destitution? Itâ€™s depressing. 

If my parents werenâ€™t still living and all of my student debt wouldnâ€™t default to my husband, I would have done it already. 

Just had to tell someone before I begin yet another day of hiding my shameful pain from the world.
