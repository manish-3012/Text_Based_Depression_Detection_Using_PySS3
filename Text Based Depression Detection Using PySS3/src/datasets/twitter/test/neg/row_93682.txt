It's just so tiring.I feel so selfish as I have people who love me and a soulmate yet I feel like I am empty.

I think about jumping off the platform in front of a train or taking too much morphine which I get for my condition, my waking hours are pretty much constant pain. It's agony to be honest, I am in and out of hospital and A&amp;E as it's a really difficult condition and there is no cure.

I get so anxious it is embarrassing, my partner needs a grown up not a grown child. It's getting to the point I can't even go to pick something up from the shop without having a major panic, it frustrates me and I stand behind the door until I get enough strength to go out.

I keep making mistakes and my mood gets the better of me, I am constantly having some kind of emotional breakdown.

I can't bear it, she deserves so much more. My Dad passed last March, I just want to be with him.
