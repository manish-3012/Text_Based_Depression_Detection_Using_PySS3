my catIf I close the door, heâ€™ll be there, wondering where I am, why I wonâ€™t let him in my room. Will he know Iâ€™m dead? I bet heâ€™d be able to sense it. Heâ€™d be all alone, scared, for god knows how long. 

If I keep the door open, thatâ€™s just... sick. I imagine him coming into my room to lie in bed with me (he sleeps with me every night) and him pawing at me, not knowing whatâ€™s wrong but knowing Iâ€™m not really there, knowing that Iâ€™m dead but not knowing why or how. 


I canâ€™t take him somewhere. I couldnâ€™t bear preemptively leaving him, knowing thatâ€™s the last time Iâ€™ll ever see him. He hates car rides, he hates when I leave him. According to my old roommate, when Iâ€™m out of the house he always sits by the window, and his whole body perks up when he hears my car coming down the rode. He gets so excited. He meows at me in the window as Iâ€™m walking up. 

Never thought a cat would be the reason I didnâ€™t kill myself, at least for the time being.
