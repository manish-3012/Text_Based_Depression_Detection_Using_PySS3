Im really not okayFuck this shit. I'm a piece of shit drug addict. Nobody cares but my parents. I'm not afraid to die anymore I'm not afraid to just end my fucking life. I don't care what people think when I'm gone, they'll get over it. I have nobody no friends nothing. I have people that "care" people that arnt there when I need them. Everybody is out having fun with other people while I sit in front of my computer contemplating suicide. I haven't left my house besides going to my classes in months. I've been multiple antidepressants and they all seem to make me worse. On on Lexapro right now. My anxiety is gone for the most part since I started taking 30mg of baclofen a day. I'm in my business class right now and I just can't focus with all these thoughts going through my head. I want to fie, everything is just crumbling apart.
