i don't have the will to livei have no friends no acquaintances no family that would love me (though i love them)  no hobbies i'm good at. i am an ugly and fat 14 years old person (female) without any sense of humor. i now have two enemies in my class, others just ignore me. even on the internet everyone ignores me no matter how hard i try to be interesting. i want to move out of my country but i can't due to my age.  i would try to change myself in another place, but i can't do it here in my neighbourhoods, in my city and maybe even in my country. i just want to die. i am not good at anything, i am too depressed to try  to find some new hobbies. sometimes i think  my life will be pointless even when i  grow up, i still won't have any friends or just acquaintances and it all will be just the same as now. i cry everyday, i feel so pathetic.
