What to spend $10k onGraduated college last year with a useless degree. Worked min wage job canâ€™t find anything else. Was d1 athlete and 4.0 student. Still live at home. No car, lots of debt. Younger siblings in high school both make more than me. Hate life, hate myself, just a leech. Play video games not because theyâ€™re fun but to take my mind off my self hate. Isolated all my friends. What can I do with all my money before I kill myself?
