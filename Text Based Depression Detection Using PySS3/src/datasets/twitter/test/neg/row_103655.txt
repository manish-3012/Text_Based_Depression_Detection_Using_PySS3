A Continuation of 1.3- 2.8 Seconds, or Rather Why keep trying?This is a continued thought from earlier posts of the  title 1.3-2.8 Seconds.

I keep getting closer to it. I still have a devout love (as mush as I am to him), a good family (my niece is turning 2 tomorrrow), a great job (I didn't get the promotion; there's always another chance), and the aspect of obtaining a job after. Yet, I still wish to die.

Many people take their lives because of what is here in this world. A lack of friends, of a job, of interaction. To me though, I want to end out of curiosity. 

How can any one of us say what is after? Whether it be Heaven, Hell, or nothing? We don't know. We are limited by our own scope of things from our own eyes.




I beg you Redditors, tell me first: am I alone in wanting to end for the above reasons? Secondly? What would you propose to let me continue living this life of curiosity? 


I am so torn that it makes a grown man cry.
