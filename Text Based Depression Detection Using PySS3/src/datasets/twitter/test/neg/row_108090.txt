I don't know whether to try to improve my life or think more seriously about ending itI've been a bad person. An addict, a cheater, a dropout, a liar, a flake. I'm 22 and married but my parents still spend thousands of dollars a year on my existence. I'm back in school now but I've barely done any work because I'm lazy and sleep all the time instead of going to class. 

I'm happy plenty of times, until I remember all the stuff I'm bad at. I used to believe in constant self-betterment and achieving deep fulfillment, but I've since realized I'm no good at that. I like my area of study, I like my hobbies, I like my friends, but I'm not inspired to actually improve at any of those. Constant self improvement and honesty are the most important values to me, but I fail at both of those. A lot of times the fear of disappointing my husband is the only thing that makes me even try in my life at all. 

A not insignificant part of me wants to do a bunch of drugs and fuck his best friend so he'll hate me. Then I won't feel bad killing myself (he said he'd leave me anyway if I tried and failed.)
