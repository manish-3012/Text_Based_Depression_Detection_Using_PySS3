ðŸ˜•Honestly, I'll be up front and say I don't have the balls to kill myself (plus I've made a promise not to) but it gets harder and harder to keep the promise. Walking my dogs, my thoughts go to "tie them up to a tree, run in front of a car", or lock my bedroom door and leave a note for my parents to call the coroner and not enter the room, or my personal go to of visualization of me running face first into a plate glass window and hoping for the worst. Lately though, the thoughts have become more like how far is it from the attic window to the ground/driveway/yard and how my climbing rope is all static so that'd break my neck with ease, right? My anxiety is through the roof, my depression is thicker than a San Francisco fog. I've been looking for jobs and valuing myself accordingly but can't land anything beyond less than 10/hr. I look at my ex who, in the last couple months, has become happier, more effervescent and I'm really fucking happy for her, but I wasted 2 years of her life and made her miserable. I make everyone around me miserable or push them away. Life genuinely feels like it's not worth trying anymore because whatever I do, others become happier because of me but I just get sadder and more depressed. Currently I'm curled up in my closet, wiping away tears that aren't fully formed and hoping that I can mellow out. I genuinely don't wanna keep doing this routine anymore of try try try and just get ignored. I openly talk about my suicidal thoughts to keep myself in check. If others know where my head is at, then it's harder to get away wth. Being alone is nice, but my thoughts take over and push me to the brink. I've been at this brink for so long that the idea of dieing isn't scary to me anymore. It looks less like something to fear and more like a weight that could be lifted from my shoulders. I give no shits how others feel if I were to do it. Frankly, if you gave a fuck then why haven't people tried to be there for me? Huh
 Fuck, I hate myself.
