I ruined my life and there's no point anymoreMy compulsive lying and mental instability ruined my relationship with the only person in my life I love more than anything. Now I have no relationship no goals or anything in life and no one would fucking want me with all the baggage I come with. I break literally everything in my life. From my car to my phone to my job and now the love of my life. I feel like he would be better off without me. I'm 24 years old and can't do adult things. I ruined our future. I don't deserve a future.
