til i dont think i can actually get helpi went to a psychiatrist. didnâ€™t get diagnosed but she straight up told me i have depression and anxiety. then followed up by saying that if i was really suicidal, then im going to be put in inpatient care to make sure i was safe. she pretty much asked the same things that i looked up which made me realize i am suicidal, which pretty much scared me into actually admitting i want and need helpâ€¦ so i just lied and said the same â€œplans for the futureâ€ that i tell everyone else.

i cant even get meds bc im only 15. this shits only going to get worse. i canâ€™t get anything done bc all i can do is sleep and if i donâ€™t sleep i cant get anything done bc all i do is procrastinate. i cant even finish a single load of laundry. i start everything that i can never finish and im always in too deep to back out. i make friends and i never actually get close to them. im pretty sure i accidentally lead some people on and now i have to avoid any friendship with them bc if not everything is just going to get weird and awkward again just like it did last year. i actually told two friends i thought i was comfortable talking to bc they would listen, abt being really suicidal â€œin the beginning of the yearâ€ (as if that has changed for the better) and both of them donâ€™t acknowledge it when we talk and to essentially summarize what they said, it was just oh.

i feel like i got so used to lying and faking that im not thinking about killing myself every waking moment and crying myself to sleep and sleeping any chance i can get bc i have no better way to cope. now i canâ€™t actually open up in person about all my problems.

tldr; talking to a psychiatrist/friends just made me more paranoid so i just made lying me norm, and now iâ€™m afraid of actually getting help.
