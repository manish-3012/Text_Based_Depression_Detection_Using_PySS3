Am I depressed or am I just looking for attention?I definitely have anxiety and I think I have some kind of borderline disorder. I'm 16 and I had one friend in the world until my "clinginess" made him put a lot of space between us. I feel like I am battling myself to be a well rounded person. I feel like there's something wrong with me and I'm destined to fail in life because of it. All I want in life is to start a family and grow old I feel like I won't be able to do that because of the bad part of my personality. When I am faced with thoughts of how I have no friends or examples of my own inadequacy, I fall down this slippery slope of what I think is depression. I get this pit in my stomach and I don't want to do anything but sit and stew on those feelings. When I get this way all I do is lay down or talk about how I should kill myself. I don't think I'd ever actually do it because my family loves me but I've noticed myself doing it just to make people notice. Is it all just made up in the back of my head to get people's attention?
