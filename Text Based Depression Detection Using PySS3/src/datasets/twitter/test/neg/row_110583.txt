tired of hearing it'll get betterI don't see a future, I just see how many days left until I finally feel able to go through with my plan. but I don't want to hurt anybody who might care. I wish I could just decide not to have ever been here in the first place so it didn't have any effect, or didn't hurt anyone. but I don't have any effect on the world alive so. idk what the point is. this is just a vent like nobody needs to reply I just dk anymore
