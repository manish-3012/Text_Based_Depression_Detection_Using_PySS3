Please helpI dont know what to do, im sitting here in my bath tub deciding if i should slit my wrist. I started writting a note to my family, but just writting it made me think how much it would hurt my parents. Ive been having really bad paranoid thoughts, even to then point that i suggested that my boyfriend tried to hurt me intentionally when he didnt, but theyre just my thoughts. And no one understands they just think im weak. Im scared to die but i just dont know what to do... even just thinking that im scared makes me feel like im weak and i should just get it over with. I need help and no one wants to help me they just think im crazy, awkward, ill mannered... so just tell me what to do, because im trying to talk myself down but i just start thinking of more reasons why i should.
