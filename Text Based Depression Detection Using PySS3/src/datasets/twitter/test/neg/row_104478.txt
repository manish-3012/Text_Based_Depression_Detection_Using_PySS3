No one close to me will ever read this but need to get this off my chestI have tried and tried and tried again to understand why I am the way I am. I have never been an emotional person, in fact strong emotion makes me uncomfortable. My friends used to call me Spock , I used to wear it like a badge of honor now I see that it has only allowed me to rationalize my behavior. I do not even think my own parents even truly know me, I wear a well crafted mask, I pretend to care when I don't, I avoid emotional and physical connections, giving someone a hug makes me want to vomit in my mouth. 

I believe I only married my wife because of my family's approval of her. In fact I feel like my wife is closer with my own family then I am. I am so emotionally detached that even the thought of suicide does not give me strong emotions one way or the other, I haven't gone through with it t I am still trying to rationalize what purpose someone like me has in this world. Sure I feel empathy and I know right from wrong.

I can't tell you what my favorite color is because I have none, I have no hobbies nor the desire to find one. 

I have no purpose
