If working is the only way to live then I just want to die.I don't want to work. I just called out sick and now I'm laying in bed and crying. I'm just ranting because it feels like no one in my real life understands. They always say "well this is life" "everyone has to work" and basically tell me to just suck it up and cope.

But I can't.  Nothing in my life outweighs the fact that I have to be stressed at work everyday. I have a boyfriend and a dad who love me. But it's not enough. Quitting will probably also make me want to die because I'll just be burdening people financially. 

There's no escape except suicide for me. My dream is to quit my job, use the rest of my savings then die.
