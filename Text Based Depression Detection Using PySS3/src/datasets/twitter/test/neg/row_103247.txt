Iâ€™m only alive because of my familyEvery night, when I try to make myself fall asleep is when it hits me the strongest: I see it as a vision in my head, the various ways I could kill myself. Sometimes itâ€™s jumping, sometimes carbon monoxide poisoning, slashing. Itâ€™s almost a fantasy. Itâ€™s a fantasy. Iâ€™ve never harmed myself in any way because I just know my mom and husband would find out and it would drive them insane; theyâ€™d blame themselves even though I know I am the problem. 

I love my family. But sometimes, in my darkest moments, I canâ€™t help but think how unfair it is that I have to stay alive just because of them.
