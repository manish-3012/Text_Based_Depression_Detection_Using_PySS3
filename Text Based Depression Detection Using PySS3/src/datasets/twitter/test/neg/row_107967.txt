A life of empty luxuriesIdk why I'm writing this, other than I hurt. I worked hard to have a good life, I moved to a big city, got an extremely high paying job doing something I like doing. I drive a very expensive flashy car, and it sounds so nice, but I'm alone. I have no contact with people, my job is completely remote. 

I recently left my girlfriend because I didn't love her anymore. I am coming apart at the seams and feel like I have lived a huge lie, I thought nice things and women would make me happy. I slept with women that loved me that I didn't love back over and over again. I lied to them and told them I loved them. I felt so bad when I realized what I was doing. 

The last girl I dated, before leaving her, I bought her a car so she could get herself together better. And she wrecked it on the way back to my place. She slammed in to the back of my extremely expensive car, with no insurance or license. Maybe I deserve it.

 A few weeks ago I met a girl that I felt real feelings for. Something that I haven't felt in 10+ years. God I felt so alive for the first time in so very long. She said she felt the same and wanted to start a relationship. Today, she told me an unforgivable lie. My first taste of something real in a long time with a woman, and it was immediately poisoned. I had to stop seeing her. I guess I deserve that too.

Now, slowly the realization dawned on me that I'm completely alone in the world with not a single person to be my friend. I moved to this city and I don't get along with most people. I mean I do on a surface level, most people like me, and find me very funny and easy to talk with, but I don't like them. 

I am a terrible human being even though I have tried my best the whole time to not be. Everything I've done was for nothing. I hurt many people, and I became obsessed with status. Now I sit on a throne of shit. I'm sorry, I didn't know.
