LifeCan anyone please help me. I feel worthless, lonely, depressed, anxious, suicidal. Iâ€™m only 15, and I feel no one would care, let alone notice that I was dead. I have to go to jail (school) everyday and I am getting stressed from the homework. and I feel like the teachers donâ€™t care about what Iâ€™m going through, and how hard it is to do homework when all I want is to be dead. I am pretty much not allowed to be happy, when I am actually happy, they tell us to stop talking and do your homework... I have nothing I feel proud about, and I canâ€™t do anything of my own to feel self-confident in myself. I want to try to change the school system, but I am anxious that people will make fun of me. Yea... I need help
