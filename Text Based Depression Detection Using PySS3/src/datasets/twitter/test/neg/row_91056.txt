I wish..I wish I wasn't born with a birth defect (cleft lip). 
I wish I had friends when I was in elementary school.
I wish I could be funny and interesting.
I wish I could walk the halls of my high school without shaking every time I walk past someone.
I wish I could go back and tell myself to be quiet about my depression before it was too late.
I wish my friends trusted me.
I wish I could keep a conversation going for longer than a few minutes.
I wish I was the good guy.
I wish I could stop getting rejected by every girl I ask out.
I wish the first (and only) girl that told me she liked/loved me didn't lie leave me a week later.
I wish my family accepted me for who I was.
I wish I could kill myself without hurting everyone.
I wish, I was someone else, someone better, someone that people would look up to, but no matter how hard I try, it's always the same result. The only thing I can do is wait, and wish things would change.
