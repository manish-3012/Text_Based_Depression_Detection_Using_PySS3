The fear no longer outweighs the dreadI donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting here again. People rarely answer at all and I donâ€™t know if changing my mind is possible at this point.

I am so fucking exhausted. I constantly hurt. People treat me like Iâ€™m disposable. My amazon cart is loaded up with the stuff I need and all I need now is for payday to come and to finish a project Iâ€™m on at work. 

Itâ€™s almost over. And even though I know itâ€™s not over yet, I feel relief knowing that itâ€™s coming soon.
