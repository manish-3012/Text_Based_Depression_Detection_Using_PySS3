i think its really going to happeni dont know when
i dont know where
all i know is that shes burned into my brain and i cant live with her voice still ringing in my ears
shes happy now and im just drunk all the time
too fucked up to make sense of my own feelings
when i hung up last night i cried for hours
wishing you would come back and put our lives back together
you were my last hope
and now that youre gone theres nothing left
im so ready to leave this all behind
my friends tell me things will get better
but the only way they were better was when i was with you
despite all the toxic shit we put each other through
i would give up everything just to be with you again
but that will never happen
neither of us could do this all again
so live your life and be happy
and please dont be mad when they find me dead in a hole somewhere
