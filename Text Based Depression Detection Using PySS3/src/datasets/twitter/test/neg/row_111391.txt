Iâ€™ll do it when iâ€™m 25When I was in middle school I told myself that if life didnâ€™t get better by the time I was 25 Iâ€™d kill myself then. Iâ€™m not going to get into crazy details about my mental health but it fluctuates a lot and even in the good times, itâ€™s always there lurking. I also have awful self esteem issues and ADD which makes general functioning so hard. 

Iâ€™m turning 21 in a week and a bit so that means I have 4 years left. Iâ€™m not afraid of death but iâ€™m afraid of how friends and family will feel when I do die. But iâ€™ve lost a lot of friends in the past year so maybe all of them will be gone by then. 

Iâ€™ve lived a lot of my life in my head imagining a perfect life as a means to escape which makes snapping back to reality so painful. I know that realistically in real life iâ€™ll never live the really good lives iâ€™ve made up in my head. Iâ€™ve never been in love, iâ€™m not outgoing the way I want to be, I donâ€™t like the way I look, and honestly I donâ€™t see any of that changing. 

Iâ€™ve lived a pretty good life, in fact people would be jealous of my life, but iâ€™m still depressed so whoâ€™s to say that even IF i have that perfect life iâ€™ll be happy? Iâ€™ll still be anxious about everything, iâ€™ll still have self esteem issues and iâ€™ll still have my ADD. 

It kind of nice to know that I only have 4 years left (unless something happens before). This means that I can live my life to the fullest because I know iâ€™m on a deadline. Iâ€™ll travel, be more likely to say yes to outings, will care less about how I look because it doesnâ€™t matter, iâ€™ll be gone soon anyways. 

I donâ€™t have to worry about the future because there is none. This deadline as morbid as it sounds feels so freeing. The older you get the more problems you collect and I canâ€™t really see myself in the future being 50 with half a centuryâ€™s worth of problems. 

I have 4 years, and iâ€™m gonna try my fucking hardest to live those years to my fullest.
