The date has been set, but I need advice.I've set a date. It's less than a month away. There are only two things left now. My boyfriend has sworn that he'll go with me, but I don't want him to do that. He needs to move on. I love him so so much. Should I break up with him before I do it? Also, I am very afraid of failing again because they'll send me back to the hospital. 
Edit:
The date has been removed for now. Maybe not permanently, but I'm slowly getting better.
