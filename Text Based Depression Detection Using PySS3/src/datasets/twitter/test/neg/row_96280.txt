After committing suicide.If you believe in an afterlife, what do you think happens next? Will we be punished? I have read many NDEs and I am really curious. I wish I could assure myself that it will be ok. I know my family will be okay without me. Just need to know that after will be ok, and that the 9mm to the grapefruit wont hurt..
