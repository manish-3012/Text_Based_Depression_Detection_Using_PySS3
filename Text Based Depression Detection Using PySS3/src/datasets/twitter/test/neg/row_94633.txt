Not going to make it to 2020 lolIm too boring and bad at socializing to have friends. I only have an online bf makes me feel like a prop to his fantasy but it's better than having no one to talk to. I cant make a career out of what I love because it's art. I barely do art anyway. I just see no reason to do anything. Why am I even here? So yeah. That's that. Looking for a solid place to at least partially hang and I'm set. See ya.
