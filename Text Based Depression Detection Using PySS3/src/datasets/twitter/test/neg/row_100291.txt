Always pissing everyone offWhy can't I just keep my damn mouth shut? Everytime I talk I just make everyone angry. I can never say anything right, do anything right, think anything right. I'm just an annoyance and a thorn in everyone's side. It would be so much better if I just don't say a fucking word, never try anything, never do anything. I should be locked away where I won't bother anybody. 

I can't help that I'm fucking awkward and can't be a normal functioning person. If I just stopped doing everything wrong everyone would be happier. But nope, can't do that to save my fucking life. God I'm a useless sack of fucking shit, I never should've been born. There are so many potentially better people to be born, so why the fuck did it have to be me?? Why do I still exist when I'm obviously not worthy of living?! Wish I could just drop dead, then I wouldn't be a fucking burden
