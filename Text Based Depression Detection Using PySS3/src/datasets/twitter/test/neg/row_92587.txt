Here we go
Itâ€™s been a hard couples of months or even years and Iâ€™ve been trying really hard to deal with it
My only regret is that I was ever born . For a lot of years Iâ€™ve been fighting it but I just donâ€™t know  anymore . A few weeks before all the outbreak began I tried drinking some pills and probably fucked my liver. 
I talked with my therapist about  and she said I needed to be medicated and I made  an appointment with a psychiatrist ( Iâ€™ve been misdiagnosed before ) and made an appointment and now with the whole outbreak itâ€™s canceled . This quarantine is messing my mental health so horrible and I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore
