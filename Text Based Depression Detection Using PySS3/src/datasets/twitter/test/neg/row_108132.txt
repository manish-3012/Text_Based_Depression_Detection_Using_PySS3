they'd be better off without meI cheated on my wife. She was my best friend. I've had super selfish tendencies my whole life and I've ruined almost every relationship I've ever had. I've ruined her life. She's so unhappy. She's so hurt. I can't stand to continue to watch her hurt this way. She's an incredible mother and she'd be so much better off without me. My kids don't need to know what I did, they just need me to be gone before I ruin their lives too.
