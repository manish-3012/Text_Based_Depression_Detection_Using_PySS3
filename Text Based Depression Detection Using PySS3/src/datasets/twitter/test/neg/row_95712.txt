How much is too much to share with a Suicide Hotline?Iâ€™m not trying to get committed. Iâ€™m not trying to be on the line for $3-$4k for an involuntary stay at a psychiatric hospital and Iâ€™m certainly not trying to have my whole life implode because Iâ€™m trying to reach out to someone who can at least get the ball rolling on some help. 

I want to call the suicide hotline. Even though I already have a pretty good guess as to the fact that they will be less than helpful and woefully disappointing in the experience offered, I want to call. First time calling, and I donâ€™t have much hope but I want to know what to not say in order to have them not overreact and call police/ambulances to â€œrescue meâ€. Serious replies only.
