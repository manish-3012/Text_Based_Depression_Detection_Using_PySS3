I'm at the beginning of a manic episodeI stopped taking my bipolar meds a week ago. I've slept 3 hours in the past 48. I feel a deep inner restlessness, and I keep having vivid visions of finally ending it. I've been chained to this bed for months... I fear the increased energy level may be the push I need to go through with it.

It feels as though a weight is being lifted off of me.
