I want to end it but things keep holding me back. Please help me, I need people to talk toI have a decent life. I have a girlfriend for over 8 years who keeps supporting me and I have therapy. Still there are things in life that keep fucking me over and i don't know what to do. I slack off and stay home gaming all day instead of going to college. I lie to my parents about multiple unnecessary things and I keep breaking everyones trust. My first suicide attempt was a year ago after being depressed for over 6 years and having suicidal thoughts for 2 years. I have been in the hospital 2 times this year because of overdoses of misc meds. And tried ending it with sleeping pills and  pure ethanol(alcohol). I have a wonderful friend who came to my aid multiple times and stopped me from jumping and overdosing myself. I have the stinging feeling that I want to die because i do not want to hurt people but i also hurt them by killing myself. Im scared of pain so for me cutting or hanging is not an option. I recently got a new puppy which is keeping me up right now. Im feeling happy because of that but my college is going bad again. Im thinking of ending it again after all the help people gave me and I don't want to disappoint them. Please help i need people to talk to
