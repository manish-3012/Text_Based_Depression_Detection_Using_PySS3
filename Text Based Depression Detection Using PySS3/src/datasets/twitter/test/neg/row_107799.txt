my body is disgusting to me and the world hates me for itim trans

I've been here a few times and just keep coming back

my body is still horribly disgusting to me. I can't stand it and knowing ill never be able to fix it.

on top of that there's so much vitriol aimed at trans people now and dozens of bills that make it clear im not welcome in society

so I feel like dying because my body is wrong and society at large reinforces that my body is disgusting and ill never be a real woman, and if someone saw me coming out of a women's room, or a straight man saw me from a distance and was accidentally attracted to me, they would beat or kill me. if I try to stand up for myself there's a good chance radical feminists will find my personal info and start a campaign of harassment against me because they hate trans women

im just tired of trying to live in a world that manifestly doesn't want me while struggling to live in a body that disgusts me and everyone around me. I don't want to give satisfaction to those clamoring for my death, but I just don't have the will to resist anymore. you win, world, im a disgusting delusional perverted freak whatever you wanna call me, just please kill me already.
