Can't stop thinking about itI have a couple of specific methods in mind. I'd say there's a 20% chance I'll go through with it tonight. I just can't handle the idea of my boyfriend finding my body. He loves Christmas. I don't want to ruin it for him. But I cannot stop thinking about suicide. I've stopped making plans with people, stopped caring for myself, stopped... pretty much everything because I'm only going to kill myself anyway.

We've discussed the idea of me moving out for a week or so because I am difficult to be around at the moment. I am a burden. I am a terrible partner. I don't want to go on any more.
