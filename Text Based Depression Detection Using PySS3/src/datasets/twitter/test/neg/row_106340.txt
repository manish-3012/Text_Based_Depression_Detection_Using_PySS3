How long do anxiety and anti depressant meds take to work?Hi, I'm getting an emergency appointment with the GP tomorrow, I need an urgent solution because I really can't cope day to day (reasons explained in another thread). I should be able to seek therapy as a long term solution but in the mean time I need some anti depressants and anti anxiety medication, do they help straight away or do they take a long time to work, I really have been getting my hopes up that this will ease it in the short term until I can finish exams and get to working in my job (which I love so I know my mood will improve).  
  
Thanks for taking the time out of your day to read my incoherent ramblings.
