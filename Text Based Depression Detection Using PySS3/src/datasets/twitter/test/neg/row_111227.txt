I want to tell someone, but i don't want to tell anyone i know. I've been ready to kill myself and thought my way out of it 12 times now, but i've never felt so alone and depressed.I had a shitty childhood, and a depressed/anxious teen time. I'm 25 now and it just doesn't feel like it's ever going to get better.

I have friends, and im in an open relationship with a girl, but i just don't feel connected to anyone. I haven't really had much family in years (just a grandmother). I just started a new job, but it doesn't seem to distract me like work used to.

I'm so tired.

I've never been afraid of death, only of the pain and failure that i could find instead.

Why can't it be time now? What if i've never wanted to be alive? I don't feel loved by or connected to anyone in my life. My baseline is rock bottom, and anything better than that feels like so much effort.

Why not?
