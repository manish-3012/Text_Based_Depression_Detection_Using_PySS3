At 2:37 AM I always want to end it allI donâ€™t know why I do this to myself, I just canâ€™t sleep I think Iâ€™m scared to. I think pushing it off makes it somehow easier, because every night when I finally convince myself that I need sleep I start to think about things that I never wanted to think of, how I fucked everything up today, what I said wrong, how I couldâ€™ve said it better, how I always manage to make everyone feel terrible and I just canâ€™t help but think Iâ€™m a burden and that it would be better if I was gone. But I canâ€™t leave everyone behind I just I promised someone I wouldnâ€™t and I canâ€™t try to break that promise again. I just wouldnâ€™t mind falling asleep and never waking up again.
