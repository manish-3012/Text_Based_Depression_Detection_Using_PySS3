I'm setting an ultimatumI got fired last fall. While it wasn't a serious problem, it was due to my carelessness. I still haven't found a job since then. After every interview, I can feel the disappointment; interviewers might as well slap me on the face and tell me to just end it already. I'm losing motivation by the day, I have no other skills to support myself on, and I'm not very smart. The longer this takes, the more it pushes back the acquisition of my degree. I was supposed to finish this spring, but now it looks like I won't be done for another year.

My long dormant depression has returned like a ghost knocking at the door. I've been a drain on people in my college and on my parents. If I had friends, it would be the same for them.

Maybe people won't read my post, but I guess I wanted a place to commit to this in case my lack of courage gets to me. If I don't get a job by the summer, I'm going to kill myself.
