After two strangers saved meI had a long wonder and after a long time I thought it was inevitable that I would die tonight, I went to a different, higher place and I just sat there staring at the stars thinking about how beautiful life is, but I knew it was the only way I could feel better. A lot of police cane and took me to my mothers, I really really just want to be okay:(
