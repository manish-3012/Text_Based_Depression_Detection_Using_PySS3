I'll just post it here. This is probably ignored anywaysHere's backstory. So I'm a math major in my college. I'm not the greatest, but I'll put the time and effort when I can. So I love mathematics, I have a ton of books on it, I study it and read a lot about it. I try to understand what goes on and I love everything about it. 

So finals come, and I study my arse off for the month. I ignore the world completely, and I study hard and crazy and I still recall most (if not all the material). On the day of the test (that's when the beans get nervous and I was contemplating about committing first degree murder on myself). I don't opt for it, and I tried really hard and the material is really difficult and I failed the exam (quite miserably to tell the truth (his exam was hard). The course grade comes out to be about a 60. Ok not a big deal when you see how much the final grade was, it comes to about a B-. This isn't really fair (seeing how the class average was about a 70 and he was going to curve if needed and mentions that in class and no curve. College logic). But then come my analysis class (Oh my god I fail that and I studied about 4 hours a day for that class.) I get a C in the class and now what? I can't go to graduate school because they want to see As and high B marks there in math. 

So I've actually been contemplating about this for a while. I asked around what I can do, and my advisor in my math department said well you can try getting a job and live life liking math. But to me that's a life that's meaningless. Like the thought of suicide was there but then now not being able to do what you want to do because you study hard and not show it in a test is just ridiculous and stupid. Most of our professors are of no help, and I feel useless the more I look at the material and I just wanna grab my kitchen knife sometimes and just stab myself because of it. Then on nights, I hold back looking at it and saying I should have cheated multiple times till I knock out and repeat this process.

Please just help me.
