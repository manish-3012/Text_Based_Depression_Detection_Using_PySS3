It feels like my mind wants to fly out from this bodyToo many things are wrong and Iâ€™ve tried too hard to make them better. And now I just want to leave. I know there must be a better place out there but I wonder why I and others have to suffer here... itâ€™s not fair. 
I have problems inside my head I think, and then problems outside my head and all I can really conclude here is maybe Iâ€™m too lazy to fix them or maybe they were never meant to be fixed? Iâ€™m just so overwhelmed with everything and I just hate being an adult (Iâ€™m 22). 

Iâ€™m supposed to be figuring out college, how to get insurance because I canâ€™t be on either of my parents, how to save money. Iâ€™m trying to figure out whatâ€™s wrong with and why I think certain ways, get angry or upset or think thereâ€™s signs directed to me or whatever. Iâ€™m trying to figure out how to have energy to do anything at all. I work and after I work I canâ€™t do anything else. I always think I deserve a day off but I donâ€™t. I take 4 classes; it was 5 but I dropped out of one. And I am 3 weeks behind on all my homework. I donâ€™t even know where the time goes I guess I just sleep I really donâ€™t know. 

I only work 3 days a week which is a little under $200 paycheck and my friend who doesnt go to school makes me feel like shit and always asks me to go places and I just donâ€™t know what is wrong with her as to why they donâ€™t understand why I have no money. My dad has no money so Iâ€™ve had a lot of things that I needed to pay. My mom is retired and I donâ€™t ask her for money anyways because I genuinely feel no connection with her and it is the worst feeling in the world. 

People just donâ€™t like me either. I donâ€™t know what I do wrong I know I am awkward but Iâ€™ve never been mean.. I donâ€™t know. I just kind of mind my business most of the time and I canâ€™t fake being someone Iâ€™m not... and so I just donâ€™t talk to that many people I guess. Everyone else seems to always have people interested in them just meeting them for the first time and with me... no one looks twice, no one cares.


Long story short; in every way possible I feel I donâ€™t fit in here. In every aspect. I feel like the time is coming closer to call it quits and the days move too fast
