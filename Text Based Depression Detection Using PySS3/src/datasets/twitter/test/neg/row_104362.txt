Yet another desperate guyI'm posting anonymously (yes I'm paranoid). I don't know where to begin, I failed at almost everything I ever tried and I'm about to fail again, just proving the fact that I'm just a looser. In the past, my bouts of depression led me to seek help which I did, but I got it working only for a while.

Now I'm back to depression and I'm more depressed than ever because as I'm getting older, I feel I'm losing grip, I have no control anymore and even my support network is getting smaller and smaller. There's no more than 2-3 people who really care for me and I'm just living through my messy life because I wouldn't want them to hurt.
What do you do when you feel your life is meaningless and you're stuck in a job you don't like? You try something else? Then if you fail and you end up in an even worse situation, it just prove you're a big looser who will never achieve anything. I try to stay positive and just keep fighting, as if finding a new job would change anything. Maybe it would help, but maybe I'm just another looser who will end up on social security after I run out of unemployment insurance.

For now, I have no self-esteem at all, my sense of worthiness was based on what I achieved while I was working full time and it was also based on my achievements in activities outside my job but all of it is irrelevant now. I'm just a big looser who struggled with depression and social anxiety for almost its entire life and just when I thought I was about to get rid of it, I'm falling back. It's as if, no matter what I try, I just find a way to mess it up. Going back to school may be another way to boost self esteem but right now, I feel I will just mess it up again because of depression and lack of motivation. I wake at noon almost everyday...
