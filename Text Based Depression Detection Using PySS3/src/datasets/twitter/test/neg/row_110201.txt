I'm 19 and ready to end my short lifeI just can't take it anymore. I've been dealing with depression ever since I was a young child, and didn't seek help until I turned 12. I've been in and out of therapy and it's just not working. I've been on so many medicines I've lost track, and I've been admitted into a hospital two times because of my mental state. (Both willingly)

I know things can get better, but it's not always guaranteed and I can't stand that. I feel like all I am is a worthless stoner who isn't going to do anything with their life. Ever since I graduated high school, nothing has gotten better. I can't motivate myself to do anything other than to make money to get more weed.

I still live with my parents and it impacts my mental health so much, but I cannot financially afford to move somewhere else, and if I could, it'll be hard to find a place that would allow me to keep a dog. My dog has been such a stresser. I didn't properly train him when he was a puppy, so I don't know what the fuck to do.

Everything stresses me out. I've been having anxiety attacks on the daily for the past week, and I'm just so ready to end my life. I hate that people told me it would be better after high school because it just seems so much worse. All my problems wouldn't have an impact on me if I was dead. And I know, they would then impact someone else, but I've always been selfless for my life, so I just want to do this one selfish thing.

I'm so tired of waiting for life to happen. I just want it to be over and it's barely even started..
