Feeling so many urges and death pulling me.Ever since Ive been sober, my depressive episodes have been worse and worse. I feel so many urges to leave and I want tonight to be last night. Nothing goes right.

I look up to the rafters and see myself hanging. I think of just fucking shooting myself. Making a lethal cocktail. Hanging myself. Sitting in my shitty car.

Why does life pull me into bad directions. People dont think of dying as much as I do. I dont even think of suicide, but then I flash images of me dying.

I think soon, Ill probably commit suicide. I dont want to wake up tired anymore, or sore, or upset, or a burden, or a failure. Im done with it honestly. I have so many health issues. My parents dont care about me. Im so lonely. I have 2 anchors in life left, and one is about to leave, I suspect.

Life shouldnt be this hard.
