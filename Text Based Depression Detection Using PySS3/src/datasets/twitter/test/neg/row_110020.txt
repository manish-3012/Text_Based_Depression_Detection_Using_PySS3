13 and tired of the pain          Iâ€™m 13 and am suffering from chronic depression and thinking about suicide. My parents are divorced and I have to go back and forth between house every other week and itâ€™s like moving to an entire different home every week. After a while it just gets tedious and tiring. 
          My teachers are literally LOOKING for reasons to act like crap towards me even though Iâ€™m a straight A student and great listener. They MAKE up reasons to make my parents disappointed of me and are just so mean. 
          I only have one friend. Lets just call him â€œDaveâ€ Dave is a good friend and is always there to pick me up when Iâ€™m feeling down. Heâ€™s my neighbor and goes to my school. I go over to his house and just hang out and talk about life. Our parents are great friends and make us go to summer camps and make us do stuff together all the time. Then he was hit by a freaking CAR and died. Now I have no friends.
         When Iâ€™m at school I eat lunch by myself. In the rare occasion that Iâ€™m not sent to detention for some teachers â€œmade upâ€ reason when I go to recess I play outside by myself. I sit by myself in class. I stand in the car line to wait and go home by myself. I used to do all that with Dave. But heâ€™s gone now.
          I asked my Mother a theoretical question about â€œWhat would you do if I somehow died before you?â€ She replied â€œSeeing as that Iâ€™m not married and only have you as my one child. I would have nothing else to live for and would commit suicide.â€ This is the only reason that I have not done it yet. Because of some form of sick, twisted, unintentional form of corrupt blackmail. I have chosen to not kill myself yet.
          
          Reddit, I have a question for you. Is it worth living in constant agony to keep my mother alive. Or could I just end my suffering. Every day is agony and I donâ€™t know what to do.
