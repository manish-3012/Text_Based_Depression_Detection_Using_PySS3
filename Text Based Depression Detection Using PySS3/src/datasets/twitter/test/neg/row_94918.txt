Canâ€™t think of a reason not to do itWhen the constant gut feeling says, â€œYou should do it. You should do it...â€

Then all external forces seem to be whispering to me, â€œYou should do it. You should do it...â€

From the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep, the overpowering emotion is, â€œYou should do it. You should do it...â€

It is pervasive when I am at work, when I eat, when I relax, when I exercise. I cannot get rid of it. I just want everything to end and am coming closer to making solid plans. Iâ€™m just tired of everything.
