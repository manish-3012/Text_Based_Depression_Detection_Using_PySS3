Is now the best time?I'm currently at home sick, with my whole family gone till 5-6. I've wanted to die since 4 years ago. My last suicide attempt didn't go as planned; took 3 bottles of pills, but just managed to vomit them all up in my sleep. There are train tracks that run through a wooded area that takes 5-10 minutes to walk to. I've already cleaned up the whole house and I'm contemplating packing away all my stuff and just doing it. It'd be no mess for my parents to clean up and they would probably not have to see my mangled corpse. I think now is the best time. Should I?
