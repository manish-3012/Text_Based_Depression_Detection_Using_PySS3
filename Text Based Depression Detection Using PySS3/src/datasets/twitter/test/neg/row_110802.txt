Idk anymoreThis is something I have thought about for the past year and I need to get it off my chest even on a throwaway:
I have fucked up a lot of shit in my life. Enough for me to not be able to go back. I have my 9mm next to me the bullet loaded and everything. And I just look at it a think this shit could end within 5 seconds. But for some reason I don't. I have felt empty and lifeless for a long ass time and honestly just don't know what to do anymore. I may not kill myself or maybe I will idk. I am not afraid of death. I've attempted once and that fucked my life up tremendously. I'm afraid that if I do it this time and I fuck up and dont die I'm going to be a vegetable in a shit ton of pain. I guess I just gotta wait and see what happens.
