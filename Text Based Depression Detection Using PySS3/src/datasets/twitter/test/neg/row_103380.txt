Woke up to the worst news of my life.There has been something that I have been avoiding. Trying to tell myself that it wont ever happen and being hopeful. I've tried everything to get out of it but I realize I'm completely hopeless. I've talked to everyone, my parents, my friends, but they just said I was making excuses or looking for attention. I'm sweating like crazy, trying not to cry. My whole mind feels numb but I know now the only way out is by killing myself. I have till March but hopefully I'll have the courage to be gone before then.
