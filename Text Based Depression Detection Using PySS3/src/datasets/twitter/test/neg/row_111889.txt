am i living for myself or for others?This is my first time posting here so hello everybody. 

Everyday has been pretty dreadful. Suicide has not been on my mind lately but regardless of that, I still cannot get out of bed and really "live." I talk to my friends about how I feel and honestly, most of them can't offer support since they really don't know what it's like to feel the way I do (that's why I'm giving this subreddit a shot). Living feels like an absolute burden some days. Eating, drinking, or even showering just isn't part of my schedule and I couldn't even be bothered by those tedious tasks. Yet some other days, the sun is beautiful and I don't feel the need to curse at it as it creeps through my blinds midday. I've considered suicide in the past and came close to attempting it (I stopped because a friend called me and told me he was coming over to pick something up and I just didn't want them to feel disappointed). Most days I do think about dying and how I would be so much happier that way. My sister, my mother, my father, and my friends; they would miss me so dearly and I wish I wasn't like this. Suicide does feel like the only answer to me but I don't want it to be. I need help.
