So I am defeated.So my mom - my rock and the only person who loved me unconditionally - died a few years ago.  I was really struggling with her death and my husband and 20 year old daughters confronted me. I told them that I was struggling with suicide (for so many reasons- not just her death). I get this text today while arguing with my husband (about other things - not suicide - which hasn't been brought up since a few years ago):

You say you want to die because your mom isn't here. I am still here. The kids are still here. That was very painful for me and had to be beyond brutal for them

There was no compassion shown then - just anger- and now brought up to use against me in an argument. 

I don't know what to do with the statement. It makes me not to ever want to confide again.
