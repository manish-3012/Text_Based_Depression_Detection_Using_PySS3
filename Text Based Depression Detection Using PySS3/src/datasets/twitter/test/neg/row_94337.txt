I can't stand my life anymore, I need someone to talk toThis has been my throw away account. I had an issue, recently, you can see it in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/m800i/24f_cheated_on_boyfriend_now_threaten_by_ex_lover/)

Before that, I tried to get ideas for that guy[ here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lxwj0/you_are_alone_in_an_unknown_city_no_money_no/)
  
Lastly, before all that I told [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/jkmpv/when_i_was_15yo_i_had_sex_with_my_best_friend_and/) story

I'm a 24 years old female.

Then I started to think... in all the things that had happen in my life..

* My half sister abused me
* I was emotionally abused by my sister and half sister in my childhood
* I'm kind of ugly, and overweight (lost 30 lbs by now...)
* I'm socially akward, too much
* I'm depressive
* I have rosacea, I hate that
* I'm kind of retarded, in Asperger's way
* I had a nose surgery because I hated my nose (in general, I have body issues, a lot)
* Of course, low self esteem. 
* I was emotionally abused by my current boyfriend a few years ago.
* When I was a child I barely saw my parents, and they are not the kind of parents that talk and teach you stuff
* Because of low self esteem, I cheated on my current boyfriend...
* Now ex lover threatens me and follows me, even to my classroom


I was trying to improve my life, got to /r/GetMotivated, and lost weight, tried to keep my hobbies, but now I see it all and I'm really fucked up. Almost everybody around me are bad people, and now I have to end my relationship of 7 years because something awfully stupid I did.

I'm studying Software Engineer, I'm the top of the class and the generation, but I feel incompetent, I just want to get the fuck out of my life.

I prefer committing suicide instead of hurting more my boyfriend.
