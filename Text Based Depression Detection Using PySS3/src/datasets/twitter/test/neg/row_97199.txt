I can't stayI have the coronavirus, that's fine I'm young and healthy but I live with my mommy who is very likely not to survive the virus if she gets it (lung condition). We don't know yet if she got it. I've decided that I was gonna off myself if she dies. I cannot live without her, I'm not even 25 yet, she's 55. I'm a only child. Never had a father. We're five in my family: mommy, my maternal grandparents and my maternal uncle. I love all of them but am unable to stay for my grandparents if mommy goes. I can't believe all this happened. I was so happy two weeks ago. And now I've planned my suicide. I didn't imagine the end of the world to be when I wasn't even 25 yet. I'm crying all the time for my mommy and waiting to hear symptoms of the virus. We're facetiming all the time (I am isolated since I developed the symptoms of course). I love her so much so much so much so much so much. It's always been my mom and me and I knew I'd end up alone but I imagined I'd be 45 or 50, not 24... I never signed up for this. I'm not going on without my mommy. 
Of course she may be okay and that would be a miracle and if she gets through this we'll stay together in the same house forever. But everything's ready in my head if needed.
