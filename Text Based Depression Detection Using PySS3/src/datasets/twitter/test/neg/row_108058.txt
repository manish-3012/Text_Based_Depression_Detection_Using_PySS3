Ready to go.I tried to kill myself at 16. Clearly that didnâ€™t work out for me. Here I am, almost 10 years later, just as sad. I told my therapist today that I was going to kill myself. Sheâ€™s obviously not happy about it but overall sheâ€™s handling the situation kindly. The next few weeks will be about me finding suitable home for my pets, because I love them very deeply and I want to make sure they have good lives. After that, Iâ€™m out. Iâ€™m so ready to not have to deal with anything else. Thank you guys for giving me a place to put it into words. Itâ€™s nice not to have to pretend.
