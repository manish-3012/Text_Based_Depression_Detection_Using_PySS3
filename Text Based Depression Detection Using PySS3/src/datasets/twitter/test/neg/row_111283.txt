I'm still hereI tried to end it last week and now all I feel is guilt for even trying. No-one knows about it apart from the person who stopped me and the 2 people that could possibly be reading this but all I have done since is cry and cut. I know that isn't going to help anything but makes me feel better because I deserve that pain and the constant reminder, I deserve to die but here i am, a depressed mess that can't even end her own life no matter how hard she tries. My life is a mess, I'm a mess and there's no going back to the Times that when I told someone I was fine I actually meant it.

Sorry this probably makes no sense but I just needed to put it out there I guess. Stay safe. X
