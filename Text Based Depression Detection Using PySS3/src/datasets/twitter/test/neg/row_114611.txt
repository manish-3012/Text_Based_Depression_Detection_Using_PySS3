Any help appreciatedI know that there are a lot of people who have been in a similar postion to mine and I was really hoping someone could offer me some advice.
Having been depressed for a very long time, with one suicide attempt already, I've really hit rock bottom these last couple of weeks. 
I have to believe that things will get better, but I can barely get through each day, and I really need some help. As it is I hardly eat or sleep, leaving the flat is incredibly difficult, and any advice to get through this would be so very welcome. Self harm is something I've battled with for a long time, but I just can't stop. I can normally distract myself by doing things with my hands, like cleaning or sewing, but nothing seems to work right now. 
I just don't know what to do any more, I wake up every morning wishing I was dead.
