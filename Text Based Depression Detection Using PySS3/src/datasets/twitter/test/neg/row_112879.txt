I can be temporarily happy, but my emotional baseline always tells me suicidal is inevitable.Since I was about 12, I never saw myself living past 29 (since at that age people thought 30 was old), and if something didnâ€™t kill me, I knew Iâ€™d kill myself at some point. Iâ€™ve never felt like it mattered in the grand scheme of things, and my self-worth is non existent. Iâ€™m 23 now, and I feel the same way. I can feel love for someone, I can enjoy a moment, or I can anticipate something thatâ€™s coming up, but those moments arenâ€™t all the time. I usually take care of the people in my life rather than myself, just in case you get scored for the kind of person you were in the afterlife. Being selfish is the quickest way to lose points.

Iâ€™ve lived a â€œkeep your chin up and keep pushingâ€ lifestyle. Iâ€™ve spent most of my time being a workaholic and keeping busy so thoughts canâ€™t keep up with me, but they always do.

I left my job in July. I do â€œshamefulâ€ work in order to make any money. Iâ€™m engaged, and I love my fiancÃ©e very much, but I feel selfish knowing that what Iâ€™d love is happiness with her for the rest of my life, but I also canâ€™t get shake the feeling of wanting to just disappear any day now, which Iâ€™d warmly welcome. I feel like I should leave her to spare her. I thought if I found someone I wanted to spend my life with forever, that Iâ€™d actually want to continue to be here. Instead, I still want to cut connections with people I have, not create new ones or maintain them. I have no motivation to get another job, to clean, to take care of myself, or to even hurt myself in a suicide attempt. I donâ€™t have any strength left. Itâ€™s all exhausting and I want to lay here and wither away. Itâ€™s been long time of dealing with this, and Iâ€™m so drained. And I have no means to afford help with only $1 in my account and no drive to earn more so I can buy medication I was supposed to start thatâ€™s been sitting at the pharmacy for weeks. And why ask someone for help when Iâ€™ll just end up back here anyway?

If not today, then some day eventually. Iâ€™ve got less than 6 years left, maybe only 6 days if I completely stop eating too.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
