How do we get my suicidal brother in law the help he doesn't want?Basically, my brother in law (24) has severe mental health problems, he drinks a lot and takes diazepam along side. 

When he loses it he gets mad and cuts/stabs himself, for example, 2 days ago he came round drunk and high from taking 20+ diazepam, thought he'd lost money and the rest of his tablets, went crazy and smashed open a glass bottle and started slicing open his face and arms before my wife and I stopped him.

This all stems from his best friend dying unexpectedly a few years back, he's always been emotionally unstable but this tipped him over the edge and now another of his friends has died more recently it has brought back everything and now he is very unstable again.

He has been at home where he lives with his mum and step dad and has been trying to kill himself with sharp objects since the event I mentioned earlier.

We are all worried that he is going to succeed soon so we want him sectioned so that he can get the help he needs but they've tried before and because he isn't a danger to others and he knows how to talk his way out of things That sadly didn't happen.

Does anybody have any advice on how to somehow get him the help he needs before it's too late? It would be greatly appreciated.

This is in the UK, just saying this in case anyone tries helping from another country with the way they do things there.
