I don't really want to post it, but maybe someone can help me.Edit: English is not my first language and i just came back home and tipped down, what went through my head. I might going to delete it anyway so i don't have any interest in reading it out again. If something dosen't make sence, i understand and im very sorry.

So it's close to 4 am and I'm back home. I just walked to that bridge close to my flat. My husband is asleep and i just walked out and stared down into this big dark empty nothing. I thought about what would happen if i do it. Who would miss me and what I would miss out on if I just do it. I thought about it for quiet some time now and I don't really know how it all happend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a good life. A very loving and supporting husband, a cute cat, a great job and amazing friends, but somehow i just feel so empty. I'm always so happy and friendly, energetic and cheerfull. I help everyone around me and I'm always the first one to help others. I'n my freetime i volunteer in different projects, with kids or homeless people (not right now because of covid), i learn how to play the piano and i took singing lessons until the beginning of the year. I started to learn french as well (my 4. language).

Everything was just great and then it just stopped being great. At one point there was just nothing. I can't answer any messages anymore, i don't want to play piano I don't want to play any games, don't listen to music, nothing. My head feels like it's about to explode and i just need to end this pain. I really don't want to, but. 

I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't seem to know anything lately. It's the only answer i have for anything right now. Just: I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why I'm sad, I don't know whats wrong, i don't know why i want to end it, I don't know what is happening it the world right now, I don't know how to cook my favorite dinner any more, I don't know why i don't want to clean the flat anymore, I don't know why I cant get out of bed, I don't know why I'm here, I don't know what i want to do with my life, I JUST DON'T KNOW....... 

&amp;#x200B;

And it just dosen't help that all the people admire me. They tell me how great my life is, they tell me that i got such a great husband and an amazing flat, they tell me that they would die to have a job like mine, or how they could never be that active in their free time, or how i can always be nice to anyone. I just want to scream in their faces sometimes, want to hit them hard and tell them I'M NOT OKAY! But what ould they think of me if i do? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am autistic. Women who are on the spectrum have a very high chance of getting depressed at one point, but they dont always get the help their want. A lot of depressed and suicidal people don't get the help they really deeply need. Why should i be any better than anyone else?

&amp;#x200B;

A car came by that bridge. A taxi and the man inside stopped and asked me if I'm okay. I told him I am, but he insisted to take me home. I don't know if i would stil be standing there, since i don't have the balls to actually do it i think. But to be honest I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was feeling it for the last few weeks. It was getting worse, to the point where i could not hide it anymore and my coworkers came up to me, to ask me whats going on. I started crying and left to the bathroom. It got to a point where i told my parents everything. I told them, that i just dont know why i feel that way. My dad said i will be okay. He knows me long enought, so he must know right? My mother said i should get help, but I don't want to. I don't want to be a faliur. I don't want to put my problems on someone elses shoulder and call it a day, especially, since i don't know what my problem is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel very pressured, but nobody puts pressure on me. I feel bad every second i did nothing, because it is a wasted second, witch i could have used to make the world a better place. At the same time i don't want to do anything, because i feel like it would not have any use what so ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know if i should make this post and i might delete it later, but at the moment it helped to just write down whats in my head. I'm sorry that i took your time. I know you could have done something better with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I always say to my friends, that they should remember, that they are loved and that i love them and they say they love me too, but what if noone cares? 

&amp;#x200B;

Why are we here? Why can't i be normal? WHy is my autism so hard. Why do i have to mask all day (not facemask, masking is a term for fake frindliness for autistic people)? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry for the long post. I guess i got carried away. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. Just don't know......

&amp;#x200B;

I love and support all of you. I don't want to hurt myself, I'm sure i don't, but 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to finish this. Stay safe everyone.
