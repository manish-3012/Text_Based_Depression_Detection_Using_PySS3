Hello, my name is Chris.I'm positive that I want to die ,but killing yourself isn't all that easy. I've always been on to look on the bright side for the most part but I'm just too tired now. I'm always exhausted. The worst part is that there's not even a big reason to be depressed. Basic problems everyone else has. The one that bothers me the most is that I sometimes just break down crying. I'm a 25 year old fucking man, and bawl my fucking eyes out for no discernible reason. It's been such a pain in the ass hiding that from coworkers, friends, and family. Maybe part of it is that I'm the only one out of my family and friends that isn't married or have a fucking kid. Hell I haven't even had a girlfriend in a long time. Maybe it's my little brother, or dad, or grandpa dying. (suicide/stroke/cancer). Maybe its just that I've been telling myself telling myself it's going to get better for too long and it never has. I couldn't even begin to tell you how many years I've been doing it. I've got a loaded .38 special on my end table ,and a bottle of tequila. I hope I have the balls to pull finish it this time.
