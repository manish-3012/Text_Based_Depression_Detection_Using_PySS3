Iâ€™m sorry I couldnâ€™t save you.So I met a friend from this Reddit. He came to help me when I was super sad and going through a lot of stuff. One day he decided to take his own life. Before he did said he was at peace, and his Reddit account was gone the next day like he never happened. I really hope wherever he is thatâ€™s heâ€™s ok or at least no longer in pain. I will never forget him.
