Well, almost choked myself out.Since this house is crumbling and i doubt even the shower rod could hold my weight (120lbs), i went head and tried to essentially strangle myself using some rope and our bathroom door.

I managed to just chill for a few minutes, but i guess feeling like my face is swelling is too much for my bitch ass to handle.

I have no real reason to stick around anyway...i cant stand being a burden.
