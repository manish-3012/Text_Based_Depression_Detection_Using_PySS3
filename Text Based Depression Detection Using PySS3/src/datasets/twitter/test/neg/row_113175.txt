Life is too much to handleI canâ€™t Handel stress , I really canâ€™t , how do people handle life ? Iâ€™m so amazed! Iâ€™m 22 and Iâ€™m already done , I get stressed about every little thing and nothing goes well in my life ,  Iâ€™m so tired of life , itâ€™s like everything I worry about happens , I didnâ€™t become the person who I thought I would be Iâ€™m really sad to death , I keep falling and failing and failing and I seem to canâ€™t prevent myself from failing itâ€™s crazy 

I lost control of everything and itâ€™s very painful 
The problem is I canâ€™t seem to know how to fix things
