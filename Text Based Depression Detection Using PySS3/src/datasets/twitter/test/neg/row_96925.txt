I feel like I need to escape.So I finished high school last year and my poor
grades mean I have not been accepted into a university. It now looks like I'm goIng to have to get a full time job and join the rat race. 

 This may not sound so bad but I have the last few years swinging between shear apathy and nervous breakdown, I allways assumed once school ended and I got into university life would be good.

Since school has ended I feel largely the same and this coupled with the idea of me having to start a full time job has left me feeling trapped. I know my situation doesn't sound bad but everyday seems to take a mountain of effort and I no longer have the hope for tommorow that I used to. Ultimately I just don't feel life is worth the effort. 

Sorry for the long winded post. I just wanted to get that off my chest and see if anyone can relate.
