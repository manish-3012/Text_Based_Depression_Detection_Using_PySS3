is there anyway to hide your phone number or location when calling a hotline?i want to talk without the cops getting called on me. i have a lot going on right now and thats just too much to deal with. ive put off calling for a long time and i feel like if i could anonymously express my feelings it would help. it would be really embarrassing and stress inducing for the cops to come to my door.
