No one ever helpsI'm in an extremely weak and vulnerable moment and made a post here six hours ago but no one helped, or even commented... I really have no where else to go. Telling a friend shows them a weakness.. all I have would be to 302 myself (hospitalize) and I'd prefer death to that again...

I have Anti-Social Personality Disorder (Sociopathy, informally), Narsassistic Personality Disorder, and Sadistic Personality Disorder. A huge part of sociopathy is lacking empathy and sympathy for others, but there is one person on this planet I likely care for so much more than normal people care for each other. My mother. She means the world to me. Nothing else anyone else has ever said can hurt me at all- I have no worth in the individual, but even just her disappointment breaks me. She's the only person in my entire life I can say I truly feel love for.
I feel like, to her, I'll always be the second child. The one that failed and needed summer school half a decade ago. The mentally ill and damaged one. The one that's only chance at success is taking it from others. I constantly want to make her love me outwardly, but I can't. I can finish a class (senior year) five weeks early and she'll yell at me for being 10% behind, not even mentioning that. I'm popular and have a long list of accomplishments- but she only mentions the shortcomings. No matter what I do good it's the bad that she must fight with me over.
I suppose I deserve whatever happens- as like other sociopaths I have harmed animals (mostly frogs and snaked) for a rush and have become obsessed with human anatomy, but even my path to going into medical school for Mortuary Science isn't a happy moment for her. It's revolting to her and she doesn't care one bit about me going there (she's a nurse, so she's no stranger to gore and such). I got in trouble a year ago for "encouraging" suicide and have been going to psychotherapy for almost a year as a result, but now that is on hold and I don't even have therapy to lean on.
I'm not scared of death. I've obsessed over it my entire life and have delivered it to living things before. I'm considering if I am ready for it, though. To forget I was even a concept in the universe and cease to exist. To not remember any moment of my life- accomplishments and all of my faults.
I tried to change. I even called to attempt to 302 myself when I thought I was going to seriously harm someone. I did everything and I'm hated by those that know me, seemingly even the only one I care about, because I was born wrong. Because even my birth failed in her eyes.
