Have you ever felt like Life is a game or simulation?Have you? 
I have since I was 9-10 y/o. This can't be reality. Working all day, getting money, marying, children, obligations, bills, faking prestige, faking good mood, faking coolness etc.
I don't like this game, so I'm out. Thank God there is an exit button.
