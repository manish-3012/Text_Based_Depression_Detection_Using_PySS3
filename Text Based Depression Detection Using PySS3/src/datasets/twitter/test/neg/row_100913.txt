lost too much in too short a timesince february, my psychologist of three years has been diagnosed with cancer and been forced to retire early, my boyfriend of four years broke up with me because i was â€˜too much emotional effortâ€™ and now my cat has gone missing and been missing for over a day. iâ€™m not strong enough to keep dealing with these things. itâ€™s killing me. i just donâ€™t want to keep going through this, it doesnâ€™t get better. every time iâ€™ve thought â€˜things canâ€™t get any worse!â€™, they do. i wish iâ€™d get corona and itâ€™d kill me to save me the effort. my cat was the last pillar of emotional support left.
