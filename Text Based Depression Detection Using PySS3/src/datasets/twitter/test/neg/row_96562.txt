Trapped by myselfHi SW. I feel completely helpless and lost due to my lack of self-esteem/self-confidence. Its like its trapped in a socially isolated bubble that I just can't escape. I'm 37 and should have sorted all this out by now, but somehow I can't.. I'm single and feel very much alone as I watch all my peers find a girl and settle down, and do well in their careers. I'm a guy, and I've always found it much easier to make friends with and relate to women than other men - countless times this has left me on the sidelines hurting and 'friendzoned' as some more assertive man swoops in and takes her. I used to complain about nice-guy syndrome, but I've come to realise this is a falacy.. women want a manly-man, someone with confidence, which makes perfect sense. With a few exceptions I find it incredibly hard to let myself go and gel with other men.. why can't I be one of the lads?! The lack of confidence has affected my career aswell, I could have done so much better, but instead, I've stuck myself in a deadend job for fear of facing the world. I've done CBT, and whilst this means I can now see the illogicality of my self-deprecating thoughts, and correct them, it hasn't had any effect on my emotions or my timidity.. it's like I can't escape that comfort of hiding away from the world that I've made myself.. its reassuring there, I feel safe there. My friends tell me I should "be more confident" and "stop being so down on yourself", as if there were some magic switch - I mean, I know those are the answers but I can't see any path to get there. So here I am frustrated that Im stuck in a place of my own making, and feeling that I should hold the key to get out, and you know, I think i've driven myself crazy beating my head against the same wall again and again and that maybe I should just quit before I lose all sanity... I could so use a hug right now
