I'm not normal and I need help.I'm 16 and i'm sick and tired of not being "normal". Most girls my age have boyfriends and like to go to the mall or starbucks or whatever the fuck else. I however, am a hermit. I stay home watching documentaries about school shootings and obese people. I'm homeschooled and I have no friends. I have severe anxiety(and have since birth basically) along with depression which started at 12 years old. 

Its not that i'm a religious homeschooled sheltered kid. I used to go to public school actually. Dropped out because of anxiety and panic. It was only recently I lost all my friends and I occasionally still chat with them on social media. I just feel completely isolated and alone. I don't relate to anyone.

It ranges from my personality, my interests and even my sense of style. Most people throw on a pair of skinny jeans or a mini skirt and I like to wear BDU style pants and boots. This is obviously very weird, especially for a teenage girl. Its probably not even appropriate to wear in public, but because I have anxiety, I love dressing like i'm powerful. It gives me a false sense of security. 

I've been suicidal for about 2 years now. In 2014 I was admitted to hospital 5 seperate times for suicidal and homicidal incidents. What really pisses me off is the girls all over tumblr claiming to have depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, gender identity disorder.. Fucking christ I get worked up just thinking about it.

I feel like I will never have a life. I stay in bed all the time doing nothing. I've done therapy and tried medication. My GP is oblivious and even says he doesn't want to deal with mental health problems. The psychiatrist wait list is about 8 months long.

What the fuck do I do?
