what does healthy mood regulation feel like? where do i download some? i'm either experiencing all my emotions like an F5 tornado tearing up my focus and churning my guts, or slamming into a wall and coming to a completely hopeless and indifferent stopI just can't take the emotional whiplash anymore. My life has been a chaotic mess for almost a decade, from mid adolescence till now, early adulthood, and I thought this past year since becoming not-homeless and moving into an apartment with my girlfriend, things would settle, but Adult Life just keeps happening and I can't keep up with everything that needs constant or immediate critical attention at risk of ending up without a roof or health insurance or food or vital medication or whatnot. 

I'm disabled and can never go anywhere and meet people, and none of my online following is very interactive so I don't have a lot of friends in total, and I just found out yesterday that one of my closest friends of several years, who told me almost a month ago that he planned on killing himself before completely ceasing to even open or read any of my messages, and who repeatedly excuses himself for not sending me a single message or coming and visiting for weeks or months at a time because he says his anxiety/depression keeps him literally asleep or unable to do anything except basic living functions without internally combusting, which I understand because I deal with days like that too, and which up until now I've made as much room for as humanly possible, has been posting actively on tumblr the *whole time*, sometimes even about all the other friends he's having over to his house and hanging out with and all the skype group chats he's a part of. 

With that on top of all the things that I just HAVE to be responsible for because I'm an Adult and I just. Have to be. I just can't do it. I just can't handle all of it all the time with no real rest because I can't sleep, getting to sleep takes hours or doesn't happen at all, I wake up in the middle of the night to be sick or have a panic attack, and I spend every second during the day that I'm not desperately just trying to calm my heart down before I just start breathing dead air and pass out (I have POTS so it's fast anyway and anxiety easily and often pushes it over 180 or 200 which is BEYOND painful and uncomfortable) worrying and stressing about everything that I haven't taken care of already, or worrying that I didn't do it right, or that somebody hates me [again] or that somebody's talking shit about me [again] or that none of it matters anyway because there could be a bomb or a car accident or a falling tree or some crazy random slim-chance disaster and my girlfriend could just die before coming home from work and I'd just have to pack up and move whatever shattered bits of me were left back in with my parents and god knows how well /that/ has gone in the past

I just can't handle it anymore and I've become so paranoid (about natural/crazy disasters, about people/being assaulted/robbed, about the environment and the economy and the fact that if someone misses the 40-mph turn into our blind apartment driveway, the corner of our apartment where I spend the most time is the first thing they will hit which *almost happened* once and only didn't because the car *broke the curb* and got a piece wedged underneath between it and the ground and then was being held up by some very small shrubs and that was a more terrifying experience than I had realized until the NEXT time I heard a very loud crash outside) and unstable and my mood can change like *that* and I can go from giggling and being affectionate and excited about the future and our future together and then either something will happen or my brain will just decide I've had enough time being happy and less than 30 seconds later I'll just be screaming, in a full rage, just barely in enough control by a fraying thread to keep myself from getting violent or destructive, or sobbing hysterically and begging to be allowed near a blade or pills or the busy road to hurt or kill myself. 

I was forced into therapy for about six years when I was a teenager and so don't really have pleasant experiences or positive ideas about the whole thing but I'm getting so fed up with myself and desperate for ANY kind of internal stability that I can count on and expect that I actually WANT to go and find someone and at least try some sort of meds, mood stabilizers or anti anxiety or something, but I'm on this awful government insurance and their website is so out of date that in calling any 10 random doctors (as I did last time I needed to find a new provider for something), only ONE was actually networked with the insurance and only because they had moved to a contracted hospital, and none of the rest had been contracted with them any time in the last TWO YEARS. 

I don't know what to do. I go from having my six bottles of medication all in hand, ready to take every single one with whatever hard alcohol we might have laying around, to being horrified at myself and desperately clinging to anything and anyone around me that I can and telling people that I'm suicidal to try and get them to do something or help or even say something, but nobody!! does!!! nobody cares or reacts or sometimes even fucking responds when I tell them in no uncertain terms, "I want to kill myself and I'm not sure how many more times I can stop before I complete the attempt because I've made several already". Nobody cares anyway and it's getting harder and I'm getting crazier and more manic with each high and more depressed with each low and I never agreed with my bipolar diagnosis until I realized how fucked up I am and I don't know what to do but at least if I killed myself my girlfriend could still pay rent and have a life and wouldn't have to listen to me whining all the time or pay for all my fucking weed that I need because it's the only thing that does SOMETHING for my anxiety but it's expensive as shit and she'd get over it. I know she would because other than a pretty face and a sharp tongue there's nothing about me worth keeping around and I know she only does because she feels sorry for me and because she'd feel guilty booting me out knowing i have absolutely nowhere but going back to sleeping on the literal sidewalk

i don't know what i'm asking for i guess i just wanted to post about this somewhere that cunty asshole wouldn't fucking see it and start subtumbling me about how I'M an ass for wanting to know that my friend is, y'know, alive 

i wish i knew how to get my hands on better meds. i don't abuse anything rn, never have, but i wish i had something to at least use.
