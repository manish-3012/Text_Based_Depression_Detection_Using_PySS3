I canâ€™t take it anymoreI literally canâ€™t be here anymore. Iâ€™ve tried and I canâ€™t. Every day hurts. I feel guilty because I have a 7 year old daughter who I love. Sheâ€™s the only thing that has kept me alive all these years.things are getting so bad that I canâ€™t try anymore. 

Iâ€™m done .
