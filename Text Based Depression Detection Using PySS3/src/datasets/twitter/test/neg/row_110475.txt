i dont want to live anymoreim gonna kill myself really soon. i dont see any reason to live anymore, i attempted 3 years ago and have been seeing a therapist since, she doesnt help. i just want to die and have wanted to for months. i cant feel any emotion, no one around listens to me, my boyfriend is getting close to breaking off our relationship and my only friend besides him is his sister so i will be completely alone.
