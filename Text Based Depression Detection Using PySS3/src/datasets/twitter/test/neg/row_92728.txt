All my faultSo in the past two years I've managed to royally fuck up my life. I went from straight As to Ds and now I can't get into the university that my mother wanted me to go to. I feel like utter shit because I can see the disappointment in her eyes, and she scolded me. 

She's pretty much the only person keeping me alive because I rely on her praise for validation. But then again she hasn't praised me for two years so there goes any self-confidence I used to have. 

I fucking hate myself. Don't remember what it's like to like myself, or maybe I never did. I have a good life, a roof over my head, and I still fucked up the only 'redeeming quality' I had. Been depressed for 5 years. It's getting tiring. My mother thinks I'm too young to have depression, and that I have no reason to have depression. She's right about the latter, but idk, I still feel like shit. And the more she scolds me about being depressed the more crap I feel.  It's not like I want to feel this way. And it's hard to focus on studying when you can only think about how much you'd rather be dead. Then again maybe I'm just full of excuses and too weak to pull through. 

Wish a truck had ran me over two years ago so at least I would die when I was a good student. Nothing motivates me. I don't even want to try anymore which makes her more pissed. I wish I was never born. I was an accident anyway. 

I feel bad for my mom. She only has one child who turns out to be stupid, depressed, trans and queer. She deserves way better, which I cannot give to her. Wish I could just off myself because I can't see myself turning this 'trivial problem' around. Yeah, I'm that weak and stupid. I guess I'll have to trudge around as a failure until I die. 

Death couldn't come soon enough! It should come for me ASAP so I don't have the chance to fuck more things up.
