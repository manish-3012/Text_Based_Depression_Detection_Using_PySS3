No titleI'm bored, I'm lonely, I'm hurt, and I want to die.

 I feel so fuckin' afflicted right now that I don't even feel like bothering to think of a title. Reaching out, and any attempts to do so will be in vain, rarely do I feel that anybody takes me seriously or cares enough to not give up. This post is stupid. I am stupid. I want to die.

And I mean _die._ I want to feel the excruciating pain of death. Because in those last few moments, when I sit on the line that divides the living from the dead, I know everything will be peaceful. Even if that peace is no more than mere seconds, those few seconds is all I ask for. Just peace.

I would kill myself right now. Believe me from the bottom of my heart when I say I would kill myself right now. Not because I'm in distress. I'm not mad or sad. I'm not... Anything. I'm indifferent. I'm indifferent to both the thought of living and the thought of death. I see no point in living. Everything means nothing.

I haven't killed myself yet only because I'm too depressed to be arsed to write notes and a will. 

I feel dead inside. 

Some days I wonder which post will be my last post.
