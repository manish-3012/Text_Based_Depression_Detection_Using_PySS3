I feel dumb for feeling suicidal.Hi there. 21 year old guy here.
I don't know if this is the right place to post, but yeah can't think of anywhere else, so. 
First of all, i feel dumb for feeling suicidal in the first place.
And second of all i feel dumb for feeling suicidal because of my looks and because of how lonely i really am. 
I'm a weird looking guy. Even though i'm a nice and normally interesting guy, my looks gets in my way. Even my closest friends have called me ugly behind my back. Not so much i can do about it though.
It's just really hard to bear the emotional pain of being called ugly so often. It's really a battle each day.

I guess i got friends, but i feel like i have slowly drifted away from them. It seems like they grow happier each day with their girlfriends, and i just slip longer and longer into the dark. 
It's really weird to experience. They are growing up to be stable and jolly adults, and i'm just growing more and more gray and depressed. I haven't got much in common with them anymore. The only thing keeping me up with them is my fake smile and effort.

I'm just so tired of pretending everything is alright, and i feel weird thinking all of these thoughts. It seems like they are here to stay.

Just needed to get that off my chest.

Thanks.
