Pill advice??Honestly Iâ€™m too lazy rn to look up the best best ways but curious what over the counter pills will help me kill myself.
Basically Iâ€™ve been depressed a while but Iâ€™ve had it tonight cause my boyfriend keeps threatening breaking up and has shown he doesnâ€™t care about me at all. I just want to end it all. Nothings going right and I fear it never will anymore. 
Iâ€™m trying to just find a park I can pop pills at and end it nicely because I donâ€™t have it in me to do a more violent route. Thanks.
