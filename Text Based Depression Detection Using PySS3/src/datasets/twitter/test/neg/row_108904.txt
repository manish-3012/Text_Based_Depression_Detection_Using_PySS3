I suck at being alive.I've tried killing myself so many times, yet I failed, why am I still alive? Why am I in a world where my best friend was raped? Why do my parents fuck me over? Why have I been unemployed for fucking months? Why do I have an eating disorder? Why do people fuck me over? Do the words "I love you" even mean anything? Can I actually meet real people for once?  I can actually meet someone who will hold me, love me  and kiss me? Is it so much to ask to not want to be lonely? I've tried to put myself out there and fucked myself over I dropped out of high school TWICE and collage once 'cause I wanted to die. SO WHY THE FUCK AM I HERE? I failed everything to fucking die and I'm still alive. WHY AM I ALIVE? I suck at being alive so I'm better off dead. But I'm alive. FUCK.
