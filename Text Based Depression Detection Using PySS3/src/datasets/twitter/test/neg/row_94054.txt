Does an involuntary commitment really effect your life and future??Ptsd and depression which led to suicide idealization beat me to it. Cops rolled up and threw me in the car and sent me to the hospital for evaluation. I realized when I was in the hospital that this can possibly ruin my future while Iâ€™m still a student. This made me even more anxious because Iâ€™m about to graduate and I didnâ€™t want to throw all this away. I want to know how negative it is for my future? My work at the moment has a clue and I didnâ€™t get promoted due to the incident.
