I got charged $150 for crisis intervention?I went to a doctors appointment for social security evaluation for benefits. I told her all of my symptoms as I was supposed to, including thoughts of suicide. After I told her this, she called the police and had me taken to a real hospital. At the hospital they asked if I was going to hurt myself and I said no, and they sent me home within 15 minutes of arrival. 

Today I got a bill for $150 for crisis intervention. 1) what the hell 2) what the hell
