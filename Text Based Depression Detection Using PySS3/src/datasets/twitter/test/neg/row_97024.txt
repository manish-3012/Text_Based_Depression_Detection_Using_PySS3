Here we go againAfter writing this, it really doesn't make a heap of sense and there's a bunch of details that just arent there. I just had to write this down somewhere. There's a TL;DR at the bottom.

Sup people, i just really need a place to vent my thoughts as i've in recent months fallen back into depression. I was here around three years ago and things felt like they got better, but sure as hell this shit creeped back on me. I am currently living with my best friend, if I didn't I'm not sure that I'd still be here. But even him comforting me in my worst times there's just too much for me to handle. I just don't see a point in anything anymore, and I've spent countless sleepless nights laying there thinking about the way I want to go, when, where, why. I have a pretty decent plan in my head, but it'll take a few months so I'm not in desperate need of help, or in need of any help for that matter. I'm going through with it this time and I don't want to be stopped. I just realized now this is going to be a long one so if you really have nothing else better to do, strap yourself in.

I just want to recap a bit what happened these last three years, I started working on my highschool diploma/graduation slowly but surely and things went fine for a few months, but for the second time I failed. I couldn't manage it even when only taking one course at the time. Like it's not that fucking difficult, it's mandatory school stuff that everyone are supposed to be able to do, and it defeated me twice. I notice everytime graduation time rolls around i feel worse than ever, seeing all the happy fuckers riding their stupid celebratory trucks (in lack of a better word) makes me feel like a speck of dust. 

So i was unemployed and really didnt do shit for about a year until my friend found a job that I also got a spot in. It was great! thing is it was only for a season and not a full time job, but hey, i'm doing something right? I end up being notorious at work for being slow and pretty shit overall at what i did, and didn't really make any friends there. I managed the season though and ever since (this was around october last year) I've gone back to amounting to nothing. I no longer live at home so I can't really keep this up forever, as i don't have an income. I started doing drugs again (these helped me move on from my depression last time around) but this time they didn't help for more than the duration of being high. I feel like i dragged my friend into the drugs as well and i feel so bad for doing that. He's got his shit together, he doesn't need me as an anchor to keep him down. He is my only friend that i meet IRL as the other ones have dropped me during these past three years. I can't thank him enough but I can't really with a good conscience stay around him much longer. That being said I'm going to disappear from his life (and from everyone elses if they care, but prob not) later this year. I've talked to him about it and he says he won't let me, but I don't want this anymore. I'm sorry if this sounds selfish at all or offends anyone but I want nothing more than to stop having to deal with every last bit of bullshit life has to offer. I've had enough. When the only thing that puts a smile on my face is doing drugs, I know that it's probably time to just face it. I'm not worth anything, most people that I've met throughout my life will probably just say "oh, he died? that's a thing". I know I'd be the same to them. I don't really feel empathy anymore. To be honest i feel very little except anger, hate and sadness. Mostly towards myself but also to everything/everyone else. I've been in therapy, I've taken meds, I've tried to reach out before and it was a temporary solution. I can't live life having a temporary fix throughout the whole thing, that'd just feel fake. I'd rather hit the big restart button (I believe in reincarnation). And if there is no such thing, then what will differ from before I was born? 

This turned into a messy ramble lol. I'll go through one more thing and then put a TL;DR. Which is family.

Family is kind of a weird thing for me. Ever since i was young my family has kind of had the mindset of "have a good image outwards" kinda thing. So that's what I've done. I don't think anyone in my family actually knows me, which is kind of weird to think about. I don't really want them to though so that's all fine. It's just that keeping up that facade towards them has been too much of a strain lately and I just don't want anything more to do with them. They were a solid anchor last time around when i was here, but now there's not really anything or anyone that holds me back. It's kind of a weird feeling of freedom, at the same time I've never felt so lonely. 

Also, worth to mention that just today i fell back into self harm. I have had the urges many times but have resisted time and time again. I gave in at last and it. Felt. So. Good. I can't describe it but I was crying and laughing and just kept going and boy, it was an emotional rollercoaster. Fuck. Well, I scratched the surface of the situation and if anyone read this, well, yeah. Hope it was worth your time, sorry if it wasn't. I'll just put my TL;DR and go play some PC game in hopes of having fun.




 TL;DR: Got out of a depression three years ago, fucked up school a second time, got a job at which I'm laughing stock, started doing drugs kinda heavily while also dragging down my best friend (and only current IRL friend i meet regularly), lifted the anchor that was my family (regarding suicide), went back to self harming and now have a plan to end it all :')
