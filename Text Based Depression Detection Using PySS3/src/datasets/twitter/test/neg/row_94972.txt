It's my time to be doneI woke up sad.  I went to work sad.  I came in, and there was a problem.  A bit of it was my lazy intern's fault, but a part of it was mine, and guess who is getting all of the blame.  I've given 5 years of my life to this place and worry constantly about doing a good job.  I do the work of an entire team and for a ridiculously low salary.  My boyfriend can't even just get a damned steady job.  It's all up to me.  My mom is fucking obsessed with planning my sister's wedding, she literally doesn't respond if I speak to her anymore.  I used to think they would be sad if I was gone, and maybe they would be, but just for a little while.  Maybe they wouldn't be better in a week, but they'd certainly forget about me within a month or two.  I'm ready to go.  I don't know why I'm even posting here, seeing as my mind is pretty much made up.  I guess I just don't know how best to go about it.  I have a few ideas.  I'm going to try tonight when I get home from work.  Boyfriend is away for the next 3 days and I'll just put in sick notice tonight so they don't expect me at work tomorrow.
