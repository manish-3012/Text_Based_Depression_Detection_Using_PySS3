I can't see this ever getting better.It's not just that I'm sad, it's that nothing seems worth doing and everything seems completely hopeless. I feel completely worthless and unimportant, my self-esteem is non-existent, and I don't have anyone to talk to. 

Nothing makes me happy anymore; nothing I used to enjoy doing is enjoyable anymore, and I can't get motivated or find the energy to do anything but lie in bed all day. I feel like I lost myself - I don't know who I am, I don't have any hobbies or interests.

I see everything negatively, and I hate when people tell me I just need to "think positive" and everything will magically change. I can't think positively, I try, but the negative thoughts just push back in. 

I have no idea where I'm going in life. I dropped out of college "to start a business" but I can't find any motivation to work on that. I can't find a full time job, and I'm very quickly getting to broke. I've lost all my friends and literally have no one to talk to. And worst of all, I feel like no matter what I do, my life can never change.

I wouldn't actively kill myself - only because even though we aren't close, I couldn't hurt my family like that - but I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up. Most people are scared of death, but I look forward to not having to deal with this shitty life anymore.
