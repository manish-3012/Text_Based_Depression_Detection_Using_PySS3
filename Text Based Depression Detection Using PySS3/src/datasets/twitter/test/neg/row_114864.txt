I'm worse than garbage.29F, single, self harm scars, cellulite, student loan debt, barely hanging onto my career, no friends. I want to die. I can't be alive anymore. All of my dreams are fucking dead. I'm a disgusting, loathsome shell of anything my life could have been. Couldn't have been much anyway, I was physically, sexually, and emotionally abused. There is no fucking reason for me to stay alive. I'm garbage. Worse than garbage.
