I feel like I have nowhere to turnI hate my life. I barely have any friends at all and I definitely have no friends that care about me at all. There's only one person I have kind of told I have these problems, and I can tell that he doesn't like to talk about it or really know what to say. I feel like he's looked at me differently since I told him. I don't blame him for any of this. I make everyone around me feel uncomfortable and I don't like to subject people to that.

I tied a belt around my neck and choked myself. I obviously knew I wouldn't die and I don't think I was trying to. But somehow it felt good, the pressure that started building up in my face. It was not painful.

So I have no friends to talk to and I don't know if I trust any of my online friends either. I tried that suicide hotline chat thing but it put me in a queue which I can't wait for, and I don't know how they could help anyways. I guess the reason I'm here is so that I can at least tell someone, because I think at least one person will read this. I don't know if I have the motivation to type any more.
