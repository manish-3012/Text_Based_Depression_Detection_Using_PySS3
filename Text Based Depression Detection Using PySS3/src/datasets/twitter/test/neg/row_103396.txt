Thought I was finally better but it looks like I'll forever be crazy and hated :)Theres no ending worth living for anymore, there never was. I was delusional to think it would ever get better, but its not. They all keep saying "You're too young! You have so much to live for! You're only sixteen!" I hear it so much its just tuned out, it just becomes a repetitive lie to me. Just stop caring please, why cant i just be left to rot in depression and end myself, why do people gotta stop it. Im not worth saving, im not worth helping, i wont be any help to anyone on a big or small scale, im not right for society, im just a mistake who thought I could still be happy. No amount of believing it'll get better will cure the mental illnesses which ruin me. im just a crazy obsessive useless guy who thinks he can be a girl. theres nothing worth living for, no one loves me, the one I thought loved me hurt me the most months and months ago, and now im nothing. i wish i could find the strength to overcome survival instinct and finally attempt to die again.
