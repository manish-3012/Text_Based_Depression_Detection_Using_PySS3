Should incels kill themselves?I don't post on incel boards, rant about women or talk about being a virgin irl. I am able to get along with women, they're just not attracted to me. I've posted on Reddit about wanting to kill myself because I'm not good enough for love, relationships or society in general. This resulted in people mocking me and calling me an incel. This is why I identity as an incel, because other people keep telling me I am and I guess the label applies since I am involuntarily celibate.

So I looked up what people say about incels on reddit and it confirmed everything I believed. I'm pretty convinced that I'm a 30 year old virgin because I'm disgusting, unwanted and I'm expected to kill myself. 

This post, where the OP says I'm a subhuman because I'm a virgin, is the 5th most upvoted post of all time on /r/inceltears.

I don't understand all of this. Like I'm given this incel label, get lumped in with maniacs that want rape legalised (among other strange things), I have to just be okay with being lumped in with rapists and child molesters and people will honestly pretend I'm not supposed to kill myself? Like if everyone agrees that being incel makes me literally subhuman then why not commit suicide? 

It hurts like fuck. I'm respectful of people, try to be nice and make an effort to do the right thing when I can. But yet everyone hates me. I'm the worst of the worst because I'm unattractive and women don't like me.

Everyone wants me to kill myself and the discourse around people like myself proves that.

I didn't know where to post this. /r/inceltears disallowed it and /r/braincels is a toxic place where everyone drags each other down.
