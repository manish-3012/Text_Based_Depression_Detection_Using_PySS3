I just want some damn quietIn a city, roaring with life, thriving with people, it is peculiar how someone can feel utterly alone. Just wanting some quiet from the cars, the people, the running water in the pipes, the TV screaming and booming, the electricity buzzing as it runs through the wires and powers our electronics. Is just some quiet time so much to ask?

Although not too long of a quiet. Because that's when the bad thoughts come. Thoughts telling that you are stupid, telling you that you should quit. Quit your hobby, the one you used to like but now just find it a task you got used to doing. Not something that you enjoy, but something you've gotten used to. Telling to quit your job, you were going to get fired anyways, since nobody likes you. Quit going out with your friends, they don't like you either. Quit at life, you aren't anyone meaningful anyways. Just a bystander to a person's journey to success, money, women, happiness. Just a ploy to be used in someone's story to slowly move the plot along, but not in any meaningful way. Just a side quest. And optional mission. 

Doing things is a chore now. Nothing is fun. Nothing has meaning. I am nothing. Just another person being suffucated by the tidle waves of life. A slow poisen of which there is only one cure, but you don't have the guts to use it. You live with this poison until everything loses colour and becomes basicly the same hough of black and white.

I am this person, if you couldn't tell. A person not knowing how to deal with his deteriorating and decaying mental state. A person being swallowed by a void. A feeling of wanting to breath air in water but can't. A feeling of wanting a connection with someone, but knowing that noone will love you. I tried a lot of things, but I seem to be hopeless. There has to be a way. This world can't be that bleak and cruel. I did nothing wrong god damn it. 

 There is a lot of noise around me. I want it gone.

I want to be gone
