I hope this isn't my last ChristmasI'm doing my best to make as many good memories with my family as I can this Christmas. I'm doing all of the little things I haven't done in years in case I won't be here in 2017. Making tons of holiday food, decorating the tree with my family, actually buying them good presents this year. If this is my last Christmas with my mom and sister I at least want to give them some good memories to look back on.
