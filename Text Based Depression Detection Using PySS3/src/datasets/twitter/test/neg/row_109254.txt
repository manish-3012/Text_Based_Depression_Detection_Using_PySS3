Psychomotor RetardationHi all. Iâ€™m posting because I was looking for some advice.

My depression has been really bad the last 2 weeks or so. Iâ€™ve been glued to my room &amp; bed because any task I try to complete feels impossible. I canâ€™t decide whatâ€™s high or low priority. And everything feels like it needs to be done perfectly or thereâ€™s no point in trying. There are so many things I need to do, but Iâ€™m so overwhelmed with my mental state that I can barely move. I feel like my life is not worth living and thereâ€™s nothing I would want more than to be dead right now. I feel paralyzed and trapped from myself.
