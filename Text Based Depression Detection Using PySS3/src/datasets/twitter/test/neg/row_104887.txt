i really really want to do iti ruined all my friendships, i didnâ€™t get into the college i wanted, iâ€™ll never get a partner or get anywhere in life. iâ€™ve started to stock up on pills and i think iâ€™ll start buying bottles of vodka soon to down them all in one go with the pills. i wrote my friends that i ruined the friendship with a letter explaining that this is the best option to guarantee that i never hurt them or anyone else ever again. i want them to be happy, and i know iâ€™ll never be.
