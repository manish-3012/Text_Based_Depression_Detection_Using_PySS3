Skip thisI've been dealing with depression and anxiety for over 3 years now. It just keeps getting worse and worse every fucking day. When it started, I was only anxious to go to a specific class then it became going to school every day. I lost all motivation to study anything whatsoever, I don't have any goals or aspirations I want to accomplish nor a job I desire. For about 2 years, I became suicidal but I haven't attempted anything yet but I am too afraid it's going to fail. Although I do plenty of research online to find the best way and I'm 70% done with my plan. All I do is stay home and cry a lot. Even when I go out to eat with my close family, I barely talk and actually get annoyed when any of them talk about school or life in general. When they go grocery shopping after eating I usually give a lame excuse to stay in the car to cry some more. Sometimes I feel like getting out and run into passing traffic or jump off the nearest bridge. Then I come home and cry myself to sleep. I've come to a time where the only thing I fantasize about is the day I die and how it's going to play out. Although, I still do have a heart. I wouldn't hang myself or blow my brains out inside the house. It would be me driving really far away and doing it. None of my family members know I'm actually sad as fuck, mostly because I am one heck of a pretender. They all have these expectations of me and I say things about my future like "when I get a kid" when I know damn right I won't even live until then. 


To my family: If you're reading this it's probably because I'm dead and you went to Apple to unlock my phone to find some memories or me and you happened to stumble upon my open Reddit account that contains posts of me being suicidal so if I happen to die by accident or risk my life for a small/big reason just know that I have never been happier and I probably did it on purpose.
