Sometimes it's the smallest thingsMy central heating and hot water source is broken at the moment.  It's 3 degrees here but feels more like -3.  The heating engineer was due to come tomorrow, but I got a phone call to say that he can't and I will have to wait until Wednesday.  Apparently he has an appointment that he 'can't cancel'.

There is the practical/logistics side.  I have no heat but probably won't freeze to death (I wish LOL). 

Then there is the mental aspect.  I suffer from anxiety and depression.  A stupid postponement of repair by a single day has me thinking that it would just be better to go now. 

I've been counting down the days until I can get heating again and 
 psyching myself up for a visit tomorrow (these situations cause me intense anxiety.  Now it's just all thrown up in the air!   To anyone else, this would be disappointing; to me it is catastrophic.  My depressive mind has this little voice telling me that they will cancel again and push it even further back. I couldn't deal with that.

I an so physically cold.  Yes, I have lots of layers on.  No, I can't find someone else - the guys who are any good tend to have waiting lists.  

Suffice to say, I've written the first draft of the email to be sent to 
Belgian doctors and clinics who agree to perform euthanasia.   It's not quite there yet but I have the foundations.  I've attempted twice and it would appear that I am really rubbish at suicide! So let's get a loan, secure it on the house, and do it properly.
