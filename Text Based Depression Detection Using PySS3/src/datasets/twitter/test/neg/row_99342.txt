I think Iâ€™ll kill myself soonIâ€™m tired to be honest. I feel like everything I feel is fake and invalid and Iâ€™m making up every time I feel alone or sad. It feels like my parents hate me half the time and no matter what I do to try and impress and please them it never works. My friends are starting to slowly sound more and more tired of hearing my voice every night and dealing with me. I can hear the hint of annoyed in their voices when I join party or phone someone up. I had good things and I ruined them. I probably wonâ€™t go anywhere in life from here Iâ€™m just waiting for my med school rejection and then Iâ€™m set. I donâ€™t think my parents would miss me they have two other children they admire and praise when they put in half the effort I do. Iâ€™m always replaceable to my friends so thatâ€™s not a problem Iâ€™ve never been special and never will be. Now just to wait for those results in a couple months time to decide whether I live or not.
