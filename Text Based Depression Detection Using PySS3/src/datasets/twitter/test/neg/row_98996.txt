Not a whole lot to look forward to right now. Pretty sick of living. Empty promises, false hopes, and dreams that will never be true.Right now honestly the only thing I have hopes for is playing the wither 3. Pretty sad. I kind of wish that I would pass away quietly in my sleep rather then suicide. But really either way would be fine at this point. Mom recently told me I was a burden and I was holding her back from things she wanted to do. Why not remove that burden? I really have no purpose here. I feel like I am just in the way. No friends. No job. No money. No happiness. No motivation. Just nothing. I cried for the first time in 10 years. Thinking about how lonely and disappointing my future is. Been diagnosed with a type of autism that still confuses me, severe depression and severe anxiety. Don't know what to believe. All I know is whatever I have, it's getting worse every year and I'm slowly losing functionality? Don't even know of that's the right word. 

I hate myself.
