I don't know what is wrong with me.I don't think I'm a real person. They have lives; they love things, they have hobbies, they have interests, they keep doing things. I just sit here. The other day at work I got stuck, I literally couldn't move. I got in at nine, sat down and then couldn't move. I just kept running over and over in my head that I could tell my manager that I wasn't feeling well so I could go home, but I kept trying to stand up and I couldn't move. I just sat in the same position for hours until it was time to go home. I saw my brother later that day and I must have seemed weird because he kept saying that he had "enough crazy people in his life." 

I don't know what I'm asking for here, I just needed to tell someone. I feel sick and I know how few minutes it would take to never have to feel that way again. I just don't know what the fuck is happening to me. Is this normal for depression or is it something else? Thanks anyway.
