To anyone out there... I'm scaredNot everyone is religious, and I myself am agnostic, but if you are, please pray for my soul. I want to rest. I don't want to go to a bad place. I don't want to suffer anymore. 

I've felt suicidal almost everyday since I was in middle school. I'm now in my 20's. I won't go on a long rant about my life story. Just try to understand that this has always been the only answer for me, no matter how much I've tried. Things have only gotten heavier and heavier in my life, and it's at a point where I can hardly ever function as a human in even the most basic ways. I am crippled by my past and my pain. I'm not sure what I did to deserve such an unfortunate life. Traumatic event, after traumatic event..  Everything is so crushingly painful, and I just want to sleep.

Please, if there is a God, I beg you to have mercy on my soul. I just want to rest in peace. 

Please also give me the courage to fight through my last, but worst physical pain. May it be quick, like a shot.

That's all. I'll be spending the rest of my time writing goodbye letters and preparing my belongings I want to giveaway. The end is coming soon.
