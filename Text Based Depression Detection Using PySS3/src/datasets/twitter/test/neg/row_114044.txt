The hotline sucks, cant find help. Not going to call 911.Called the hot line, got put on hold, it was basically tech support. I try to find help and I can't. I'm a crazy person so once I start alking people usually have the same reaction, they sop ;istening and find the next person to pass me on too. I called the holine and all he did was just try to give me a nuber aned get me off the phone. when I go out though, i'm takign some deserving people withme.
