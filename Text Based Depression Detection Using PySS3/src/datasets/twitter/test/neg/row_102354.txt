How should I write my last message to the ones I care and to tell the story they never knew.I probably won't last that long anymore, the only reason I'm still alive is because of my body's instincts stopping me on some energy consuming methods and because I don't like pain(Neither am I ready to face the consequences if I fail). I will continue to search for a more sure and painless way to die. It's pretty funny how I see life despite still being so young, but I think I've seen enough. I just hope the people close to me are going to be better off without me and fix all of the mistakes my existence bought on them. 

So since I'm still alive I think I should leave something behind, something that they will read and fix many misunderstandings. I already have testament written but that format doesn't really work on my case. Please share some ways to write a good letter of leaving, or whatever you call it, and write it so the people close to me would know how they'd be better off without me.
