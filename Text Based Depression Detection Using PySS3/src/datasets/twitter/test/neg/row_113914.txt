I'd rather end it...I have been very depressed lately. I was a cutter for 10 years, then stopped when I met my wife. Lately, all I think about is hurting myself. And today, the more I think, the worse I feel. Today I feel, like I would rather end it than live another day being me... I hate everything about myself. I know my wife loves me, but I don't think she understands me anymore. Also, I'm spending tonight by myself. My wife is working. The only other person that's home is my stepdaughter who doesn't even like me. Looking back on this year, I feel I've accomplished nothing. I've watched lazy co-workers be promoted while I keep getting shit on, I have not made any friends (which doesn't surprise me because I haven't had any in years), my parents got divorced so I get to deal with both sides hating each other so that's fucking awesome. The only good thing that happened was me getting married and I don't even feel like my wife is happy with me anymore. The world would be fine if I wasn't here. And honestly, it would probably be better... Maybe something good will happen before midnight and make me change how I feel... I just don't want to live life being this person anymore..
