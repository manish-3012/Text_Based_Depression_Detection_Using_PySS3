I think suicidal is the wrong name for itI donâ€™t want to die so much as i want to cease to be. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone else anymore than I am hurting myself. I donâ€™t want to translate my pain into the pain of a dozen others. 

I just want to stop being. The love of family and friends doesnâ€™t make it easier to live. Just more guilty to want to die. 

I think weâ€™re all here hoping to read or see something that changes everything. Some answer that unlocks our happiness. Our satisfaction but I donâ€™t think - for me at least - itâ€™s coming. 

I think weâ€™re all hoping for some cosmic answer or shift. When really it needs to done from within. And personally I donâ€™t want to search for it. I just want people to stop caring about me so I can get it done.
