It gets betterYou start high school â€œitâ€™ll get better in collegeâ€ they say

You get to college and they say â€œitâ€™ll get better in medical schoolâ€ 

You get to medical school and nothing is better so they say â€œitâ€™ll get better in 3rd and 4th year.

You get to 3rd and 4th year, nothing is better, so they say â€œitâ€™ll get better in residency. 

You get to residency and nothing is better. 

Your attendings hate you for existing. Your upper levels want nothing to do with you. Your interns are scared shitless. All this education and time spent studying and treating the sick and yet nothing is better. And now it is my job to repeat the lie to the dear medical student and intern beneath me:

â€œIt gets betterâ€

Iâ€™m leaving medicine and the practice of it forever. We treat our future physicians like crap because â€œit gets betterâ€

It doesnâ€™t get better....
