My family is the only thing keeping me here at times.Iâ€™m 22 and Iâ€™ve had the thought in my mind as long as I can remember. I put on a fake smile and go through the day but it feels like Iâ€™m slipping more and more recently. I havenâ€™t relapsed in four months since moving back in with my family but it feels like theyâ€™d be happier without me. I keep telling myself it would hurt my mom the most because her father committed suicide when she was thirteen.
