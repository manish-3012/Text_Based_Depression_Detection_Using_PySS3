Is there real help?I sorta need some real face to face help here.  I have a small bag packed with no real place to go.  I'm pretty sure I just left a relationship that I was in since I was 15.  I'm 43.  This is no bullshit.  I am a really lost soul who is beyond heartbroken.  North cincinnati area.  Just want to try to live before the reality of my actions take control of me.  I'm not sure what else to do.  I sorta just want to get drunk but I don't think staying in my car to do that is a good ideA.  I'm in the parking lot of a doctors appoiment that I have in 30 minutes trying not to act like this isn't real.  I feel like I was smacked in the face with a 2x4.  I want to throw up and run away.  I just ..well I don't know anymore. Is there someone that van maybe get me at least through the night?

Thanks for any consideration.
