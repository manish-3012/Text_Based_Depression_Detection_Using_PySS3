Watching her play and just want to die of happiness and sadnessIdk why Iâ€™m the one grieving, Iâ€™m the one who was a piece of human garbage. I donâ€™t have any excuse. Sheâ€™s better off without me and she deserves someone who can give her everything. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting this. Why would anyone even care. Why am I the way that I am. I look at her smile and just fill up with joy while my eyes are crying and my face gets all disfigured as I try to hold the tears back. I donâ€™t know what the future holds but if itâ€™s a future without her, then I really donâ€™t want it at all. I donâ€™t know why I cared so much about the bad when the good was undoubtedly way better. Iâ€™m such a shitty person and I donâ€™t deserve to heal. I canâ€™t cut her out of my life and she canâ€™t cut me off. Itâ€™s a cycle of endless pain that only ends if we get back together. Idk why Iâ€™m fighting so hard when she has made it clear that she canâ€™t get back with me. When people tell me that I am young I get so sad, I know I am! Thatâ€™s why it hurts so much! Because we were supposed to enjoy our youth together. Live a long and happy life together. Go through ups and downs together. Because thatâ€™s what true love is. Idk why I couldnâ€™t just be the way that I am now, back then. Why do I feel so much pain now. Why hasnâ€™t 6 years of no friends and no emotions hurt me as badly as this? Because I lost someone who was worth everything in this universe and more. I wonâ€™t kill myself out of the love I have for her. I donâ€™t even self harm because of the love I have for her. I have no coping mechanisms. All I do is just sit in a room where no one notices me. Where no one looks for me. I feel like everyday I heal on my own but then this depression hits twice as hard as the last time. Things I enjoyed I canâ€™t even do anymore because they remind me of her. Music I canâ€™t listen to because I shared them with her. Thoughts that hurt just because they remind me of her. And the worst part is, she had no fault whatsoever. It really was all just me. Drowning in sorrow. Wanting a life that I can no longer have. A poem that I can no longer read to her. A song I wrote just for her. A future, where she is no longer in the picture. A painful memory. A beautiful woman. The perfect wife. I lost her and Iâ€™ll never get her back. It hurts so fucking badly. It feels like my chest is going to explode. I canâ€™t even see my keyboard but my feelings are pouring out and I know that Iâ€™m typing what I need to. That I need her. I canâ€™t stop fighting for her because I canâ€™t stop thinking of all the good times we had. The life of a misanthrope becoming normal and falling in love with someone. I never thought I would get hurt because I was always the one causing pain. And now I canâ€™t even feel hate for others. All I feel is hate for myself. She melted my ice block of a heart and made it hers. And she gave hers to make my own. G.L.L. You know these are your initials, if for some reason you ever read this, now or in the future, I want you to know that I am love with you. For now and forever. Till death do us part.
