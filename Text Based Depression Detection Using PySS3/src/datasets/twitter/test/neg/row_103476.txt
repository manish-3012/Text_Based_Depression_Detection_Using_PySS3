My 15th birthdayI went outside to go "play in the road", thinking everyone just didn't care, but my little brother wanted to go on a walk outside with me instead so I couldn't. As I came back, I was greeted with cheesy notes, dark chocolate, and some..money. what? I..what? I want to be grateful, I am, but in the back of my mind I feel like a spoiled cunt. But..this helped, I mean, a candy bunny isn't going to solve my existential terror but. I think I'll stay a little longer and be a little less shitty and assuming to my family, at least.
