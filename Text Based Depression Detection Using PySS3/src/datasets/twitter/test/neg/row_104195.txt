I feel suicidal when I get emotional outburstswhenever, I have mood swings or some shit like that I realise how bad I am at everything, and I am dead scared that I am toxic to people around me coz I hurt them by saying something stupid.

After these outbursts, I begin thinking about how im so emotional and that all of this shit is coz of that. But these outbursts don't stop, why. I also cry alot, for no reason and I think about how I have no place in this world coz of the idiot I am. 

I barely ever am satisfied with myself as I think I should do better but I don't. I barely ever am grateful to the things around me. Im so weak that I can't even deal with such petty and stupid problems, I always overreact and get angry at myself for not being good enough.

I just wished I never existed
