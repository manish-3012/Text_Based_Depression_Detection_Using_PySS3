I just took 1500mg of prozac with vodka.I canâ€™t take it anymore so I am leaving things up to chance.  1500mg of off brand prozac only has a 50/50 chance of killing me. If I wake up from this, so be it. If not, god bless. I also got some vodka to wash it all down and it was surprisingly easy to take.

I wish I had a more concrete way. 1500mg of prozac was all I had since my roommates took all my pills except for the very old prescription of fluoxetine I found in my car. There were 75 20mg pills.

I donâ€™t have a tub to slit my wrists in. Thereâ€™s no gar
age to put my car in and let the carbon monoxide in. And I canâ€™t use my car. The last time I tried to kill myself I ran my car into a highway hill going 120mph. It didnâ€™t work and I was left with medical bills and a totaled car.

So far I feel nothing but a mind buzz, extreme tummy grumbles that arenâ€™t quite painful but are distinct, and very very sleepy. too sleppy to drink anymore vodka i dont even like vodka im not drunk though but i wish i had the energy to finish the bottle and die that way. 

But we will see
