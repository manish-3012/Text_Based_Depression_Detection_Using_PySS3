I dont want to kill myselfBut i dont want to live anymore. My friends ignore me. My family thinks depression isnt a real thing and that i just need to get over it. Im tired all the time and sleep the days away. Music and food are bland. Why should i live anymore. I wish i wasnt too much of a bitch to end it all
