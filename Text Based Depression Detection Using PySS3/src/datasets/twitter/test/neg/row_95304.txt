just need to let it all outstarting to realise that this time of year is an absolute trigger for me. past traumatic experiences all happened may/june, 4 years in a row. was in an amazing position this year, feelin great so happy changed my life round have an amazing support system and here I am back at rock bottom. could be a combination of everything thatâ€™s going on, really donâ€™t see a way out of all this (Iâ€™m high risk so still shielding/working from home during this lockdown). Been playing my switch for 12+ hours a day just to distract myself, I took two weeks annual leave because things were getting so bad but Iâ€™m on the last few days and I have no idea how Iâ€™m going to cope again when back at work. Already dreading it. Seriously wish I was brave enough to end it but donâ€™t actually have the energy to try, donâ€™t have the energy to cry either. Just lie in my bed day in day out thinking about how nice itâ€™d be if I wasnâ€™t alive. Fucking hate this shite.
