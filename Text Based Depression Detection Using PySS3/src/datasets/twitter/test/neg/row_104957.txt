What is the point of life?I just dunno how long I can keep pretending that I am okay with my life. I have zero friends and I seriously doubt anyone I know would miss me. My job has turned into a Spanish Inquisition. Most of my family only want to know me when I can do something for them. I am pretty sure my father has hated me for my entire life. I was the one that would not bow to his will. I was the defiant one.

I have visited various therapists but all they have done is re-enforce my thoughts.

The thought of suicide is entering into my head more and more. Reddit this is my last hope, my last chance to see something in people and this world that is good, that maybe a total stranger might help me see a meaning in a life that has no meaning.
