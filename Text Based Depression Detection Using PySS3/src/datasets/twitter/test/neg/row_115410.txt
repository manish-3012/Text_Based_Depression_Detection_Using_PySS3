WahI can't afford therapy 
Everything would be way more simple if i were nooot doing this. Things are too hard. So fuckin gd hard. Ive been so fucked for so long. I know ill kms some day. Rad. Nice. Fuck me. 
God why cant things just feel good. Why cant things just be good. And happy. I dont want to hurt the few who care. And im gonna haunt the asses off the fuckers who pretended they gave a damn. 
God please i just wish i felt good
