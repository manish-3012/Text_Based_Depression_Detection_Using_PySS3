Getting ThereI'm at a point where I'm starting to think about not living, objectively.

I lost my wife to ovarian cancer in 2016; We'd been together for almost ten years.  Reflecting on everything as I've been for three years, I took caring for her on as my identity.  I still am, and at 33 I have no idea of who I am.  I failed out of college due to inattentive ADD and depression at 20 - I was alone.

I think this is why I clung to her so closely, I feared being alone.  Now I've lived in a different state for three years.  I'm still mostly alone - Everyone around it seems has someone, or something - A passion, a drive to succeed, friends and family or just to enjoy something tangible.

I'm still depressed, still incapable, and still feel wholly alone.  When others recount their stories of youth, I have none.  I've never truly known who I was, but took on qualities as best as able from those around me.  I'm exhausted.  I've tried therapy recently, along with doing things to improve my health and to get out and meet people.  Nothing is truly working, and I feel I'm becoming a burden on the few people I can talk with from time-to-time.

So what would the world lose, honestly?  Who would the world lose?  Objectively, nothing.
