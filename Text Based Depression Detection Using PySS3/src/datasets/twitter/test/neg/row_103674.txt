Question about helping someoneHello, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this. My fiancÃ© is pretty suicidal in general. I do not believe there is immediate risk as he is pretty stable, but he is struggling. Apologies if questions like this aren't permitted.

He used to self harm a lot, but stopped because he was getting better and he knew it upset me. He's going through a particularly rough time right now and he's relapsed a few times in terms of self harm. Because he's not meant to do it because we've acknowledged it as a negative coping measure and he knows I don't like him doing it (I've had friends severely hurt themselves by self harming, infections etc.), It makes him feel really guilty, which makes any relief short lived and he ends up feeling worse.

However, he says that cutting makes him feel more in control and more able to deal with things and less likely to think of suicide. I am wondering to what extent I should "allow" him to cut. If I allowed it, he would not feel guilt about it as much and it may help him to feel together enough that he might be able to do things (he stayed in bed all day today due to depression). I could even potentially make sure that he has a safe, clean and not too sharp implement to do it with and check over any wounds regularly instead of him trying to hide them(I'm first aid trained). I'd urge him to not do it too often, but if it did happen, I'd not treat it as a bad thing. With addictions of multiple sorts, humans tend to go overboard once they fall off the wagon: "Well, I've ruined it now, might as well do a few more". Maybe it being allowed would minimise.

Or maybe allowing it could lead to increased dependence on something that ultimately needs to not happen and could make him cut more often and lose track of how much he's doing.

What should I do? My priority is keeping him safe and that's harder to do if he is edging closer to acutely suicidal every day. I also can't help him to get help when he is overwhelmed by it all so much.
