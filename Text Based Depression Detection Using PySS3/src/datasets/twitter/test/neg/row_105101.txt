Suicide or runway HELPI have very religious sexist parents that will most likely have an arranged marriage for me at 18 I will not be able to have a job or maybe even go to college in other countries like I wish to 
I have a record of self harm depression and some drug use,
If I try to reach out for help I will probably be skinned alive 
I would rather die than marry and have kids, I want to have a job and live normally,
This will all happen in a matter of a few years I need all the advice I can get 
Should I just end my hopeless life or start a new one some where else
