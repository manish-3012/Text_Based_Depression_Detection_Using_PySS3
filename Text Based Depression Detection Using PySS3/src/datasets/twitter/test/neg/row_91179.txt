I hate myself, and I also hate myself for hating myself.I have been depressed for several months now. I'll just lay in bed all day, rotating between feeling emotionally numb and complete anguish. And I fucking hate myself for it. I feel so guilty, knowing that a lot of people have it worse than me. I have a steady income, a mostly peaceful family life, and I don't have to worry about getting killed in the streets.

I feel like such an ungrateful bitch, and this will probably be my last post here. I'm planning on throwing myself into a lake near my house. To anyone who sees this, you just wasted your valuable time reading a pathetic post about a waste of flesh and blood. I'm sorry. And to all the people suffering out there, I hope life gets better for you.
