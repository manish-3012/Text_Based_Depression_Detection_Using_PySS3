Running out of options.I feel so stupid. I've always kept suicide as a plan B, in case things go wrong. I recently found out I'm not graduating college on time. I feel like I'm letting everyone down, mainly my family that's invested so much in me, and I've gotten so good at lying about how I'm doing but I can't lie anymore. It's so stupid. It's not the end of the world but it feels like it. I don't want to have the difficult conversations. I don't know what to do, I just want out.

I feel guilty posting this but I don't know where to put these feelings. I feel like I can't be honest with anyone.
