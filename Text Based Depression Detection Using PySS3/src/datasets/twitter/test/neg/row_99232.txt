I need some serious help for my best friend and I'm lostI don't know what to do. I've read every generic "do this" list on the internet and it's not helping, it's far past all those points. I don't want to get too deep into it on here, but it's very very serious and I honestly have no idea what to do and I'm freaking out. 

I feel weird posting this online, but she is my best and only friend (other than my wife and my family) and she lives far away and I'm scrambling for anything at this point. 

I feel like there is nothing I can do. Please, any suggestions are welcome.
