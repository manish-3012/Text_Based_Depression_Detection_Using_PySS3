Why am I the assholeI have had strong suicidal ideation for about three months now. The risk of committing suicide has grown steadily since then. I hit stage 2 of suicide at my very peak.

Anyways, I guess a part of me didn't want to die. I thought about my family and how bad they would feel. I guess I was wrong. For some my sister took it on herself to self victimize. Oh, how she has done so much for me. How if anything she should be the one killing herself. That there is something wrong with me. That I am a waste of time because I couldn't finish my classes. How I had the luxury on focusing on nothing but my classes. How I wasted so much money. 

For fucks sake I didn't even want to take any classes. But it was never an option was it? I am suicidal because of my classes that I was forced to take. And I am the devil for wanting to end my life. I am the asshole because I need help.

When she complains about her day at work, you know what I do? I listen. I don't judge her for being short tempered. I just listen. Why can't I recieve the same respect? Why can't I recieve the same level of empathy that I give.

Then my dad comes in and gives the worse counseling service ever. Basically he told me this is what's wrong with you and you need to do this.

God damn it, I just want some level of compassion. Apparently I am dick for expecting these things.
