I don't know what to do. My life is overMy girlfriend of 3 years ended it last night. She was literally my only family. My best friend. I have always been depressed, but this was the nail in the coffin. I can't get this pain to go away. I don't have anyone to talk to. My mom left me when I was 15 and my dad isn't all there in his head. So I can't talk to anyone. I am going to lose my apartment, my girlfriend, and my dog. I'm broke, nowhere to go. 

I'm going to take 20 sleeping pills since I don't have a gun. I can't get this pain to stop. My life is over anyways. I just need it to stop.
