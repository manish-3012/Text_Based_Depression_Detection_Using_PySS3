Living in Orange County made me want to kill myselfI just couldn't handle it.  
My family wasn't rich, or white, or even Mexican. We were outsiders. I've lived here for 12 years and I never once liked it. Everyone was so boring and predictable. You were either rich and white, or you just didn't exist as part of OC. 

It's just so plastic.  
I feel like I don't belong.  
Fuck Orange County.
