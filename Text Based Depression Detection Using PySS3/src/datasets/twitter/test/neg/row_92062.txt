Do I have depression or suicidal thoughts?My life sucks and I just want to kill myself. I hate my parents just say that I am a mess in life and I am tired of this shit. Last week my dad said that I was a piece of shit. I don't go outside and I just cut myself cuz it's the only feeling that makes me feel "alive". Now I have to ask, do I have depression or just suicidal thoughts?
