Does this mean I'm just depressed?Everyday I feel as if I am dreaming.  I feel like I'm floating around.  I cross the street wondering if I'll be fun over.  I once couldn't sleep because the fire alarm went off and I worried about CO in the air.  I slipped in the shower and almost hit my head.  I dropped a knife and almost stabbed myself with it.  Every time I take a bath I wonder if I'm going to hit my head and drown.  When in the forest I wonder if the trees will finally die and land on my head.  I'm just very sleepy I guess.
