HeyHi, call me skittlez. I just turned 19, I live in england and i've had enough. Every time i improve or seem to get any closer to what my peers want me to be i am showered with hate and disapproval from everyone, it's like no matter what i do to make them happy i  just can't. Whenever i meet my own expectations someone is there to make me feel like i am barely scratching the surface of being a decent human.

I am a regular drug user and a high functioning alcoholic, the only thing that gets me through the day is music. I worry that one day very soon, an album will stop playing and those last few seconds of a track will play out, and i won't see the point in carrying on. 

My last relationship was horrifying, i was with an awful guy who was abusive to me both physically and mentally and the way he treated me has stuck with me so much to the point where i now have regular nightmare about him. 

I suffer with really bad gender identity issues, these all started when i was 16 and i was raped. I haven't ever told anyone that, not even the many therapists i have had to see. I have an awful relationship with my family, the only time they speak to me is if they want something or need money or just want to remind me that i am nothing. As silly as this sounds in comparison, the final straw was last night. My album that i wrote and produced myself using just a phone and audacity and a couple guitars had been privated on soundcloud for a while, but i finally decided i wanted people to hear it. 

I was so proud.

People came from all directions using anonymous twitter accounts to attack me and say that it was the worst thing they had ever heard, i was told my vocals made people want to kill themselves and that i would never make it as a musician no matter how hard i tried. It destroyed me.

And now i'm here, on the brink. 

I found this subreddit through another thread in which i was looking for painless suicide methods, i don't know what that says about my future.

I needed to say something to someone, so i'm sorry if i have misunderstood the purpose of this subreddit.

I don't know if i wan't help but something stopped my from doing it today and lead me to make this post, so i'm praying something comes of it.

Thank you for listening, god knows no one else will x
