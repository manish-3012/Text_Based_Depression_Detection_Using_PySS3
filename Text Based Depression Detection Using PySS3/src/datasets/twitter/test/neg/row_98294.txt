i hate how my worth is based on academic successim so pathetic. ive been so unmotivated and burnt out from school even though im basically lying in bed all day. there's not a minute that goes by without me thinking about suiciide, what i should write on my note, how i should do it, or when i should do it. i hate how getting one 70 pushes me over the edge. i failed my ap exam and still haven't told my dad. im hoping to kms before i end up having to tell him. im terrified of failure. gifted kid burnout sucks ass. 

i think im ready to end this bs called life
