Had about 5 hours of sleep in two daysIts either anxiety or food poisoning but my whole body is sensitive and aching and my nausea wont let me sleep.

Been interviewing for jobs like crazy, did paperwork at the SSA today but no matter what I do I dont feel like I've accomplished much.

I keep bouncing between hopeful about the future and completely devoid of any hope at all and not wanting to continue forwards.


My family doesnt want me around, I'm a burden on my friends and everything has been falling apart around me for around a year now.

At some point you can't blame a guy for giving up, right? 

Some times the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that my family doesnt love me at all but will all milk the hell out of my funeral if I end it all and pretend like they cared so much about me just to keep up appearances.


I've been thinking a lot about the afterlife lately and whether or not there is a god and I'm leaning more towards "everything is a chemical, nothing spiritual about life" death is just a void.

I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I feel so sick and sore and just awful
