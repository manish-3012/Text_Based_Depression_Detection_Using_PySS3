Where can I hang myself fromDon't tell me things will get better. I have a rope but there is nowhere in my house to hang myself from. I don't think my curtain rod will hold 100lbs I don't know where else I could go. I can't hang myself from a tree because I'd have to be far from my house and I'd have to bring a ladder. I don't know what to do
