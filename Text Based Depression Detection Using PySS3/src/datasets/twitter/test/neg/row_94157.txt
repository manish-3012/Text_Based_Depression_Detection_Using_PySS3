Thinking of suicide, only option left.Iâ€™m not in immediate danger, I donâ€™t want anyone to panic. But Iâ€™ve been thinking of suicide. I just got out of hospital a few days ago and nothing has changed and Iâ€™m back to my only option being suicide. 
Iâ€™ve had depression since I was a child and Iâ€™ve been through so many medications and therapies, Iâ€™ve exhausted all the resources provided and Iâ€™m still the same. I canâ€™t have a normal life. Iâ€™ve tried researching other options but thereâ€™s nothing. 
The only thing left to do is to kill myself, I donâ€™t even want to die, I just donâ€™t want to live like this anymore.
