Really in need of advice. Idk what to do anymore.Everything I do just doesn't seem to go the way I want it. Every relationship I've ever put effort into always goes nowhere. All the goals I set fail miserably. Worst of all; I feel I have no close friends or family members.

I walk around school with this false persona of always being happiest kid. I'm basically known as "smiles". I'm athletic, intelligent, and to some point would say I am good looking. All this I feel I have wasted. Nobody knows how deep down I am hurting. Every person I've started to come close with, to start opening up to, I push away immediately. I just wish someone could know. That somebody could help me with what I am going through. I guess that's why I've been brought to here. It's a first step.

There have been countless nights, this new year alone, where I have cried myself to sleep. It always starts the same as me looking back at how happy I used to be. Nobody knows this, or has the slightest idea of it. The thought of suicide has crossed my mind multiple times. I don't feel I would ever give in and actually commit suicide but I'm just looking for any advice to avoid feeling like this. Maybe there are people who have gone through the exact same thing that can help me. I feel it has gone on way too long and would do anything to get back to how I used to be. 

Really couldn't thank anyone enough for reading all of this, any advice is much appreciated. Please reddit, help me get back onto my feet.
