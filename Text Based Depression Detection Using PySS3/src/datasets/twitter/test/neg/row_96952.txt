all of my interests and hobbies are gonenothing interests me. the last few things i liked were taken over by others and i donâ€™t enjoy them any more. they treat me as if iâ€™m inferior, or i face criticism, and i just loathe myself for even trying to participate in anything now. thereâ€™s no more joy in anything i do. i waste time i waste my days and i do nothing and i feel nothing and iâ€™m so fucking tired of it.
