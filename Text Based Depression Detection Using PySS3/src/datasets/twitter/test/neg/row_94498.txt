Maybe it isnâ€™t worth it anymore.I have spent so much time and effort and money into trying to be happy. I moved out of state. I came back. I got a different house. I got a better job. I got fun hobbies. I dated different guys. But now I sit here, in my new apartment I can barely afford, with my cat who is the only creature alive concerned with my wellbeing( mainly because I feed him) and I just feel really useless. My boyfriend is sick of my dejected attitude, and. I do not blame him. Iâ€™ve become less affectionate, more withdrawn. Now I have some fun medical issues impeding some good things in my life. And ya know what? I really just want it all to be done. I doubt Iâ€™ll do it, because Iâ€™m too fucking scared, but man I really really really wish I could just grow a pair and go through with it like I wish I had at 14. 

Iâ€™m so sorry for being an attention seeking whiny baby. I just needed some sort of outlet, though I donâ€™t think this will help much. It may just be time for a long drive off a short bridge.
