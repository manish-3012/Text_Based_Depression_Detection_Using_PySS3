Unwanted humanI donâ€™t really want to make this post because it always ends up the same regardless of my efforts. Iâ€™m unwanted anywhere I go. My familyâ€™s always disliked me and treated me less for no reason. I have no friends and never had friends. Any woman claiming to be interested in me goes ghost, or it ends up being fake. I have exhausted myself out on making attempts. It all ends the same. I canâ€™t find solitude in the loneliness as my trauma makes me crave what I have always longed to achieve. Someone that just cares which I donâ€™t think I can even feel like someone does at this point. Iâ€™ve thought about going to hard substances to escape until I pass or push me toward it. I no longer see a way out of this hell. I canâ€™t make anyone like me I obviously shouldnâ€™t have to and I wonâ€™t but I canâ€™t find anyone that wants anything to do with my existence. Life has fallen apart in more then just this in many ways. Every day gets worse. Every year gets worse. It doesnâ€™t get better. Humans are too selfish, greedy, and close minded. My existence means nothing and Iâ€™m ready to exit
