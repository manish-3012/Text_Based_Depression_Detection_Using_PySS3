I'm all alone now...I've posted before, but my girlfriend and you guys stopped me. Today I saw her getting kissed by another guy, she was shocked but didn't stop it. I saw it and when we saw me she tried to stop me but I drove home...

My whole life was supposed to be with her, we had so many plans. I came to Uni just so that I could get a good job so I could take her traveling around the world like she always wanted. She was the only thing stopping me, she was my anchor but now I'm all alone. I don't see why I should live, we had been together for a number of years but its all gone now, and it's my fault too. I want to die so bad.

I would do it now but my emotions are flowing too much, and I'd probably back out, so I'm going to kill myself when I'm more composed.

I wanted to post here because...I don't know....I've always posted here on multiple accounts and you guys cared each time, so I thought I owed this final goodbye to you wonderful guys and girls...

My depression and anxiety are so bad now, I'm going mad. Since she's gone now, I don't have anything to live for. There's no one here with me now, I'm all alone...
