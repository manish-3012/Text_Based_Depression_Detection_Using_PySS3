I need to talk to someoneI am not certain I am suicidal, but I have thought about it once or twice. Right now, I am in my dorm room, drinking alone cuz I am bored. My entire family is filled with alchoholics and I just realized I am following down the path I desperately don't want to follow. Yet I am in college and all it seems my friends do for fun is drink. Please, please dear god, give me some advice I can follow
