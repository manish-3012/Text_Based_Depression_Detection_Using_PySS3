Overwhelmed.I think thatâ€™s all it boils down toâ€”Iâ€™m overwhelmed by everything, and feel like I can no longer push through and deal with it. Like my last straw has broken. 

Itâ€™s been years of fighting, and pushing, and continually trying. No matter what came my way, or how badly I broke, I always found a way to get myself back on my two feet in one sense of another  

But now, it feels like I canâ€™t. And you can argue that this is just another one of those times where I break and get back up, but I canâ€™t properly verbalize the fact that this time feels different. It genuinely does. I had such a wonderful Christmas break, and was happier than Iâ€™d been in quite some time, but during the weekend on the tail end of it I completely shattered. Maybe itâ€™s because I became too hopeful and reality really brought its fist down on me, or maybe itâ€™s because I didnâ€™t have the positive factors around me anymore to distract from my anxiety. 

But now the anxiety is eating me alive, and thatâ€™s an understatement. I donâ€™t feel capable anymore. I donâ€™t feel like I can ever stand back up as tall as I used to, and that thought scares me beyond belief. If I can never make it back to who I once was, whatâ€™s the point in persisting?

My heart wonâ€™t stop racing. I donâ€™t see a point in pushing on if that distant memory of happiness and self love can never be reached again. Itâ€™ll be nothing but torture and itâ€™ll drive me absolutely mad. So whatâ€™s the point in suffering through that for the rest of my days?

I really feel like this is it for me
