My failed suicide attempt and why I'm not going to not try it anymoreYesterday I snapped. I was ready to go to sleep and not wake up. Sick of feeling the way I feel and was ready to see what if anything was on the other side. I had a mission, it was simple... death
I drove to home Depot and bought the nicest softest rope they had (might as well be a nice one am I right?)  I drove to the gas station and bought a 6 pack of IPAs. I had 3 2milligram Klonopins that a friend gave me for anxiety that had been sitting in my wallet forever since I hate pills and don't take them. I took the pills and sat in my car chugging beers looking up videos on YouTube on how to make a hangman's noose... got pretty frustrating because it took me a good 30 minutes to figure it out. Waited until 8 finished the whole 6 pack (I didn't really want to feel the pain of the rope) I grabbed my 8 foot latter from outside my house and searched for the perfect tree. Once I found one I got on top of the latter to try and hang the rope... I guess I was too fucked up of wobbly so the latter fell and I fell with it. So I just laid there crying and finally passed out. I woke up the next morning and realized how stupid it all was and how much it would have hurt my loved ones , it was a selfish thing to do.
