I'm so pathetic I can't even end my pathetic lifeI'm 20 years old and I've had suicidal thoughts for 9-10 years now. I remember when it started in 5th grade I would poke a kitchen knife just below my sternum and try to work up the courage to fall on it. Now I'm in college and I hate myself more than ever. The worst part is I have no reason for it. My parents are pretty wealthy, I have a decent group of friends, and I've done pretty well in school, but still i think about suicide all the fucking time. Today I stood on a bridge like I usually do when it gets really bad. But once again my legs wouldn't let me do it. I'm too much of a pussy to do it. I wish I could just fall asleep and never wake up.
