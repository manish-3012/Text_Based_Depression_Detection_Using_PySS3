I screwed upFirst off Ill state that I'm not contemplating suicide, Ive worked that out earlier (It wont solve what I thought It would). I just need some info and would like to know what I should do. 


What I'm most interested in:
If I talk to my college (Ga Tech) about depression and suicide are they likely to contact my parents or get them involved? My sister suffered from some issues in highschool and my mother blamed herself. I don't want my mom to think that she is somehow responsible for my own fuck ups. 


What is this all about?:
I fucked up big time. This is all my fault and Im in no position to blame it on depression. Me fucking up caused me to be depressed not the other way around. 
I started out pretty good the first semester with a ~3.4 which is not great but its  decent. From there on out things went downhill. I started questioning what I was doing and why I was doing it. College was always touted and hyped up as different and exciting however what was I doing? Eat, sleep, study, and play (Youtube, games, books, tv, ect). And what will life after college be like? The same except studying is replaced with work. Whats the point? Aka I was preoccupied with stupid existential shit. 


My grades the second semester tanked and the bad grades just made it worse. I was depressed about my grades which resulted in worse grades and so on, like a negative feedback loop. And did I do anything about it? No I started to just read more comics and books. I was escaping from my problems rather than facing them. I never wanted to confront life because then I would have to recognize how pathetic I am/was. My grades were getting worse and worse. It went from 1 extra semester to two. While I could afford one extra semester there was no way I could afford two. Reality came knocking and I was forced to wake up from my dreams. 


I worked hard over the summer in hopes that my supervisor could vouch for my work ethic and that could help me demonstrate Ive changed and in turn help me get the prereq overrides I would need to get the classes I needed in order to graduate in 3 rather than 4 semesters. If I was able to get these then I saw I saw a path out off the hole I dug myself in. Unfortunately GaTech doesn't give prereq overrides just because you need them you have to deserve them by demonstrating you have the required knowledge. I somehow deluded myself into thinking It would be okay since I still had to retake the prerequisite course anyway so I would sill have to take the same courses I would just take two concurrently that normally would have to be taken sequentially. 


That plan failed and I now had four semesters left while I only was able to afford 3. My parents used to be proud of me and now I failed them. I started contemplating suicide. I saw it as the only way out. My plan was to go to school as normal and then kill myself while making it look like an accident. I figured that way my parents wouldn't have to deal with the fact that their son is a loser.  We were planning a hiking trip during winter break and I felt like that would be a good time to stage an accident. I also went on nighttime walks off campus for the off chance I might be mugged and perhaps shot when I put up a fight (I tried to have reasons like picking up pizza for those walks). 


A couple things happened after this most recent semester came to an end. The hiking trip was put off since nearly everyone getting sick and some of the logistics for the trip were not working out. I started looking into other ways to make suicide look like an accident online and found out that its unlikely for me to pull it off because with just a bit of investigating they can see my online history and additionally see my academic performance. After that its not hard to put 2 and 2 together. Then it would be revealed to my parents that Im not just a failure but a suicidal failure. 


After that I got a bit of good news. When looking through some letters it was found that some money has been going into an account to pay off some loans. The loans were paid of so that money has been building up to quite a bit. With this money I could afford the second extra semester. Things were looking up, I saw the recent occurrences as possibly some sort of sign that things were going to turn out alright. 


Unfortunately the good feelings didn't last long. Since I thought my prior semester was pointless since there was no way to finish college I didn't put in enough effort. When grades came out I got a drop/dismissal notice a couple hours later. The saddest part was my gpa would have been high enough to avoid being dropped If I didn't miss one of my finals because I was being careless and wrote down the wrong time in my schedule. 


So now Im in a situation where I am royally fucked. I dont know If there is some way to perhaps try justify my grades last semester by explaining the circumstance and then avoid the drop. And even If I do contact the school and tell them I was having my last hurrah before I kissed the world goodbye (Or at lest felt like that at the time) I don't know If its likely to change anything (It is my fault for fucking up after all) and there is the possibility that it might lead my family might find out the fact that I was contemplating suicide. 


Is there any chance for me to salvage the situation? Who should I talk to and is there a way me to bring up my justification without mentioning my suicidal thoughts (I just don't want that leaking out, especially to my parents)? What should I do?



Sorry for bothering you with all my nonsense especially because this is a hole I dug myself but I feel a bit helpless right now and Im not sure what I need to do.
