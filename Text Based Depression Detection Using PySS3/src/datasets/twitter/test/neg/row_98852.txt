Should I die?I've been thinking about death for a while because I feel like a horrible person i really hate myself and I'm sure you'll all hate me aswell after hearing this, I'm quite young and rather fucked mentally, I can't stop thinking about sexually harming people. I don't know why but it just won't leave my mind I was scared I would act up on my erges and one day I did, someone I knew was asleep one day and while they were asleep I put my fingers inside of them, thinking about it even now makes my stomach churn when she woke up she immediately left and began to cry, hearing her cry made my heart feel empty I couldn't have belived what I've just done I don't know why I did it, something came over me it's hard to say but that's not the important part, I just want to know if I can change I've been seeing a therapist for a while now long before I done what I did and I've cut myself even longer (I was trying to get rid of the thoughts) I feel hopeless, i keep thinking "i should end it now to stop myself from hurting anyone else" then I look up about why shouldn't I die then they say the same thing like "you're amazing" and all of that shit. So now that you know my story and what I've done i want to know. Do I deserve to live or not?
