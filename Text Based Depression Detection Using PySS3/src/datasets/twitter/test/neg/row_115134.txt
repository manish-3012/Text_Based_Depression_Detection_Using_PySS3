I am going to hang myself tonight. I refuse to live in pain any longer.Hey guys. I am a 22 year old female. I just turned 22 on the 17th. I would be graduating with a bachelor's degree in English literature, hoping to becoming a teacher someday. I have a family who loves me. I have friends. I do alright in school, I am there for people who need support. 

But what does any of that matter if I hate myself? I absolutely cannot stand to be in this body anymore. I have been struggling with depression anxiety, and I am almost sure, BPD (yea yeah, self diagnosis, but all the symptoms are there, I would basically have to pop into a shrink's office for a diagnosis). I struggle with disordered eating and have 'recovered' when I was in high school; I also struggle with purging, body image and self-worth. 

I was sexually assaulted 2 years ago in a dorm. It has since haunted me every waking day that I am alive. I have received counselling for it and while the ladies were kind and helpful, it still haunts me. 

In addition to all that fun, I am a sex worker because I don't make enough money to support myself. It's alright most of the time, but it has taken it's toll. I feel worthless. My body is repulsive, it's garbage. I want to peel my skin off and die, I am so desperate, and nobody know how desperate I am to die

The pain I feel comes and goes in waves, so for example, I was having a fucking FANTASTIC stretch; showering wasn't a chore, I was doing sort of okay with food and purging, everything was cool. But when it rains, it fucking pours, and each time I fall back into my depression it gets worse and worse and worse... 

I refuse to live the rest of my life going down this path of hell. I am literally taking my life into my own hands. The only thing I am scared of is waking up and having brain damage. Then I really would have fucked up... You know that saying where people don't really want to die, they just want the pain to end? I really want to die. I don't want to live a life pain-free, I just don't want to "do" life. I could call a hotline, but what do I say? Those hotlines are there for the people that want to live. I am beyond help. I wish I had a better method. I don't have any hope left; my heart is aching, it is being ripped in two, I don't know what to do anymore... I figure at least I won't be so isolated even if my last words are read on reddit. I just don't want to be in pain anymore, and I am scared; I know it' silly, but I just want someone to hold my hand and let it happen so I know I won't be dying completely alone. 

Sorry for the rant. I love all of you silly people. Keep fighting the good fight man.
