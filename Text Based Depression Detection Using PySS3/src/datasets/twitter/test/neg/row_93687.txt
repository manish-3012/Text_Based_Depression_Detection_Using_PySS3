I want to commit suicideI donâ€™t have many friends and no family. Iâ€™m very tired. I feel as though my issues will never be resolved and I will continue to be in pain. I just want to feel content, I donâ€™t even need to be happy. I believe I will commit suicide in the next few weeks, after I say my goodbyes and get my ducks in a row. I am just tired and want to go to sleep forever.
