Need some help with a person I don't knowI've run into a strange problem.

Long story short someone signed up for an online therapy platform using my email address, and I was trying to unsubscribe. In the process, I managed to get access to the account (since they'd used my email address to sign up), and found a suicidal message on there, as well as a phone number. The platform responded with what looks like a canned response. I'm hesitant to get involved, but want to make sure I can this person's contact info to a professional in case this is serious.

This is what the message said (sorry I'd attach a screenshot, but it's my first time on Reddit, and I dunno how).

"I'm going to kill myself. My phone number is +1 (702) 849-5342

Let me know if someone knows what I can do with this.

Oh and I don't live in the US, where this person seems to be based, so I can't call or do an online chat with a US based suicide prevention hotline.
