Mental BarrierHonestly I've stopped trying to get better; I've been sick coming up 8 years, learnt I was disabled in that time too, and I'm getting tired of waiting it out. For what? So I can just be dependant on my parents for the rest of my life, never achieving anything, because I'm slow instead of sick? There's no 'better' for me, only coping and I don't care for that anymore. I used to fantisize about dying in a natural disaster, or getting hit by a drunk driver- anything that I couldn't be blamed for, until I realised nothing was guaranteed to happen unless it was by my hand. After that the fantasies were about trains, bleeding out, pills. I've become more realistic since then and understand what's more plausible for me, and honestly I feel I'm ready. Mentally, I'm ready. But I just... dont act on it, for some reason. A handful of half-arsed OD attempts, sure, but nothing with a likelihood of success. There's a difficulty, feels like a near impossibility, of taking what's in my head and making it Real. At this point it's all I want, and I feel like even more of a failure for not doing it! I used to be so scared of admitting it, but I've told my doctors that I think of and want it, multiple times, and hey as long as you dont actually do it, not our problem! Since then I don't feel as afraid, because no one can be surprised when/if it happens. The only thing left is figuring out how to remove that barrier, bring what I want and thought about so much into actuality, but I have no idea how to and it makes me hate myself more. Every time I think of it and don't act feels like a personal failure.
