I think I finally came to terms with the fact that my cause of death will be suicide.I canâ€™t keep fighting. Iâ€™ve heard for 7 years â€œthings will get betterâ€ â€œlife goes onâ€  â€œgo for a walk, it will helpâ€. Life doesnâ€™t get better. Itâ€™s only gotten worse, regardless of the attempts Iâ€™ve made at bettering my situation. Itâ€™s like one thing after another. I guess I just finally made peace with the fact that one day Iâ€™ll be able to kill myself. Itâ€™s given my tormented mind peace since accepting this fact. Iâ€™m not actively seeking suicide at the moment, but itâ€™ll come, maybe in week, or a month, or year. Itâ€™s just a matter of time
