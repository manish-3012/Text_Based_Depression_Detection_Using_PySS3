When you...When you look around at your peers and see the things you wish you had and the people you wish you were try to remember how face-palmingly wrong you can be when it comes to assessing the emotions of your future or hypothetical self.

Remember kindergarten?  I do. I remember that we were never assigned homework, and I remember longing for that to change.  All of the older and cooler kids we're doing it, and the weeks seemed months long as I impatiently waited for the day that I would finally get assigned my very own homework.

What a fool.

When you can't sleep because the voice in your head keeps reviewing everything that should be doing or should have done differently try to remember that the voice isn't you, it's the manifestation of the expectations of others.  Others that would likely rather see you happy than to see you rise to their expectations miserably. You can always identify this voice by its use of "should."

When you think about killing yourself try to remember that it doesn't mean you're weak or selfish or mentally ill, it means you're just like the rest of us.  There's not a person on the planet that can't imagine a situation in which death would be a mercy, although some won't be comfortable externalizing the sentiment. 

When you feel worthless try to remember that nothing is ever free.  Just because you can't figure out what something is costing you doesn't mean it's not costing you something.  In the same way, just because you can't determine where you're valued doesn't mean you're not enriching someone else's life. This is another area where you can be face-palmingly wrong, and here's another example:

When you are considering whether or not to post here asking for help I bet there are many who don't because they feel like they're being a burden. In reality they are withholding their value from being shared with people like me who feel a little richer every time we are able to help someone in need.
