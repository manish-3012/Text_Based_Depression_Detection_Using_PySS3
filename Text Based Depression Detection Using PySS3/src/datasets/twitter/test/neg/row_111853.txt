Its getting stupid at this point.You see how world changes. Everything in this world makes us miserable. Life? Its a joke. I hate my job. Stress. Cold. Long hours. But gotta be an adult. Right? Suck it up. Be miserable and just do it because this is what being an adult is about. Suck up the fact that you're unhappy because you need to pay bills. Many things are driving me insane. I'm almost 23 year old female. I'm thinking about ending it on my birthday. I can't cope with everyday life. I've been mentally tired ever since I was a kid. I hate myself. My life. Have no reason to keep going. I can't be in relationships. I have no trust. I hate other people. I hate other females the most. I even hate the word female/girl itself. Makes me want to vomit. All I imagine is skinny tanned big booby bitch trying to seduce my boyfriend by wearing crop top and mini skirt. I'm ugly. Unattractive. And just tired. I know what men are like. I will never find a person who never looks at other girls. I'm terrified of leaving him alone at home for few hours because all guys do the same kind of crap when they're alone and then lie about it. They cheat. Constantly check out other women then lie. I'm not good enough. Nor I ever will be. My body shape is disgusting. No matter the gym. Whatever. It will never fix my ugly square shape. I feel distorted. I can't be happy. I don't have goals anymore. I go to work and I'm miserable there. Come home on days off to just sleep and think about suicide and argue with the love of my life about other women . I want this to end. Anybody?
