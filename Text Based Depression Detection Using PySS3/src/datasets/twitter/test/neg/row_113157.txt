I donâ€™t want to kill myself, but Iâ€™m losing hope.Iâ€™m 22M and currently living in a small apartment with 3 other roommates.  Iâ€™m going to a tech school for welding and am enlisted in the Army National Guard.  

The welding program was supposed to be my last resort for a backup plan, because I want to become a writer but I need a decent career to help support me.  

Before, I tried going to a community college and planned to move to a university, but I failed miserably the first semester of cc.  Now Iâ€™m failing the first semester of the welding program.  

I guess I have the National Guard, but thatâ€™s only part time.  Iâ€™m supposed to go to basic training this February.  If I fail welding, I might try to switch to active duty, because thereâ€™s nothing else for me.

I also think I have undiagnosed autism, which would explain why I keep fucking shit up.  If I got diagnosed though, I would get discharged from the military.

I also donâ€™t really have many friends and am still a virgin, so thereâ€™s that.

I just donâ€™t know wtf Iâ€™m doing with my life and Iâ€™m thinking about suicide more and more.  I donâ€™t want to die yet, I want to live to an old age, but Iâ€™m losing hope.  I still have some hope, but itâ€™s slowly fading away.
