Comtemplating an "easier" wayReally just an overall mess; 21 father of two. Every day just seems to get harder and I'm increasingly fighting with the the mother of my children, so much so that I fear it will affect them. I've never really felt like I was made for this world, have remembered feeling sad primarily my whole life have never really been a happy person at all. I'm just scared I'm going to elect to let my family be free of the burden that is me. I just don't know what to do
