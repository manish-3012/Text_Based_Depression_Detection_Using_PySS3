Having strong suicidal tendencies now. Can't even get through to a suicide hotline. No one is picking my call. Too scaredLife is complicated for everyone. I don't have the courage to face my current problems head on. Counseling is helping me calm down a bit but it's too slow. A precipitating event happened a while ago. Feeling like committing suicide but I have some reasons that are holding me back. But the only thing I can think about right now is dying. Very difficult to even breathe
