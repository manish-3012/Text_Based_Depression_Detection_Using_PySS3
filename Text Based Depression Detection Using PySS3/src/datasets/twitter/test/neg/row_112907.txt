I have nothing to live for.So, to start off, I'm nineteen and transgender, born male. My family doesn't give two shits about what I have to say or how I feel, telling me I'm delusional, that I'm just trying to get attention, I shouldn't believe everything I read on the internet, etc.

My father makes $100,000 a year after taxes, but would rather spend that money on $25,000 boats, hot tubs, alcohol, and his drug addict wife, instead of a college fund for his only fucking child.

I am emotionally numb. The only emotions I can really feel are burning anger and crippling sadness. I have no friends outside of my tenuous friendships with people online. I haven't left the house in almost four months. I have no job, no aspirations, no goals, nothing. I just eat, sleep, play videogames, and mooch off of my elderly grandmother.

Whenever I see my female friends whining and bitching about their periods and shit like that on Facebook, I feel absolutely disgusted and an unhealthy amount of jealousy. I would *love* to experience that, but I will never be able to. 

I can't even get to have my preferred body type. Plump/curvy/thick, whichever word you prefer. 

I will never find a guy that will love me, because I can't love myself. Any person in their right mind would never date me, let alone an attractive guy.  I can't satisfy his desires, so he has no reason to pick me over a girl that can actually give him what he wants. I can't have periods, I can't have sex, I can't get pregnant. Whenever I see a pregnant woman, it is a painful reminder that I will never be able to carry a child to term, give birth, or hold *my* child in my arms.

"But MissKibblez! What about adoption, or banking sperm for later use?"

**Fuck that shit**. Fuck it with a rusty rake. I don't have the skills or knowledge to take care of a child, let alone myself. I also don't want to be stuck with a child that isn't biologically mine/genetically related to me. 

I don't want to have to take estrogen for the rest of my life, I don't want to have to pay $25,000+ for fucking sex reassignment surgery, I don't want to have to pay for facial surgery, because I fucking *can't*. I don't want to be a shitty fake imitation of an actual person that was born as a perfect female.

tl;dr Nineteen year old transgender virgin that hates her life, has no desire to improve.
