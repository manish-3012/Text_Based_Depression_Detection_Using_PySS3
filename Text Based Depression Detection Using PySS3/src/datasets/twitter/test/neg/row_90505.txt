self harm alternatives?TW mention of self harm!

hi everyone, so I'm trying to cope with depression and haven't cut in awhile (like a year), but I'm going through a depressive/anxious episode that was triggered by a bad breakup, and my friends isolating me and not inviting me to events. i'm not feeling the best right now, so i was wondering if anyone has activity recommendations that are good alternatives to self harm/cutting? i've heard crafting is good, but i'd love some personal recs just because i'm really trying to get through the day without thinking about hurting myself the whole time. thank you!
