Broken earbuds left even more broken than before.
TL;DR: No, Iâ€™m not putting one, I canâ€™t sum this up in a neat little package. If you donâ€™t wanna read the whole thing, donâ€™t. 

Some of you may have read that â€œBroken Earbudsâ€ post, well, that was in preparation for a speech to give in school. I basically read that analogy but with more to it. I was sweating like hell while I was up there and i hadnâ€™t even started. Anyways, when I got halfway through, I noticed like five people had tears in their eyes, I guess it made people see how dark it is for some people. How some people see rain when everyone else sees sunshine. Anyway, I finished it and got applauded for it. Thatâ€™s not what I did it for, but I guess people thought thatâ€™s how they show support. (It was in front of an assembly.) Now, I didnâ€™t really care and I just wanted to be left alone after, I was struggling to keep it together through the whole paper. 

Come the end of the day, Iâ€™m called down to the office. Yeah, the DEANS OFFICE. I wonder what the hell i did, I used to fuck shit up most of elementary, intermediate, and junior high, but now I just keep to myself. That life wasnâ€™t who I wanted to be, but hey, look who I ended up being. Not much better, right? When at the deans, they told me, (I shit you not) â€œWeâ€™ve gotten some reports from teachers and some fellow students that you may be going through some troubling times.â€ I replied, â€œsure, if thatâ€™s what people wanted to tell you.â€ Why the hell would they care now, they never cared before? The dean said, â€œOkay, well weâ€™re pulling you out of your classes and putting you with Mrs. Miller- (my Resource teacher, yes, Iâ€™m in a special Ed class.) -for an extended period of time to make sure youâ€™re not overwhelmed.â€ I stood up and said, â€œAre you shitting me, youâ€™re pulling me out of classes because you think thatâ€™s gonna help me?â€ Obviously, I was warned about my language, but thatâ€™s not the point. â€œYes, we are here to help. We will also be messaging home about the paper.â€ At that point, I was pissed off and just left, I walked home today. 

I am now required to see the school therapist every week for a â€œcheck-upâ€ and will not be able to see my friends in any classes as I will be stuck in Resource. 

Me trying to get things off my chest has left me feeling more isolated than before, and Iâ€™ve got nobody to talk to about it with. Except for some stupid ass school therapist who is PAID to listen and doesnâ€™t give any more of a shit than the teachers do. Guess the moral or the story is to not express how you feel, just let it fester until youâ€™re past the point of no return. Then everyone will rush to your aid.
