16 - Done with itDone with life at this point. Nothing to live for Iâ€™ve so many ups and downs the downs are just 80% of the time. 

Not sure if Iâ€™m even man enough to end it. If I donâ€™t Iâ€™m running away.

I never do well in school. I feel I do an insane amount of study but still fail. And my parents donâ€™t except it at all and I feel bully my into feeling bad about myself.

I just feel depressed like if I didnâ€™t have technology Iâ€™d be dead. My â€œfriendsâ€ piss me off all the time and try to annoy me so I donâ€™t like talking to them.

Iâ€™m male btw. And I guess this is a last ditch effort for some human advice that doesnâ€™t involve tough it up or it gets better.
