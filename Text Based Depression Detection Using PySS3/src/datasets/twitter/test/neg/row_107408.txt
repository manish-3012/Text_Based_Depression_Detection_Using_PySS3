I'm a mistakeI'm getting a 32 in Math now. I'm not happy and I know I'll never be. I don't feel like living because I know I'll never amount to anything. I'll probably end up with a shitty job, and I just never do anything I should. I know I should do my work and I have a math tutor but nothing. I'll never get into any university or anywhere and I'll just be a waste to everyone.

I really just want to kill myself and stop feeling all this anxiety and pressure. I know it's all my fault. I need to start doing work and not put things off, but I can't. I just get distracted even during doing work. I shouldn't be doing this. I should be studying for tests and not doing this to myself but I do.

I just don't want to live. I wouldn't be missed anyway.
