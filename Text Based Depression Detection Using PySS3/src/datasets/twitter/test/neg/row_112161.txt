What counts as a suicide attempt?I know what normally counts as a suicide attempt, like actually doing the ac to in but failing, but does this scenario count as well or is it just suicidal ideation or something like that:

Does it count as a suicide attempt if the person has the weapon (gun, knife, etc) in hand but canâ€™t bring themself to do it?
