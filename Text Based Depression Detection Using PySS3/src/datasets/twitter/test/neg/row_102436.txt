I surrender. Take me nowI surrender 

Anyone else? No matter what I do it goes wrong. Can't win. Ever. I surrender! 

Everyone else seems happy. Why not me? Not even given a sprinkle of happiness to enjoy for a moment. Seems like my whole life has been a sick experiment and someone enjoys watching me suffer. 

Do you feel the same??? 

Gone to doctors twice just get signed off. But then I'm left alone with my own thoughts. I'm meant to go back to work in a few days. I don't think so.

Friends and family.. LOL what are those? 

I have always put everyone before myself. Never expect anything back. Always get it thrown back in my face. 

People only care about themselves. 

Just tried to find a webchat/text service and the webchat is closed now so I tried the text... got a reply to say they are updating their services so I should call. I have never laughed so hard in my life. 

I reach out and it's either I'm not taken seriously or ignored. 

The only reason I'm still here is because I want to support my girlfriend by going to a funeral that is soon. Going to have to fake energy just to peel myself out of bed and show support. I don't even have any emotion left. 

I did think about how she'd feel and how my mum would feel if I were gone. But what about my pain? I know its selfish but I don't care anymore.

I've researched methods and I'm seeing too many failing attempts but that is not going to stop me. I'd rather try and fail than not try at all... But I know my luck, I'll probably end up immortal with no way out then I'd really be screwed. 

I surrender.
