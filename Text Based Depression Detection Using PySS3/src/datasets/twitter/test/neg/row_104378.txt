i want to kill myself this weekhelp me please iâ€™m so stuck, instead of recovering from my depression and being suicidal, i thought home would be a good way to recover, but i thought wrong

my younger sister beat me and when i told my dad about it, he sided with my younger sister and i was left there to be beaten up and be bullied by them 

i was really hurt and i told my mom about it, and she sided with my younger sister
i fucking hate everyone in my family, 
my dad started treating me like an animal and told me that I belong to an asylum because iâ€™m depressed

my dad started saying mean things about me and insulted me about my depression, whenever iâ€™d defend myself heâ€™d threaten to punch me

iâ€™m so lost and i want to kill myself this week
