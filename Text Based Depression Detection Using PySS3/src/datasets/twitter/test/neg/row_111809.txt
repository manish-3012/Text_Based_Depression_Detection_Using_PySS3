I need helpI'm only 17 I shouldn't be this unhappy I should be happy with my good job but for whatever reason everything I'm doing that I thought would make me happy has not. Right now I'm sitting on the beach in Florida, I hate the beach I hate Florida. What I thought were the best years of my life quickly became remembered as the worst. Drugs, girls cheating on me, alcoholism. only one thing has remained dreadfully constant, I can't seem to be happy no matter how hard I try. It's some kind of problem that my brain no matter what knows that the end is near so why try anymore. I cannot picture myself past the age of 19... 19 that was always my favorite number, every since I was tiny, and I'm not old now only 17, that age that number has meant something to me and it seems like the signs are all around me I'm going to die at 19 whether it be by my own hands or out of my control I know it's going to happen. Every year on my birthday id get unhappier and unhappier somehow I've turned into a cynic but still I act like the happiest person because who wants to be friends with a downer. I've talked to therapist after therapist been on drugs to help me get better but nothing helps it all comes back to "I don't want to be alive" it seems every time something starts to go a little right my mind warps and everything gets flipped everything goes wrong. That's why I hate being close to people they see how I really am how out of control of my own head and emotions I am and then they leave they get tired of dealing with it and with me. Do people not understand I'm tired of it too but I can't just get up and leave because apparently people do care about me and letting myself escape from this hell in my mind would affect them so terribly I've seen how others seeking escape had affected the people around them. But still I want someone to be close I want someone to care and when they do even when they argue and argue that they care it's nothing to me it's fake it's just then being nice.  19. 19 is when I'll cut everyone out I'll be living alone by then I hope and I will finally have the chance to leave this place leave everything. Maybe I don't have a reason to be so unhappy and feel so shitty about every single thing I do
