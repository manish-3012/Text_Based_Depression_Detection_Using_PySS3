Iâ€™ve been on hold with the suicide prevention line for 15 minutes nowIâ€™ve begun realizing that I have a lifetime of narcissistic abuse from my family that Iâ€™ve been repressing my whole life. 

My family has told me that I am manipulative and selfish and I know that I am. Iâ€™m financially dependent on them and beyond broke because my BPD symptoms prevent me from holding a job for more than 6 months on average.

The realizations that Iâ€™ve come across have me feeling like Iâ€™m in a waking nightmare.  

I donâ€™t know how to get out - my main outside support has been an emotionally abusive relationship and my friends are tired of dealing with me and my emotions. 

Iâ€™m tired of me too. I donâ€™t want to be here.
