I donâ€™t know if I want to continue living if Iâ€™ll always just be a shadow of myselfI look back on my life before 2016 and I just hurt. I donâ€™t feel like I have anything to live for and Iâ€™m just going through the motions. I miss my childhood and my grandparents. I miss my life before anxiety and depression took over. Life was so fun at one point and then it just stopped being so. I hate being here.
