I hope Iâ€™m sick and canâ€™t stop thinking about suicide.Iâ€™m not overweight or anything. Iâ€™m pretty average to low weight, my bmi is 19 i, pretty sure. But my diet is horrific. I donâ€™t eat fruit or vegetables. I got my blood tested a little bit ago. I didnâ€™t have any deficiencies but there was something wrong with my liver enzymes. My doctor ordered an ultrasound, so i got that. Today my mum got a call saying that the results were in when we were ready. Most people would be hoping they were ok, but i hope Iâ€™m sick. I want to have a few months to live. I always joke about stuff with my friends and i would say something about getting cancer or heart disease. They tell me not to say that, that i, putting bad vibe into the universe or whatever, but i say it because i mean it.
