My love life is killing meIm disgusted with myself. I hate myself.  Im in love with two people and i cant pick one over the other, i just cant. I have a girlfriend but i also want to be with my male friend. Im in love with both of them and its killing me. I know my girlfriend will never agree to an open or poly relationship but ignoring and rejecting my friend over and over is killing me and him, i cant stand to leave my gf and break her heart either. I feel so horrible about myself. I wish i was dead. Nothing i do is enough and i always fuck up. Its killing me. This is killing me. Why am i so worthless? Why cant i be normal? Im so ashamed.
