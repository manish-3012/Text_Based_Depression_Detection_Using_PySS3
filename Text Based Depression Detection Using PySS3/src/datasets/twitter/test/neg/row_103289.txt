whos in the wrong?My dad who i personally resent after years of him deteriorating me to nothing, is now being more ignorant and abusive to me than he has been in a while. But it made me think, what if im the one in the wrong and im taking things a little too seriously. anyways ill try and give my story with as little bias as possible. Lets start with work. im not talking about small chores around the house like taking the laundry out, or doing the dishes. im talking about things like digging 1-2 feet trenches  for cementing the fence. All the while he gets to sit back and relax and claim that he's too sick to work. (he's been doing this for a bout 2-3 months now, and hes only ever sick when theres work to be done, which gives me some pretty good backup to believe he is faking it) theres various jobs like this he makes me do, and if i say im busy with school work or something, he gets pissed at me. ive talked to him about this and what did he say? well me getting mad at you is better than not getting your schoolwork in. Like what the hell? does he even think about what he says or does? nextup we have online school. they come evry 30-45 minutes and look at my screen. they yell at me if i take a break by watching a video or two. he yelled at me this morning because i had my tabs open from yesterday which had youtube in it since i was learning a new song on guitar. I've never done anything remotely fun without thinking, shit, dads going to be mad. that includes going out to bike, going fishing with my friends, or even getting something from mcdonalds cause he told me oh theres no more meat left in the rice, just have the small scraps and some rice. now im not sure what he was trying to say,  and if he meant it the way i think he meant it, but i was pissed beyond belief. this isn't to completely destroy my father, but after some time, you grow tired  of it. im done with life, and i feel so help less in life now. my few enjoyments are slowly getting detroyed, and each day my life looses some more value. sometimes i think im just being  overdramatic, and im just an oversensitive bitch. thanks for reading, and i hope you have a wonderful rest of your day
