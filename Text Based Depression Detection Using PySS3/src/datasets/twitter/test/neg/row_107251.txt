Today is my cake day and Iâ€™m surprised Iâ€™m alive.I am not really a success story in terms of suicide. I still think Iâ€™ll do it, but it just got delayed. I was planning on killing myself on the morning of October 1st after the audio drama I am in was finished, but then it got delayed cause one of the actors got sick. The thing is, the next show that company was doing started yesterday, and I wanted to make sure I was dead before it starts, so they donâ€™t cast me and then need to replace me. (I still signed up, cause if I lived I would have massive FOMO if I wasnâ€™t in it). Now, my previous audio drama is delayed past the beginning of the current show, so I canâ€™t kill myself until this new ones over. You know what the kicker is? I got a lead role in the show.
