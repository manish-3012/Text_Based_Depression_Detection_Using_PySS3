Closeted and in danger. This is my last resort.Hello. I am 16 and a closeted lesbian, and I need to know the fastest method of suicide.

Please let me state something first: I donâ€™t want to die. I am terrified of death, and I fear it more and more by the day. But what will happen to me if Iâ€™m outed scares me far worse. This is my only option if it happens.

My parents are both Baptists and very homophobic. If Iâ€™m discovered, they will undoubtedly either kick me out or send me somewhere undesirable. Its nearly happened once before, and their reaction wasnâ€™t pretty. I managed to convince them I wasnâ€™t gay, but if it were to happen again, I wouldnâ€™t get away with it.

I live in a dangerous area, and Iâ€™m a young girl. I wouldnâ€™t survive very long on the streets.

Most of my peers donâ€™t know Iâ€™m gay, and the ones that do have homophobic parents as well, so staying with a friend isnâ€™t an option. I have few living relatives, and none of them live nearby. There are no Youth LGBT centers nearby and no Youth Homeless shelters. Again, most people in the area I live in do not like gay people.

If Iâ€™m discovered, suicide will be my only option. It terrifies me, but what other options do I have?

 My parents do not own any guns, so gunshot to the head isnâ€™t an option. The only weapon I have access to is my knife, but I know knife wounds are very painful and it might take me too long to die. I need the fastest method that I can have easy access to. This canâ€™t be something Iâ€™ll survive. I canâ€™t live just to have all of my hard work, all the friends Iâ€™ve made, amount to nothing just because of my sexuality.
