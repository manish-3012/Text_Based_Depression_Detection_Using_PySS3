I don't know how to talk about itI daydream about suiciding in the ocean 5 mins from my house on my Bad Days and I can't get the thought out of my mind today. afraid to talk to prevention hotlines because I'm afraid the cops will show up. I am also autistic and am a fucking failure at relationships. I'm pretty sure my husband despises me. I wish I could just thanos snap my fingers and disappear
