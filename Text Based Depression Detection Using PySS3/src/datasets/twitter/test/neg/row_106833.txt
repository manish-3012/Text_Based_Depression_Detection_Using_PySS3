How long can I leave it before I have to go the the ER?I've slowly been eating pills of different shapes an sizes throughout the day, I actualy feel fine, but not fine at all.  I have bipolar btw.  going to an ER would cause a serious strain on my realtionship and I don't think it's worth it, but if I keep going I don't know how much damage I'll cause.  I know most pepole are going to say go the ER. but it's not that easy, I have other people to consider.  I made my partner dinner for when he comes home to show I'm a completely lost cause. It's a fucking jacket potatoe and salad, woo go me, who am i kidding.  
I don't know how much more I can take. :(
