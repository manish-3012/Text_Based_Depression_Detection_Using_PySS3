ummm uhhhso like, surely i should actually kill myself doe 


im so depressed. im seeing friends today and eating italian food &amp; a BERRY TART, but im still so miserable. like, i dont feel excited about it. i should though? i like the people im seeing. i like food a lot. i just want to have a good time but i feel so sick :/ 


im worried that this is what life is gonna be until it's over. kinda wish i was a cat or a bird bc i wouldnt be able to think about dumb fucked off shit. i know my attitude sucks but i havent been abke to fix it for years 


i used to walk along the length of train tracks and tall places, debating jumping until the last minute, and i almost miss doing it. i dunno mane.
