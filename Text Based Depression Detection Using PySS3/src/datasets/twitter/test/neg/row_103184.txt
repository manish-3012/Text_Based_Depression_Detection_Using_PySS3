I have nothing to live forAs the title says, I simply have nothing left to live for. I have no family, zero friends and no social life at all, and I also don't have any talents or worthwhile skills. 

In fact, I'm pretty sure the only people that would "care" if I was gone would be my workplace. But they'd hire someone new easy peasy and forget about me. I just don't want to continue. My life sucks. Nowadays I just wake up, watch YouTube videos, go on Reddit, go to work, eat, shower, rinse and repeat. It's like everyday is the exact same.

No girl likes a guy who's socially isolated and anxious and depressed, so I don't have anyone that makes life worth sticking around for. I literally feel like a prisoner in an isolation cell in my own apartment, that's how lonely I am.

I wish I could meet people but my social anxiety fucks that up of course. I cannot name one reason to stick around for. My life is just sadness and why should I live through that sadness for decades when I could just end the pain early? 

I've tried so many times to better myself physically and mentally, but I fall flat on my face every time. I told myself I wouldn't give up, but now my options are slim. I had ambition, energy, goals, and actually felt happy before... I just don't know where it all went wrong. 

I have tried to get help, but people just said that I need to "toughen up" or that I'm "just lazy". Lol. I wish this was all just a simple case of me being lazy. I also wish I had real friends but I can see why people wouldn't want to be friends with me. I'm just a monster that would drag them down too.

I just needed to get that all out there before I march to the gates of eternal darkness. And if you're reading this and you're in a tough spot, I sincerely hope you can find happiness. I've just tried too many times and still nothing changes, so I think that God or whoever created this all is telling me it's time for me to go. I don't really wanna die, but I want the pain that is my existence to end. But anyways, peace out
