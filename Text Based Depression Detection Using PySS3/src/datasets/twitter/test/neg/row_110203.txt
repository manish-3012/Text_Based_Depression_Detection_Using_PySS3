A running startMaybe that's what I need to finally jump. I can't buy a gun anymore because I was involuntarily committed. I did a series of 8 ECT treatments and feel as though my brain was fried.

My time in the hospital taught me that anesthesia is pleasant and that my kids and wife don't really need me. It also taught me that psychiatrists are hell-bent on keeping miserable people here at all costs...
