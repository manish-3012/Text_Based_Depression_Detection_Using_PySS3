Is it ok to commit suicide if you are a bad person?Hi

I wanted to ask a question about suicide? Is it hypothetically ok to commit suicide if the person has done bad things and is a bad person? I wanted to ask because you usually always hear how nothing is worth committing suicide over? What if a person has fucked up badly in life and there is no hope of that person living a good life again? Would it be ok then?
