Gonna kill myself because I dislike being a virginOn the thirteenth of September, day before my 25th birthday, I refuse to be a 25 year old virgin. I tried posting about this last night but I kinda flew off the handle a little bit, maybe I can have a more constructive conversation about it tonight. Please don't tell me to talk to a friend or family member or something like that, I don't have any, not everybody in life has it as easy as you do. Nobody will change my mind about this, it's just like...I feel like I should talk about it with *somebody*, I dunno.

**Edit:** I'm going to sleep, it's been helpful to have people around to talk to, thank you. I also like how there won't be any need for me to bother writing an explanatory suicide note or anything like that, if ppl wanna know what was going through my head I can just link 'em to this thread.
