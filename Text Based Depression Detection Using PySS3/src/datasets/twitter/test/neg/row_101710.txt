WhyWhy do I want to die?

Why am I always so angry at everything?

Why do I feel like nothing matters?

Why do I feel so alone?

Why can't I make an effort to explain the things I'm feeling?

Why do I talk down to myself and everything I do?

Why do I have no happy memories?

Why do I dwell on the bad parts of life?

Why do I feel so worthless?

Why has this been my whole life?

Why can't it just end now?

I want to die but I'm to scared.

I just wanna go to sleep and not wake up.

Why is that so wrong?
