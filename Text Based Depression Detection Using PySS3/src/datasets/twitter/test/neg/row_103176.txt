Just need someone.I don't know where to start. I have a girlfriend who is bored and flirts with another guy who is a druggy. I have friends, but they are all busy that I don't want to bother them. My parents run 5 businesses, so I know that I can't bother them. I don't know why, but I'm constantly fighting the urge to kill myself. And it doesn't make sense to me. I have friends. I have a job. I have money. I have a nice house. But constantly, I feel empty and un motivated. I just need help and this is the only place I can turn.
