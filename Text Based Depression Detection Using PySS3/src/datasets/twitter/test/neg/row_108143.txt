I know how to get better.There is literally no more advice left to give me. I have heard it all. So why havenâ€™t I gotten better? Why havenâ€™t I worked on improving my life. I am such a lazy shit why dont I just do what I have to become happy. Why donâ€™t I tell the truth how I feel? Why do I lie to my doctor? Why am I like this? I have been given so much advice, why dont I act on it? There really is not hope for me.
