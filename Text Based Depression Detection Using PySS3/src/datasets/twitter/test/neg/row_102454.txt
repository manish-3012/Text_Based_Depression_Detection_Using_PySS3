i want to do it, badly.so, um to start off, ima 14 year old girl (pretty young huh). havenâ€™t even lived half of the normal lifespan, and yet a have a big death wish. everyday, it overtakes me. i canâ€™t no more. i was diagnosed with bipolar depression over a year ago, but i refused treatment. my parents forced me to talk to the doctors about since they found out about my major drug use. but, yet i just couldnâ€™t get the urge to go, since it meant i was going to be labeled as crazy. everyone brings up my past all the time, n it just reminds me how much of disappointment and a regret i am. not gonna lie, i have attempted suicide, i have self harmed. i am ashamed. i canâ€™t stand the topic of mental health, as due to it mostly being degraded in my household. iâ€™m ashamed of everything iâ€™ve done. i want to die. recently, iâ€™ve had the biggest urge to self harm as a way to cope, since iâ€™ve managed to halt my drug use. i tend to just sit alone late at night, thinking, blasting music into my ears, dreaming how it would be to be happy. i just want to feel happy. my energy is gone. my will is gone. i canâ€™t no more. i have no support from my family, at all. i am their biggest regret. i canâ€™t face them no more with out wanting to just cry since they are mostly the trigger for my suicidal actions. im so unstable right now. i just want to pop a couple pills and just end it today.
