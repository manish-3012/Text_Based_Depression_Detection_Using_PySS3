I think about it every day.My heart hurts. I think about dying everyday, but I'm not sure I want to die, I think I just want to escape. I figure that if I kill myself, then I get to be with Jesus anyway. To live is Christ but to die is gain. Please don't hate if you're not Christian, I know it's not everyone's view point. But life's been hard, and I just don't want to be here anymore.  I don't think I could do it to my mom or friends. Trauma sucks and I'd hate that for them.  But it comforts me, the thought of dying.
