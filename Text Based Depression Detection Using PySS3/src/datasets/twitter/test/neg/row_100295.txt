Listen HereI donâ€™t care if this post gets hate. A lot of people here have situational depression and instead of doing all they can to help themselves are trying to take the easy way out. You can create a better life for yourself, get a gf, get a better job, make friends, etc. It is very possible and no not everyone hates you there are others like you looking for meaning too. Some people have real mental illness that they have tried everything to cope with for many years and are at their last straw. Think about that if you are perfectly healthy and just depressed because your life isnâ€™t going so well. You are all here for a reason though and I want all of you to be happy I just want some people to realize they have a lot to live for and just canâ€™t see it
