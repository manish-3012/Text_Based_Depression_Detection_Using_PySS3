Thereâ€™s nothing stopping me now. Nothing.Iâ€™ve seen a few posts recently titled â€˜how I keep myself aliveâ€™ or an ask reddit saying â€˜what tips keep you from suicidal thoughts and you know what, there is nothing stopping me except pure â€˜eh, Iâ€™ll do it later or whenever, letâ€™s see how today goesâ€™. There is currently nothing standing in my way. Iâ€™m not very open about this stuff and the only people who I talk about this to arenâ€™t even in my own country anymore. I could do it right now and nothing is emotionally stopping me from doing so. Iâ€™ve got no tips or tricks to prolong it, Iâ€™m just merely waiting for the best convenient situation. I guess the only real thing stopping me is the fact I want to do it away from my home where my family wouldnâ€™t have to find my body. Right now, Iâ€™m just waiting. Thereâ€™s not much reason as to why, itâ€™s more like you have to do something yet you are still just glancing at your phone, prolonging the task simply for no real reason. I have reached that point. Iâ€™ve never made a post on my condition or really ever mention it ever, and I donâ€™t want to give my life story, but Iâ€™m finished now. I feel like Iâ€™ve gotten to that point where itâ€™s just something on my to do list I could do whenever. 
I donâ€™t exactly know why I wrote this, especially since I never write this kinda stuff, but oh well. I guess Iâ€™m asking for any advice or anything. A sliver of me wants to live, so I guess I need some proper tips here. Iâ€™m at a point where Iâ€™ve become emotionally hollow, not even able to experience excitement, happiness, sadness, wonder, hype, motivation or even just smelling the air outside and smiling. Just give anything really. Please donâ€™t send anything like â€˜you have so much to live for!!â€™ Because I donâ€™t want that. I get the sentiment, but I want tips and advice here, please. 
Anyway, send your advice.
