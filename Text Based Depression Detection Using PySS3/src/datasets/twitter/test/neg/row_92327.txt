I wanna jumpI was thinking about jumping for the past 2 years and last summer it got so bad I was standing there and idk it was horrible. I saw a wacked out homeless guy and felt so bad he sat near me waving at strangers and then dug in the garbage for a minute and walked off it's terrifying. I stood on a 50ft balcony and saw some people go by absolutely no will to live and wanted to find a higher place. I'm scared I'll end up paralyzed and unable to kill myself or fix myself in any way. I can live out my miserable for friends and family or I can do something for myself. I have no desire to fix myself or have pleasure and success. 

I have a job to start next week in fast food and no ride and it's cold as fuck. I'm often nostalgic thinking about my old relationships but im rambling I trued commiting to life for awhile, then it got too hard again. Everywhere I go I get this crippling sadness and isolating feeling inside my bones like I miss someone. People subtley tell me to get my shit together and i have no structure or motivation to get any bc I've tried what am I still doing I dont know.
