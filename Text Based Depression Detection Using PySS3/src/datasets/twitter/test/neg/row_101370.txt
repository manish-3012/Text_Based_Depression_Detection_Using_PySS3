15 year old, and really sad, help me?First of all: i am sorry if my english is not perfect, my native language isnt english and i am still Learning
Second of all: i have read some posts here and there are a lot of people that seem in a lot worse situation than me, and i wish them the best, but i still want to get some help from somewhere because the suicide hotline from where i live suck and my family and (few) friends arent really helping.
Third of all: its ok if you think that i am stupid for postinh this, that i am fine, that i am worring about stupid stuff, PLEASE i want to hear the truth, i Need to hear someone

So lets begin; i am a very shy and anxious 15 year old boy, my grades are not the best, i dont look good, i dont have a lot of friends, i have a really bad myopia (5 degrees and going up) i am considered weird and ugly by pretty much everyone ( people sometimes dont even want to talk to me), i hate my height (5â€™7) i know its not that bad but i am still considerably smaller then most people my age, its been 9 months i dont kiss anyone (i only kissed ugly girls btw),and i am very anxious( i take medicine for anxiety and i hate the fact that my mom spends money because of me), thats pretty much all i dislike about myself.

But i think the worst part is that i dont have anyone to talk with, my mom gets angry at me when i try to talk about it, and i dont talk eith my dad a lot, he is not present dad.
My friends just laugh, they dont even try to help. I dont want to bother other people with my problems, thats why i keep it all to myself.
Anyway, thank for your time, if you have anything to say just do it, i am sure i have a lot more to tell but its late now so my mind inst in the best condition.
