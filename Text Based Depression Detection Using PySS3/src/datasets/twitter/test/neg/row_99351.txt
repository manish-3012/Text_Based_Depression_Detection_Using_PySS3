I am aloneI have strong feelings to commit suicide at night. Every night, I go through the same routine. clean my room, shower, then stand in my room, deciding if I should either off myself or get in bed. And most of the time i get in bed. Lots of times i end up going to a bridge or building rooftop far away from my apartment. To kill myself. But i end up back home. I think if i leave tonight i will not come back. I feel different. I have no friends or family to talk to. I work, then come home and sleep until my next shift. I never check my phone anymore because no one ever talks to me. I just get spam notifications from apps i dont even use anymore. The person i loved the most killed themselves 8 months ago almost. I have nothing to live for. I failed four semesters in college and am getting academically expelled due to failing grades. I lost one of my jobs and my current job makes me less money than my bills. One of my checking accounts was negative for so many months it got shut down. The only one i have open is also negative hundreds, and will be shut down soon as well. I have nothing. I canâ€™t even talk to a friend that loves me. Or family that loves me. There is no one. Closest family is hundreds of miles away and they hate me. My whole family cut me off. Iâ€™m such a piece of shit. I cry myself to puking every night and go days without eating. Who needs me? No one. Goodbye
