I think this is my time to go is closeFor the first time in my life i think im actually going to end my life i have fought hard over the past 8 years and have nothing left now.  Im 27 years old but have put up a solid fight but there is only so much pain i can handle.  People may say im young and could have a great future if i stick around but i dont give a shit some people are just born to have this disease that destroys someone from the inside.  I have had good moments not many but i dont think anything can change my mindset anymore.  My parents will be upset if i go through with this but i believe for me it is for the best.  Thanks social anxiety and depression for ruining what could have been an enjoyable life also you never let me experience a relationship.  So no emotional support or intimate love from a girl which has really fucked me up further.  If i go through with this it will be in another country so my parents dont find me also lets just say i have my belt ready for when the time comes so i am prepared.  I have some things to do in my personal life before i go ahead.  I will write my note explaining some things and letting my parents and friends know to not feel guilty and that nothing could save me and also tell them thanks for their company.  I have not decided when to do this or if i will but i can see myself going through with it this year sometime there is no more i can do and i would rather die this year than suffer over and over everyday for years to come.  I will always use reddit and update you if and when i know for sure im getting out of here.
