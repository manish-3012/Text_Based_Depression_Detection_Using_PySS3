Feeling less hopeless after a few weeks of nonstop hellThe last few weeks have been filled with so many thoughts of suicide. I've had 10 attempts in the last 7 years. I recently relapsed with self-harming. It's 5 am and my SO is asleep. I haven't slept. But right now feels okay. The air is cool coming from outside. The nearby churches bells just rang to announce the time. I'm just here. Breathing. And I'm okay with that. I'm by no means better, but this is okay. The world isn't crashing around me right now. I have a very small sliver of hope that I can survive. Maybe even thrive.
