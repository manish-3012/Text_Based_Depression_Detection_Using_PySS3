Why do we live? What is the purpose?Hi this is my first post here!

I almost took my life about half a year ago on a rail way, it was intended. But something stopped me. That something was that I hade to many questions like: What is everyone gona think? Will they miss me? etc. But the real question I wanted a answer on was: What is humanity's purpose. 'Cause at this time I could not find any reason to why the humanity should be alive. If you think about it we only destroy the palnet. We live to grow up, get education --&gt; a job --&gt; kids --&gt; and lastly die. What do we do during this time? We use resurces, that destroys the planet, we make more carbonsioxide, that also destroys the planet. 

I don't think I have to say more than "What is the reason to live!?" This is why i almost took my life and I've thought of killing myself every day since. Only thing that has kept me alive is all my unanswered questions and all of my games, yes games, a great way of keeping your feelings in check. But it does not last of ever. 

What should one do to make this less painful, find a better/easier way to die or just try to keep it together? I don't find any point with life at this moment.
