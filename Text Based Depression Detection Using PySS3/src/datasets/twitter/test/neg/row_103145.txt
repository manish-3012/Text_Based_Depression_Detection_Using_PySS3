Right after a week of my last suicidal episode, I want to die again.Im losing my will to continue in this hellhole, I try to imagine that there will be a better part of my life, but everytime i think that it gets worse. I am currently a poly addict, and im not even really an addict. I just wanna get fucked up and drown my sorrow, i have stolen cigarettes, Prescriptions,  and shit like inhalants from my parents in an effort to get fucked up. I have always had an extreme inclination to get high, for no reason. My grandparents won't let me visit them anymore. I am 15 years old. I live with my mother and my stepdad, because my father wont allow me in his house, because I have stolen alcohol, and cigarettes, Done whippits, huffed Diethyl Ether Starter fluid, and ruined my relationship with my father. My brothers look up to me, and this is the example im setting for them. I constantly envy others for their "normal life that i cant have". Im constantly bored, Despite the fact that my parents allow me videogames, they tell me i can play sports, or anything i would like, and still, im bored all the time for no reason. Im so stressed all the time, I can barely force my self to do my school work without getting stressed out, despite the fact i am incredibly intelligent and never have any issues academically. im always paranoid,  I feel my parents are talking about me about something i did wrong, but in reality, nothing. I am unable to socialize with other kids my age, I have aspergers syndrome. I feel that i am in prison. Because my mother wakes me up at 9am every morning, I drink coffee, I typically get fucked up on something during the day, I eat snacks all day, I am a fucking Glutton, and then get 1 meal for dinner. I cry myself to sleep everynight, for some reason scared of the dark at 15 years old. I am 15 years old and my parents cannot allow me to stay home by myself, and can't trust me to stay up later than they do. I plan on gaining the courage to kill my self, and at some point before my parents wake up, I am ending it. With 3 mg of clonidine. A toxic dose of clonidine is 0.6 mg, i plan on taking all the pills, my heart will slow, my breathing will grow shallow, and i will go out peacefully and calmly. Everything will go black, And i will be at peace from my emotions. To all of you people out there, I love you. Dont be like me, Drugs are bad kids, they have defeated me. Goodbye.
