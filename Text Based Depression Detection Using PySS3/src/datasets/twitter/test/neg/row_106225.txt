No pathIâ€™ve been thinking about ending it recently because I just donâ€™t see a path where I find success and happiness in life. Iâ€™m 21 probably dropping out of college have no plans for the future, no job, my friends are dwindling. Even though I am fairly fit and not the worst looking I have never had any sort of relationship. I have never even held hands with a girl. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing this because I know Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to ever end it but Iâ€™ve been thinking about it constantly. Sorry just had to get this out there
