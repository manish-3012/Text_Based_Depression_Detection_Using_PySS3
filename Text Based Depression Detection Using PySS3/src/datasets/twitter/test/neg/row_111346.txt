My brother is considering suicide. Please help.Hi all, I hope this is okay to post here.

My brother, who I love and am so proud of for everything he has overcome and the person he is becoming, has recently admitted to our mum that he's considering suicide. Today we had to go out and try to find him after discovering he had told someone he was planning on ending it all. Luckily he was found and brought home, but he won't really talk to me about anything. I want to help. It kills me to know how much pain he is in and not be able to help him.

A few years ago I went through the same thing, suicide attempts and all. I'm so unbelievably glad I'm still here today and I know what a huge mistake it would have been.

I love my brother more than I can say but we've always had difficulty talking to each other. I don't want to overwhelm him or stress him out, I just want him to know that I'm here for him, that I care about him, and that I know what he's going through. He's just not the kind of person I could easily say that to.

Does anyone know anything I can do to help him? Or anything I could say or get him to show I care? He's been through therapy already but hated every second and said he'd never go back.
