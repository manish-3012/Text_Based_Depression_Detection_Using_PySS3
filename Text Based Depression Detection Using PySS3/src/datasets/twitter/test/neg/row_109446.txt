There aren't any reasons to live.I hate everything about being alive. I hate working, I hate interacting with people, I hate buying things, I hate eating, I hate sleeping, I am filled with so much hatred for life. Every single day, my chest physically hurts from all of the anger and sadness inside of me. I constantly hear "it gets better" but I've been feeling like this for 5 or 6 years, I've tried various methods of treatment, it's not getting any better. Nobody can love me, nobody has ever been able to love me. Nobody can be my friend, nobody has ever wanted to be my friend. Nothing interests me. Nothing pleases me. I have no reason to live. Killing myself would be the easiest way out, it would solve all of my problems. I guess I don't really want to die, but I also don't really want to live.
