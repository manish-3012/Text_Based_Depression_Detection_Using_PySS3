I might as well just do it.I'm a shitty person, from an objective standpoint I really am. I don't want to go into details, but I really am shit. So I might as well just kill myself. I'm going to disappoint everyone anyway, might as well make it on my terms. I don't want to be this way, I really don't. But I am, and I'm afraid I'll never change, I'll never get better. I just want to be someone else, someone not like me.
