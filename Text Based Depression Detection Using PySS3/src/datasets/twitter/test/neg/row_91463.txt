ExhaustedEveryday feels the same, probably because it is. I canâ€™t even remember the last time I had a â€˜lifeâ€™ all I know is that I miss living. I miss having friends and people around me. I canâ€™t ever keep anyone around. I genuinely feel like a failure. I keep thinking that if I wasnâ€™t so horrible maybe Iâ€™d have people around. Or maybe I just donâ€™t deserve it? Iâ€™m only 21 and Iâ€™ve been thinking about ending it all for as long as I can remember.. I feel numb.. I feel exhausted.. like I just want to sleep forever. I feel so alone and Iâ€™ve felt so alone my entire life. Does this void ever stop hurting so badly ? Iâ€™m still young but it feels like Iâ€™ve been in pain since forever ago. Do I deserve this ? I just wish I had one friend. One person.. they say to find happiness within yourself but Iâ€™ve been trying my whole life and every year that goes by I just find more reasons to hate the person I am. I feel lost.
