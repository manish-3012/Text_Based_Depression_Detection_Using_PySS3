Work force, intense workloads , considering taking drugs until my body shuts down completely. Already no call no showed for my jobInstead of killing myself instantly i sort of want my body to shut down after working too hard. People around me are super nosy, they aren't considerate. I get no inheritance, it's taken weeks just to talk to a psychiatrist about a medication I took for 5 years ago.  Someone who isn't even my family or blood is treated better, children that aren't even related to my grandparents will get it all. My father and uncle are 2 felons who don't care if I get anything. They spend it all on junk. I have no future inheritance, I have nothing in my room, I'm a 23 yr old white male. Everyone says man up and grow a pair anytime I start to complain it makes me super angry. Only reason I keep going is for my sister and mother who always loved me, and my current gf who also was going to end it before I met her. She said I stopped her. I have nightmares, I'm sick of cheap talk and continuing on. If I just speed enough I can probably die working. I want to be a example to society on why the energy crisis is so fked up. We have no future way out of our debt we are increasing it another trillion this year. So yeah, 23 year old white male from Ohio. I hate this place, the job I just left smelled like a std in the kitchen. Like literal sperm smell all over the floors. The bathrooms were absolutely filthy at all times. I feel even if I get out of this abusive trap house, I'd be stuck with a dead end apartment lease for years and my job would fuck me over anyways. If I get sick or weak I just won't cut it. It's as simple as that.  McDonald's already gave me 2 jobs at different locations. But I want a real career, everyday is a evil one and I'm ready to end it producing money for my mother and sister. They worry about me everyday but the person they knew is gone. I'm no longer innocent and young and this world only caters to soulless bastards who don't care about people. I'm not one of them. I'm to considerate and I'm a yes man. Hard work doesn't pay off for me it detriments my health. Even without drugs I can work until I'm dead. I was almost coughing up blood when I got home. What should I do ? My psychiatrist appointment is the 21st and everyday seems to drag on and I'm invaded with people in and out of this god forsaken house for no reason other than to wake me up. I can't even sleep anymore without disturbances. How am I ungrateful when I have no future wealth ahead of me ? How am I ungrateful when hard work never pays off ?
