Destroyed my relationship with a few sentencesMy girlfriend broke up with me yesterday because I said things that made her feel like she was a burden to me, which pushed her over the edge because of earlier concerns of our long-term compatibility. I said it while trying to convey why I was upset at the time, which has always been difficult for me, with me usually choosing to keep quiet. After she pushed me on it, I started taking about how I was worried about some things, and I said that I wanted to keep trying, but I needed to figure out how to deal with her more depressed state than what is seen so far while dating her. But she didn't want to be something that was dealt with by someone and broke things off. 

But it was okay, because there was a chance we could still be friends. At least until I misunderstood what she said and ignored why she broke up with me. I tried to figure out what I did wrong, but I only drove her further away by trying to ask her to explain things when she already had, making it that I ignored her and insulted her by saying things that are completely off the mark.

Now she doesn't even want to talk to me. I've had breakups before, but this one is different for some reason. I think because I don't feel much direction in my life after I was earlier forced to give up the one activity that truly made me happy for the only time in my life. Without someone that I feel close to, I just feel so empty. Being told to go away by the one person I felt I could talk to when I'm so sad hurts so much. 

I'm scared, not because I'm really afraid that I'm going to kill myself, but because I know that, if I decide to, I am resourceful enough to make sure I can't be saved, that I can't turn back once I start to act. 

I care so much about my parents that I can't yet hurt them by taking my own life. My dad just lost his father a few months ago, after losing a younger brother and his mother in the last decade. And my mom would be so broken by my death. But I'm scared because what is holding me back has always been other people, never me, for my own sake. But I don't know how much longer I can keep going for the sake of others, rather than for myself.

I'm just so sorry for ruining everything so permanently.
