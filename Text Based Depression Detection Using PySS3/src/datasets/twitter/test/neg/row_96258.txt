In a sort of limboI no longer want to better myself, yet i dont want to die, it feels like purgatory, just me existing, putting on a face, laughing at shit jokes etc, I don't want to go on, yet i dont want to go. I no longer see a point to improvement when i dont feel any better mentally 

You dont have to reply, but thanks for reading.
