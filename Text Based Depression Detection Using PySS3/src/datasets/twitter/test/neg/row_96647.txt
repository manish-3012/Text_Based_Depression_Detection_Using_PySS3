I dont understandI dont understand why I spend my time alone. I jokingly said I would be forever alone when I was 16. It seems noone is really interested in me, either as a real friend of romantically. All the people around me seem to want to be around when I can do something for them, otherwise it seems there is noone in my life. I stopped talking to my friends about how I felt because I was sick of people talking shit about how I was emo, or whatever bullshit they wanted to label me. I'm fucking 24, and I've spent all but a year alone. Girls keep me around for my relationship advice, guys keep me around to help work on their cars, but noone really cares about me. I drive down the road, looking at telephone poles as an easy way to end everything, and it merely being an accident, so my family wont feel the pain of me intentionally killing myself. I've though about that for over 5 years. I keep trying to distract myself, to avoid that kind of thought, but it always returns. at first  I thought my lonelieness was the result of being a fat ass in highschool, and being specifically disincluded. and maybe my shyness as a combination of that and being abused as I was growing up. So I started introducing myself, and making friends to try to overcome it. Now on any given night I can find a friend to distract me for a bit, but I know once I return home, there is noone, and that none of my friends really understand me. They only care when they believe I'm at the end of my rope, and I feel its more so because I've been a fixture in their lives, than them actually caring. Maybe I'm just crazy, I dont want to die, but I dont want to live. Its been the predicoment I've been in since I was growing up. I can't help but think it would be easier to die, but I dont want to hurt my family. Since I know how it feels to lose someone to suicide. so instead I just try to focus on not going back to cutting myself as a release. I suspect I'll always be a creeper, That guy that wont say how he feels for fear of rejection. Or more accurately, fears how that rejection could effect my thinking. It seems I spend my whole life trying to avoid falling in another downward spiral. I've tried every drug I could get my hands on, been so fucked up crackheads are scared to approach me, watched the fucking walls melt, and tried killing myself with ridiculous amounts of whiskey and cocaine. I mean shit my closest, longest lasting relationship was with my soon to be step sister. I guess I'm pretty fucked in the head. Maybe I should take a long walk off a short pier. I'm a failure, both as a person and as a man. Why the fuck am I even here? Seems I've always been the example of what not to be. I've talked about some of how I felt and yall recommended I seek help, about 4 years ago. They just put me on pills and on a 8 month waiting list, and wanted me to stop smoking cigarettes. Never even got to talk to anyone qualified, I took a guess as to what my problem was, and they just fed me pills. now a couple years ago, my mom suggested I may have ausburgers or some shit, I told her to fuck off but maybe she's right. But if they are right there is no cure, and no getting better. I will only become a drain on the system. So if that is correct there is no way I want to live. so I've avoided finding out so far. I wish I could cry, just so I could feel that release, but i've been unable to since I was 17. I just can't anymore. Maybe I'm broken. It feels like drowning. like my lungs are half full of water, like I'm one drop from choking. I dont understand this feeling, and I dont understand my life.
