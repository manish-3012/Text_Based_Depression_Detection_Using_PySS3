I'm so fucking tired of being transgender.I'm a 20 year old transgender man (female-to-male). I've been living as male since I was 15. You would think that five years of hearing the harshest of words from people that don't understand, online or right in your face, would thicken my skin. But no. It's still fucking painful. Whenever transgender related stuff is in the news, it's the same damn thing all over social media - "fight against the liberal agenda" "these people are delusional/freaks/etc." "if I knew I was pissing next to a transgender I'd grab my kids and run for the hills" "keep transgenders in the military - they make good target practice"

I know I shouldn't be giving the comments of strangers on the internet so much weight. But I hate, hate, HATE knowing that the world hates me and wants me dead just as much as I do. I don't want to deal with this anymore.
