Does anyone know how to get help without your friends/family knowing?I can't go on like this anymore. I want to get help but I know if I go to a therapist they'll tell somebody and I don't want anyone to know. 

I was hospitalized once before and I'm scared to be hospitalized again. Also everyone thinks I'm better. I get told almost every day how relieved everyone is that I'm not suicidal anymore, even though I am. My dad keeps telling me how he's relieved that I'm off my meds and I'm "stronger than that." Also, I don't want my parents to start going through my things or trying to stop me. 

It's so confusing. I know that I shouldn't kill myself, and that I should get help. But help might make my life worse. I know I shouldn't kill myself, but suicide is comforting. I want to cut but if I do then I won't be able to stop, and everyone will know. I want my meds back but they're too expensive.
