I don't know.I don't know. I just don't know. My life isn't worth anything really. Junior in high school, not in any clubs or sports teams. B to C student. Not because I can't make better grades...I just choose not to because Im not good enough anyway. I don't want to do anything with my life because it would be a waste. I feel like if I were to do something it would take away possibilities for people that want to live and be successful. I'm not scared to die. I'm scared to keep living. I'm scared of my future due to the fears of my past. Nothing goes away. Pain doesn't get settled it only grows with every breath and every step my weak body tries to make. I don't know.


Edit: I gotta go.
