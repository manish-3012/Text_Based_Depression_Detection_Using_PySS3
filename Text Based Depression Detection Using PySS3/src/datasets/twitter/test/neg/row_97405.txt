I don't want to do it, but living is so painful.I have to go into the city tomorrow, for a driving exam which I'm not entirely sure will go well since nothing ever goes well for me. 

I'm 23, unemployed, single, with no friends, living in a shitty dead-end village. I've been unemployed since February last year and no matter how many times I apply for jobs, I either never get a response back or I get rejected. I'm running out of money and hope, I don't see the point in living anymore if everything I try to do backfires no matter how positive I am about it.

I don't want to do this but I see no other alternative, I love my mom and dad with my entire heart but I'm in so much pain because it just seems like life really enjoys kicking me while I'm down. Everyone else around me is so happy and thriving and it hurts to see how well everyone is doing while I'm struggling to get on my feet and reach even a fraction of their same level.

For a while, my only friend was my sister, but she's moving far away because she says I'm too negative and honestly? I don't blame her.

There's a lot of bridges in the city. Hopefully jumping off a bridge won't hurt so much.
