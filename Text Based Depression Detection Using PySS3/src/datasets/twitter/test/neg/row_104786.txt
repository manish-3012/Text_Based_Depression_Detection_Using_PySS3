That's it. With no help, I have to end itI have no support system. Therapists, family members and so called friends have all failed me. the hotlines suck. My girlfriend of 4 years, who has been my love, and life, who i saw my future with, has dumped me and completely turned her back around me. i live with nothing , i can't eat or sleep, or have the slightest, shortest moment of calm. just anxiety, and stress, and pain that is enough to fill a lifetime. i can't take it anymore.

every day is the worst day of my life, with no light at the end of this miserable tunnel.

this is honestly my last resort, before i run out of any power or will to continue to suffer through this painful loneliness and bitter misery .

i hate myself for feeling like this, and i hate the world for giving me these circumstances. i can't take it
