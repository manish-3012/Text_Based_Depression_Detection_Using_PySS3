OakI can't stand it anymore, it's almost unbearable. I went to college, was incredibly involved, got high grades, interned at two companies, started my own business, and here I am. I'm working as a software engineer. Working weekends. Failing every in interview I go to. I accepted the first job that made me an offer. I'm making $25,000 below market value, and barely can make ends meet.

I'm up late doing spec work for a job interview, and I know they're going to reject me because I can't get it done by tomorrow, and every other place I've interviewed at has rejected me even though I contribute to major open source projects and have an impressive portfolio. I was too busy staying late to work at my current job to even consider having the energy to do spec work.

Two weeks ago I told my boss I felt undervalued and underappreciated and asked for a raise. Today he asked me to start working weekends even though I was already putting in extra hours during the week. This is all without that raise I asked for, of course.

I have to live with my college roommates who are doing worse than I am, but they still are cheery. I don't understand. What are they even working towards. We're all just cogs in the machine working for our bosses. 

This is meaningless. It all is.
