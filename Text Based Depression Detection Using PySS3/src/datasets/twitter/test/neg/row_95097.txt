Are there any reliable drugs at all to OD on for a relatively painless suicide? Or should I just travel to a country where it's easy to buy a gun?Title says it all.

Due to a prior medical condition a lot of drugs are relatively accessible to me. I can just waltz into my doctor's office and grab almost any kind of painkillers, all sorts of sleeping pills and muscle relaxants, any kind of antidepressants or drugs to treat anxiety and et cetera. The list is too long to list.

For reference the last time I "needed" tramadol I just asked outright for six month's worth and I got it no questions asked. I did read though that tramadol is a pretty awful drug to OD on, so I'm giving that a pass, and besides, I've already depleted that supply long ago though I could get another lot if needed.

Alternatively, is that isn't an option, I guess I could just book a one-way ticket into a country where buying a gun is relatively easy. I can easily bring five figures to make any necessary bribes work. Guns are illegal in my country, so that isn't an option, though I prefer to just kill myself locally.

I don't need the usual bullshit spiel from anyone that life will get better and yada yada fucking ya. I'm a victim of abuse and injustice by the government of my country, but not to a level considered sufficiently serious for me to be applicable for asylum in any country I've communicated with over the years. I've spent years living with the traumas inflected upon me, and I'm honestly tired with it all. I'm tired with waking up every single day just to continue repeatedly punching my head and slamming my skull into the wall. I'm tired with waking up every single day just to disfigure and abuse my body that I no longer love. I'm tired with waking up every single day with all the migraines that I suffer as a result of everything I've been through. And above all, I'm tired with waking up every single day being reminded of the injustice that the government of my country is allowed to get away with because our pathetic excuse of a justice system has absolutely failed me.

I've attempted suicide once via OD. I won't go into the specifics but let's just say that it didn't work. Obviously. I've recently completed my will, my suicide note is complete and ready to be disseminated to various media agencies across the globe, and I'm pretty much ready to go anytime.

I'm just having a hard time deciding on my method. I do have access to plenty of high-rise buildings but I've always been afraid of heights (I used to live on the 20th floor and couldn't even step into our balcony without beginning to shake). If I had a gun I'd have shot myself by now, but for now that isn't an option.

Suggestions?
