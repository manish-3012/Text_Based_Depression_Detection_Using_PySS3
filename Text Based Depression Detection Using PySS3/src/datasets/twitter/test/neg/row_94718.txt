All i do is push my boyfried awayI have the greatest boyfriend. We've been together for 8 and a half years. He has taught me to be better and to help myself. 



In recent years ive become more and more mentally unstable. My anxiety eats at me like a disease and my depression and anger are insurmountable at times. We've fought a bit, as he can't understand why I'm so unreasonable all the time. I've gotten on antidepressants since October,  but occasionally I'll get massive bouts of anger about the stupidest things. For example he was going to take the laundry to get done and I got upset that we wouldn't be able to spend Saturday together. This escalated into a fight and lots of insults slung, primarily by me. It cooled down but I was and still am frustrated and sick by it. We argued again before he left, and when he close the door I fucking lost it. I didn't want to. I just did. The anger in me boiled over and I took anything near me and threw it at the door. Things broke. He heard it and opened the door and screamed at me about what the fuck my problem was and called me a psycho. He said he doesn't know if hell even come back.



A person can only take so much and I'm fearing that ive lost him. That fear causes me to do more shit that just pushes him farther away. I am being an awful person and I know that. I just want this to be over. I can't deal with this unpredictability anymore. I want this to end. I don't know any other way. I don't want him to suffer attached to me anymore. I want to end it to give him peace.
