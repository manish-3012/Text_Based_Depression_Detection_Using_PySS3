iâ€™m sorryiâ€™ve been sexually, mentally,emotionally &amp; physically abused. i quit my job without having another lined up, i donâ€™t have a car or a license yet, my parents probably fucking hate me, my sister is a major selfish cunt and my other sister is a druggie. my adhd runs rampant ive barely slept these past couple days. my friends are kinda shit except the zoeys they cool but i canâ€™t be with them all the time.  itâ€™s like no matter how hard i try nobody fucking gives a shit. in fact when i tell my side of anything iâ€™m fucking wrong but when we arenâ€™t arguing itâ€™s â€œexpress yourselfâ€ and wonder why i donâ€™t want to say my side because fuck what is the point if itâ€™ll just gonna be whatever you want me to be. nobody cares what i have to say ever. i feel stupid and just worthless like iâ€™m the shittiest person in the fucking world and i donâ€™t know how to cope.
