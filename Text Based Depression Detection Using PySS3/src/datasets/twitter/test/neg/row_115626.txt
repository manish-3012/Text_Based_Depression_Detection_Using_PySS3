I haven't been myself for a while   I don't know why i am writing this here but i feel i should post here.

   Since as long as i can remember i have been making a fake personality, acting like everything is okay and making sure no one is worried about my mental health. But it's getting worse and worse everyday and i don't know how much long i can keep this going. I wish i could talk to someone around me about my depression but i feel that i don't deserve help. I think about ending myself everyday and how i can make it an accident. I wish i could make it go all away
