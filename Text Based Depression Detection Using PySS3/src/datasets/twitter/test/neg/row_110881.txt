No safetyThank you for reading. 

I feel like I have no one that understands or gets it. I've always been extremely anxious ever since I was around 5 years old, and I have been depressed since about 11 years old. I've had recurring suicidal thoughts since about 13. I am now 24, and I wasn't diagnosed with chronic major depression until a couple of years ago. 

I've had my first attempt last year. I had a very intense fight with my mom; she was listening in on me telling my boss that I need a break from work because of my mental health problems. My goal was to end my life after that fight, but I still don't believe it was an attempt. I can't wrap my head around the fact I did attempt suicide because nothing happened. I didn't end up unconscious or anything from the half of bottle of pills that I took. I could hear my mom saying she wanted to kill herself, and my dad telling her to "put down the knife." I snapped out of whatever mental break I had when I took the pills, and I told my Dad what I did. He drove me to the hospital afterward. I was treated, evaluated, and was voluntarily committed to another mental hospital for 2 weeks. The treatment I received worked for some time, but my depression came back around June. My suicidal thoughts started in July, and I have been cutting again to cope. 
My family isn't exactly supportive. I have an older brother who has problems too, but he is basically verbally abusive towards my mom and I. He will call me "anal whore", slut, and use Christianity to put me down (he's not even a Christian). I am not comfortable dating or having relationships, so I don't at all. He constantly brings up the one and only guy I went out with a few years ago to tell me I'm forever his "bitch". He would text me offensive and creepy things before I started forwarding his texts to the rest of my family. They won't do anything. He is literally a troll. He will constantly say the ex-boyfriend's name or call me a bitch if my parents aren't around. He would make kissing noises and faces at me if I was around or drive by him. He has said (unprovoked) that I should kill myself after I was out of the hospital. 
He can't keep any job and lacks any kind of common sense or respect. He will act like a crazy jerk in our house, but he will quickly act "normal" if he is outside of our neighborhood. My dad tells me to ignore him, but how do you ignore something like that? He won't bother or threaten my father or other brothers.
He is about 6', and my mom and I are under 5'2". He has smacked my mom in the face before, and I have gotten into physical altercations with him as well. My dad is usually there to stop them, but he doesn't have much authority. Ever since the police told my father the owner of the house can kick my brother out, he's stopped caring because it's my mother's responsibility. They keep allowing him to come back.
I don't feel safe in my house or in my neighborhood anymore. The boy and I use to ignore each other if we ever cross paths, but he now makes it a point to harass me even outside. I am constantly looking over my shoulder. He has even attempted to walk in the middle of the road if he sees me driving down the street, and he will do something obnoxious when I drive by him anyway. 
My mom will constantly say "he's not normal," but she allows him to continue living here. She owns the house, and I can't stand her enabling him. My brother is aware of this, and he has recently started shouting at my mom "no power!" I literally have nowhere else to go, and I don't have a car. I feel trapped. 
I have a moderate to severe autoimmune disease, and it can prevent me from going to work or school. I feel like between my depression, disease, shame, and crappy family that I would be better off dead. If he went away, life won't be as depressing, and I can effectively deal with my other personal issues more often. I was already depressed before he started becoming a monster, but it feels like there is no safe place to recover with him lurking in the house. 

Sorry for the long post. Thank you again for reading.
