No hopeI contacted the suicide prevention hotline through text it was alright but because of my situation I couldnâ€™t really be helped. I felt like a jerk every time I sent a text because Iâ€™m so used to letting other people vent to me and when I tell people I want to die, they take it as a joke. I was so happy but after about 30mins to an hour it went back to emptiness. I want to feel something more often, I want to love others, I want to really hate someone, I canâ€™t do that though, so Iâ€™m useless. I get good grades in school, but that doesnâ€™t matter. My life plans I canâ€™t do in the best way possible until a few years from now and I donâ€™t think I can handle any more of life. Of course Iâ€™m still in school, I would say my age but if I did I think that it would just help to get this ignored. I want to feel something, but thereâ€™s nothing available to feel, I want either large emotions fast or for me to be released. I have no hope even for when I do start on my plans cause it could easily fall down and I end up homeless. It doesnâ€™t help that most of my friends are complete asshatted bigots. I just wanna take my god damn toaster and cleanse my fucking soul. I have no fucking reason to keep wasting my time here.
