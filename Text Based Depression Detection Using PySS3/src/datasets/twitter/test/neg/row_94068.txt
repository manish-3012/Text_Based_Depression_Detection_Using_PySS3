A permanent solution to permanent problems When we think about the typical things people would tell a suicidal person while trying to stop them from taking their lives, what comes to mind are things like "It's a permanent solution to temporary problems!" "Your problems are temporary, medication and talking therapy will change your perspective and make it seem like there wasn't a problem in the first place." Sometimes if you're seeing a therapist they might spice things up and use "the broken car analogy," which I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, consider this. What if, and hear me out, what if one's problems aren't actually temporary? Would suicide be a permanent solution to permanent problems? The terminally ill are already being offered the choice of euthanasia in quite a few western countries, but that's because baby boomer politicians who make these laws value physical suffering far more than mental illness. These patients are often on their death beds anyway.  


Here's my story:

 I'm a 17 year old female, living in the UK. I was born in Lithuania and moved here with my dad when I was 14 because my mother kicked me out of the house. I wasn't convenient for her lifestyle of sleeping with three different guys in a week. My father was one of the top Doctors in the post-mortem section in Lithuania and made news headlines back in 2013 for being caught in taking bribes.  Having lost his job, he had no choice but to move to the UK in order to provide for his newly wed wife and child that they had together. I moved in with him in September of 2016. I started school, but suffered horribly  from bullying. I have several extreme physical deformities which I will go on to talk about later. I made my dad sign a form that would legally bind me as "home schooled" in December of 2016. The following March his wife filed for divorce because she had found a better man. We moved to a crappy apartment building. During this time, he was at the lowest he was in his entire life. He'd lost his medical license as he couldn't renew it with limited knowledge of the English language and picked up a job in a milk factory. He was incredibly physically abusive while I was little, but this was worse. Although he didn't hit me, he drank multiple 6 packs of Stella Artois beer a day, yelling at me about how we need to save money. He'd wake me up at 2 in the morning and demand I made him food. he once got really drunk and started getting handsy with me. Luckily I managed to get out of it, he fell asleep and didn't remember a thing the day after. He'd scream at me telling me to pack my shit and I better not be here when he comes back from work or else. He'd often get so drunk that he couldn't control his bowels. Keep in mind that I was 15 at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

 I attempted to commit suicide on the 13th of November, 2017. I took 840mg of codeine and that came with 14 grams of paracetamol. I woke up, 5 hours later, unable to breathe. I had said my goodbyes to the only friends I had on the internet, but they had doxxed me and called an ambulance. (I know it sounds a bit out there)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I got in at the hospital at about 3 AM. My dad wasn't present at this time because he was on a night shift in the milk factory. The hospital ran toxicology and all sorts of blood tests, making me stay for another night. My mother rushed over from Lithuania distressed about her child attempting to take her own life despite the fact I'd sent her pictures of my self harm just a week prior as she was siding with my father in most of these things that he'd been doing, but when I try to end myself she's suddenly concerned about my well-being. On the second day of being in-patient, I was seen by the local CAMHS worker in the hospital. I was asked typical questions like "oh so what made you feel this way" and "do you think you'd do it again given the chance?"

I literally explained to him that I'd spend my savings buying oxycodone off the deep web and overdose on that because clearly, codeine is too weak. I was let go the following day. 

This is also when social services got involved.

&amp;#x200B;

 After this, my sister who's also lived in the UK for quite some time invited me over to stay at her place for Christmas. I stayed there for two months and heard her arguing with her boyfriend about how me staying here is "interrupting their relationship" (they can't have loud sex) and without consulting me first they arranged a date for me to go back to live with my father (they kicked me out.)

&amp;#x200B;

So, I came back to live with my dad. He's got some sort of a landwhale Lithuanian girlfriend who absolutely despises me. It's actually like I've personally hurt her in a past life or something. My dad wants to move in with her, I don't. He goes ahead with it anyway and says he'd pay rent for our current shitty flat until February (when I turned 16 and he's no longer legally obligated to house me.) So, he leaves me on my own for days at a time, dropping by some money for me to go to the shop or leaving a care package of food, topping up the electric metre, etc. I mention this in an online forum and one of the adult admins gets very concerned. She explained to me that leaving such a young child unattended for more than 24 hours is illegal and that it's abuse. She contacted social services and we were seen by them shortly. The first social worker I had was an absolutely incompetent Indian woman. She told me that I couldn't be put into care because I wasn't a British citizen (bullshit) and gave me three options. 1. I move in with my dad's abusive girlfriend. 2. I move into the local YMCA building which is basically like a school on permanent recess (despite knowing my history of being bullied) and 3. Go back to Lithuania and live with my mother who doesn't want me. Luckily, while we were taking the time to think about it, this social worker went on sick leave and I was assigned the loveliest social worker in the world and I got placed into foster care. in early February I moved half way across the country to Hull, away from my dad and I was much happier. Long story short, this placement didn't work out because the old lady foster carer couldn't harm with my mental illness, trauma and self harm.

My father was diagnosed with cancer shortly after this and died on the 22nd of April, 2018. My immediate family joked around that I was sociopathic since I was so unflinched in the funeral. I did not give a single shit.

&amp;#x200B;

In late March, I was put into another foster care placement in the Midlands. This lasted 6 months before the placement broke down, again due to my mental health (although this was just an excuse for the carer to get rid of me as she was retiring) and in August last year, I was put into semi-supported living where I am now. I live in my own one bedroom property in the city centre with 15 hours of support from support workers hired by a 3rd party company. I've got a very loving girlfriend, she's 21 years old. We've been dating  She's not allowed in here but I sneak her in and hide her when the support workers come. Abandoned by my family, I don't have any friends apart from the ones introduced by my girlfriend and her circle, she's the only thing keeping me here.

&amp;#x200B;

I've missed two years of school. I have a moderate opioid addiction. My girlfriend is falling out of infatuation for me and we rarely have sex anymore, I'll probably lose her too soon enough. 

Most importantly, I have a condition which has caused a few deformities in my face and body. I've been 6'2 since I was 13 and my face would cost 15k to fix. This will stick with me for the rest of my life, no matter what it'll still be there. Other people would be paying for a car or a downpayment for a mortgage for that amount of money, but I'll be set back like I was at the start of my life. Always, on every corner. Looking at my face in the mirror makes my fucking stomach turn and it makes my thoughts spiral. The only thing that ever helps is taking 5 30mg tablets of Dihydrocodeine to make myself fall asleep and reset my brain. I want to fucking die so badly. I see people complain about struggle or stress and it fucking hurts me deeply to think about the things that these people have and had handed to them, they get stressed just from their GCSE exams when I have to fucking deal with that on top of all the heavy baggage that comes with my life.

People stare at me and I make babies cry.

I want out. I want to die.

My issues are permanent. I want a permanent fucking solution
