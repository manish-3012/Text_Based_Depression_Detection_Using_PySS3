My uncle died when he was 30. I don't want to end up like him, but i'm literally doing everything he did wrong.My uncle \(dad's brother\) died from a heart attack when he was 30.

He had very poor control of his diabetes and numerous heart problems. He weighed 600 pounds when he died.

My dad worked with him in a few different jobs. My uncle would always do great for the first few weeks/months of work, then slowly start making excuses why he couldn't come, until he started almost never going to work. He always, inevitably, got fired, and he could never hold a job for more than 6 months. Through his childhood and adult life, most of what he did was play video games.

He had always struggled with his weight. He had type 2 diabetes, which he never had very good control of.

I'm going down the exact same path. I don't want this to be my fate, but I know that if I continue living how I do I am going to die before I turn 40.

I weigh 225 lbs \(i'm 5'8.5\) at 15 years old. I have very poor control of my blood sugars \(I have type 1 diabetes. My uncle had type 2. They're different diseases, but similar. We both have/had poor control of blood sugar, though.\)

I've tried to lose weight, but I can never find the motivation to do so, and always end up giving up. I can never bring myself to care about my blood sugar enough to control it well, so it's normally above 300. \(Prolonged exposure to high blood sugar over a long period \[10\+ years\] basically fucks your nervous system. Your toes start falling off, you lose feeling in you fingers, your eyes stop working correctly, etc.\)

I was homeschooled for most of my life. I started high school last september. I did very well for the first few months.

Then, I started missing days to being sick. Eventually, I got to the point where I was only going a couple times a month \(where I'm at now.\)

All I really do is stay home, feel sad, and play video games. I don't even enjoy it. I just feel uncomfortable when I'm not here on my computer. It's the way I grew up \- I don't know how to do anything else \(most of my homeschooled life was spent on the pc\)

I always start doing stuff for a while \(When I was homeschooled, I would do my work for a few months and then slowly just give up and stop.\)

It should be easy stuff to do \(homework isn't that hard at all...\) but I can't bring myself to do it.

This is literally exactly how my uncle was growing up. When my dad told me, it fucking terrified me.

It's literally the exact same things I'm doing, and he died when he was 30.

I really don't want to go down this path. I don't want to end up like my uncle. But I can't bring myself to change.

I need help. Does anyone have suggestions? I'd much rather just end my life then end up on this path..

TL;DR: My uncle died when he was 30. He had poor control of diabetes, lack of motivation, weight issues. I'm having all of these issues too. It's scaring me. I don't want to die before I'm 40 but i definitely will if I continue on this path. I need help.
