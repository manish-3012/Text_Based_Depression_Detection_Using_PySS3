Got out of the psych ward yesterdayCluster B and C personality disorders. Guess I kinda always knew they were there. Just so sick of living with them. Going to an intensive outpatient program now. Hopeful for the first time in a long time that maybe I can change the way I think at least. I donâ€™t want to feel so okay with death again. The worst part though is that my parents didnâ€™t really give a fuck at all and my sister blocked my calls so she doesnâ€™t have to deal with it. At least I have my friends and my wife doesnâ€™t want to seriously divorce me anymore. If I fuck this up again though Iâ€™m sure it will be the last time I fuck anything up.
