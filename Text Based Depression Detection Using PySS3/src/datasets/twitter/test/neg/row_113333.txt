My life is absolute shit.It's been 5 years since i moved to another town. All this years i deal with shit inside my head, i scream every evening and beat myself with something. I have no friends, i lose my ex-friends, i don't have good work and count as unemployed. there is a lot of shit which i want to tell, but i don't think somebody care about it. next year will be last.

happy new year everyone
