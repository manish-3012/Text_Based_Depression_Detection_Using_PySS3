MemoriesIâ€˜ve notice something today after I regained alot of terrifying memories. All my life paranoia, delusions and wierd hallucinations were at my side. I was terrified of the darkness and the basement because I was absolutely certain that there were creatures out to kill me. I felt like I was being followed and watched constantly and everywhere by them. I was sure they were standing next to me while I was laying in bed, just waiting for the moment to strike. I also had some wierd moments when I spaced out and visually â€žhallucinatedâ€œ/watched a movie in my head where I was either firstly hunted down or directly slaughtered by those creatures in gruesome ways. I could not do anything against it, stop it, prevent it and it usually took over my vision entirely and felt very immersive. All of it except the paranoia stopped for a long time but recently I had a two week long episode where I had vivid visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations and delusions. I know that those creatures do not exist but I canâ€™t do anything against the thoughts coming up in regards to those things.This is not giving me hope in regards to the major depression and pushing me even further into the abyss..... this is really heavy right now ._. I see light at the end of this tunnel with the appointment with the psychiatrist but I feel like it will just be another train thatâ€™s going to hit me.
