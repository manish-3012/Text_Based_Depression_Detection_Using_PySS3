Recently purchased my coffin.I bought a camper-van to live in.

Signing divorce papers real soon, probably today.
 I've tried to conceive any sort of a life without her &amp; each of the paths before me would crumble my soul more than I'm willing to endure.

I still need to get insurance/plates for the van &amp; pack what amounts to my share of 15 years worth of our life together into 12sq ft.
 As soon as I can get that done I'll hit the road in the dead of night in order to avoid any crazy confrontations.

We'd agreed I could take $5000 from our joint account. Bought the van in good shape for $4000 &amp; I was expecting an a additional $1000 to live on while I tried to settle down somewhere. 
It's looking increasingly unlikely that I'll have anywhere near that amount.

I'm salty about it but it doesn't really matter.
I've no actual intention of settling anywhere. The budget being less than I expected only shortened the timeline.

I know where I'm going but I don't want anyone else to know. If pressured before I depart I'll just pick another city to pacify them.

Honestly, the plan: do drugs until the money runs out.
Heroin for the grand finale.

I don't think I'm going to be capable of writing goodbye letters or any of that bullshit. 
With any luck my kids, my wife, &amp; family/friends never have to find out how it all ended.
