Generic title hereAs everyone's posts iv seemed to read, i too am tired. For as long as i can remember iv been tired and pretending. I struggle to make quality connections to people, to the point i have no friends irl. The only people i can turn to are online, one of which suggested this, looking and maybe posting on here. 

I tried taking my own life yesterday. I wanted to call someone so i wasnt alone, so i called someone who I thought could help make my final moments more happy. I dont fault him for calling the police on me, which made me run away. They caught me on a bus trying to escape and took me to A&amp;E. i didnt need an IV from all the crushed pills i had taken, but the agony and discomfort, all the throwing up that followed last night was nothing i had felt before. I felt like death itself. But all i could think was how this, despite all this physical pain, is nothing compared to the past years and the thought of future years of pain im going to endure. I dont have it in me. I dont have the motivation. I cant try again, yet, though i want to try until i am honestly dead. There is alot more to the story, but the memories are too fresh to retell. Its such a blur. Thank you for reading.
