I say Iâ€™m living so I can accomplish everything I want to do but I never actually do it lolI feel this great pressure to do something with my life but I canâ€™t really push myself to do it. In my head, I have this idealized version of me where Iâ€™m pretty, smart, good at working out, can speak multiple languages, can play the piano etc etc but I canâ€™t bring myself to put in the effort. I know itâ€™s because of the depression because I used to be able to study for 8 hours a day without losing concentration. I used to have control over my eating habits because I used to be skinny. I used to maintain my appearance well but I let myself go so I donâ€™t look my best anymore. What happened to myself. I had so much potential. I was optimistic and positive and had dreams and a strong work ethic. But I guess people took advantage of me and I became like this. People ruined me and my future. I canâ€™t forgive them.
