I survive, So can youI am a survivor of depression and suicidal thoughts. I am a long time lurker of reddit. As it is December and a difficult time for many of us, I thought I might visit a bit and see if my experience could help anyone. I have lived with this condition all of my life, I am a 45 woman. I hope my experience may be of help to anyone fighting the fight. AMA. This is my first time here.
