I canâ€™t get help, no matter how hard I tryHey, this is my first ever post on reddit so excuse me if I do anything wrong, but
I need help 
Iâ€™ve been suffering for as long as I can remember, but I was raised in a house where getting help was frowned upon. Going to a therapist meant you were insane and something was wrong with you. You should be able to handle yourself.
I used to be able to handle myself. I used to be able to handle the constant mental beatings I got from my mother and father. I could deal with them telling me Iâ€™m worthless and unwanted and that Iâ€™ll never be what they want me to be, to say the least. There is so much more... I want to cover the basic stuff just so people understand where I am coming from, but please just keep in mind there is so much more. Other stuff thatâ€™s even worse.
My dad was the first one who made me suicidal. He convinced me I was just trash and there was no reason to be alive. He convinced me that Iâ€™m a woman so I have no worth beyond being a servant. I would try to avoid going to his house as much as possible but my mother would still send me. He treated his fiancÃ©eâ€™s children like they were gods and me like I was dirt. He forced me to be around a child molester without a single regard for my wellbeing.
Just when I thought I was recovering from being suicidal, my mother pushed me over the edge. She yells at me for talking to her and my stepfather says nothing. He agrees with her that Iâ€™m worthless because he is too afraid to speak up. I canâ€™t even look in her direction without her screaming at me. She knows my dad made me want to die and she threatened to make me move in with him because she doesnâ€™t want me living with her because I got upset she took an ugly picture of me. She claims that me hating myself is an act. She says I â€œknowâ€ Iâ€™m pretty and I need to get over myself. How can someone fake hating themselves? How can I be faking it when the sight of myself sends me into a deep depression and makes me want to vomit? How can I be faking it when Iâ€™ve cried myself to sleep because I hate who I am and how I look? She refuses to accept that there is anything going on with anyone but her. 
My point to this huge rant is that Iâ€™ve been pushed so badly recently that Iâ€™ve been considering suicide more than I have been for years. About a half a year ago I wanted to get help from a therapist. Thanks to my uni I can get help from one for free, I just have to make the call. Thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m stunted.
I tried making the call. I did call once, only to cancel the appointment immediately and say Iâ€™ll try again tomorrow. I have never called back again.
I cant bring myself to dial the number. I canâ€™t bring myself to talk to the receptionist. And if it actually happens, I wonâ€™t be able to bring myself to talk to the therapist. Iâ€™ve never been able to talk to people about my problems unless it is strangers through a screen. But to see someoneâ€™s face and tell them Iâ€™m suffering? I canâ€™t. I donâ€™t view people who get help as weak, I think they are strong and brave individuals. However, if I get help, Iâ€™m weak. Iâ€™m dumb. And I know this mentality is ridiculous, but itâ€™s how I was raised.
I need to make this call. I need this appointment. I canâ€™t get out of bed anymore. I eat once a day. I can barely talk to people, of the people who even talk to me. Iâ€™ve pushed the few friends I have away because I canâ€™t bring myself to talk to anyone.
Please, I donâ€™t know how, but please help me make this call.
I donâ€™t care if I die, but I have my brother and my boyfriend who do. Iâ€™ve never been able to live for myself, but if Iâ€™m living for them, at least Iâ€™m living for something. But I canâ€™t even do that anymore.

TLDR: please help me call a therapist

Iâ€™m really sorry this is such a long post...
