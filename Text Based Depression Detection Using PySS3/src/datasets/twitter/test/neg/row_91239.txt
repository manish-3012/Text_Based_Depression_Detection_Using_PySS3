I have Social Anxiety Disorder and I want to die.Iâ€™m just so tired of living my life this way. Iâ€™m tired of being alone, Iâ€™m tired of nobody caring about me, Iâ€™m tired of hating myself, Iâ€™ve wasted years of my life because of this shit and I just canâ€™t take it anymore. Self help doesnâ€™t work, supplements donâ€™t work, and I canâ€™t afford therapy or medication. I feel so helpless.
