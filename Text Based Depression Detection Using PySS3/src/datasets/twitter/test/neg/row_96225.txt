don't know where else to turn toI feel more hopeless than usual today. 

I feel like crashing my car somewhere. 

I'm so tired. 

I grew up with no family. As soon as I was born, my grandparents raised me and my mom left to another country. Age 10, my grandpa got shot (heard the shots blocks away), and so I moved to Canada with my mom and step dad and half brother. Was abused emotionally and physically for 8 years. Raped/lost virginity age 17 by stranger. Moved to America to pursue dreams, went through a very hard break up, got kicked out and was homeless and couch surfing for a year. Graduated last year at age 21, but now I can barely get a job cause of the job limits by visa. My visa ends this month. If I go back to Canada, I have to go back to my abusive family. I have no one to couch surf at cause I've left my life there. I have to start all over again after finally finding people I love in America. I don't want to force my current boyfriend to marry me for papers so I can work here. I'm about to turn 22. I'm falling back to depression. 

I feel more hopeless than usual today.

I'm so tired. 

I'm writing my suicide note.
