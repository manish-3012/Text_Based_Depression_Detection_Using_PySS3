Feeling TrappedDoes anyone else feel trapped like the thought of living the next years of my life feeling like this makes me feel so fucking scared. I can barely handle ONE day let alone the next few decades and it makes me feel like I'm being held hostage in my own head. I've seriously seriously contemplated suicide  over this just to get some relief from this feeling. The scary part is its either I kill myself or I fail and continue feeling trapped for the rest of my life, there's no other options. I lost hope awhile ago and getting better just isnt realistic anymore. I just want out, what do you do when each day you feel like you're suffocating?
