Iâ€™ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts for about a year nowI just hate my self so bad and I mean Iâ€™m the worst son my parents could ever get, Iâ€™m the worst student of my school, I canâ€™t talk to new people because of my lack of confidence. I just want to be forgotten by everyone so that I can kill my self without hurting anyone I just want to stop feeling this fucking way Iâ€™ve been suffering with depression for 2 years and struggling with suicidal thoughts for the last year I already lost the hope of seeing new year. i wish i hadn't been born I didnâ€™t ask to be born. I'm just a piece of trash in this world
