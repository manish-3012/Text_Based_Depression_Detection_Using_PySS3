I want to but I don't.I'm so torn.
I'm miserable, have been my whole life. But I can't bring myself to even attempt anything that could end it for good. There's always that chance it will get better, but It doesn't. I don't care about anyone, but I don't want to cause a mess. I could continue on, but if I do I might just blow up and make it worse than it would be if I did something soon. 
I'm stuck in some molasses, you could say it's OK at times, but it really tastes terrible. I've considered the options people get here, but it wouldn't **really** make it better.
