My disability is killing meI have a muscular condition called Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and it is ruining my life. I think that this is the worst disease in the world, because it kills you slowly from the inside by crushing your hopes and dreams. It's the worst disease because its progressive. 

When I was young, I could walk, I could run, I could ride a bike, I could do anything. But now, I can't even stand up, or draw, or go to the beach. I used to fucking love hiking but now I can't even get up off the seat. How fucking pathetic is that. The thing is, i'm only 19 now. Imagine what i'll be like in 5 more years, or 10, or 20. Will I be able to even move at that point?

I don't know. And I'm scared. I'm terrified. I can't stand this life anymore. I don't want to be the crippled guy anymore. I hate the looks, I hate the pity, I hate the world for being so fucking unfair. At least poverty and shit has a possible escape. This though, this *thing* that is my body isn't something I can escape from. There is no bright light at the end of the tunnel for me.... The only escape I see is death, and that is why I'm going to kill myself.
