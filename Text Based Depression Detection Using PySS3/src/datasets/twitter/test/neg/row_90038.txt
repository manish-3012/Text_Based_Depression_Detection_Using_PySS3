I'm so lonelyIm bad at making friends because I just cant handle people. I hate being alone. I have trust issues due to being repeatedly used. Because I cant recognise emotions very well I assume people are upset with me and im so hard on myself that i hurt myself physically. Im afraid everyone will leave me so i try to hide it. I just feel trapped in life
