I did everything they say to doEveryone knows Iâ€™m depressed &amp; that I have bipolar 1. Iâ€™ve been stuck in depression for months and told my boyfriend several times over the last two months that I didnâ€™t think I was going to make it much longer. I told my mom this morning that Iâ€™m suicidal and that I couldnâ€™t shake the thoughts. She told me she would call me later in the day. I told my boyfriend that I really couldnâ€™t be alone and I wasnâ€™t sure Iâ€™d make it to the end of the day but he had to get off the phone to get ready for work. I told my psychiatrist two days ago that I was suicidal too.  She simply gave me a new antidepressant rx. I said that I couldnâ€™t be alone &amp; that Iâ€™m scared. And here I am, alone. I told everyone. Itâ€™s no secret. Everyone knows that I could end my life any minute &amp; no one cares. I know theyâ€™ll be sad once I do it but what else was I supposed to do? Iâ€™ve gone to inpatient so many times before &amp; even if I go check myself in now, Iâ€™m still going to do it in there or once they let me out. I did everything, I let out a cry for help and no help came. I know itâ€™s selfish to expect people to help me but these are the people who have told me to reach out when I need someone. I know itâ€™s selfish to place such high hopes of someone coming to my side in this incredibly dark hour Iâ€™m in but fuck Iâ€™m so desperate. I am suffering so bad. I have enough mood stabilizers, antidepressants, beta blockers, and anti anxiety medication to kill a horse. I also have a noose ready. Iâ€™m just waiting until 11am so I can finally complete it all. I tried. I really tried in this life but this was inevitable. If my family ever reads this, I love you &amp; Iâ€™m sorry.  Iâ€™m finally going to be free.
