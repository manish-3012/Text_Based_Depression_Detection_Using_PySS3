Thinking about getting it over withNothing ever seems to truly improve. I can't even indulge in the hobbies I'd like to because I'm such a fucking failure. I want to die so I don't have to hurt anymore. I'm lonely. I'm empty. My motivation is gone. I even tried to call the national suicide hotline and the woman who answered was condescending right away. So what's the fucking point? I'm not alive because I want to be. I'm alive because others make me feel guilty for wanting to die.
