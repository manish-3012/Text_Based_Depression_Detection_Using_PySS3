The only thing holding me back are my close onesI'm blessed to have them, which in itself feels even worse. Someone else should be privileged with a family and SO like mine. But nevertheless every week I'm here, just plain wanting to go into oblivion. I simply don't see this life worth living. If there's another life so be it but I'd be perfectly content with just disappearing. I don't know why I was even placed here in the first place, it's not the reality my psyche can handle. I do it all with a smile while dying a little more inside each day. 

There's some grand schemes in place to make it look like an accident so my family can mourn in another way than asking themselves "why"? 

I just don't want to involve others. I got money and availability to most drugs and I'd like to go out without anyone knowing I actually committed suicide. No one is to know it was my own decision but I'm just living a reality that is being upheld by everything besides my own will to live it. There's no compromises here, this is going to happen. How can one go about it? 

Alcohol + benzodiapines  (massive amounts) should do it?
