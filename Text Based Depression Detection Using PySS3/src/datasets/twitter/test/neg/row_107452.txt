Hypocrisy in the argument against catching the busThe argument of people that say u shouldn't kill yourself "you will create devastating sadness. A sadness so profound, that we, I, will never get over" "dont feel bad because we will feel bad"  so ultimately behind all the veils of "caring for the other person" all they fucking care about is avoiding pain and discomfort, themselves.   So I should live with devastating sadness. I should have the ability to respond and make myself happy?   Why dont you turn that standard upon yourself and take responsibility for your own emotions and "just snap out of it, just be happy, turn that from upside down,  no matter if your loved ones kills themselves?"  No way, because their standards are double standards. Goddamn hypocrites.   I would love an explanation to the contrary.
