I need help but I don't know what that even meansThoughts of suicide are louder. After the fight with my bf, I've got more ammo against myself than usual. I've just been repeating some of the worst things he said to me over and over and over again. I can't make it stop. No matter how hard I try to focus on anything else, it's echoing in my head.

I had a handful of sleeping pills in my hands earlier. I wanted to take them all, just to see if it'd work. But the thought of it not working and just damaging my liver or something stopped me. There's a bridge not too far from me that I think about a lot in times like this. On one of the railings, someone wrote "you are enough". And it just makes me laugh. I'm not enough. I've never been enough. I don't feel like I ever will be. My bf said he feels like my caretaker more than anything and I guess that's true. I can't even get help on my own. I can't pull myself out of this. It's not enough to just struggle. All I've done is struggle to get through life because I'm not enough.

I need help but I don't even know what that means. I don't feel like anything I've ever done has helped. I have no hope for anything getting better and the only thing stopping me from walking out to that bridge is the fact that opening the door would wake my bf up. But that's not going to stop me tomorrow morning and I'm terrified
