6 days left.My last post was titled "It's almost time" and I'm surprised it was actually viewed by some of you. Thanks for that. When I posted it, I didn't know how soon it would be but I just found out today and it's only 6 days away. I think I'm starting to go through the 5 stages of grief over my decision and well I just wanted to read any of your thoughts on the matter.
