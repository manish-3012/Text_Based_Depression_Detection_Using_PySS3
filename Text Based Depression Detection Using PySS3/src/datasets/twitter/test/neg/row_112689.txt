I have a lot of invisible "friends"I know some of them are trying to get to know me better but I still feel so lonely. I keep getting told that they want to be closer to me by the school counselor but guess what? Everyday I'm alone in the canteen. Where did they go? I don't blame them though. I'm a loser who just hurts the people around me.

Oh and online is the worst. You tell people how hard everything is and they give some superficial answer that they'll be your friend.
