don't want to do this anymoreim not scared of death like i used to be

my parents were the last people to care and now they want me dead almost as much as i do

it's dark out, but the traffic is raging. who would notice the small girl out on the road? the headlights will only illuminate me when im gone, on the ground, still

maybe then they'd feel even a little bit sorry
