im pretty sure i wont be allowed to move out even when i have the money to do  so. my mom gets phsyically violent when she doesnt get her way shes thrown things at my dad even tho my dad's mistakes are not cleaning up his own space. im scared she will try to take away my debit card if she knows i have enough to move out. idk what to do rarely do ever both of my parents leave the house. should i get a police escort idk. im so confused ik first i need to focus on the job and saving up but it all seems like a huge fiasco
