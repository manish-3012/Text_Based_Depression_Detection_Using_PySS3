The world is too scary to live inI'm so tired of hearing about all of the bad things happening in the world. Nothing bad has ever happened to me or anyone I know, that I know of anyway. But hearing so often online or on the news about harassment, assault, murder, and all the other bad things in the world is making me incredibly anxious. I was never scared to go outside or be alone or anything, but hearing so many bad things is making me scared where I didn't used to be. On top of this hearing people saying things online like every single female in the world has experienced assault from a young age, or gets harassed regularly, or is terrified to go outside, is making me terrified myself (I'm female.) Like I said, I was never scared of anything like this and nothing remotely bad has ever happened to me (and it's not like I never go outside, I take public transport every day and some of those days alone.) But now after seeing stuff like this on the internet I'm just so anxious of being alive.


I'm going to have to go out to university soon too, and now I'm terrified to. I really feel like dying is the only solution to avoiding all the horrible things that can happen to you in the world we live in. What is the point in continuing living in a place where you can feel such horrible pain and suffering, when you could guarantee you don't have to experience any of it by just taking your own life? I'm way too scared to die at the moment but also worried that I'll gather the courage to. Honestly I've had thoughts about suicide for as long as I can remember, and as I grow older I find more and more reasons to do it. I know that there's no way I will right now for a few reasons (I'm scared and have people I wouldn't want to hurt), but in the future I can't be so certain. I hate this world and I'm scared to be alive in it.


Sorry for this long rant.
