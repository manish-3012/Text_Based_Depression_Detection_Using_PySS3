I just want someone to tell me itâ€™s okay to feel miserableOn October 3rd itâ€™ll be a year since my ex and I broke up. We were together for 2 and a half years but for the last 7 months of our relationship she was cheating on me. I just found out that she has a son now with him. She just gave birth.

Iâ€™m tired of my family telling me to â€œget over itâ€ when I canâ€™t. I truly did love her. I truly thought she was the one but sadly I was mistaken.

I just want someone to tell me itâ€™s okay to feel miserable. I canâ€™t bottle up my emotions anymore.
