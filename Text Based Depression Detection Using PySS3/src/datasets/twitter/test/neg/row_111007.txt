Spoonfed what I want, Very Few Reasons to be depressed.. But laziness slowly outweighs my interest in lifeI'll keep it simple. Death seems like relief because I don't want to do simple tasks that benefit my future. I'm literally a pussy-bitch because I'd rather peace out from the world than study a couple hours a week. Laziness??? My only fear is that I don't want to suffer in hell for eternity because I kill myself lol. I'm an agnostic person, so I'm merely worried about the possibility that hell actually exists. If it doesn't exist, I'd have gladly ended my life by now. Does anyone have any thoughts on overcoming the fear of eternal Hell?
