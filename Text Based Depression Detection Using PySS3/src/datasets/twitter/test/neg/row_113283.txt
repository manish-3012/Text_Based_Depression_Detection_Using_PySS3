Finally have a reason to do itIâ€™ve realized Iâ€™m truly alone in this world. My friends are long gone after I shut em out for so long. Today, I found out someone in my family stole my last $300. I left it out to pay for the mechanic that was coming to fix my car and he just called me saying he never got paid. So now, Iâ€™m depressed, broke(actually $8000 in debt), and I know my family doesnâ€™t care for me. I got some razor blades and found my old sleeping pills. So long empty life.
