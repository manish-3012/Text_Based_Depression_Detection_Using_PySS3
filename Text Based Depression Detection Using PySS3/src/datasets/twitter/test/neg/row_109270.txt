I have lost.I posted this on r/Depression but this seems the better place to post it. 
  
Depression has beaten me. I've been struggling for 10 years or so to varying degrees and I am too emotionally tired to fight it any more; it's impossibly tough.

I'm at the weird calm point I've only heard about or read about. I'm not upset, angry, sad, annoyed. There's still no emotion, except the confidence in my intentions.

No one will miss me, no one will care. Everyone will be better off not having to remember I exist at all.

I know what I am going to do, so it's only a matter of hours till I'm dead, and deservedly so. I'm a lazy, forgetful, selfish piece of shit and don't deserve the time of day from anyone at all.

I'm not looking out for a reply of any kind, just wanted to let the last of my thoughts out.
