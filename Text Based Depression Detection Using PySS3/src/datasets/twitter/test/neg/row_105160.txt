Left/Right/Up/DownIt's amusing thinking that in but a few minutes it's Father's Day yet here I sit, by myself, kids gone, "wife" downstairs. MS has straight up fucked my whole life over. In the past two years I've gone from energetic and with it to gone enough my wife has asked for a divorce. I can't blame her. I get it. I agree. I no longer have the energy that I used to. The things I used to love wipe every bit of energy I can muster. My kids shorten my fuse to no end.

I had a great time today in Boston drinking with my wife. I felt I could be honest, and straightforward.  As the nights worn it's gone downhill.  As my energy waned my care, my wanting for normalcy has taken a nosedive. I sit here wondering do I take things further into the deep end? Do I go, on all the possible days of the year, to a final restful(?) end, snuggling with my favorite cat? Do I just go to bed and sleep it off? What  is it that I actually want?

Why can't I just be happy with what I have? I realize I'm way the fuck more fortunate than most in this world. Can't that be enough? Should that be enough? What makes life worth it? I feel like everything is objective and subjective at the same time; like I can have all, be all, accept all.

Fuck. Everything.
