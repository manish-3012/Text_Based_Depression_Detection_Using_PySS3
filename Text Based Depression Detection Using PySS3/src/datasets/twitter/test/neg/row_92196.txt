I can't deal with what I did years ago anymoreI work with my family. So, my mother is my boss.

A few years ago, I broke up with a guy I had been with for five years. I was hurting.

I never should had said out loud at work that I broke up with him.

This got the attention of this guy that was working for us. He still does. But he started to talk nice to me and I was feeling very vulnerable.

We had a thing. It was a rebound for me but his only reason was to get in my pants. That never fully happened. We fooled around but we never went all the way. 

I finally realized what i was doing and i pushed him away. He still went after me. He touched me after it was not welcome anymore.

I touvld my boss that he grabbed me a few times, but she never believed me.

Now I'm haunted by my huge mistake.

I can't tell my boss mother about it, or she will kill me and then maybe him.,.

I wish it never happened. 

Please help me.
