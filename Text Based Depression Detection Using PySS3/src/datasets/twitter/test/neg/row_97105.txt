I'm aloneLast night, my boyfriend blamed me for his shortcomings. 

I've been the rock that carries both of us. 

My mom is getting a divorce.

I'm the rock carrying both of us. 

I'm always the fucking rock. But here I am, freaking out and no one is available. No one can hear me because nobody cares. Nobody ever fucking cares. 

I got drunk and looked up the guy who raped me in college. He has a high paying job, a home, a beautiful fiance, and here I am picking up the pieces. My mom won't acknowledge it happened. The boyfriend made it about him. My friends try, but I know they think I deserved it. I always deserve it. I deserved it the first time because I was drunk, and the random guy was eager. I deserved it with HIM because I shouldn't have been over there in the first place. I can't hold down a fucking meal because I instantly feel it on my body. But I'm too fucking fat to starve myself. I'm too fucking dumb to get a better job. I hate myself too much to stand up to my mom and boyfriend and friends. I'm a fucking coward for not reporting. The world needs less people like me. It might not be tonight, but it's happening soon
