Trigger do not readThinking of hanging myself in the near future. Recent happenings in my life reminded me that nothing good is waiting for me anyway. I love my family but I donâ€™t think I can support them anymore. Iâ€™m too weak. Too tired. Too much in pain. Thinking of spending the rest of my days slaving away at work and trying to be the strong one for them has taken its toll on me. 

One less person is one less mouth to feed. Maybe when I die, my family will get the real help they need. Right now, Iâ€™m a crutch. They need to be set free. I need to be set free. 

Iâ€™ll be okay. Iâ€™ll be okay. I wish i can get the courage to do it at least before the year ends, or maybe New Years? Or next week? I just hope i can do it without faltering. 

Iâ€™ll really miss my dogs, but I think theyâ€™re better off without me too.
