How to get over her.She was my first relationship... Kind of.  I did everything I could to keep her happy.  She left me... Before even the first date.  We would hang around and she agreed to go on a date with me sometime... We shared feelings and I really liked her... And she left.  I don't know what to do.  This was a year and a half ago.  Still... I can't deal with it.  Couple months after she left, was hospitalized for suicidal feelings... 6 months ago was hospitalized again... Crashed into a tree going 120 mph as suicide attempt(suffered major injury).  Survived... Again.  I don't know how to deal with this or if it will go away... Reddit please help:(.   By the way, 17 years old
