I want to dieIâ€™m laying here in bed. I donâ€™t see a point to my miserable life anymore. I see no future for myself. All I do is cause people pain and all I feel is pain. I want it to stop. Why shouldnâ€™t I make it stop? I have no friends, Iâ€™m losing the love of my life, I dislike my own parents, I have no job. I graduate from community college this year but I have no fucking clue what to do with my life. Thereâ€™s nothing for me. I need to end it.
