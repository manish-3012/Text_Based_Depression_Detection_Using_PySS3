Im only 12, i have severe depression, i want to kill myself.Im only 12, i have severe depression, i want to kill myself. i hate my life, i was bullied so much i had to leave school and my only 2 friends behind, im now home schooled and its gotten worse. i just want to jump out my window and end it all but i cant, i really want to just end it but i cant think of what will happen afterwards, im hoping that when i die i end up in a more interesting world, a world like the anime i watch were i can be happy. i hate earth, i hate being human, and i hate my life, so bleak, boring, depressing, every single day the same routine over and over, arguing with my parents about school, running to my room and crying myself to sleep, i only fall asleep hoping that i will dream of a better world than the one i am in.

EDIT: this is from a few months ago, doing better now. :) thank you all for your help
