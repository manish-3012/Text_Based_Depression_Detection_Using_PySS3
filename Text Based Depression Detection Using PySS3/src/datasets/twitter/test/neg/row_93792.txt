Feeling bad latelyI feel so fragile... The only person that is kipping me alive is the person I love a girl but I feel that after she will leave me, because all the people do it even if she said she won't I'll do it, I'll finally do it and go in peace ig I want it right now so bad who knows how im gonna feel later.
I hate everything I hate the stress, the society, the cold i dont even like games anymore and nothing seems to make my happy expect this girl, I would want to marry her but im 16 and she is still 14 and at one point this will stop working as always at least for me. I would like to think that we will make it but the reality it's though and she is stronger then me and she is gonna move on...
At least I hope when I'll do it with sleeping pills it will work and I'll be gone forever no one will remember it and I honestly don't even care about it they can fuck themself all this trash people that only thing they think is how to make more money, how to fuck more bitches. Is this rly life? I don't want it, it sucks fuck it.. And even if u find true love things dont change..
