I have passive suicide ideation. Here's why.My dad thought he could slit in a windows 7 x64 disc into my pc, it freaked out and now it has a flashing screen, and I don't even know how the bloody hell I'm typing this. nothing on steam works except for Super Meat Boy. my dad gets angry at ME because when I try to ask him to help me fix it, he just gets upset and reluctantly tries with medium to little effort, or just ignores me.

at school, all my grades are failing because my folders keep on disappearing, and one time I even saw my backpack was open!!! 0.o  (it was closed b4hand) [it was today] and my 4th period teacher flat out ~~fuckin~~ HATES me. she even SAID it. (oh, and my 7th period teacher too. ~~the others just mildly hate me~~ )

Also now I have to be escorted everywhere by a fat football coach and a grandma, because THAT doesn't encourage bullying and harassment. ~~also I'm bald, did i mention that? they like to say to me "looks like your eyebrows took a vacation to the back of your head. ha ha."~~ All the bully's that DO get caught, haven't gotten ~~SHIT~~ anything done to them! ~~not gonna put examples~~ oh and I have an Iphone 4 that my mom got a long time ago. it doesn't even work well and isn't authenticated.

TLDR: everything I have is either broken, stolen, or ~~shit~~ / doesn't work properly. ~~and my dad stomps (kinda-ish, he looks like he's walking normally but it sounds like weights being dropped) (almost) everywhere and acts aggressive~~
