My own rules for not ending itFuck your ego. This is not a guilt trip. Iâ€™m just starting off with a reality shot. You can just not imagine the damage you do to others by ending it. You litteraly ruin all of a persons memories, inducing trauma, pain, probably ptsd to the ones you love most. You will impact everyoneâ€™s lives very very badly. The reason you suicide, that reason will ten fold into your surroundings. This is not a guilt trip. There is just no way that your pain is equal to the pain you will induce to others. My grandma said itâ€™s like a tree of memories the deeper you go the more branches it touches. Every memory around that person. Time with others you spend. You get to have anxiety about every memorie you have. Yes every memory. If you think it is equal to what you are feeling then you are clearly too confused to think outside of your own ego into the many lives you are going to give your sorrow. And this comes from a person also thinks it is selfish from others to not let you go and impose their structures and beliefs of living on those who just want to vanish. Therefore I think you should just move to a different country or search for something else than suicide. Get white hair and be proud of being stupid. You literally can just go. Do anything. Nothing is keeping you if the alternative is suicide. Anything. I have some funny stories based around this concept as well. Doing something other people donâ€™t like but you want to do is a way better option than the alternative. Fuck others everyone is egocentric anyway nobody remembers you in 10 years if you keep distance. Except when itâ€™s suicide... That thing that people will laugh about now, that crazy thing you did, nobody will remember it in 10 years unless you want them to. So make new connections. Go live your best life. Or try and communicate better and make things better which is always the premium option but not always viable. This comes from a man with ADD, RAD, PTSD (so depression, anxiety, flashbacks all of the shit for 10 years), white hair and a degree for staying in bed for weeks on end. I went to have a sensual erotic massage in a parlor a couple of weeks ago and got jerked off by a random lady. This sounds nasty and I did think it kinda was. But you know what it made everyone laugh including myself and made me being able to laugh at myself again. Fuck everything. If itâ€™s not bringing you closer to dying like eating too much or picking up smoking again then anything you do is great. Iâ€™d recommend staying healthy to see opportunities coming and feel your emotions better. Not that Iâ€™m good at this but it will already change your life if you focus on just this. Your brain needs fuel to start with. You canâ€™t give a plant piss instead of water and be like wauw strange that itâ€™s not thinking ahead and only think about death?! Super strange. If you think there is no point to anything and we are all just little specs. This is true but if there is no point to anything then there is also no reason to not be stupid and go for what you like. There is always something you like as well. You have dopamine receptors and while some parents smoke through pregnancy, you still have them and they do light up with certain things. So claiming it doesnâ€™t is just you not being honest to life, or you are just really really unhealthy. Try shit out. Be a fool. Anything is more than being dead. The anxiety you feel and pressure is your head, if you do not like others pressuring you then 1 or you are not able to communicate well and tell them to fuck off in a nice way so they incorporate what you are saying. Or 2 you have to distance yourself because trying to convert to other peoples opinion of life is actually disrespectful to them, cause you are letting them slowly fade with you, not giving them the perspective they need in order to understand you. Also donâ€™t forget humans are dumb even if you demand respect which is not the best way to get it but sometimes necessary as you are not good with boundaries , it might click two years later why they mistreated you. You canâ€™t hold people on their thought processes they have now. Allow others room like you want and need right now yourself. Allow others to grow but that does not mean you have to be with them when they do. So, be a fool. Be whatever you want. Not being is the greatest crime.
