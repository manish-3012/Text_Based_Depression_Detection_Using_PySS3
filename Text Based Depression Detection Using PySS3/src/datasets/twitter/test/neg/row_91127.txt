Need help - suicidal friend 17 years of age. What to do?Hey there, for a little context, my best friend, who turned 17 not long ago, has turned the most suicidal he has been. He has always been on the weird side of things. Ever since I met him a few years ago, he has always mentioned suicide and death, as well as being nihilistic. He has always defied teachers at school, been rebellious, smoked weed, all common teenage behaviours. Although, after an episode that lasted a few months where he distanced himself from everyone, and fell into a deep depression, did I realise a lot more was going on in his head. His younger brother who is 13, has severe paranoid schizophrenia. His mother and father devote all their time into looking after the younger brother, as he couldnâ€™t be left alone for any amount of time. This explained why my friend was so depressed. He probably felt (feels) very lonely and unloved. After this episode of 3 months, he came back to his normal self, and made friends again (very popular guy), and things started again. As we got older, weed became a big part of our lives. We would smoke every weekend, and have a great time. Eventually I stopped, and later on so did he, but the damage was probably already done. You see, someone who has a brother who is schizophrenic shouldnâ€™t be smoking weed at 16. My friend became increasingly paranoid , saying how he thinks he might be developing psychosis , etc, but I assured him he was fine. Time passed , now the present moment. A couple of months ago, school shut down here in Australia. We were order to stay home and learn from home. This is where things started to go downhill. At my friends house, things donâ€™t go smoothly. His brother is always screaming and is very violent. Police are always there , etc. my mate just locks himself in his room, eats there and doesnâ€™t interact with his parents. He has distanced himself completely from all school friends, disregards us, and doesnâ€™t speak to us. During online school, he acts very weird. Heâ€™s always late, and leaves as soon as we can. He doesnâ€™t participate in any school work, and philosophy, our favourite subject, he never discusses any topics. One time, for once he chimes in. After a 2 minute conversation, he says â€œfuck my lifeâ€ before turning off his microphone. I contacted him on Snapchat, and he just left me on read. I talked extensively to my other friend who is closer with him, and my other friend states he wil use pills to kill him self. Sorry if this is very disorganised , but I just need help. What do I do with him? Clearly heâ€™s not in the right mindset, and heâ€™s extremely depressed. I know he might do it, but at the same time Iâ€™m not too sure. I have contact with his mum through my mum, should I let her know? Do I talk with his mum? See whatâ€™s happening st home? Iâ€™m stuck and I really donâ€™t want to loose him, heâ€™s my best mate and has always been. It sucks to see someone go through this. Any way peace .
