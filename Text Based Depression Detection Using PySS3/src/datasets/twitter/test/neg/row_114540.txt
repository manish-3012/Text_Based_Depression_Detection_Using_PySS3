Find myself randomly depressed and contemplating suicide at weird timesDoes anyone else have moments when they just feel depressed for no reason. I can be relaxing watching Netflix and then suddenly feel like I got hit by a sledgehammer. It gets so bad that I contemplate killing myself even though I have no idea why I hate myself so much. Never gotten too far but it is really beginning to distress me. I thought it would go away when I got into my dream college but it ended up persisting despite however hard I try. Then it goes away and I am the happiest person in the room again. I'm beginning to become worried that one day I might actually act on one of those impulses and I've been getting closer every time. I've been seriously confused about this and wondering if anyone else is going through the same thing.
