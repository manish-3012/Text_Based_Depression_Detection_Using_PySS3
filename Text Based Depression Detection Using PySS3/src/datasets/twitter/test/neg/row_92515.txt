Something something somethingThe only reason I'm still alive is for my cats. I've already sliced my arm and legs up, but I am too much of a coward to go down the street. I want to die so fucking bad. I'm sick of trying to put on a happy face for everyone and I'm sick of being 'crazy' when the mask slips. I'm trying to work up the courage to do it tonight. 

At least I'll finally be good enough! When I'm dead I'll finally be accepted.
