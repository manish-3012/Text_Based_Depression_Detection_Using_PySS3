I Want to Die, but I Canâ€™t Kill MyselfI donâ€™t know why I canâ€™t. I want to. I hate everything about my life. Not one aspect of my life is what I would choose for myself if I could change things. I have no hope of things changing for the better and no desire to keep living. I think about nothing but killing myself. I am so angry that the people around me get to make decisions about what they want to do with their lives but what I want to do with mine is forbidden. I donâ€™t want my life, at all, any part of it. I am so fucking miserable and exhausted and I just want to quit. I am so scared of making a mess of it because it seems like all I do is make mistakes. I wish I could just do it and be done with all of this.
