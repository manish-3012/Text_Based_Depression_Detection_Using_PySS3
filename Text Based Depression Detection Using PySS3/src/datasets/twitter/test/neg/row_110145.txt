Attempted last night.I just need to talk about it somewhere. I don't know if this post will get removed but I literally don't care about anything anymore, I just need to vent, I need to tell someone. 

I tried ending my life last night. I kept trying and trying. I moved positions around my room. Tried putting myself in different postions to make it more comfortable. I tried so fucking hard but I just couldn't let myself black out. At first I was crying but then I just ended up being  numb, frustrated and exhausted. I just couldn't get myself to let go and black out no matter how hard I was trying. I kept taking the noose away as things started to fade. There were so many different thoughts running through my head, so many different thoughts. I ended up giving up, I did almost black out at some points but I couldn't let myself. And dying at home isn't something I wanted, it wasn't my plan. I planned on going to a hotel in a different city once things started to calm down here but I was so desperate and fed up that I just gave in and attempted anyway. It was past midnight too so I had to be quiet which is hard when you're trying to hang yourself and I'm sure I would have made more noise once I blacked out. I woke up this morning, exhausted and annoyed at myself for failing. I haven't even attempted to get out of bed yet. Everything seems so strange. I shouldn't be here. I should be gone.
