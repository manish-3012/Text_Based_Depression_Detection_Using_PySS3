Within 6 months id like to start offering a little help if you can make it to hawaiiI'm moving back to big island soon, back to the.family property where we have a big ass house that we are turning into several separate bnbs, the bottom floor is mine. And there are several small houses that are bnbs as well out in the jungle. Very peaceful place. Anyways my bottom floor is two bedroom but I only use one and I think I might open it up to to people that are willing to give.life another shot. One thing I'm just offering a room, food and rides to and fro and anywhere I happen to be going. I figure I'll just lurk and make an offer to everyone I can. You all think this would work? I just want to help and I'll have the resources to help when I'm back over there. Maybe a few days over in a peaceful place can change someone's outlook? Any thoughts? And yea bad everything stupid kindle fire has the worst auto correct I've ever seen plus it's early.
