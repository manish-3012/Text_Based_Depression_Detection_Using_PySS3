Modding - better to remove suicidal posts in a thread or leave them up?I mod a large subreddit with a daily discussion thread.  Sometimes we have posters who comment in the thread with suicidal thoughts or "I want to kill myself" in a serious manner.  

Is it considered healthier/better for the person's sake to allow them to talk it out with other people, or to remove all those comments?  I honestly have no idea how to handle moderating these comments.
