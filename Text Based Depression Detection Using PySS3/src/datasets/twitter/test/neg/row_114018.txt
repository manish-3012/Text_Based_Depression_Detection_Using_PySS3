I feel like I was picked specifically to deal with the worstMy parents are alcoholics and have been every sense I was born, Iâ€™m surprised at the fact I donâ€™t have FAS. Each day seems like a chore, I get up walk to school, get bullied and beat up, go do some knock off job, get home to my parents, they take the money I make, then I cry in my room. 

Every single fucking day it has gotten worse, Iâ€™ve even started walking in the lane of traffic sometimes hoping I get ran over. 

Iâ€™ve never been able to get any friends, or love (whether it be from my parent or anyone else for that matter). People always keep telling the same bullshit responses when I say Iâ€™m depressed, â€œlike go get helpâ€ or whatever. THATS WHAT IM TRYING TO FUCKING DO YOU BRAINLIT. Itâ€™s a constant cycle of 

Then here I am, saying Iâ€™m suicidal, now people care. Itâ€™s only like people only give a ounce of decency when people say they want to die. But again I get the same responses like â€œcall the hotlineâ€ â€œspeak to a psychologistâ€ â€œtalk to your parentsâ€. I mean bitch, I can barely afford food nevertheless a psychologist. And my parents donâ€™t care anything about me. And if I call the hotline I know they are going to tell me the exact same thing again. 

I donâ€™t want to die I really donâ€™t. I want to be happy, and death seems like the only solution.
