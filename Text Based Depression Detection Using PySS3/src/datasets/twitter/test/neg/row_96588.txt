I took a cocktail of drugsI can't stand continuing this life, I'm such a failure. I don't have friends, the people at work hate means I'm going to get fired due to time off. I can't count on anyone and I just always come across as a dick. I'm not good at anything, I'm screwed financially and academically, I work a dead end job which doesn't lead me anywhere and I can't find anything else. I just get angry all the time. Now there's a puddle of blood on my bed because I cut my arm open because I got angry at myself. It's not normal, I'm not normal, and after thinking it through, I don't want to be hear. I don't want to deal with people and people don't want to deal with me. THIS IS A WIN WIN SITUATION.
