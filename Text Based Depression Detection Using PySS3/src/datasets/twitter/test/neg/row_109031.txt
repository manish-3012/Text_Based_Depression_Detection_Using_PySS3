Iâ€™m simply too weak.I canâ€™t handle what life throws at me. I canâ€™t stand up for myself, Iâ€™m too sensitive, and Iâ€™m easily taken advantage of. People love to bully me for it, and they laugh when I suffer. My parents donâ€™t care, my friends donâ€™t understand, and Iâ€™m too afraid to speak up because I know iâ€™ll just get laughed at again. All I am is a weak little girl. I just want people to accept me, but they wonâ€™t... and I just want all the pain to end...
