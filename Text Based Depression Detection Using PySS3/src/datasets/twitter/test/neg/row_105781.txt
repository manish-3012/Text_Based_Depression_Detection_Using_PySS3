suicidal thought starting to appear, it never seemed so appealingwhy don't i just do it ? it will never get better, i know that, god might just forgive me and let me go up there, you know, the good place, every thing that i want will be there so why not just do it 

i would but my self up for adoption but i don't know how. and to be honest, not even i would adopt a person like me or even live with some one like me 

been bottling up my fellings  for about 7 month now and every time i cry i wipe my tears because i know that one one will stand beside me if i cryed or had another mental breakdown
