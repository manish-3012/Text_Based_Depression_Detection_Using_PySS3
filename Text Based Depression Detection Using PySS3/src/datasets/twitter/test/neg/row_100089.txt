healing is not my fortemy gf left me about a year ago, and not a single day has passed without thinking about her. she left me for her bad boy ex who is much older than her and beats her and abuses her a lot. half an hour ago i was on a porn site, was going through thumbnails just when i recognised a pair of eyes. the girl was covered in a black cloth like an arab but i knew the eyes so well, i knew she was no arab girl, i downloaded the video and it was HER, my ex. i know it is her because i know her voice so very well, her body, i can't forget even when i become a 100 years old. i know it is HER. i started shaking, my heart is beating so fast, i can hardly type properly. i have smoked 3 cigarettes since then but the tobacco could not give me the hit. i'm still shaking and i don't know what to do. i feel like i might go mad. its not anger, i don't know what it is. i feel like killing myself. i'm 23 which is a pretty mature age and i shouldn't be behaving like this but i just can't control myself. i'm not sure what i am typing makes any sense. i don't know what to do, i wish i had someone to talk to. i feel like vomiting.  i just want to die so that i do not think about her anymore. i want to heal myself.
