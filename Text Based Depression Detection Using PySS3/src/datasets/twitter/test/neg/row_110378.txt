It all feels fakeI have a history of depression and I have been in therapy and taking medication for the past couple of months. Recently though my symptoms have come back; I've been staying in bed instead of going to class, I've been missing important deadlines, I've been thinking of death regularly and joking about dying. The thing is I feel as though I'm faking everything just as an excuse to get out of work. I can still go out and socialize and I've even run for a campaign for my school's congress. I'm pretty sure anyone who could see me from the outside would assume it's all an act. I can't even tell if I'm just lying to myself. I don't know how to explain it to my teachers who expect an explanation from me.
