I dont feel like I will get better.The last 2 and a half years I have been really struggling my my mental health, I have health anxiety, gad and depression. Every year it just seems to get worse and its getting to the point where I dont see a light and the end of the tunnel. 


My nan died during lock down, i saw her die and I think it may of traumatised me a bit, I live with her and my grandad (me and my bf moved in when she 
Got ill to be around more). She was like a second mother to me and great comfort when I would feel like this. Without her I dont really know who to turn to. 

I've had to be strong for my mother and my grandad and I think im finally starting to crack a little. 

I have good days but they don't seem to matter when I'm having bad days. 

I've been thinking alot more seriously than I ever have before about suicide, it actually starting to scare me. 
I dont wanna feel so helpless. 

I Guess I'm just looking for some hope that I will be better some day.
