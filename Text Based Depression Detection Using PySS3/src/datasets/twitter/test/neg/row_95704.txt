I don't know if this is the right place to post.I don't know, I just feel sad. The one thing that I was happy about is just gone. I've been looking forwards to a new computer and I picked out every part, I have money in my trust fund and I just needed my dad to say yes. He called me a failure in life and said that I won't get my computer unless I go through multiple steps, but I really wanted to play in the upcoming ESEA season. 

So now I'm just watching TI5 on a saturday listening to kanye west, just not really knowing what to do. In all rights I am a failure and I do agree with him, but I don't want my life pushed around by a father who hasn't paid child support even 3 years out of the last 12.  He's basically ruined my life and now I rely on him for the one thing i was happy about.

I don't know. Theres just something in life that just doesn't seem fulfilling. I feel like the only reason I haven't killed myself is because I don't want to hurt my mom, and that would crush her.  Don't really see a point in life, I'm really great at nothing, and don't have the drive to improve.
