Banned from /r/asktransgender for being open about my experiences, fuck it just gonna kill myself in a few minutesIâ€™m never going to pass and apparently that also means I canâ€™t even be a part of the trans community as youâ€™re only allowed to be seen or heard if youâ€™re super lucky and passable and have no bad feelings and no problems with your transition.

I lost every fucking thing in my life because I transitioned and all I got out of the deal were puffy nipples and inability to orgasm.  Iâ€™m still stuck as a fucking man, but now just a broken one.

In about 10 minutes I get done work, and I intend to throw myself into the subway tracks.

Fuck life
