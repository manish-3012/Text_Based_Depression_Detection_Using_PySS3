A sad realization here...I feel I can't post here anymore because I have been stupidly posting about my alcohol use and that is the only thing people are focusing on, which is TOTALLY my fault. Now if I post, that is going to be the ONLY thing people focus on, and I admit, alcohol use is a big part of things, but...I dunno. I don't feel like I can safely post here anymore without a lot of judgement. I have gotten a lot of good advice but going to a doctor is out of the question, and going in-patient again is SOOOOOO out of the question that I don't even want to think about it. My hubby doesn't see a problem, and I think I have just been deluding myself and lying to you guys. Yes, I have been drinking every day for the last 7 days and today I had passed out before noon because I had been drinking since 9 am...but now I have not had anything in a while and I don't know if I want my other beers at the moment.

I am sorry...I am such a liar and a piece of shit for this. I should really just get my noose, put it around my neck, and get this over with...I think I might just do that. I don't know if I want to be sober when I do it though...and I am not threatening to do it right now.

Sorry again and I don't deserve to be here. Not a liar like myself.

I deserve to die.

Sorry.
