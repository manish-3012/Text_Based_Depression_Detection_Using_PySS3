Don't get in a long-distance relationships if you're depressed and suicidal.Because going from a few weeks of spending every single hour with your loved one, then suddenly having to go back to instant messages and video chats, it fucks you up real good. I'm suicidal as fuck, but the guilt of hurting him is stopping me from doing anything stupid ... so what will I do? Eat. As if I wasn't fat enough already. 

Someone put me to sleep for a few weeks until I get over it.
