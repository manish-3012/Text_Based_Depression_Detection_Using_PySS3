I stood on a bridge tonight.I was taking a bike ride along a river path, and went onto a bridge to see the view of the river. I went up to the highest point, and my mind started telling me to jump.

The bridge was only 20-30ft high above the water so I wouldn't die on impact, and would've just drowned, which is one of my biggest fears. Still, I just stood there staring for a good 10 minutes or so, hoping nobody would notice me staring off the edge of this bridge.

I kept telling myself, "the hardest part is just willing yourself over the edge, then everything else will take care of itself."

I even considered doing it then trying to save myself (the river was wide, and I'm a  below average swimmer), as test where if I survived, then I guess I'm meant to be alive, and if not, then that's the end of the story.

Instead I just cried and walked away.
