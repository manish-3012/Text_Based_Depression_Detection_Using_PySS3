How to survive when nothing is good?My health gets worse and worse every day. I am unmedicated, no longer have a therapist, part of some minorities, live in a hellish household where Iâ€™ll likely be kicked to the streets in January. â€˜Get a job,â€™ my parents say, as I can hardly bring myself to get out of bed these days, let alone eat, do necessary chores. Iâ€™m too fucked to work but not very physically disabled so I know I wonâ€™t succeed in getting SSI. I canâ€™t even ESCAPE anymore, I try to play a new game I enjoy but itâ€™s detrimental to my health and triggers my depression as soon as something goes wrong.

I know my friends canâ€™t stand my venting, because I do it so much. It gets ignored until I â€˜calm downâ€™ and the cycle repeats. I want to sabotage my friendships and what little relationship I have so I have less of a reason to keep forcing myself to live. Iâ€™m back to physical self harm, I have pets I need to take care of but I struggle with that too. I struggle with everything and this year has been so incredibly draining I just. Want. To die. Nothing is ever ever going to get better, things have only gotten worse since I was a teen.

I donâ€™t really want to hear â€˜it gets betterâ€™ or â€˜it gets easierâ€™ because it doesnâ€™t. It gets worse and worse and then you die, and thatâ€™s all I can believe anymore. Mostly here to vent because I know my friends and boyfriend are sick of me. Itâ€™s so funny, I lost a friend to suicide and I promised I wouldnâ€™t do the same, but it gets harder and harder every day.
