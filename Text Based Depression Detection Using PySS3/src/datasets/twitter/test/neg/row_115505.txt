The only people that would miss me is my family.I've been feeling so much pain lately, and I've been thinking about what would happen if I killed myself. I realized that my parents would be devastated, as my older brother died when he was a baby and me killing myself would be terrible for them. But just my parents and my siblings would miss me. My best friends would probably miss me for like 6 months, but by the time they were in college they probably wouldn't remember my name. 

I've thought about killing myself, but I don't want to hurt my parents like that. I don't want to kill myself either I'm not brave enough. But if tomorrow doctors told me I had a week left I'd be ok with it. I'd say my goodbyes and die knowing I wouldn't have to hurt anymore.

I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this. I don't know if anyone cares how I feel. I just wanted to put this out there.
