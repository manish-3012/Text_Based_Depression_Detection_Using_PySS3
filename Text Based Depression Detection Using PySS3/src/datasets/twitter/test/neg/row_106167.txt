Should an abuser kill themselves?I called mobile crisis the other night and the person I spoke with told me that they thought I seemed remorseful and that it would be possible for me to get better. I donâ€™t know though. I feel like Iâ€™ve done so much evil and caused so much hurt that I donâ€™t deserve to be alive anymore. And I know that a crisis hotline worker isnâ€™t going to tell someone to kill themselves so thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m posting here. So yeah, do you think people can be redeemed or do some people deserve to have their lives taken away?
