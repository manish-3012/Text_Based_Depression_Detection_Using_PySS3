The funny thing is...It's funny that even if I were to kill myself right now it would go completely unnoticed. That is, until the smell of course. My entire life I always thought that I enjoyed the peace and quiet, that serene feeling of being alone and I really did for a while. As the years went on I slowly pushed everyone away until it was just me sitting on my bed in a lonely apartment silently crying to myself. I used to be this intelligent student with a bright future ahead of me, hell I even managed to get myself in this highschool for career paths leading to medical and law careers. Sophomore year something changed, I became distracted and withdrew from simple things like friendship. The only friends I had either moved away or stopped talking to me entirely. I did what I was supposed to do and tried talking to my parents about this and they just ridiculed me and said I needed to toughen up. I started to blame everything I could for the way I was, that was except myself of course. My attitude just kept getting worse, I'm pretty sure people thought I was going to Columbine the school.

Went to college. Didn't leave my room for an entire semester and flunked out. Moved across the entirety of the country to get away from all the shame and disappointment I got from my family. Tried going to a community college this time around, I finished 2 classes before quitting that too. But hey at least I still have goals, I'm currently saving up for a .22 single action LR revolver with a nice mahogany grip. 

Like I said the funny thing is I guess u got what I wanted all those years ago
