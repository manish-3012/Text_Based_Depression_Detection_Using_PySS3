I'm ready to die. I don't want my death to be this big, sad, dramatic thing.For a long time, I've had this belief that I wasn't meant to be an adult I'm 29 now, so I've experience enough of adult life to know that it just isn't for me. 

I had a great childhood. Fun teenage years. But adulthood hasn't been so great. I've spent most of my adult life unemployed and feeling I'm a leach on whoever has to put up with me during my times of unemployment. Anxiety and depression took over my life a long time ago. 

I tried killing myself almost 7 years ago now. Pills. Didn't take enough. Woke up a few hours later, spent the next 5 days vomiting pretty much non-stop. I remember sitting next to the toilet just after I woke up, in tears, just saying to myself "I don't wanna die."

Looking back at that attempt, I understand I did it because I was unhappy. These days, I'm still quite unhappy. But I've come to accept that I just wasn't meant to live this long. I *suck* at being an adult.

Back then, I was all "woe is me! Goodbye cruel world!" This time, I'm just thinking "I'll finally be free." No more anxiety. No more depression. No more unemployment. No more feeling like a disappointment to everyone.

I've had years and years to think this over. I'm ready to go.

A couple weeks to go. I wanna at least see the Deadpool movie before I leave.
