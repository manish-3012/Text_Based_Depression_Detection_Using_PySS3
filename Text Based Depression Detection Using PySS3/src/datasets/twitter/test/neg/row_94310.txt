The pain never endsim tired of it

Itâ€™s too much to deal with for me. Im too much to deal with for others. I donâ€™t know what to do about it, no one else does.

I canâ€™t help but think every word that comes out of someoneâ€™s mouth is a lie

If someone likes me in the morning theyâ€™ll somehow end up hating me by the end of the day I feel

People just talk to me to feel better about themselves. It doesnâ€™t really matter if I live or die. No one will be sad anymore after a few days.

I thought about admitting myself to a hospital but itâ€™s expensive. I donâ€™t want my family knowing. I donâ€™t want anyone knowing because itâ€™s embarrassing. But how else do I cry out for help. Iâ€™ve tried many times and no one has a solution for me.

Iâ€™m tired of having to live like this. Every bout of depression I get I fall in deeper and deeper. All I wanted is to be loved. Few people have only shown me conditional love. Itâ€™s not enough for me. 

Thatâ€™s all I wanted. Just one thing. My boyfriend probably hates me because Iâ€™m such a nuisance. He cares but his life would be better without me. I donâ€™t even know if weâ€™re together anymore.

I just think itâ€™s a better decision to finally say goodbye to everyone, everything. Almost 23 years and no break of this sadness and pain. I have no idea what else to do. I feel like this is the only answer. I donâ€™t know how to do it. I donâ€™t know how to plan this. I hardly have the energy to. 

I want to be free of this pain. I want to be loved. Both seem impossible. So why even bother. Iâ€™m broken and no one wants to help me put myself back together. I shouldnâ€™t say I need someone to, but I do. Iâ€™ve already given up on myself. 

I want to live but not like this. But itâ€™s impossible. Never hear stories of people getting better, they just learn how to deal with it. I donâ€™t want to deal with it. I want to be normal. I want to experience happiness or at least just not feel terrible for at least a week. It just doesnâ€™t happen. Itâ€™s never ending.
