I just need someone to talk to.This weekend I was rejected by not one, but two different groups of friends. So after multiple years of being ignored and shunned by my peers, I am so desperate for social interaction I don't know what to do. The more apathy I receive from those around me, the more tempting it is to just end it as no one would miss me except for bill collectors.

I just want friends - friends I can interact with, as opposed to ones that expect me to always do things for them. I just want someone to talk with.
