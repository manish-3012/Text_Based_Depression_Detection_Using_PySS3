I don't want to live anymore..I don't think I can continue living. I'm tired of all this. I'm all alone andI just want to die.
 All these things made me so mentally unstable. I have noone to talk to.
 I have been trying to communicate with people to help me, because I feel like I am going to explode, and people just ignore me. I am waiting for a response, days now.
 I can't do this anymore. I'm tired. I just need help. I want to end my life. I'm at the worst point of my life.
