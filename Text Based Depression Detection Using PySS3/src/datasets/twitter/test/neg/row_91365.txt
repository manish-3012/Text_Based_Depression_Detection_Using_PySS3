I asked myself the question "What are you waiting for?"I feel like the future will bring nothing, even if I get a job and money, I will still be stuck in a cycle. Why do I keep living with nothing more than a vague hope that things will get better when they never do. I will just live to see my dreams become impossible and out of reach. I will just live looking up and wishing. Why shouldn't I kill myself when I won't be anxious about my dreams that are in the process of being lost? Please convince me otherwise, I just need a reason to keep on going.
