Bipolar depression and suicidal thoughts (vent)I have really bad depression and my mood changes quickly and there are times I cannot do anything at all I get boosts of energy usually at night which makes me think I have bipolar depression but I canâ€™t be sure because I havenâ€™t talked to a mental health professional about it. 

When I am really low the thought of suicide is strong and I think of specific ways to hurt myself. When I get huge spikes in energy the suicidal thoughts arenâ€™t as present in my mind and arenâ€™t as strong if that makes sense.
