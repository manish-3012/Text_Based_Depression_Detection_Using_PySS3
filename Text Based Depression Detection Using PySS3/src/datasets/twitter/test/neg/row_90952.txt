I think Iâ€™m readyIâ€™m really tired. And I just want everything to stop. Iâ€™ve always had the thought in the back of my mind but Iâ€™ve always been a little too afraid to leave behind what could possibly happen in the future but I donâ€™t think itâ€™s worth waiting around for anymore. I think everything else is just too much now. 

Iâ€™m still a little scared of any physical pain but I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s enough to stop me. In the past when Iâ€™ve felt like this Iâ€™ve always reached out to people close to me, my mom, my partner, a friend, because I knew deep down that they would stop me. But this time I donâ€™t want to reach out. I donâ€™t want the chance that anyone will be able to stop me. Iâ€™m only posting this here because it feels weird to just leave without saying a word, without no one knowing. So now yâ€™all know. Itâ€™s out there. 

I have a little over 5 hours before my partner comes home. I donâ€™t want to do it here. I just need to figure out somewhere. I donâ€™t drive or else Iâ€™d just go out into the bayou and do it there.
