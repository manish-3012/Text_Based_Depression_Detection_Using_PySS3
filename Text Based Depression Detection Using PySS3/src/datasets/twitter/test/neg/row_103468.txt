Everyone hates me &amp; they have good reason to.I've always felt as though people make inferences about me that cause them to dislike me before we even meet, but I know why that is: I'm a selfish, manipulative, condescending bitch who can't convince anyone otherwise.  I don't mean to be like this &amp; I need so desparately to feel wanted &amp; loved.  im living in my head where I have a boyfriend who loves me unconditionally which makes me even more pathetic.  I have dreams &amp; aspirations but I'm afraid I'll fall into a rabbit hole of looking for affection in less than reputable places &amp; if that's my fate, then what's the point?  I've already established that no one would miss me.  My friends?  They simply put up with me because no one is willing to tell me how they really feel.  My parents?  They never wanted me &amp; it shows in how they treated me. There's no one else that I can think of.  I'm not sure why I'm posting this, it just feels good to get it out there.
