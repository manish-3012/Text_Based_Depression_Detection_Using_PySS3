One bottle of wine in my fridge. Lots of [fucking useless] pills. Why shouldn't I take the plunge already? [Trigger warning for self-harm]Major depressive disorder, PTSD, anxiety, social anxiety. Well, I sure am a winner. Since I am a throwaway account, I may as well tell you that I will be 30 by the end of 2012. And I have only gone to second base (maybe I did have sex but I was so drunk I couldn't even remember). No boyfriend ever. Never did have that cute "first kiss on the porch" when I was 10. Didn't go to prom. Have never been asked out on a date.

I am an ugly person on the outside. I am so fucking fat. I hate the way I look. For awhile, I'd cut myself but then people would ask about the scars, and I felt like a jerk for blaming it on my cats (they are very sweet, the only beings who keep me going).

Lots of things have happened in the last few months. Bad events. It's like the universe is giving me a sign. **You should not be here. You will simply incur more trials. We'll just keep throwing obstacles at you.** I imagine God and everyone else in Heaven laughing uproariously at me every time such a situation befalls me.

Yes, I do see a shrink. Yes, I do take a cocktail of psychiatric meds. Is there really any point now? Sure, the Zoloft stops me from crying on the bus and embarrassing myself and making others feel uncomfortable. But I've been feeling this way since I was 12. I am so tired of it, you guys. You may think that I am taking my life for granted. But if you step inside my head, I guarantee you will want out. I visualise myself lying in a pool of blood, throat cut open... and I feel calm. I want someone to do it to me.

Why should I keep hanging on? Why?

And, yes, I have been volunteering and trying to help homeless people by giving them food (not looking for accolades). But I feel so fucking dead inside.

Take care. And good night.
