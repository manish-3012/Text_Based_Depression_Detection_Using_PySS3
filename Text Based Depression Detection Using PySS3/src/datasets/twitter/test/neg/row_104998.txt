Less empathy for "scary" mental illnessesI've noticed that the majority of sympathy towards" those with mental illness is almost always geared towards those with mild depression and/or anxiety, as opposed to those with chronic depression, chronic suicidal thoughts, treatment-resistant depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and borderline personality disorder. 

While I'm by no means saying that depression and anxiety are laughing matters,I am sick and tired of people with mild, easily-treatable symptoms being treated as the standard as if they have any idea what the rest of us go through. I don't think the people who suffer from anxiety and depression are the cause of it, so much as it is people who don't have mental illness. 

Take self-harm for example. If you have a few light cat scratches on your arm people will have much more empathy for you than the boy who breaks his bones or bangs his head on the wall or burns himself with cigarettes. 

Feel sad because you can't get a job? Have a little empathy. Maybe not a lot, maybe not from everyone around you, but from people who saw that article or that depression pamphlet who are starting to get it. Sort of. Hear voices? See things that aren't there? Always angry? Bang your head on the walls? Go into psychosis? You're difficult. You're a burden. You're an emotional vampire, you're an energetic drain. You should be locked away in a facility for the rest of your life away from good, "normal" people, because you scare them. You're a toxic person beyond helping. Feel a little bit anxious? Here, have a bit of empathy. Can't leave the house because you feel like you're dying? What a fucking bum, what a mooch. Can't keep a job because social interactions make you panic and have meltdowns? Waste of space, NEET loser, failure. 


I'm so sick and tired of people with situational depression who are magically cured, almost fully-functioning members of society trying to tell people like me why we shouldn't die. I don't care that one time you wanted to kill yourself in college because your grades sucked but realized that shit was easily remedied. I don't care that you went to an inpatient facility where everyone was loving and nice and read you bedtime stories and baked you apple pies. No one wants to be around someone who wants to kill themselves everyday because you went voluntarily and not kicking and screaming and never got a needle in the ass. No one likes it when you're clingy and have mood swings and have to be babysat everyday to make sure you don't off yourself. 

I struggle from an eating disorder. I make cuts in my skin that make people stare at me because my scars are thick and permanent. I'm always suicidal. I'm glad you went to a mental hospital and realized that all your problems could be fixed, by mine AREN'T. I'm glad you realized that grades are fixable, that being dumped isn't the worst thing ever, that you can always get a better job with your college degree.

My problems rule my life, and they're something I'll struggle with FOREVER, they color every part of my life. There are much fewer resources for people like me, and I'll never be apart of the "conversation" on mental illness, because everyone would feel better if people like me didn't exist to begin with. I scare people because they think I am contagious. I have no one to depend on, no social support, because no one I've ever met knows how to support me. 

I'm a burden on everyone around me. They wouldn't be better off if I was dead- just better off if I was never born to begin with. My family's lives would be 10x easier, calmer, less stressful if I was gone.
