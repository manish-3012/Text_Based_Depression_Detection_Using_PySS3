I'm so closeI cant take it. I'm staring at a noose and a blade but I dont have the courage. I've tried twice. Something keeps stopping me and I hate it. I don't know what ti do anymore. It feels pointless living. I just try and find something to keep me occupied until I can finally fall into an unrestful semi sleep state where life sucks just a bit less. Theres no point to any of it and I want it to end. I dont even know why I'm making this post. I dont want anyone I know to know. I've already been hospitalized once and I hated it. It never helped. It just helped me to hide it better. I guess I just want someone to know how close I am. It's just me and my dog. Shes my rock. If not for her, I would have done it already. I know my family would take care of her but it wouldnt be the same. I know it. She knows it. I think she knows and it breaks my heart. I just wish I had the courage.
