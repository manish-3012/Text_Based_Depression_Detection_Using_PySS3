Life does get betterAnd then it gets worse. That's the part that drives me towards suicide. I know that I will have brighter moments in my life, but having to fall back into this pit of despair every few weeks or months is driving me closer to the brink each time. 

Twenty years of this. Dysthymia (chronic mild depression) punctuated by bouts of major depression - so called "double depression". As if only suffering one variant isn't enough.

The medication does help to alleviate the dysthymia but isn't enough to prevent relapses into severe depressions. Ironically, this exacerbates the suicidal ideation when I do start to slide into a depressive episode because the fall is from a much greater height. It was more bearable when I slid from mild to severe, yet nowadays I plummet from happy to miserable in a matter of days. That's the time when I become most acutely suicidal - my "mixed state" (yah, I know, this refers bipolar disorder, but it seems fitting in my context).

Death is a mercy for me. Haven't I suffered long enough?
