Just don't know where to go from hereI've had relationship issues, and solved them.
I've had family issues, and solved them.
I've had social issues, and solved them.
I've had money issues, and solved them too.

Every time it feels like I have a justification for why I feel the way I do, the feelings persist even when that problem is no longer one. I'm just doomed to constantly feel this way it seems, and I'm getting so so close to trying to finish it again. Over the past couple months I've been slowly planning how to do it, and now I've got a multitude of plans. Now I'm struggling to stop myself.

Work, money, friends, hobbies, love - none of it helps. I'm not fulfilled. I'm never happy. I'm not even content. I'm just a frustrating rollercoaster.
