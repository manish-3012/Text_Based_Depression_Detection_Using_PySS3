Forget it. I'm doing it today.I posted earlier today, I thought I was going to kill myself on Thursday or Friday, but I just listened to some cool music on You Tube and went through Facebook and found an awesome picture of my ex that made me happy to see, and it's time.  I'm doing it right now.  No one even cares enough on here to do anything about it.  I was posting on here to keep me preocupied today because I'm off from work and I don't have friends but nobody even wants to talk to me on the internet.  This has been the dumbest life.  I quit.
