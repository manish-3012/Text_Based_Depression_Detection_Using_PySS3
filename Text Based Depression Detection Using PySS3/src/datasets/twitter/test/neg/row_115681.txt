I donâ€™t know whether I want to die or notThe thought of dying gives me so much pleasure and makes me feel good because all the pain will end but knowing that Iâ€™ll be dead forever is just so terrifying. It fucking makes me so sad that my life has to turn out like this and I wish things would just get better. I wish dying didnâ€™t have to be an option. I hate when people say â€œsuicide is never an optionâ€ but itâ€™s the only one for me, everything is a mess right now.
I know Iâ€™m such a terrible person and things will probably just get worse. I feel like the issues I deal with are so different to everybody else. I donâ€™t know whether to commit suicide or not, Iâ€™m really young but I canâ€™t tell if things will get better.
