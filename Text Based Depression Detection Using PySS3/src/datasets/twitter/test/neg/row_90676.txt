I couldn't save him and it haunts me everydayAbout a year ago, one of my closest friends (13/M, would've been 14 by now if he lived) passed away and I still blame myself for it. We met on Instagram and we had a lot of stuff in common so naturally we used to talk about those stuff all the time. We sometimes even stayed up till like 4 am just texting to each other. He was the sweetest person and I can say that we were even best friends. But both of us had always been suicidal and we usually talked to each other at times like that. But one day he just said that it was over and he was gonna end it. Naturally I was panicked and I started messaging him like crazy, hoping that he'd respond. He never did. He didn't even saw my texts. For the past year I've always been blaming myself for it and even though most people say shit like "Oh it wasn't your fault" it still doesn't change anything, I feel like I could've save him. I feel like a fucking murderer who killed him. I just fucking wish that I had another chance.

Also please, I'm begging you please don't send death threats to me because of this. I'm so fucking sick of people harassing me and calling me an attention seeker. Please.
