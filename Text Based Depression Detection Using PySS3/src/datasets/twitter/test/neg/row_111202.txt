My life is nothing but torture**Back Story (Around 2000)**

My father has always been a stubborn man. Before I was born my mother had two miscarriages and I never knew why until she told me that it was caused by my father kicking her in the stomach while pregnant. There is no proof that this happened, however knowing the abusive nature of my father, I certainly believe it. My mother would rebuild the house he bought for less than $30k which was in TERRIBLE condition. Leaks in the ceiling, rats everywhere including where they slept. My dad was drinking a gallon of wine per day, I wouldn't doubt if it was more. He started truck driving and she started to rebuild the house with the help of horrible lazy construction workers that worked for a small amount of money because that's what they could afford. She would go to home depot and haul all the supplies by herself with us because she was afraid to leave us alone. This was likely because when we were babies we wouldn't fall asleep so he would shake us viciously and my mother found out when she spied on him and saw him performing this cruel abuse on us babies. She never called the cops, I never understood why but I can see that she had no money and she didn't know if he'd leave her or abuse her more. She said he would abuse her because she'd spend his money while he was on the road to rebuild the house because it was in an unlivable condition.

**Back in 2010:**

My mother has always been a loving person and she would never hurt anyone. She has amazing will power and fortunately she received a lot of money from someone she helped out a lot. My father pushed her to buy his own truck and he picked out a used truck for ~$20k which she ended up purchasing. During the course of the self-employment, the truck was repaired multiple times and it severely put my mom in debt for a lot of money (I believe the number was around $50k-$90k). My mother had to declare bankruptcy and they decided to sell the truck for $5k because no one would buy it for any higher.

**6 Months Ago:**

After abusing us and his own body with alcohol and tobacco, he went to the doctor because of stomach pains and it turns out that he has esophagus cancer at stage 3. 

He refused to take any doctor recommended treatments and went to a retreat to "cure the cancer" but instead only put him $16k in debt. The treatment helped by making him feel better, but it did close to nothing when it came to curing the cancer. He kept reading these "alternative medicine" treatments online on curing cancer and he's bought all these "Natural" products that don't work, but sadly he thinks it works.  

We were financially secured with my dad's pension, but recently he took it away from us to pay for his treatment. My mother told me he could declare bankruptcy the same way she did for him and have the debt removed, but he refused and asked her to help pay for debt. She was capable of spending all of our savings just to pay for his treatment, but she declined and this was the result of him hiding the pension money.

Recently, he was in an accident because while he was in a parking lot, he was driving and papers fell out of the car. He tried to open the door and grab the papers while the car was MOVING but ended up falling out of the car and the car crashed into another parked car. Of course our insurance went up by $400 and my father locked himself in his room and ignored my mother, presumably to avoid paying for the increase of insurance. When my mother demanded him to pay for the insurance he claimed he had no money and spent it to pay for the treatment. 

He should NOT be driving around when he can barely walk and think properly. It takes him 10 seconds to think of what to say mid-sentence. He still has his license, and he is endangering other lives just by driving around on public roads. I've told him not to drive, but he of course became all defensive with the "I'm your father, don't boss me around" B.S.

All of these events breaks my heart because I never knew anyone could be that selfish, cheap, stubborn, abusive, and psychotic. My father is a barbarian and it disgusts me every morning I wake up. Our entire house smells like body decay and he still doesn't get that he's dying. I asked him how he feels and he enthusiastically attempts to say "Great! I feel goodâ€.

**Me:**

I've always felt suicidal, but I think I won't ever kill myself. I was picked on in middle school and it made me feel very disconnected with everyone. I became abusive to like my father and hit my sister/mother when I was 6-10. I feel like I'm living with a mental illness. I have constant brain fog and it's hard to talk to people properly. I'm always quite because I know if I talk to people I'll fuck it up. My friends say that look normal and talk normally, but that's because I'm around them.

I did a brain mapping and I had a lot of shit wrong with me. They said it was most likely from a traumatic brain injury. I suspect it was from my father when I was a baby.

I'm going to an expensive university for free and I'm just very lazy. I never go to computer science class because most of that shit I already learned online for free. I'm always doing homework last minute, I was motivated and did my work when started this semester, but I fell off and I am at the bad habits.  

I fucking hate my own life, but it's partially my fault.

I'd appreciate input on what I need to do to get my life together. I'm in a depressed mood writing this with sleep deprivation.
