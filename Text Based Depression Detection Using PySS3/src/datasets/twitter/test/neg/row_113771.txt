Just tell me I will be alright in a few daysI'm a severe alcoholic. Right now on a tapering with beer but headacke and anxiety are killing me. I can't take a pain at all even though I know it will get better. I just don't believe it will ever end. So, please, anybody just tell me this pain is worth it.
