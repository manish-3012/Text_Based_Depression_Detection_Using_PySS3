Didn't think I'd be back in this position.Hello everyone. I'm struggling very very very hard with a breakup that happened last week. We were dating for 2 and a half years and he was my everything. 
     I'm only 17 and I know I have tons of life to live, but I feel completely broken. I used to self harm very badly but I ended that about a year ago. Now, I have fallen back into this downhill depression and I don't know what to do with myself. Everyone I talk to tells me just to "focus on yourself" "do what makes you happy". How am I supposed to make myself happy when he was the only thing keeping me happy?
           I feel fucking awful, I've been contemplating suicide but I know that's not going to solve my problems. I need advice on how to carry on with myself. What do I do? How do I help myself? Please help me :(
