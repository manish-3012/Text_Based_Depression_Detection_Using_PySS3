My momâ€™s son (my half brother) passed away a week ago and it has made me start to wish I was the one who died instead. I would have been the easier kid to lose. Parents would it be easier?Back story: I just turned 18 a couple weeks ago so I am still a senior is high school and Iâ€™m the only kid who still lives at home. 
My brother who passed is my moms son (he was 37) she also has a daughter who is 42 both from her first marriage. 
My dad has a son who is 40 and a daughter who is 38 both from his first marriage. 
My parents then got married 23 years ago and had me, so I am the only child they have together.

Itâ€™s really hard seeing my parents this upset - and knowing Iâ€™m so much younger than my other siblings it would have been easier if I was the one who passed away. I havenâ€™t been around as long so there isnâ€™t as much attachment to me. 

If I could I would trade places in a heartbeat since Iâ€™m the disposable child.
My mom lost her only biological son. My parents have one son and daughter each from their first marriages. I am the only kid they have together but Iâ€™m the tie breaker baby, giving them each 2 biological daughters. 
So by losing me they each would still have a biological son and daughter.......therefore Iâ€™m the disposable child.
