I tried so hard.I'm not like those attention need girls, so I'll say what I have to say. It's been since I'm a young child that I've been bullied, so I don't really have a childhood. I'm 14 years old and I hate my life, I hide in my room and I lost everyone I love in one shot, I also get cyber bullied, and that's it. After this summer, I'm probably going to end all of this, because I don't see how it can get better. And I know what you'll say: "oh you're young you still have plenty of time left" yes I know. But I'm not even motivated to continue in life, I had all my job ideas prepared (art jobs like mangaka or designer) but all of this is failing miserabily. I'm not trying any longer, unless I have a fucking good reason to. I am done.
