I'm too weak and I hate myselfEverything in my life right now is very frustrating and I don't think I'm making any progress, regardless of how much effort I put in. Too many setbacks without anything positive happening (stupid/stressful family arguments, insomnia, anxiety, worry, health problems). I feel mentally weak and damaged because of depression. I've lost interest in most things I used to really like. 

The only thing going for me is that I manage to get decent grades (previously at school and now at university), but I have to push like hell for those. Still, my friends and peers seem to be light years ahead of me. They are confident, talented and happy. Even though we have good friendships, I feel like a complete loser next to them. Things run so smoothly for them and perhaps this sparks envy in me...  I also fear that I might not ever date a girl and stay lonely forever. 

I have doubts about my future and career. Now I don't have a clear purpose in my life and nothing much to live for. The world is extremely competitive and I fear that I'll struggle to 'compete' and end up as a loser, hating my life. In the past 3 years I've felt miserable like this almost every day but kept going in the hope of improvement. I hate myself for being so inadequate and weak. Perhaps the logical thing to do would be to end my life if this goes on for much longer. Don't want to be a burden to anyone...
