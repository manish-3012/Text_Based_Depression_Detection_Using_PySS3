i didnâ€™t think i would ever be saying this on this community, but iâ€™m going to kill myself.(this whole thing was typed for over 2 hours, it later turned into a rant, and iâ€™m actually in a safe place rn)i joined suicidewatch to help others, and i have been doing so much better compared to previous years with my mental health. i didnâ€™t think iâ€™d ever tell you guys iâ€™m going to have my final attempt. i have 5 ways to kill myself- all available right here, right now. the landbridge less than a mile from my house- i can climb the fence easily and jump. i have nail polish remover and all the other products in my bathroom. i have all of my iron pills and this one medication  for my stomach. i have my blades and all other sharp objects in my house. i tried to hang myself with my so-called noose  and it didnâ€™t work, but if i put more time into it i could make it so i wouldnâ€™t be here. iâ€™m not going to get into what happened, because itâ€™s a lot, and not hearing it from me in person will make you think iâ€™m one of the worst humans ever. i basically told my â€œbest friendâ€ something about my other best friends suicide attempt, she later told her what i said and from the reaction i know she didnâ€™t say at all what i told her. a gist of it is that i told(weâ€™ll call her r) r is that i was jealous over the support that (iâ€™ll call her g) g had from her suicide attempt. before i said the word jealous, i remember specifically telling r that i didnâ€™t mean what i was going to say, but that i couldnâ€™t think of a different word. i told g over text that i didnâ€™t mean jealous at the time, and that i would never be jealous over her attempt- but that i was sad over the support she got. itâ€™s 23 days until itâ€™s the day that a year ago i had my almost fatal overdose(that hurt my brain to write). i didnâ€™t tell my mom until two days after that i took a large amount of tylenol. my friends knew, including r and g. r at the time didnâ€™t have her license so she couldnâ€™t drive over, and i told them not to tell my mom so they didnâ€™t. i mention the license because i told r that no one checked on me, and right after i said that i said i know you couldnâ€™t drive but you asked your mom to drive over to gâ€™s house. i didnâ€™t have anyone waiting for me in the emergency room and no one visited me when i was in the general hospital. anyways iâ€™m going to stop there with that part of the story and wrap it up with: iâ€™m not killing myself, so if anyone even read this(and i know no one did) donâ€™t worry!!ðŸ˜˜
