The end of my life - I want it to be a good endSorry if that title is a little weird. I have a question about thought process.

I've been severely depressed in the past, with suicidal thoughts every other minute, for months at a time. It lasted a few years but I feel like my life has gotten alot better since then, and honestly I still think about suicide maybe every other week, but it's not like i'm thinking about doing it, i just think about the act sometimes.

Throughout my experience with depression and suicidal thoughts, i've always been pretty sure that my life would end in suicide.

Nowadays, it's no longer that I know that, but now it's like it might end up like that, it might not, and i'm not sure what would cause me to do it.

Here's my question:
I've been pretty good now for 2 years or so now. Will I ever start to think that my life won't end in suicide?

I think i'm making progress, because before, i knew absolutely for sure that my life would end that way eventually - whether it be tomorrow or in 30 years. Now, it's like an unknown, but definitely still a possibility. I'd really like to have an outlook on life that makes suicide absolutely never an option, I just would never think about it as and end to my life. Will I ever think like that again? Like when I was a child, thinking about having a family and stuff at old age, will I ever think like that again?
