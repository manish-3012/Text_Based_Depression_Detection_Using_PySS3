I feel trapped in my life. I donâ€™t know how to get outIf you see my previous posts, youâ€™ll see that Iâ€™m dealing with a lot. I started dating a guy at my job who turned out to be a manipulative narcissist. I feel like Iâ€™ve ruined my reputation at work, I really have nobody in my corner, and now Iâ€™m performing poorly which can be attributed to this relationship. He keeps going back and forth between me and his ex and even though he says he wants to leave he keeps going back. He treats me like I donâ€™t exist but when I try to leave he wonâ€™t let me go. He begs me to stay. He messages me on our work IM after I block him everywhere else. Even sends me money as some sick tactic to buy my affection back.

I feel like heâ€™s troubled so I try to give him the benefit of the doubt and stay but it just hurts how emotionally unavailable he is. I canâ€™t even turn to him for emotional support when Iâ€™m crying about my job. I feel so trapped. I want to find a new job but I donâ€™t know who will pay me the same as my current job. I just graduated from college so I donâ€™t have much work experience. Iâ€™ve dealt with suicidal thoughts in the past and Iâ€™m feeling that way again. I just need to escape.
