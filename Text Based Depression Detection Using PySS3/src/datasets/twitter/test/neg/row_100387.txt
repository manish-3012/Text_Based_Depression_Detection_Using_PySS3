Im lostIm writing this poem as itâ€™s easier than talk
 donâ€™t be surprised to find me outlined in chalk

I wish I had the balls to do whatâ€™s on my mind
But Iâ€™m too scared of what my family will find

Iâ€™ve got the essentials to mess up my day 
Those around me shouldnâ€™t be the ones to pay 

I had a friend who done this before me
He was all on his own but now we are we

I apologise to my friends, my family, and the one
I wish there was more that Could of been done

Iâ€™m not happy here, and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be
Go ahead and cross me off your family tree
