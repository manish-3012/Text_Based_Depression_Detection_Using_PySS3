My brain is breaking. What do I do?I need help but I can't get it. People on here say I should go to a hospital, but they won't just accept someone because they are feeling a bit sad. Even if they did, I don't know how I would convey that initially. What would I say? "I'm really sad"? There are no good outcomes.
