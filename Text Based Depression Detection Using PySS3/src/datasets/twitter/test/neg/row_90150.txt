Anyone else feel this way?i want to escape negative emotions more than i want to pursue positive emotions - this is why the happiest life i can imagine for myself is no life at all. it is really my only goal. however, i subconsciously know that i could not reach this goal at this stage in my life. i am too attached to the things i love/enjoy, and have too much of a connection to the real world. this is why i sabotage myself, destroy my potential, remove my personality, and dream of becoming a heroin addict and overdosing. deep down, i know that doing these things will free me of the attachment i feel to being alive. i have a choice - passively let these things happen and die, or be brave and take on responsibility for my life
