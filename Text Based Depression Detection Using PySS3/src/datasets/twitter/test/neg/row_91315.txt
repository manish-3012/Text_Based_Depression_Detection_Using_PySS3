worst night of my lifeI cannot stop crying. I am alone, there is nobody for me to talk to -- god knows I wouldn't normally post on reddit -- and I don't remember where life went so horribly wrong, but I am so tired of trying to fix it! I can't fix it. Everybody keeps saying things will change but sure, things change, they don't necessarily get better.

I am so tired of this. I just can't keep doing it anymore.
