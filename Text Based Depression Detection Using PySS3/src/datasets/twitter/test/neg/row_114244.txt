I have every reason to be happy.I just... I don't know. I don't have a reason. I'm not going to blame bullying. I'm not going to blame my parents. They love and care for me, and always will. I just don't want to live anymore.

My name is Eric, I'm 17 years old, a senior in high school. And I don't want to live anymore. Every single day is the same depressing story. Wake up, go to high school, go home, go to work, text friends, go home, sleep, rinse and repeat. I don't like it anymore.

**Edit:** After talking to my close friend (also a redditor), he came to my house after work and basically told me that I mean a shit load to him. And if I were to die, it would destroy him, It would destroy our friends... Thanks for the words of wisdom guys...
