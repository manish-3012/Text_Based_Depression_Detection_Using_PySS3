I knew I would kill myself by the age of thirtyIâ€™m just calmly sitting here thinking about it. The thoughts keep coming back. Ever since I was a little kid. Itâ€™s not fair. I tried everything.

I thought my meds changed my life but here I am a few months later. Years of different types of therapy. I just want to die but I couldnâ€™t bear it if it was botched.

My boyfriend broke up with me. Iâ€™m failing one of my classes and might get held back a year. I feel so trapped in my life.

I have great friends and an amazing family but thereâ€™s so much pressure around me to do better. Iâ€™m so stupid and I keep failing.

How do I make this the least painful experience? I just want this to be done.
