Iâ€™m getting help that I donâ€™t want.I went to the emergency room yesterday or done shit for suicidal thoughts and stuff like that and I had to sit there for 12 hours just to talk to some phychiatrist and I guess I need a counselor or something and I feel like they arenâ€™t gonna help all, and everything they ask Iâ€™m just gonna say I donâ€™t know because I actually donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know, I went to sleep at 5:15 am this morning and I just got home from school. I only got one hour of sleep. Honestly this whole situation make me want to die more and I just donâ€™t know what to do.
