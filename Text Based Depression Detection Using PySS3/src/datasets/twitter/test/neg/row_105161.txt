I'm tired. So very tired.I don't even know why I'm writing this. I have been finally diagnosed with depression. Taking meds. I've come clean with my family about my history. Waiting for therapy.

But I'm tired. I'm really fucking tired. I've spent the last 20 years fighting this. From the age of 8 I have been raped twice, sexually assaulted twice. Beaten. Abandoned. Suffered Emotional abuse. Drug abuse, forced on me. Alcohol abuse. Attempted suicide. Bullied.  Almost died giving birth. 

Everyone thinks that now I'm on tablets things will be fine. Everyone thinks now I've told family everything will be fine. What they don't realise is that in telling them, I'm clearing my conscience. Now i know there aren't any secrets.

Now i know I can leave this world. I'm just waiting for a time to do it.
