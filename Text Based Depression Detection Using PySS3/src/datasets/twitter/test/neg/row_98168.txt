I think i'm finally going to do it.Okay. Fine. I'm so tired of living. I give up. You have won. Bullies have won. My abusive family has won. Society has won. I've lost.

I can't reach a drugstore right now but as soon as i can, I will just take pills and sleep. I hope god will understand me if there is an afterlife.
