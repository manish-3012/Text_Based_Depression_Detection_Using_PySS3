I'm going to be alone forever, aren't I?Three years ago, I would have been attending my first and only semester in college. But at about this time three years ago, my depression would cripple me before destroying me. My grades would plummet into failing. The few friendships I was fostering would be left to die. I would end up withdrawing with over $8,000 in debt.

Upon moving back in with my father, I immediately started searching for work. Any work at all. I applied everywhere within reasonable distance from our house. It would be six months before anybody even called me for an interview, and eight months before I finally landed a part-time, minimum wage job. My university required debt payments after 90 days of non-enrollment, so for five months my father was kind enough to pay $100 a month to keep them from sending a collection agency after me.

So it's been two years since I got that job. I make a little bit more money now, but I still have more than $4,000 in debt. At times I've payed off hundreds more than I needed to, but more and more I find myself caring less and less. I started spending all my extra money on fancy food or video games or booze and just made my minimum $100 monthly payments. The last two years have been like a coma. Absolutely nothing noteworthy has happened. 

And now it's become a cycle. Work, work, work, work, work, then when my days off hit, I crack open a beer with my breakfast and my free time disappears so quickly that I usually can't even remember what I did those days. There is no variation in my life. It's the same week after week after week.

I remember about six months ago I sat down and decided that I would try to meet new people, considering I haven't had a friend since high school. I went out to the mall on my days off (which is more than a two hour bicycle ride each way) to try to socialized. It wasn't so bad at first, but as encounter after encounter, week after week, ended in awkwardness or outright embarrassment, I stopped. I was reminded just how socially inept I am that even high school student had more grace than I did.

And now I just don't care. It'll be more than two years until I'll even be able to think about going back to college. Two more years of bitter loneliness. Now, if I'm not working, I'm shitfaced or on the way there. There was once a glimpse of hope that maybe I'd be able to get my life back on track once my debt was payed off, but now it's gone. I don't care about money or accomplishments anymore. I don't care about being intelligent or educated. I just want some compassion. I just want to not be alone anymore. If I did go back to college, all I'd be is a socially retarded mid-twenties guy who nobody would want to touch with a twenty foot pole.

I just want somebody to show me that they care, but all I've ever gotten is internet hugs and generic feel-good advice. I'm unlovable. I have no personality, no interests, no hobbies, no opinions, no skills, abilities, or talents, no passions, and no goals or aspirations. I am as worthless as I could possibly be. I do not deserve to live. The world would literally be better off without me.
