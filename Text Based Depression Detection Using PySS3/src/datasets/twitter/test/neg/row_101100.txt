I really donâ€™t know what to doI want to do everyone a favor and just off myself. I feel like Iâ€™ve lost everyone close to me and Iâ€™m just a waste of space. Iâ€™ve already disappointed my whole family and I donâ€™t want to disappoint anyone else. Iâ€™ve failed all my classes and Iâ€™m just a worthless drop out cuz I donâ€™t understand anything in my classes and Iâ€™m too scared to ask anything just so everyone around can make fun of my stupidity. Iâ€™m just like all my friends told me I was, â€œa future McDonaldâ€™s employeeâ€. Iâ€™m sick of living. If high schools was this hard, life is gonna be harder and Iâ€™m not gonna make it. If anyone has any surefire ways to kill myself easy and quick Iâ€™m waiting for answers.
