I'm at my wits endI am constantly exhausted and strung out, and I'm not certain if I can handle much more of this. Every second of every day I'm assaulted by a constant influx of unwanted thoughts, and I'm losing the energy and resolve necessary to push them back.

Even right now, as I'm writing this, I'm at a social event that I should be enjoying, but I can't. I feel distant and disconnected. There's a part of me that keeps telling me that I should kill myself, and it's only getting louder. I keep getting these angry, aggressive thoughts that are the opposite of what I'm really like, but I'm so tired. I can barely hear my regular thoughts over top of this.

I'm losing focus. I never feel rested, but I'm sleeping more than ever. I feel like I'm losing it completely.
