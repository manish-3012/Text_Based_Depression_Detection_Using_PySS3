I canâ€™t stop crying and hurting, I feel like no one can see or hear meI feel like Iâ€™m already dead. Iâ€™m trying my best to be happy and positive, but itâ€™s like my mind wonâ€™t let me and I feel numb. Months have gone by and I canâ€™t remember things that Iâ€™ve done. Itâ€™s like everything is a blur and Iâ€™m not living anymore. I canâ€™t eat or sleep properly and I had to drop out of school for the semester because things have gotten so bad. I donâ€™t recognize myself anymore and itâ€™s killing me. I donâ€™t even know who I am or who I want to be. Iâ€™m just really lost and I feel like no one can hear me screaming.
