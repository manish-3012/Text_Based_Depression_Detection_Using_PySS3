I keep obsessing over suicide and I'm starting to feel like it's what I'm supposed to do.[I originally posted this in the bipolar subreddit, but I think it's probably too much/too long/too rambly for them. Maybe it's better here. I posted it there last night, slept maybe 4 hours, and I feel even more like this today. Sorry for the TL;DR of this.]

For quite a long time now, I've been thinking pretty much non-stop about suicide. I was in a severe depressive slump (sleeping 16+ hours per day, going catatonic for hours at a time, crying non stop and unable to function at all) for about 2 and a half months. In the last few weeks, I used sleep deprivation therapy to ease the depression for a few hours, and launched myself into an awful mixed episode characterised by horrible physical agitation, irritability, and a complete inability to sleep. Eventually, it smoothed out into a more classic hypmomania... elevated mood, pressured speech, drive to do things, creativity and flight of ideas, 'good' energy as opposed to the awful energy of before.

The thing is, I still can't stop thinking about suicide. Somehow, I'm thinking about it even more now that I feel a lot 'better'. Now I kind of have a weird positive feeling about doing it, like it's what I'm supposed to do and it will be better if I just get it over with now that I actually have the energy and motivation and lack of fear to do so.

There was a post on the other BP sub a couple of days ago about feeling like suicide is just... meant to be, for some of us. I've felt that way for a while. Like I'm a mistake, and so deeply glitched that I can't be repaired. Erasing me is the only way to get rid of the error that is my existence.

Now, I'm BP I, but I've never experienced full blown psychosis. I've had delusional thinking - obsessing over ideas, like the thought that I'm in a simulation like the Matrix, for example - but I've always been fully aware that these were silly and irrational thoughts and a product of dissociation and over-thinking and anxiety (and insomnia). I'm pretty clear headed right now. But the other night, after a couple of days with no sleep, I started having these horrible obsessive thoughts about the universe and reality in general. There was a voice in my head that kept saying over and over "The world is broken", and every time I closed my eyes I felt like I was watching a videogame glitch ripping holes out of reality. It hasn't happened since, and I think I was just extremely overtired, but it really added to my feeling that my life is somehow... wrong. Like it's draining the universe of too much energy and making it unbalanced. I don't really believe in anything like that, but I still feel so guilty for being alive when I'm so broken.

I should add that another thing I obsess over that I hate myself for is getting high/euphoric. Might be worth mentioning, I don't do any kinds of drugs and never have. I used to have a binge-drinking problem, but I went sober for 18 months then only drank beer on the weekends in the company of my wife and never get drunk any more. But I fucking obsess over the idea of going to a seedy club and shooting up or taking pills and getting off my head into a state of euphoric bliss. My body aches with yearning for that high. I've done... small things. One time, after literally just a couple of beers, I took 9 ambien pills in the hope that it would do something. Another time, I used the last of my pain meds from recent surgery when I didn't need them, just to feel that wonderful floaty all-is-well feeling. Nothing serious, nothing massive, just little things. But if I had access to more, I know I wouldn't hesitate. I'd fuck myself up completely, maybe even die, just to feel that good.

I'm going to be up all night again, and this wall of text is proof enough that I'm hypo, but I don't really feel 'good'. I don't feel 'bad' either. I just feel empty. Flat. Kind of distant from myself and the energy that keeps my fingers hammering at the keyboard. I don't believe in an afterlife, but I find myself wishing a warm hand would reach out from beyond and touch my face and say "It's okay, you don't have to do this any more... You can let go."

I'm fascinated with things that are morbid and obscene. I have such strong masochistic fantasies right now. Most of all, I want to die and I'm strangely and perversely excited by the thought. In a way, that just proves to me that I shouldn't exist because I'm warped and ugly as well as broken. It's weird to be having all of these thoughts and yet feel so... blank. Normally when I want to die I am in floods of tears or at the very least I've slowed down to nothing and have all the physical signs of depression (or the opposite, agitated and irritable in mixed mania). But I almost feel like smiling. Almost serene.

I've fought this desire for so long. I really only haven't succumbed because of family. But I start to think maybe it's best for all of them, too. Too much time and energy has been wasted on me. If I can repay it a little by releasing my energy back into the universe to form something more pure, perhaps I should.
