â€˜Youâ€™re not the same anymoreâ€™Any of you get these questions too?


â€˜Youâ€™re not the same anymore.â€™

â€˜Youâ€™re not the same when youâ€™re so sad.â€™

â€˜Itâ€™s sad to me that youâ€™re not the sameâ€™

â€˜I canâ€™t recognize you like thisâ€™

â€˜Why arenâ€™t you like your old you?â€™


... 

I met with my mom after some time because of corona and I guess she realized I was hurting. Her reaction to me was just... these questions. It fucking sucks. I canâ€™t do anything right. Making my mom teary is just fucking horrible. 

Anyone else just feel like they have disappointed literally everyone around them and donâ€™t know how to make it stop?
