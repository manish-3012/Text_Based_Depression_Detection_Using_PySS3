Feeling extremely suicidal and have no-one to talk to. Help me, please.Although I have been feeling suicidal for many years now every day, and have attempted suicide many times(it was before I had an exact plan(which I have now), so didn't work out); all this time my sense of *responsibility* and not wanting to hurt my family has been stronger than me(that's why my plan includes waiting until I move out of my parents' house before I realize the plan). All this time I have had to fought between both of these urges, making it two times as difficult. However, as you can see, I am still alive, so that means that my *common sense* has won this far.


But now I have understood that, being the worthless creature I am, maybe even my family won't miss me. Also, I have been hearing voices for several years, but they have got worse in the past few months. They have been telling me that I should just commit suicide. That I am not worth of love. That everyone hates me. Nothing stops them, not even self-harm(although it helps, a lot).

I can't fight all of this, I barely had the power to fight my suicidal thoughts, which were even physical, imaging a gun to my head seems like the best thing I could do with my life(having full control over my own faith etc.) I don't know how you can help me. Maybe call some reasons I should stay alive? Apart from the obvious, it is, my family. And my friends. They are the best ever, but I have been avoiding them in order to not hurt them when they hear about my suicide. Maybe it is pointless, too. Would they even care in the first place?

Or maybe I just need a hug and someone to whom I could tell everything. I don't know. I just want to end this life.
