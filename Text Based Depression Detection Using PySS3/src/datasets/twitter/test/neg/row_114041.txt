My boyfriend (and one of the only "friends" I had) cheated and we fought. All I want now is to die...We live together, he was very distant, I was in need of hugs, of love...
He cheated, even though we were in an open relationship, he kissed someone in front of me, and even though I told him that me and everyone else in the group didn't want the guy going out with us, he got mad and blame it all on me.
I got so triggered, cut myself, told him I just wish he wasn't so cruel, and he texted me (we were in front of each other) that he didn't want to talk, I lost it, and now all I want is to die...
