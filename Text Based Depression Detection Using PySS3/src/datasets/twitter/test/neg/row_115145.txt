Read and Tell me should I should live , if you don't have answer then ignore.I am a 16 year old girl . I am from South Asia ( Bangladesh ) . I am suffering dipression and anxiety . My mom used to be a single mother. But she got married 3 years ago . I was happy back then . My mom used to love me so much . I love her to since I don't have anyone. But she changed. My mom also suffer dipression in past ( before I born ) . I don't know who is my biological father . She never told me . She ask me to call my step dad papa. And I did also . But after some days he touched me badly . I told this to my mom but she doesn't care about this that much . After that i stopped going outside . It can be good for me but my mom forced me to go outside and talk with my step dad normally. But I didn't call my step dad papa so she beat me even I have a scar in my face . From then I became suicidal . But kpop and BTS keep me alive . I have 3 step sister and 1 step brother . My step brother get married few month ago and honestly he is not that bad . He is really good and warm hearted . We live together . But my step sister in law is too rude to me . She asked me to leave this House sometimes . I told this to my mom but she doesn't care . She only care about my study . I have to get 100 on 100 even if I die . I don't have any freedom in my life . She always asked me to die . I can't even wear what I want . Honestly I want to be a K-pop idol and i am good at acting , dancing , singing and I fit with kbeauty too . But kpop ent company don't accept south Asian . Now told me is there any reason to live for me ? I tried suicide before but I got in hospital immediately ( I took sleeping pills ) . And after that incident my life became hell . If you think there is any reason to live for me then tell me the reason and if not then ignore ( what you are going to do actually ). I don't want embarrassed anyone and motivation won't work :)
