Im on the edge to kill myselfI cant hold anymore, im literally in pain, i never felt like that before.

I cant see any help, i dont know what to do anymore, i lost all my force.

All my life, since about 13, i had do carry everybody mentality, now i dont have anymore nor even money to pay my college bill or my tooth treatment 

I do give up, i did my best
