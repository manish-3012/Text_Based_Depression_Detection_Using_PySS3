I want a way out of lonelinessEvery day I wake up, I have to put on a smile to pretend everything is ok, when in fact I cry alone in bed every night. I don't even know if I have any mental illness, I'm too afraid to see a shrink or a counselor, I'm afraid that if I get diagnosed with mental illness, my friends and family will alienate me, and truly making me an outsider. My friends and I used to be close, but now every one of them has their own social circle, and it's like I'm the third wheel to anyone of them, like I'm a burden to their social life. As for my family, my parents are quite conservative, they think mental illness is like a punishment, a karma to the person. That's why I'm too afraid to seek therapy or help, once they noticed, they'd probably be ashamed of who I am. And right now I'm already pretty isolated, my friends and I rarely hangout these days, I have very few social interaction at school, so I can't imagine what'll happen if I lose my connection with my family. 

It seems like I only have two options left. Either I end myself this week or I have to keep hiding and prolong my pain until the day I can't take it and kill myself. I know my experience is nothing special and maybe a lot of you have similar feelings before. All I wanted to say is that if you find the strength to carry on, I wish you the best of luck, you are brave and courageous unlike me. Right now I can't find a way out of this loneliness other than taking the easy way out.
