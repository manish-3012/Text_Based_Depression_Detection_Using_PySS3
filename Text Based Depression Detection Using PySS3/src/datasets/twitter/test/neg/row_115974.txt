Finally crossed over from â€œI donâ€™t think I can do itâ€ to â€œIâ€™m ready to do itâ€Suicidal hanging that will result in decapitation. Iâ€™ve been doing a lot of research on this method because it seems to be a mostly painless, and very quick death. 
Thereâ€™s a lovely lake in my neighborhood with a lot of pedestrian bridges. People have hung themselves from the bridges, and somehow the city still has not put any suicide prevention bars up yet. 
Iâ€™d only need to fall 6 feet for this to work, but the fall will be probably around 15 ft. I donâ€™t want there to be any chance of this not working. I know women tend to not try as hard to kill themselves and end up surviving more often then men but god damn it, my head will be in the bottom of the lake and it will finally be over. Fuck the world.
