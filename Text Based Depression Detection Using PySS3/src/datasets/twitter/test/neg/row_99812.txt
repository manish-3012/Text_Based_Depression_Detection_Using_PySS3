Nobody cares about you until your funeral and then they forget about you a week laterPeople fucking suck. I just want someoneâ€” anyoneâ€” besides just my mother, to care about me at all. To give a shit about what feels detrimental and life-altering to me. But nobody does. All they care about is their own selves. 

I have a therapist but even he can only help so much. I have hardly any friends. The friends I do have are also depressed and are too exhausted with their own issues to hear mine out. I want someone who can just listen to me and understand. I have nobody, and Iâ€™ll die with nobody. 

I pop pills every day just to make this horrible existence easier to tolerate. I sleep 19 hours a day or so. I eat my feelings away. I watch porn to feel some sort of happiness. I want it all to stop. I just want it to stop now. I donâ€™t know what to do.
