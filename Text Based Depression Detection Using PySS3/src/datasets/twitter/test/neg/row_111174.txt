Desperate to be happyI just can't remember the last time I was happy. It was probably when I was around eight, without any worries. I'm nearly 18 now and there's rarely a night where I don't go through self loathing and just feel empty. I want a purpose in life, I don't want to keep going through each day feeling like it's all meaningless. Reddit, how did you find your purpose? I want to actually wake up in the morning and be glad to be alive. Instead of this dreadful feeling in the pit of my stomach that keeps telling me how worthless I am.
