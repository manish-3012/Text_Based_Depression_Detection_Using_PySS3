Just need to write somethingI just created a reddit account because I didnâ€™t know what else to do. Iâ€™m sorry if my problems are stupid or not so serious as losing someone for real or being part of a tragedy. Also, excuse my English, because Iâ€™m from a South American country. 

Right now, I feel lost and I want my life to end. Iâ€™ve always suffered from affection problems because my dad abandoned me. I never thought it would hurt me this bad, because Iâ€™ve been using this as an excuse for all my failures. I was married for some years.. she was a great girl but I wasnâ€™t in love, so I cheated on her and let her for someone else. This new relationship was so chaotic and We ended hating each other. I left this relationship feeling so low about myself. I regretted my mistakes, because I knew I was doing something wrong and ended doing it anyway.. I could not forgive myself for being so self destructive. 

I went to therapy. Everything got better.. I could forgive myself and it helped me forgive my father. Everything got better. 

I feel in love again. I recognized her as the love of my live. We live in different towns, so it was a difficult relationship. But we tried, and we were happy so many times.... but I am self destructive, and I tired her. Iâ€™m insecure.. not jealous but just insecure about me. I tired her by asking so many reconfirmations of love, of passion, of compromise in this relationship..of acceptance. She just gave up on me a few weeks ago and we ended a two year relationship. 

I feel so lost... I know this too shall pass, but sheâ€™s still the love of my life. How do I keep going with this? I feel my heart just stopped, and I donâ€™t want to make any effort to get over her. I just feel itâ€™s not worth it. I prefer to die now, knowing that loving her was the best thing that ever happened to me. I donâ€™t want to go on with my life, right now I just want to write that. I want to write that I want my life to end.
