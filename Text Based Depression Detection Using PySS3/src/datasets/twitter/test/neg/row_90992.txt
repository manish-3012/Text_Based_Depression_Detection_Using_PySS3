I can't even try to fucking help someone without being told everything that happened to me is my faultDespite everything I tried to help out a fellow redditor by trying to make them feel a little less alone and I wake up to a message from some random asshole telling me being a fat incel is my fault and change it while I can because I only have one chance well guess what fucker I really hope you're right and I really hope this is the only chance and there's nothing literally nothing after this once I kill myself tonight I've fucking had it
