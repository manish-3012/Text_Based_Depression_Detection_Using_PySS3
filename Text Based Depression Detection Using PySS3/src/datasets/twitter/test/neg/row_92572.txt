its late and all the crisis chats are offline and i cant call the hotlines and i dont know what to doi dont even know how to describe how im feeling right now

i know im super depressed and my anxiety is through the roof and id kill myself right now if i wasnt so afraid to die

part of me wants to be in a hospital so bad away from all the things that could possibly stress me out i want them to knock me out with anesthetics and i want to stay that way i want to be anywhere but here but its three in the goddamn morning

everyone i know is asleep or offline and i dont think i could bring myself to talk to them anyway and im already imagining the responses to this post

ive heard it all before and usually it helps but nothings helping right now not it gets better or youll get through it or even please hang on im numb to all of it at this point

im on medication and i go to therapy none of it helps no one ever notices how badly im doing and i hate therapy anyway

when i talk to myself i still sound perfectly cheery like nothings wrong and i die inside a little each time because what the fuck is wrong with me

i keep reminding myself about my family and my friends and my girlfriend but its not helping at all i cant bring myself to care

im so overwhelmed but theres nothing to be overwhelmed about im just stressed out from existing and im so so tired i want to sleep forever i want it to end
