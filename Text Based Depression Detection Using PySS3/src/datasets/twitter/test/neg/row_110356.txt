There isn't really a point.I have nobody. Nothing. Not to look forward to at the end of the day, not a person to text me or talk to. It's been like this for years and I think I've finally lost it. I give up. There's no point in continuing to have to fight every day for absolutely nothing. There's nobody for me.

I haven't gotten a call or a text in close to 2 months now, last one was a security code for an account. I'm only 17 and it already feels like it's all over. Im finally just gonna close my eyes and do it.
