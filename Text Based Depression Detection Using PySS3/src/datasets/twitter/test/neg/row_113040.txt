My boyfriend is crying, why am I not?My boyfriend has depression and is suicidal, and his thoughts are starting to rub off on me.

Iâ€™m starting to self harm, Iâ€™ve been slicing myself up every night, I have suicidal thoughts, I even tried to act on them a couple of times.
Every time me and him call during one of his breakdowns, heâ€™s crying his eyes out.

I donâ€™t cry, Iâ€™ve never cried while cutting myself, Iâ€™ve never cried while trying to commit suicide.

Am I really suffering? Do I really need help?
Am I mentally stable enough to not get help?
If Iâ€™m not crying, then what
