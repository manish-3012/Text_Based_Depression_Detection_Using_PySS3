Not suicidal or anything but ion wanna be hereFor the past 9 years I've just been here. My life has sucked up to this point but I've always just brushed it off to the side. I always had a sense of how miserable I was but it never really hit me until I turned 18. Now I'm almost 19 and all I can think about is if I want to put myself through another year of misery. I guess I am suicidal but not cuz I wanna die, I just don't wanna be here anymore. Like I just don't want to exist.
