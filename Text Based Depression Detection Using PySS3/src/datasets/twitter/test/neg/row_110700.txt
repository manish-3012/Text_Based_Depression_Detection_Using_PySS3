The Hotline Helped, but I need more.Today I planned to kill myself. I kissed my wife when I got home, waited for her to go to work, finished my letter, grabbed my booze and left. 

I was driving to my spot, the place I decided years ago I would do it. I was drinking a bit, window was open, no music. I kept staring at the noose I made last week, and today I felt like I was finally committed to using it. 

I donâ€™t know where it came from but for the first time, I thought about the Suicide Hotline. So I googled it, called, and spoke with a really lovely woman for an hour. I couldnâ€™t stop crying, I donâ€™t know why, and Iâ€™ve never been a big cryer before but it just kept pouring out. I donâ€™t know if I was even making sense, but she didnâ€™t care, she just kept listening and always spoke when it seemed I needed to hear something. 

Today that woman saved my life, but I donâ€™t know if she will be there tomorrow. I have had fleeting thoughts of suicide since I was a teenager but it wasnâ€™t until my mid twenties that I started thinking of ways to do it and not until recently had I actually started putting a plan into action. 

I know by next week Iâ€™ll be driving to that park again. I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t really want to live either. Today I was clearheaded enough to make the phone call, tomorrow I might not be, or maybe tomorrow I wonâ€™t really want to be. 

Iâ€™m not really even sure about the point of this post, I just feel like i need to say something somewhere to someone, even if I never get a reply

I guess I just want help
