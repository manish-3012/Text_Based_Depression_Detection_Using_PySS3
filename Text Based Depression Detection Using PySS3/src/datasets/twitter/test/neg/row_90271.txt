I just attempted to kill myself but I don't know why I didn't go through with itI've been feeling very suicidal for the past week and a half, so about 20 minutes ago I finally tried to hang myself with a belt of mine, but as it was around me and I was choking and struggling to breathe, I stopped myself and took off the belt and stared at it for a bit. I tried again and the same thing. I was trying to think of why to stay, but I have nothing. I feel nothing at all. No emotion. I've given up. So why couldn't I go through with it :(
