Borderline Personality Disorder is running my life.I've tried to kill myself so many times and been unsuccessful. 

It's something I both want to happen and don't at the same time. 

I can't cope with arguments with my partner and it makes me want to kill myself. I feel so worthless and hopeless right now.
