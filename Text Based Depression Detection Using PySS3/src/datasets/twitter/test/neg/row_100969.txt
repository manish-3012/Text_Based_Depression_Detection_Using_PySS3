How and why I think about suicideI will get this out of the way right away and say I'm fairly terrible at writing and expressing my thoughts in general but will try to do so here as well as I can so apologies in advance for any badly worded or badly organized thoughts. Also I've never posted before to reddit in general so any post rules I break are unintended. Finally before I start I just want to say I don't know if this is usual here or not but I'm not posting for direct feedback of any kind and won't be returning to the post. I know it might sound silly but saying or writing things I know someone else can see or hear has always given me a strange sense of relief even if I never get to see any reaction. Don't really know why. 

As cheesy as it sounds I want to start with a quote I read a long time ago. I don't remember what book it was from but unlike most of the reading I've done it stuck with me for some reason and it went something like this, â€œThe world is what it is. Men who are nothing, who allow themselves to become nothing have no place in it.â€ I don't live a sad life. I had, and still have a good family with good friends around me and I live in a good place and even go to a good school. The reason I've yet to do anything drastic like suicide by this point is mostly because of my parents. They were always good parents. Me killing myself now would hurt a few people, some more than others but for everyone other than them life would go on. For them it would crush the rest of their lives. They don't deserve that and because of this I'm gonna hang on for a while but let me explain a little of how I think.

I've thought a lot about why I am the way I am. I have drank and smoked weed on and off for years but am fairly certain neither played a significant role. At least not in their immediate effects. I have no idea about how much these effected by mental development over the years as I started both fairly young but this is something I couldn't change at this point regardless. My â€œoddâ€ ways of thinking predated either anyway and have persisted during times of abstaining from both. I have always been laughably socially awkward as well, being both short and looking very young for my age. Although I admit this was a larger factor than drugs I still don't think it was just this fact either. I was never such a loner that I didn't have some close friends around me. In other words millions of others in the world have it harder for a million different reasons but don't think how I think. This brings me a little closer to my overall point. 

For a long time I've been very comfortable with the idea that I'm just a little useless spec on a little useless spec floating around endless nothingness. It was never some existential crisis that caused my thoughts about suicide. In fact I'v always found the idea that you can assign your own meaning to a meaningless life really beautiful. The people I always respected above others, including my father are people that seem to be driven not by some larger ambition, but because of something simple. They love their family, spending time with their friends and that's enough for them. There's where the divide occurs between me and others. The reason I'm â€œdepressedâ€, the reason I've remained â€œdepressedâ€ for so long, the reason I can't sleep most nights and sit around thinking about suicide for hours on end all comes down to the same thing. I don't like life. 

And not the good parts of it or the bad in particular. I mean don't get me wrong if anyone looked at me at the age I am and actually thought of me as a man many parts of the daily grind would be a lot more bearable but thatâ€™s the point I'm making really. It's only ever been â€œbearableâ€ to me. The laughing with friends or family, doing well in school/jobs, hell even playing video games. everything I've ever enjoyed has felt like taking single steps onto dry land while walking through a swamp. And as each year passes by the steps keep showing up less and less and the swamp keeps getting thicker and thicker and I have to keep telling those around me, presumably in boats in this shit metaphor that I'm feeling perfectly dry and IM NOT. All it is, is walking to here, talking to him or her then returning here to work on this thing for this future I don't even care if I make it to. It just wears and wears and wears you down and all I ever really want to do is sleep. When it ever finally comes I can just not exist for a while slipping from one half formed dream to another just existing until my alarm goes off and it begins again. 

This is where I come back to that quote as well as my overall point which I guess is directed to people who come on here to support people rather than post.  Do you really believe, and I mean really believe deep down, fuck the politically correct side or even what you would post on here just give it a little thought to yourself. Do you really believe that everyone can or even needs to be saved. Humans are animals. remarkably complex and so different no one of the ~7 billion  people on earth has the same mind. We have people who are straight, gay, believe in god, don't believe, are patient, angry, psychopathic, brave, cowardly... and I mean I could go on forever but my point is through nature or nurture or a mix people's minds end up as they are. And sure they can change but doesn't it seem some of these minds, with the mix of all billions or trillions of different traits they can grown and ways they can form or develop would just be... incompatible with happiness in this insanely specific form of current human life and culture. I honestly don't think I will change any minds here but all I'm asking if for you to consider... is it really cowardly or unfair or hell is it even sad if I stop walking through the swamp after 25 years instead of 70?
