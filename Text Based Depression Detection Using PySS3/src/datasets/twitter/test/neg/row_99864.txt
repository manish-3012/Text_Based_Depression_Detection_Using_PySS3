a rant from my journal: help me find meaningEverything will start to hurt, yâ€™know.

At some point, when the clock strikes a different digit and the earth is draped in a strange shade of ebony and is submerged in a desolate quiet: when no oneâ€™s presence is safe or understanding and the room feels strangely cold despite any possible warmth you are embraced with: when hot tea and small smiles and heavy blankets donâ€™t feel comforting anymore, because theyâ€™re not enough no matter any effort you put into being better:

there will be a moment in time where it will feel like there is absolutely nowhere to go, not here, not there, not miles away; there is no escape.

Life seems to slowly break every fiber of our being, shatter the fragments in the wind, and ultimately tear our souls so keenly apart that we lose ourselves. There are grainy pictures that present happier moments in the past before this, but even then that was in the past, and oh god, why does the past always seem happier than the present? 

Life in itself is quite menacing, in all actuality.
 
Drowning in the mundane, gray buildings and mockingly sunny skies, people who come and go, a structure that is set up for people to go to school, get a degree, then a job, and maybe a family along the way until the moment comes when our bones are so brittle and hands so cold that we patently wait for our heart stops beating.

What is the meaning to this life?
