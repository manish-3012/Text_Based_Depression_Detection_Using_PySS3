Feeling extremely guilty over former mildly controversial comments.Iâ€™m trans and a lesbian, itâ€™s kind of relevant because it makes me feel even worse about the whole situation. Basically, I was stalked and sexually harassed, mostly by guys but one time at school this girl was touching me under the table and giggling like a maniac, she said how it was fun and sheâ€™d like to do it again, she said if I did anything sheâ€™d make a scene. It was pretty embarrassing to say the least so I just let it happen a couple times until I started online schooling for different reasons, I would ask to sit somewhere else but I didnâ€™t say why so Iâ€™d deliberately get in trouble to get moved which was kind of stupid I guess I thought no one cared about men being sexually harassed, so I gravitated towards menâ€™s rights groups online. They didnâ€™t care about me being harassed, they just wanted to use me as a political pawn. I made some mildly controversial comments online and Iâ€™m worried someone will hack the account from years ago and find my real name which deeply disturbs me. After that to redeem myself, like an idiot I made another persona to prove Iâ€™m not sexist so Iâ€™d have heated arguments with them but it just fed their beliefs that they were persecuted. Now, basically, Iâ€™m ridden with guilt, itâ€™s almost unbearable. Itâ€™s not just guilt, I donâ€™t want people to find me and think Iâ€™m some sort of monster. I only told this to my girlfriend. Iâ€™m feeling a bit suicidal over this. Thatâ€™s all, thanks.

Edit: Iâ€™m honestly not sure if I made comments, I did look at it though.
