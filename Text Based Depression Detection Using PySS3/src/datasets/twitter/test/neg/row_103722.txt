SuicideI constantly have thoughts of suicide and wanting to die, today I talked to one of my counsellors and I told her how hopeless I am and I donâ€™t care anymore and her response was â€œSo Iâ€™m basically wasting my time and I could be helping someone elseâ€ that shit broke me inside and my mom doesnâ€™t support me at all I tried to text her on how I really feel and she just responds with K and she doesnâ€™t actually listen and she just puts me down negatively and I really donâ€™t know what to do anymore I want to give up already.
