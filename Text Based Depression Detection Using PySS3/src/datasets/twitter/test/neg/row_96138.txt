Any suicide survivors willing to adopt a chat buddy? I need help.My post history pretty much explains it. I'm over eight months into surviving the accidental, drug-induced suicide of my fiancÃ©e. It has been a journey. 

I'm trying to navigate life after being widowed and get very close to ending my own life to join her, but it's mostly because I don't have anyone to talk to. I feel like I am burdening or harming others who have not been touched by this kind of darkness. 

If there's anyone who's a survivor of suicide or any other kind of traumatic death, can we talk? I would just like a friend. :\
