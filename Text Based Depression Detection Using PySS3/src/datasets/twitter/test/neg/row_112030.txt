The only thing keeping me alive is my mom.She lost her husband/my father years ago and had to raise 3 kids including me as a single parent. I've seen how hard it was for her and I don't know how she has the strength she does. I just want to die and I feel so guilty about it. I don't want to keep going anymore.
