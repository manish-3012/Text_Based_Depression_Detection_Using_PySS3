I was doing well I thought, but now it seems I'm notI want to kill myself every night. So much anxiety lately. My meds must not be working or something. God I just want to go to sleep so the thoughts will go away until tomorrow night. Here's the full story, I guess. I hope writing this out helps.

I just got out of rehab after 6 months and moved back to my home state with my parents. They moved here while I was in rehab so it was nice to be able to be in the state I love (CO) and have them for support. However, after finishing up with treatment, I've had some obstacles. First, I'm in Colorado Springs instead of Denver, so I don't have anybody I know living near me save my parents. This is good and bad because on one hand I'm away from all the drugs but on the other I'm away from my friends. I left all the friends I made over the last 6 months in treatment and not having them around has been hard. I feel very isolated and so I've been going to various 12-step meetings on a daily basis in order to socialize, but I don't have any true friends I can just talk to yet. This brings me to my second problem. My insurance company has still not gotten referrals from my treatment center so that I can see a psychiatrist and a therapist. The only people I have to talk to are my parents, who as great as they are I still don't feel comfortable telling that I want to kill myself on a daily basis. They know I'm struggling, but they're far from being the people I actually want to talk to in the moment. I need a therapist because they'll just listen without trying to provide me with unwanted advice or overreact as soon as I mention suicide. I truly feel that my meds are not working and thatI desperately need to see a psychiatrist. I have pending legal issues and do not want to have to go back to inpatient. I just want things to be where they need to be do that I can get back on a routine and sort things out in my head. Trying to settle in and deal with the holidays has been hectic at least in my mind. I really need some type of routine as well as some type of stimulation and that very well may be part of why these ideations are coming back. I have not been coping in the best of ways since I've gotten back. I am still completely sober save cigarettes, however the cigarettes are kind of fucking me up. They make me suicidal and anxious. I've been extremely anxious since I got here sometimes even to the point of paranoia. God, the paranoia is just as bad as the ideations.

I've just been so anxious lately and stressed and overwhelmed and my suicidal thoughts are coming back after a nice period of absence. I need socialization. I need therapy. I need a change in meds. Thank you anyonr who took the time to read this. I know suicide isn't the answer but unless all these other issues get fixed then I know that my ideations will grt worse until the point that I don't care if it's the answer and then I will end back up in a psych hospital or dead and honesty this shit's exhausting and I just eant it to be over with.
