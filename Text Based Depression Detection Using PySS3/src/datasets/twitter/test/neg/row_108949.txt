Worried about a friend.Ill cal him Rick. 

Rick has always been emotionally unstable - dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts. about 6 months ago he got a girlfriend, but last week they broke up. During this exact same time he broke things off with his best friend of 10 years (many reasons, ill explain if anyone asks).
Basically he lost the two most important people in his life in one weekend.

Me and another friend of Rick's are keeping in contact with him. We're so worried. Here's a message he sent me:

"I didn't break it off with my gf and best friend because i want to push them away, but right now i kinda feel like pushing everyone away. It's just so much easier for everyone if i'd just go away."

Now he's just very emotionless and doesn't give a fuck about anything - i'm sure people who have dealt/are dealing with depression recognise themselves in this. It's a huge indicator that things are going downhill. 

So now me and three others including his ex-gf (who is the only one who he really cares about) are trying to talk to him everyday, but his responses are short and sometimes nonexistent. He says he's busy, which he kinda is, but it's also a pretext for isolating himself. We keep on messaging him though because we don't want him to be isolated.

His ex best friend still cares deeply about him and is going to talk to Rick's sister soon about all this.

Im going to hang out with him as well and will try to talk him into getting therapy.

TL;DR a good friend who has dealt with depression and suicidal tendencies before is trying to isolate himself but me and about three others are trying to keep him from doing so by talking to him and listening to what he says. 

What else can/could we do?

P.S. idk if this is the right sub for this, please tell me if I should post this somewhere else.
