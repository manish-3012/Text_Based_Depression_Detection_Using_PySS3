When I'm broke, it's time.25, male, US. I quit my shitty retail assistant manager job in June and all I've done is sit and smoke pot. I quit because I was sick of the endless mandatory overtime, erratic shifts, and stifling environment. I've blown like $6k the last 3 months (tbf, almost half is from bills) and have another $6k to go before I'm broke. Yeah, I had like $12k in my bank account and still didn't get my ass moving on finding anything else.

I was off the whole summer and can't recall a single fun thing I did except hang out with friends a few times, and that's beginning to feel dull too. I do not have the motivation for anything. Nothing is fun, nothing makes me feel good. The only thing I can drive myself to do is eat, smoke, vape and masturbate to porn. I feel so empty. I don't even want to leave my house because I'm so ashamed of myself.

I can't stop worrying about the future but at the same time I feel powerless to help myself; it feels futile even trying. I attempted suicide last year but got scared halfway through and ended up checking myself into the hospital. I'm certain there is no future for me other than suicide. That's the only way this story can end for a dysfunctional fuckup like me. I only wish there was some way to spare the feelings of my loved ones. If only there were a delete button for people, then I could disappear without disturbing their well-being.

When I was a teenager, I remember dreaming of being so many things. I thought I'd be married with a degree, career and house at 25. I thought I was so smart. Instead I'm unemployed, overweight, single and renting. And if I can't have what I want, I don't want anything. I refuse to "make do" â€” I didn't ask to be here and I don't need to be either. What sense is there to stick around? So I can work another shitty job and slowly grow bitterer while only escaping my bad feelings through consumption and escapism? No fucking thanks. I want out.

tl;dr quit my $40k/yr job without another job to go to and i'm fucked. useless disgusting human being
