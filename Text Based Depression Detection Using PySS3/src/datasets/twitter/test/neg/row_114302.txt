Friend needs to get help but can't.I have a friend who I know online who is severely depressed and having serious suicidal thoughts, as well as a host of other problems.  At this point, I think he knows he needs immediate help, but he has told me and his other friends that he doesn't think he will be able to call a crisis hotline because of social anxiety.  What do I do to help now?
