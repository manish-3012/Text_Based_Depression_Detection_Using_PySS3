I'm just tired.I'm fat, and hate it. Nothing I do is right. I have no willpower to improve myself, all I want to do is sleep and never wake up.

I've been sick for the past week, severe nausea and diarrhea, eating or drinking anything just gives me horrible cramps. I've not been able to keep anything down except for a small amount of plain white rice (approx 0.5 cup uncooked rice per day) and small sips of water. Today my stomach was finally feeling okay enough to eat real food, two breakfast burritos (two tortillas, two strips of bacon, one sliced mushroom, a handful of spinach, and two eggs), but now I'm super lightheaded and hating myself for eating so much.

I used to be really athletic in high school, but I struggled with my weight even then. Then I had a really bad couple of years, took a fall wrong in a choreographed combat workshop and dislocated my knee, then a guy in my class took a book to the side of my head because I wouldn't date him. My parents didn't take me to get medical attention for either of those things, and my weight started to climb. The next year, I started dating a different guy, and he raped me. I was still recovering from the dislocated knee, so I couldn't really fight him off. My weight ballooned again. I can't even talk about getting raped, because I'm so fat now that people don't believe me.

Now I'm too fat to do anything. I can't exercise because my knee injury never healed right, and my weight puts too much strain on it. I can't successfully diet, because I'm a fat idiot who can't keep myself from binging. I can't afford PT, or counseling, or a nutritionist. I'm already super in debt from a car accident earlier this year. 

I've been slowly losing weight, but I yo-yo a lot because I can't stop myself from eating more than I should. I thought that this past week would be nice, because I couldn't keep much food down, but I had to go and fuck it up like the fat pig I am. I feel bad when I'm dieting, I feel bad when I binge. I hate how much it hurts when I move around, but I also hate not moving around. 

I'm tired of just being another fat useless chick, and the world would be better off without me. I can't even hide my body so people don't get grossed out by how fat I am, because my body temp runs high because I'm fat. I haven't been out in public for a month, because I don't want to offend people with my existence. I haven't refilled my prescriptions, because they're birth control pills (which make me fat), antidepressants (which make me fat), and levothyroxine (which fat people lie about needing). 

Plus size funerals cost more, and I can't even be beautiful when I'm dead. I'm thinking about finding somewhere secluded, where wild animals will get a feast, and nobody will be subjected to my fat decaying corpse. The world will be better off without me wasting resources getting fatter.
