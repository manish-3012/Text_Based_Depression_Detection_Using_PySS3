My life is pretty awesome, so why don't I care? I've never been formally diagnosed with anything, but depression does run in my family (my grandmother has issues with that &amp; anxiety, my mom has admitted to me that she's struggled with depressive moods). I just find it horribly frustrating that.. my life is pretty great and while I often enjoy it, there are times like these that I find myself uninterested in continuing on.

Ever since I can remember I have found myself wishing I would die, not wishing to kill myself per say.. but simply hoping (praying in my younger years), that I just would go to sleep and not wake up. honestly it scares me sometimes (tonight being one of them), which is why I'm here.  

I don't know what this'll achieve.. maybe I'll just feel better because I can't talk about it out loud. Maybe I just need someone to say it's okay that I feel this way and it doesn't make me a wuss because I haven't had big traumatic events or a family/friends that are anything but supportive. 

I've considered calling places but.. I'm fairly introverted and concerned about, again, sounding like some wussy dramatic teen (I'm not a teenager just to clarify) going 'oh woe is me, I can't cope with simple shit'.  

anyways, I'm willing to be pretty open here.. so please ask away.
