Your Call Is Very Important To UsThis is literally the only thing I hear when ever people in my life who â€œcareâ€ tell me the same stock answers over and over and over again.

DO YOU NOT SEE HOW MISERABLE I AM EVERY WAKING MOMENT?!??

They donâ€™t. They honestly wouldnâ€™t care if I died. They would probably be relieved that I wouldnâ€™t be a burden to them any longer. 

I have already disappointed everyone close to me in my life.

I am objectively a failure. 

My husband hates me.
Itâ€™s only a matter of time before my daughter hates me too.

I should have killed myself in 2014 when I had the chance.
