I don't understand why I can't kill myself. I'm not upset, I just can't see the point in being happy.**I'm not considering suicide because I'm upset because of a social issue**. I just...i'm having a bit of an existential crisis? *That's an understatement*. It's been years.

I myself am irrelevant to a community which is irrelevant to a society WE CREATED, rendering it irrelevant with our inevitable extinction from a planet WHICH WILL SOMEDAY BE GONE in a Universe which will keep expanding in space as energy levels stay the same, until Heat Death claims the Awareness we call Life.

I can't handle it.
I can't go to school every day because this is what I think about.
I can't wake up in the morning because it terrifies me and makes me so fucking upset.

I mean, I could be content in that all of this is irrelevant, but then I remember I'm just fucking meat. I'm meat and chemicals that make false feelings.

 I remember how THERE IS NO TRUE COMMUNICATION and how human relationships are just the bouncing back and forth of ideas, and relating stories. I remember how we cannot truly lend another person our consciousness so they can fully understand.

Without that, I can't even be content in my irrelevance, because I can't be happy in this horribly isolated disgusting fashion.

I'm living for drugs and bulimia right now and I'm destroying my body (and therefore myself) and I just want to end my Consciousness NOW and become unaware I'm not aware, because the thought of dying terrifies me, so I might as well make it come sooner.

Am I making sense?

Oh god please help, I've run out of friends and family the last two years and I don't know how I've held on this long.
