So depressed right nowIt always happens I do something to dissapoint my wife of 12 years, she gets pissed at me and hey presto she says "the only reason I am still with you is cause of the kids". See she can't work as both our kids have downs syndrome and need constant attention. Today she not only said that, but when I told her how sorry I was she said she didn't want to hear it and that she was over it.

This phrase always hits me in the gut and straight away I feel like harming myself. I have in the past prepared things for a suicide; noose one time, I own a couple of very sharp samurai swords so it wouldn't be that hard. I even got one out one time and went for a walk in the woods, but chickened out after a couple of hours, we also happen to live in an apartment on the 5th floor and that balcony out there looks mighty tempting.

Things are complicated at the moment as her Dad is in hospital with an untreatable condition and we are likely to have to move in with him to look after him. His wife died when my wife was young in a car accident, and her siblings probably won't help.

I usually don't follow through as I think of the life the wife and kids will have with no source of income. But it is getting harder, after one of these events I usually feel depressed for weeks afterwards, the worst bit even when she has gotten over it and she sees I am depressed she gets shitty at me for being depressed, I don't know how much longer I can do this.

The stress of being a sole provider, working my ass off and then getting treated like shit means that the depression seems to be lasting longer and longer sometimes one just rolls into the next.

Sorry for the long rambling post but it is hard to not explain everything.
