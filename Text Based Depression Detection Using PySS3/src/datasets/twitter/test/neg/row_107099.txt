20 years old, getting close to going through with my plan to blow my brains out in my car in the next 48 hours. [long/ranty]I am a complete fuck up. I barely passed high school, failed first semester of college not because I got bad grades but I literally stopped going and didn't even formally withdraw due to constant anxiety, feeling scatterbrained, etc. I was lucky enough to have a great step father who paid for my mistake and even bought me a laptop so that I could try online classes this summer semester.

&amp;#x200B;

Well guess what? I am a lazy procrastinating piece of shit who managed to fail again, I did try for the first 2 weeks but I eventually just gave up due to the stress, I feel like college isn't for me, I love to learn but I just can't handle the restraints of college. I have now certainly failed for the 2nd time(Didn't withdraw this time either because I am such a fuck up), my parents don't know but they are expecting me to sign up for another semester by tomorrow or the next day, I can't bring myself to tell my family I once again fucked up a perfect opportunity to better myself in life.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been looking for a job for over a year now, I send out and refine my resumes nearly every week. I have gotten 5 interviews in the past 6 months but no one ended up hiring me, probably because my anxiety has gotten to the point that even in interviews I look like a complete fucking spastic who stumbled over their words and my mind goes blank. I want to work really hard and earn money and move out of my poor mother's house.

&amp;#x200B;

All my siblings struggle with the same thing, I made an attempt when I was 16-17, both sisters have made multiple attempts in the last few years. Family has gone through 2 divorces as well since I was 5. I feel like we are all crazy but at least they have jobs and are going to college.

&amp;#x200B;

All the money I had made when I was 17-18 years old (I made $20,000+ in under 2 months) is all gone because I am a dipshit who thought that the money I was making was gonna last forever and spent it on materialistic shit like air jordans and polo shit, all my relationships with my friends went into the gutter and I no longer speak with them because when I was going through that manic phase in my life of me making lots of money I kinda acted like a complete asshole flaunting my money (even though it wasn't much, but it felt like a lot when you're a pothead in high school), I regret it so much. Also was getting caught up in very sketchy not fun illegal activity, hanging out with people you really don't wanna hang out with. I learned my lesson there though, gangsters will just want you for your money and drugs before they ghost you, got scammed out of about $2,000 through shady business deals since I am a fucking idiot.

&amp;#x200B;

Also was a drug addict, I was snorting cocaine and oxymorphone and a bunch of other shit in my car before classes in highschool, was doing MDMA + LSD on school nights, drinking lots of alcohol, smoking way too much weed, popping 80-120mg of adderall almost everday. I also met the first girl I ever liked in my life during that time when I was about 18, we got along great had some great trips and fun times together, really loved her, unfortunately she just didn't feel the same way about me in a romantic way which is okay I can't blame her for that, but it still doesn't make it hurt any less. She used to keep sending pictures of us together saying she missed me for the past few months, but I think she meant just as friends so I haven't really responded much.

&amp;#x200B;

All my other friends are moving on in life getting jobs and moving out of state, yet here I am, 20 years old living with my poor single mother while she supports me and my 2 sisters who are over 22 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to quit weed for over 2 months but nothing has changed, and I relapsed on weed literally last night im so fucking stupid I was clean for so long fuck. I am still as just as depressed and down and I am getting closer to literally blowing my brains out. I really don't want to but at the same time I never imagined to be such a fucking disappointment to my step father(he doesn't live with me but he takes care of me financially when it comes to food and clothes and what not) and my mother who also keeps me under her roof, they both have pushed me to go to college and I can't anymore I just want a job but I can feel the pressure coming on harder by the hour, I think they think I don't try but I really do try and get a good I.T job but no one wants to hire me. This combined with college debt and the crushing lonelyness of holding everything in is literally killing me.

(I have quit nearly  all hard drugs except I still take like 90mg of adderall but it hardly has an effect on me anymore due to the stupid tolerance I have gained in the last 4 years)

&amp;#x200B;

I pace my house for 4-5 hours a time everyday for the past few months thinking about suicide and how I am going to do it, the time is getting close.

&amp;#x200B;

i have one good friend left but he has to leave soon because he is getting a job out of state, he is the one who tries and motivates me to stay clean and hike with him everyday. I usually hike 1.5-3.0 miles with him almost every single day and its nice to hang out with him but after those 2 hours or so are up I am back home alone with my thoughts and my fears of the future.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have a 7.62x39 AK-47 with hollowpoints that I am planning on using to shoot myself, I am going to drive up the canyon, take some klonopin if I have any, drink some vodka with it, smoke a joint, listen to some of my last few songs have a cigarette and then put the barrel in the roof of my mouth and pull the trigger. I am extremely scared that this is going to happen soon, I can't tell my parents or friends they will put me in a hospital like last time and that was hell and is arguably what made me worse over the last few years. I know my mom and my step dad loves me, its hard to connect with my step dad cause I only see him once every like year or two, yet he seems to be the one dictating my future cause he financially supports me so I feel obligated to do as he say but I never can because I am just not that kind of person I feel like a deceiving lying piece of shit. My poor mother is who I am really worried about, she just told me that if I didn't get my next semester college classes and financial aid filled out in the next few days its going to be hell and I know exactly what she means. This can't happen, but its too late I already procrastinated like a fucking dumbass because I can't stop pacing and calm down.

&amp;#x200B;

i've been holding all of this inside and I know I should be more thankful some of you guys have it way way way way worse than I ever will have it, but it still doesn't help cause I been feeling empty and depressed and not like myself for the past year especially. I feel like a failure not even out of my moms house no job failing school for second time fuck fuck. I almost carried this plan out back in January because I had many people tell me to hold out a little bit longer and things would get better but it hasn't fuck fuck.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

im sorry if this hardly makes and coherence sense, I have definitely left a few awful things out im also on lots of adderall and ive been up for awhile.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could turn back time to october 2017, if I could knowing everything I did now I could've literally been rich and much more happy off

&amp;#x200B;

i dont wanna die but i have to i am sorry i am a materialistic ungrateful piece of shit i love my mom and my family this is 90% goodbye.
