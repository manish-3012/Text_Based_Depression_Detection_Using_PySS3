What do you do when you no longer have anybody in your life to love you ?I don't really have a family, I lost all of my friends, and I lost my ex a few days ago. I truly have nobody now. They all either hate me, are too busy with their own lives to care or just don't want to be near me anymore. I just don't understand why I'm being so punished in life right now. I have never felt this alone in my whole and its eating up my soul everyday. Ive done a great job of actually keeping up a normal daily life and getting stuff done, but deep inside Im suffering more than I ever have in my life, and I cant handle this anymore. The only reasons I'm not taking my own life is because my father needs me to be there and I love him too much to let him live in a world where he had to witness his child die before him. Also because I know i have potential and I feel like I have so much to offer to this world. I know it sounds so like weird because I'm depressed but at the same time I know my value, yet I want to take my own life. I fight this everyday, and I just want to give up so bad. Im the only on telling myself not to die right now. Please someone give me some advice. Anything will help
