Im tiredI am tired and don't want to keep going. 

I have chronic untreated pain. I miss my late husband like a missing limb. I don't have any dreams or goals - nothing to live for. 

It's less of desiring suicide and more of not wanting to live. There's nothing left in this world for me. I am okay with that. 

And there are no resources for me to access. I tried the crisis center last year and they wouldn't give me my medications (which can kill me lol) and insisted that if I didn't talk my way out it would be multi day in patient with no way contact my job. Oh and insisting that I would only be referred to by my legal name and gender the whole time. 

So. I guess I am just going to give up? Last year I thought about just wandering into the woods to freeze to death but it's not cold enough now.
