Feeling numbA few months ago my boyfriend and I were robbed at gunpoint. Didnâ€™t feel real at all. I felt like the whole time it was happening I was watching myself. Itâ€™s hit me that what happened was real. Not going into detail, but lots of other things could have happened to me. Iâ€™ve come to terms with the fact that I was going to be sex trafficked if my boyfriend wasnâ€™t there.

I see news articles and videos that make me feel guilty that I lived. Why? I donâ€™t know. I see things like â€œSingle Father of Two. Robbed and Killedâ€ and it just makes me feel so AWFUL. Iâ€™m so thankful that I lived but why? Why did I get so lucky? I donâ€™t have family, I donâ€™t have children, it wouldnâ€™t effect much if I died. Then I feel so guilt because those people would be so thankful to be alive. Why did I get to?? What is my purpose? Iâ€™m too scared now to leave my house. What if something bad happens again? You canâ€™t predict it, thatâ€™s what drives me crazy. Why canâ€™t I get over this?? Why am I so awful??

The weed and alcohol isnâ€™t helping me get rid of this feeling anymore. Too pussy to try anything else. I want to be happy. Why canâ€™t I let things go? Why canâ€™t I just be thankful? I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I wish I didnâ€™t exist. That feeling of like iâ€™m watching myself, it hasnâ€™t gone away since then. I just donâ€™t want to feel like a shell.
