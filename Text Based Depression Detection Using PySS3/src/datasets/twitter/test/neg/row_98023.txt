why shouldnâ€™t I?Today feels like as good a day as any to call it quits. My illness is getting worse and life is not getting any better, so why shouldnâ€™t I? I donâ€™t care about my family I donâ€™t care about school I donâ€™t have a gf I donâ€™t owe anyone money I donâ€™t need to take care of anybody Iâ€™m alone.

I already have my plan and note ready, Iâ€™m gonna wear my favorite clothes, eat my favorite food and go on a drive. Thereâ€™s a nice secluded hill in a forest that I like to go to sometimes, Iâ€™m going to go there to watch the sunset and get high and then die. I think there are worse ways to go out.
