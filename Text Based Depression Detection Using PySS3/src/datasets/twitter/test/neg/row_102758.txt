I Want To Be Free From This WorldI just feel, my life has no purpose anymore. I have lost all my energy to do anything. I found myself just sitting in my bed thinking of nothing. Nothing tragic happened in my life, but I feel there's nothing I have left to do in my life. I have no ambitions except possibly freeing myself from this world. I have friends, but it's not like they really care about me. My attention span is nonexistent now, and I just want to end this mental pain.

I want to sleep forever.
