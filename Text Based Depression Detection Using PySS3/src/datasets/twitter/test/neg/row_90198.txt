I just want someone to hold my handI want it so bad. Iâ€™m so lonely. Sometimes I hold my catâ€™s paw and pretend heâ€™s a person. 

Someone. Anyone. I just want to hold their hand and feel another human, and know that theyâ€™re alive next to me. I donâ€™t know how long itâ€™s been since Iâ€™ve held hands with someone. Itâ€™s pathetic. But I feel like if I could just do that I might be able to find the will to keep going.
