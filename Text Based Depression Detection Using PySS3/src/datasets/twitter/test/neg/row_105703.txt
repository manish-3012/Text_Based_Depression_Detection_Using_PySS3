I hate myself.I moved to Colorado with my so and daughter who is 1 and I go to school full time in hopes of being a massage therapist. My family and friends are back in Ny and my parents have resented me and neglected me my whole life, my mom was abusive and went back to Spain when i was 8 and hardly talk to her since, the few times I did she didn't seem to realize how much the way she treated me affected me. My dad treated his gfs and their kids better than me... no one ever went to anything i did, i was forgotten alot left waiting for hours to get picked up from school. No one was ever proud of me, no one has any expectations for me. I was a sad kid growing up.

My friends are gone, I have no friends I feel I can talk to. My so seems sick of me ( wont be surprised if he leaves me) and I don't feel like anyone really gives a shit about me. I am pathetic and cry everyday, I don't think I can be a good mom and I don't want my shittiness rubbing off on her. I feel like I don't care anymore about anything, I want to hide. I think about suicide a lot because I am sick of myself I hate myself... Idk if id do it... but I don't know how else to escape this shitty shell that is me. I resent myself. 

Sorry
