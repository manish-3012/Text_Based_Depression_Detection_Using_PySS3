Been having a hard time...I've been going back and forth on whether I should post here or not but I just really would like some support right now..

I've been having extreme suicidal feelings and no one, not even my mom, wants to listen to me at this point.

I just got out of the hospital for a failed suicide attempt a couple weeks ago, I was diagnosed with depression and borderline personality disorder, I was given drugs and got some therapy, but I'm still feeling absolutely hopeless about my future

I just feel absolutely alone right now
