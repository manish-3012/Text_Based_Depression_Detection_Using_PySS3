I having absolutely nothing left.Everything is just so painful. The tipping point was the end of a relationship but really this has been building up my entire life. 

I was kicked out of my house at 15. I bounced around for a while but didnt really have stability. Had my extended family reject me at 18 because I got pregnant and my family is ultra religious. My son died 2 days before childbirth and I had to try to rebuild my life. Met my best friend at work and he was my source of stability for years. Got married when I shouldnt have. Got divorced after leaving my religion and realizing I wasnt happy. Everybody who was involved with my life got mad at me and I had 0 support as well as people being vindictive. 

My best friend moved across the country because he was feeling suicidal and wanted to try starting over. This tore me apart because hes been my support structure for years. I had started back into the dating scene so I had just met someone who became my best friend instead and quickly became entertwined in everything in my life. I lost the job I adored and the team I adored and my source of stability. My boyfriend became my reason for living.

But I have pretty intense emotional issues and I started freaking out at him and I scared him away and I lost the one thing I had left in my life and I dont see the point anymore. And people say that things can get better but frankly? I dont want them to. Every time things get better they just end up getting even worse in the end and I dont even want to try.  And every little "distraction" i try to find seems to always tie back to the boy I lost and just heightens my internal pain. 

I dont think I can do this. Im not sure I want to either.
