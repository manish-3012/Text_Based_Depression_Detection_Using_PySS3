I just donâ€™t know what to do about this anxiety/dizziness... it makes me wanna give up all together...I quit weed about 4 months ago , and I thought all this anxiety panic attacks would go away but it hasnâ€™t. I heavy smoked for almost 10 years. My dog passed away on thanksgiving and itâ€™s seem since then I just canâ€™t get better... I worry about everything I get dizzy least once a day and I donâ€™t know what to do... I donâ€™t make much money at my job to try seeing a doctor or therapy, donâ€™t have a girlfriend.. all I have is my parents and I donâ€™t know what I would do without them... I just donâ€™t know what to do to get better, some nights I just wanna give up on life... this anxiety, stress, dizziness, and worrying about everything is really getting to me... I donâ€™t know if my brain is still recovering from weed or what but I just canâ€™t get my head right..
