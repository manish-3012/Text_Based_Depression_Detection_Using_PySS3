"I hate my life." "Then change it." "Any change I have the power to make would make it even worse." "Then what are you complaining about?"I feel like a lot of us are stuck in this bind and it's hard to talk about because most people don't even want to acknowledge that it's possible, because it would force them to ask uncomfortable questions about how 'free' they really are.
