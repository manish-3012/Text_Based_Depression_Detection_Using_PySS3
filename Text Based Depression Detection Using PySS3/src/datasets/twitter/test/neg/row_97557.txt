I've never wanted to die more than right nowI'm 17 and I have nothing. No job, not in education, not looking for a job, haven't left my house in 7 months, struggled with depression for 4 years, and my whole family have told me they hate me at least once. 

I pretend I will start doing stuff but I know I won't. It exhausts me. I'm ready to go to sleep after around 4 hours of being awake. I don't eat anymore. Maybe a sandwich or two a day with some water/milk. I only eat the bare minimum required to keep moving. 

I never harmed my body with alcohol or smoking or anything. I was a good kid. I did my work at school and focused. But I'm lazy, and for being lazy I was punished constantly. Is my lack of doing stuff really that bad was my first thought, but yeah actually I'm the scum of the earth. 


I don't care about anything because I don't like much. Everything tires me and stresses me out. I'm like 7 and a half stone now despite being 5 foot 7 or something.

The only thing I cared about was a game called Dota 2 that I play all the time. But I'm shit. I have played around 5000 hours of Dota since I started a year and a half ago. That equates to playing for around 10 hours every day. All the rest of my time awake would be watching Dota. But I still suck and will never be good at it which is all I really wanted to be honest.

I cared about one thing and I'm not even good at it.

My friends in real life who play kind of joke around about how it's sad that I play so much Dota and don't do much. I know it's sad.

Today somebody intentionally ruined one of my games after I'd not only had a shit day of family argument, but also been in a bunch of other terrible games. He started insulting me, the amount I play, and the fact that I was still not very good despite the amount I've played.


I cried over open microphone. The last time I cried was probably 3 or 4 years ago when my cat died. But this time I cried until I couldn't squeeze out another tear.

I literally have nothing to live for. I'm not driven enough to go get or keep a real job. I had one for a year and kept reducing my hours and finding ways to not work because it tired me the hell out, especially dishwashing since I have OCD, makes it an impossible task.

So yeah. Never felt more like I should not be living anymore than I do right now.
