Iâ€™m 15 and ruined my life my only option is to die and I canâ€™t do thatSo in January 2015 I found out I could force days off school then the day after that faked tearing my thigh muscle and managed to get a month off school, then when that month ended I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes which made me have even more time off making it even harder to get back afterwards although for the rest of that year at school (7) I managed to keep an ok attendance and everything was working out then in July 2015 I started to drop off with managing my diabetes which then caused me to lose motivation then in September 2015 I had another month off school, that was the first time I felt suicidal although that didnâ€™t last long and everything (except my diabetes which got way way worse) started to improve until after Christmas, in January I had another month off school which caused me to officially drop out in February which is when everything started to fall apart, I started pushing away my at the time girlfriend became essentially a hermit  let my diabetes get worse and basically did everything in my power to make myself worse 2 months later I lost 3 of my 4 best friends (the one I didnâ€™t lose being my ex) then just preceded to feel sorry for myself for the next 3 months when I became friends with someone I used to hate whoâ€™s now my co best friend (co with my ex) after that nothing changed until January 2017 when I decided to try and get back to school that didnâ€™t work out at all and I just got worse afterwards after that nothing changed until June when I started being even more of a wanker to my at the time girlfriend by stopping talking to her and carried on doing that until October when I started talking to her again in December we got back together and I got a job although me and her only lasted throughout December, in January I badly injured my foot which got infected gave me sepsis and nearly killed me (typical of my luck that it didnâ€™t ðŸ™„)  and I quit my job not long afterwards in March I got back with my ex  and I stopped pushing her away but still wasnâ€™t anything close to a proper boyfriend but between March and may was the best period of time Iâ€™ve had for years and in May someone kissed her and that was the "final nail in the coffin" between us in that way although weâ€™re still best friends but it got to the point where the last thing keeping me going was me and her and now itâ€™s gone Iâ€™ve lost all hope because nothings fixable anymore but Iâ€™m too fucking pathetic to even kill myself I went out to jump in front of a car which sounds stupid but still and I didnâ€™t even have the balls to do it and I donâ€™t know what to do because I canâ€™t go back and fix things no matter how much I wish I could and I canâ€™t and I canâ€™t end it but at the same time I canâ€™t carry on because Iâ€™m basically dead anyway all I do is listen to music and watch movies
