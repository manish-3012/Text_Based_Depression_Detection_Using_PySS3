I can't cope anymoreAll my coping mechanisms that I've spent years crafting are now illegal, and the only friends that would break the law to help me either have COVID-19 or have something huge going on and they can't help it. 

I've been depressed for most of my life, even suicidal for the majority of it to be honest, so I have a lot of good ways of coping which is how I'm still alive. But now, it's all gone. I'm having one my worst episodes, with nothing to look ahead to, and none of my coping mechanisms there for me because I can't go outside, I can't see anyone, and I have no distractions. I talk to my friends online but that's not the same; I just have spontaneous panic attacks mid conversation and have to leave.

I've tried forcing myself to do things but I can't, nothing is distracting me and nobody is legally allowed to meet up with me to distract me. All businesses are closed so I can't go out for a day-long cup of tea at a cafe (which is one of the things I do when I'm trying to prolong myself from an attempt).

My top surgery has been cancelled after 6 years of the nightmare NHS transgender system, I can't see any of my friends to help me, and I'm consistently having panic attacks every day I wake up. I can't go to my family home because, as much as they are happy for me to be there, it's an unhealthy atmosphere and and chance of me recovering from this will be absolutely obliterated if I go to my family home. I will not live through this if I go there.

I can't do this anymore. There's nothing. Everything that was important to me has been taken away, and I've legitimately been just left broken and alone in a nervous breakdown that despite years of councilling, I can't fix.

I'm done. I don't want to do any of this anymore. Fuck this shit.
