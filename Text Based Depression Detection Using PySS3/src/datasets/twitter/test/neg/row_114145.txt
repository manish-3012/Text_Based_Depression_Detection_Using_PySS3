_________I dont know how to start this off. Or how to say any of this but:

I don't feel helpless. I feel defeated. I'm 17, started college in September (Im in England and took a year off school due to reasons Ill go over in a bit) I was happy for a while. Not so much anymore.

Ive been having problems since primary school. Ive been constantly bullied, harrassed, beaten up and ignored. Every inch of my self esteem and confidence has been annihilated. My confidence issues are why college has become a pretty bad thing for me. This is gonna sound dumb, but Im miserable there now because I have a crush on a girl. I know Ill never have the confidence to talk to her and even if I did I know she wouldnt like me.

Thats a big deal to me because everything always feels like a big deal. The smallest joke at my expense, the smallest mistake I make. It just hits me really hard.

I think about it a lot, but it never really affected me very strongly, I get a bit sad about it then move on, but a few days ago I was just overcome by an overwhelming feeling of stress, sadness, depression. I just collapsed where I was standing, I dont even know why. It was like I couldnt bring myself to even stay standing.

Im not a crier but the feeling left me with tears running down my cheeks. I just lay there becoming more and more depressed each second, thinking about every wrong decision Ive ever made, everything I gave up that would have made me a better person today, every way someone has hurt me, everyone Ive lost and everything I should have done to make someone else happier.

I hate myself. I feel like Im taking up space that someone else could have taken up, someone who could have done more than me. Done better than me. 

I dont feel clear headed right now, so I apologise if this isnt very well written down.

To help a bit, I got dumped during the summer. I just found out that she was cheating on me for about 3 months of our relationship. On top of that, my grandma died at the beggining of the year, my mums boyfriend is verbally abusive and I havent even been able to see my dad in months because my sleeping is fucked up from college. I feel like all my problems are whiney and that other people have it worse. But that makes me feel even worse for feeling so depressed over all this.

I dont even want to send this because it feels so longwinded and it doesnt seem like it makes much sense. Theres a lot more to this, but I dont want to type anymore. 

I wish I would just die

Edit: I feel like I need to add this now. As she has done so many times, my best friend stops replying to me after her boyfriend comes online. Its not like I didnt put up with her whining while he was in Mexico. Even my best friend cant be fucked with me when someone else she would rather talk to is online.
