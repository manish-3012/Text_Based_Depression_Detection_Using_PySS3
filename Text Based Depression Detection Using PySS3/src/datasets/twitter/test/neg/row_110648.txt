Honestly I can't think of any other outcome.Well, I think I'm one of those people who were born doomed. I have a list of "problems", and most are under the "hard/impossible to fix" subcategory. I'm slowly accepting the emptiness of my future, but I don't want to go through an existence of just. Nothing. I think I'm starting to accept suicide as the only outcome. Maybe the world will be a better place without me. Nah. As I am now, there's no way I'm influencing anything. So yeah. Might as well not be here at all.
