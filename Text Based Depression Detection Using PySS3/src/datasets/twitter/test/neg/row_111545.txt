I canâ€™t live anymore. Thereâ€™s no other possible solutionI canâ€™t deal with this isolation anymore. Iâ€™m all alone. It wonâ€™t mater once this isolation is over because Iâ€™ll still be alone. Iâ€™m homeschooled. So Iâ€™m always alone. Even when you arenâ€™t having to practice social isolation due to the government. I have no friends who wouldnâ€™t abandon me for being gay. I have one friend who wouldnâ€™t but sheâ€™s cut contact with everyone after getting in a fight with her mom. It doesnâ€™t matter anyways because I donâ€™t know how To hold a damn conversation anyway. Iâ€™m so lonely and I canâ€™t do anything about it. Thereâ€™s so much screaming and yelling and fighting in my house and itâ€™s all stressing me out. 

None of my old coping mechanisms help. They just make me feel numb. I donâ€™t find joy in anything I used to enjoy. My parents brought me to a therapist for a while but theyâ€™re just mad at me for not being better yet. They put me on two different types of antidepressants and it didnâ€™t help and now my mom keeps telling me how ungreatful I am for having a perfectly fine life with great parents and yet being so unhappy. 

Every single suggestion people give me is simply out of my reach and I feel useless and Iâ€™m so tired of being alone. Please. Please I cannot do this I cannot be alone anymore.
