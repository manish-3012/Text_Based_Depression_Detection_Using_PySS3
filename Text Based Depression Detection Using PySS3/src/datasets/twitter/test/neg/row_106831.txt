i'll be sure to go.i cant live anymore, i am the biggest regret and sad excuse that anyone had made before. i'm losing grip of my own sanity and i know i'll die i just know i will, maybe i'm a bit content with my pathetic life will come to an end but i don't know. i failed truly failed at being some kind of decent son to my own parents, i can't do any good in this rat race of a society and maybe i'm truly meant to die six feet under. everyone can see that i'm a pathetic waste of space person and i know i don't belong anymore i don't know if i'm content with that or not but i'll have to figure that out i suppose. i cant breathe anymore without regretting it, just take me away from my own place where i no longer belong to, everyone can see i'm just a waste of energy and i should of been dead long ago but wow look at that i failed suicide multiple times. i cant even do that good enough now can i? i call it quits i truly do, i can't change or maybe i'm too suborn and abusive to do so and maybe i'm just that completely regrettable to society that i wish i died when i did. i'm sorry to everyone who i've failed in my short life and i know i can't make it up to anyone anymore so please accept this last apology and please move on when i am dead.
