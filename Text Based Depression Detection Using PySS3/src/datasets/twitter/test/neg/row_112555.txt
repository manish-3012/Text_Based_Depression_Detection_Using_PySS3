People just say I'm an ugly troll. I want to die.I serve no purpose. No one likes me. I'm an autistic retard. People hate me. I can never do the right thing. I can never say the right thing. My family hates me. They don't even care about me. They used to hit me and scream at me and tell me what a terrible fucking ugly piece of shit I was.   


Today I tried to learn something new. A programming language. I watched a video, I copied what the guy did. I did everything the exact same as him. His worked. Mine didn't. I asked for help in /JavaHelp. User " [Zeros\_Deathwolf](https://www.reddit.com/user/Zeros_Deathwolf) " Called me a troll because I broke down and got upset after everyone down voted me for explaining what happened. I don't know what I did that was so fucking bad and horrible. I speak the only way I know how and I don't feel like speaking anymore. In life. Online. To so called friends. Everyone hurts me. No one cares about me. If I don't reach out to people... they don't contact me. I literally serve no purpose to anyone. I am not wanted by anyone. I feel ugly and useless. I feel worthless. I want to die so much. I wish I could just end my life. I don't wanna feel pain and hurt anymore.   


I don't want people to say lies about me " [Zeros\_Deathwolf](https://www.reddit.com/user/Zeros_Deathwolf)Score hidden Â· [12 minutes ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp/comments/b1xv9k/im_a_full_noob_i_need_help_i_do_not_know_java/eipi3gu/)

Yeah, troll post. Alright then, reported."  


I am not a troll. I might look like one and people might think I'm one because of my autism but I'm not and it hurts. I only say what I mean and I mean what I say. I'm so scared of everyone now. I don't wanna exist anymore. I wish I could die. I wish I could just stop hurting. I wish people could just stop being mean.   


Goodbye.
