so alone...I just don't think I can do this anymore. I hate myself for it.. I hate what I can't be.. 

It feels like everyday, people pretend they understand.. My hometown lost someone two years ago to suicide, not the last since but by far the most impactful, and now everyone "talks" about it.. Oh well he didn't seem sad.. Thats so unfortunate.. If I knew how he felt I woulda helped.. or if he understood others felt that way..

but they say all this to me.. who looks at them.. smiles.. agrees.. while I'm dying.. All day I hear that I should just get up.. that nothing is that hard.. that I'm "healthy".. so I must be better.. whatever that means.. Everyone talks about suicide like its so simple... you're either selfish or you're in some unimaginable pain.. if you talk about it.. you're just looking for attention.. nobody actually goes through with it.. until they do.. 

I'm so.. so alone.. I can't handle it.. there is nothing that hurts so much as to have someone look right through you.. to be invisible.. I'm just.. invisibly dying..
