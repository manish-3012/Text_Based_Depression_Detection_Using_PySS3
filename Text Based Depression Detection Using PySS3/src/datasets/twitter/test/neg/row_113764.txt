I'm sorry.I'm a sixteen year old guy from Europe. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for about five years now. I'm also FtM transsexual, which doesn't exactly make things any easier. I live with my mom, who is an emotionally unstable hoarder, and visit my dad a couple of times a week. I'm an artist, though I haven't been able to draw anything in about a week. I also used to self harm. I've been clean for a couple of months now. I'm planning to start again tonight, after my mom goes to bed. I go to group therapy three times a week for six hours at a time. It's shit and has only made me feel worse. I recently started taking Zoloft, but I haven't noticed anything yet.

I told two of my friends that I love them. I have three more to go. I don't think that I'll kill myself tonight, or tomorrow, or the day after that. I might hold it out for a few more months. I don't want to die, but I see no other way out.

I can't live here anymore. I asked my dad if I could live with him, but there's no room for me. He hasn't got a lot of money. I can't live with any of my friends either, nor can I move out on my own. I can't go to school, I can't work, I can't do anything.

I'm just at the end of my rope.
