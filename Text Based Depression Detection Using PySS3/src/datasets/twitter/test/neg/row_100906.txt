I owe so much money...im so screwedI put myself in so much debt as i was too depressed to work.

My parents bailed me out so much, i promised not to get anymore loans 

I was in a ldr relationship and i was supposed to come and visit for a few days. I coudnt afford it but he said i wasnt "trying" hard enough to get ahold of money (i couldnt work due to severe depression  and it felt like hed leave me if i didnt come up to see him so i got a loan to help me go up but the money was taken due to me oweing loads of money to other places. 

I got another loan out because i decided i was taking my life and i didnt care about paying it back. 

Ive wanted to tell them but everytime im around they say how little money they have and i know if i tell them theyll insist on paying it. 

I can pay it over time with benefots but i just feel so ill hiding this from them. 

I feel like a failure. I feel ike i shouldnt be alive. 

I just wish i could work and pay everuthng off. I owe 1000s but im too ill. 

Im just in a fucking mess and want to die. 

Im sorry for rambling
