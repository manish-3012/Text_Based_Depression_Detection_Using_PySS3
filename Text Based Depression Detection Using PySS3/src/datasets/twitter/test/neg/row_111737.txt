â€œMy Heroâ€ music saved my life (post from the other day)I canâ€™t find the post but I wanted to say this: 

I read a post the other day to the tune of music saving one of your lives, when My Hero by the Foo Fighters came on &amp; encouraged you to keep going. 

Nothingâ€™s in vain: I heard it tonight, and Iâ€™ll always think of the OP of that post, whoever &amp; wherever you are.
