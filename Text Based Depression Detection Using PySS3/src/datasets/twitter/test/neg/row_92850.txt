One more go - some hope for people potentiallyIâ€™ve been having a think, Iâ€™ve been suicidal for the past few days, bipolar disorder and an ED- fucking nightmare. But I was just reminded of a friends story which gave me a little hope. This friend was in and out of prison asa young adult, everytime he got out of prison he would go back to drug dealing, a vicious cycle because he had to make ends meet somehow, didnâ€™t have qualifications. But he was always charming, could talk his way into anything, would sometimes get jobs through charm alone (but would be immediately fired when they found out the truth). On his last time in prison, he decided he was going to hang himself. He was done. Had no direction, the future looked fucking bleak. Proper rock bottom. He said to himself, if I donâ€™t decide what Iâ€™m going to do with my life by morning, today is my last. He thought, Iâ€™m going to be an actor. Okay. Thatâ€™s it. Heâ€™ll hold off for a little longer and make it work. He got a job at the drama school I was at, working in the cafeteria. Serving the students he hoped one day to be. He auditioned and eventually he got in. He worked his arse off. He never forgot that decision made in prison with the noose so close. He just finished a one man show at the national (if you donâ€™t know, itâ€™s the biggest theatre in London, a really fucking big deal). It made me think, I might give it one more try. X
