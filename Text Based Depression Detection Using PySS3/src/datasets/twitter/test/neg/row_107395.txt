My family is the only reason I'm still here.For a while now I've wanted nothing more than to end it all. About a year ago I realized that life is truly pointless, and that fact has been driving me crazy ever since. Some people say that it doesn't matter whether there's a purpose or not, but I disagree. Compared to plenty of other people I've had a good life, a great life even, but I'm ready for it to be over. I find myself considering suicide more and more lately and I've accepted that I'm going to do it.

The problem is every time I get close to doing it one thing stops me, the thought of my deaths impact. My parents would be destroyed and my siblings as well. But specifically my younger brother, he's 13 and has had alot of problems in the past coping with stress and I fear my suicide is something he wouldn't be able to recover from.

So here I am, 16 years old and the only thing keeping me alive is the guilt I feel. It's no way to live, I know that. I won't last this way forever and in truth that knowledge helps because it means eventually I'll look past the guilt and do what needs to be done.
