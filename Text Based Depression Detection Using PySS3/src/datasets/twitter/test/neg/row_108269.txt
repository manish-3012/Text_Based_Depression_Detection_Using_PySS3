Want to kill myself what should I doIâ€™ve been suicidal for 3 years so please just donâ€™t comment shit iâ€™ve heard for so long like Â«it gets better, donâ€™t give upÂ» etc

Canâ€™t be bothered to describe too much

Male 18
Servere anexity and depression

Just failed my driving test for the third time because I simply cannot relax or focus. I can drive pretty well I just canâ€™t focus
Doctor and shrink been trying to help but I just canâ€™t seem to be happy

I was so close from jumping infront of the train afterwards. I just feel like I wanna punch someone to death. 

Basically what can I do to try and ease the pain. I know itâ€™ll get better, but I wanna try something else than just drink and do drugs

Go for walks is something I do

Help
