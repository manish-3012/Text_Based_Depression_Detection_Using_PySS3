22, abused by father and stepmother most of my life, heart broken twice by the woman I love, mother going into surgery in 3 days and very likely will not make it out, and about to be homeless. It feels like my time is coming.I've battled with depression and a feeling of numbness most of my life. Therapists have tried and failed to help me and medication only gets me temporarily out this pit. I've attempted twice in my life and failed,  but in the end I get the same argument of stop we would be devastated if you died statements. Looks like this people who say that are either about to pass away or used me for what she wanted then cheated on me and left me behind. Death has been enticing for a very long time and it's embrace seems like the sweetest end of all.
