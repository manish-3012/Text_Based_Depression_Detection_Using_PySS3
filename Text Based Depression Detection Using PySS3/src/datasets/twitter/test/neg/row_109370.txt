I don't even enjoy music anymore1. I don't enjoy music 
2. I have no real friends 
3. I've spent the whole summer inside doing nothing
4. I have no hobby 
5. I'm not talking to half my family 

I wish I could kill myself, but I don't have a gun. 

If anyone in the dmv does, hit me up. I don't want to fix this because I can't. I just wanna die.
