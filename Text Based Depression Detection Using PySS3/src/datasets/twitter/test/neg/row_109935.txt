Gahd im back here again it always comes back to thisI thought life was gonna be alot better by my 16th birthday. I thought i was finally gonna be able to get on hrt much sooner and start presenting how i want and stand up for myself. But everythingâ€™s just the same as it always has been. I have prom/formal in december and if im going to be forced into a suit and tie i will throw up. Idk iâ€™m just envious of the people who dont have these issues with their head, i just wish that i was born female and didnt have any problems with studying or concentrating or mood. Honestly at this point i just wanna stay in bed forever and shut myself in from the world.
