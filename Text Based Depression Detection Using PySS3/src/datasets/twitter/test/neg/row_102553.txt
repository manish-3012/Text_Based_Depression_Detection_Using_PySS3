Failed suicide attempt last night after trying to overdose on Trazodone.I'm 22. I've been cutting myself too. My girlfriend woke me up and I told her I overdosed. She started crying. Told my parents, and my mom bawled her eyes out and was bellowing at the ceiling. My dad said he needs his "best friend" in this world. I was upset this morning that I was still alive, but now I am upset at myself for causing my loved ones so much pain. I don't know. I gave my dad the knife I've been using to cut myself but I still want to do it. They wanted to commit me to a mental hospital tonight but I've been committed twice before and I told them that I wanted to finish the semester before I agree to be committed anywhere. I was already 4 semesters behind going into the Fall and I should have graduated this past Spring. If I get committed now I won't be able to go to school and I'll just prolong my time in college and that will fuck me up even more.
