The last strawAlright...Iâ€™ve posted here before on another acc but i forgot the password so here comes throwaway too many numbers

Alright so,I suffer from severe paranoia.I feel as if Iâ€™m constantly being watched,listened to and even that people know my thoughts.I think I might be bipolar,I stress my ass off for school,my step mum gets drunk and makes my day even worse.I also have a huge fear of abandonment.

I have like 3 things or so in my life,my dogs,mom and gf.

So the thing is,my gf lives in England and I donâ€™t,sheâ€™s also suicidal and was raped and some other stufg I wonâ€™t get into unless you think you wanna know ig?

If/when she doesnâ€™t respond for days,either her mum took her phone or sheâ€™s thinking or even almost attempting to kill herself.

Thing is,she hasnâ€™t responded in 3 days now,which worries me like alot,since thatâ€™s the longest that she hasnâ€™t responded since we met.

If she dies,I think Iâ€™ll kill myself bc Im also sick of being told â€œIm too young to be depressedâ€ or like its treated as a joke or it not being real or some shit.

I really hope she replies soon bc fuck I donâ€™t wanna die.I want to be done with this life,but Im afraid of what comes after.

Help please,I need ideas or you can just tell me to kill myself if you want to do that.
