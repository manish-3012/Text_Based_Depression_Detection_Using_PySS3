I can't live anymore!So, I'll try to break it down for you quickly so I can go back to crying myself to sleep:

I'm 18, and I have so many things wrong with me that, if I said them, you'd not want to help me, but this is my last resort. I have everything you can think of wrong with me: Autism from a young age, Schizoaffective disorder, and even a false violent felony on my record (for a SUICIDE attempt mistaken as a homicide attempt). 

I can't do this anymore. I get out of prison only for people on the internet to berate me and tell me I'm good for nothing. I can't. I JUST CAN'T.

Please, I need some advice. Please.
