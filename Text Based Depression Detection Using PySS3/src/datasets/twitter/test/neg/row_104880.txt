I've always wanted to die, but now I'm actually thinking about killing myself...I know.. this will probably get lost in the sea of people who feel the same or reaching out for any kind of help... but I'm kinda hoping mine doesn't...

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been depressed. At least I'm very sure I was just born depressed and suicidal. I've only told a few people in my life because I'm sure they'd never believe I was telling the truth, but my earliest memory is of myself maybe no older than 4 and I frequently had this "vision" that I would grab my mother's largest kitchen knife and stab myself through the heart in the living room and just watch myself from above in a pool of my own blood. I can't explain why I thought this... I just know I thought of it a lot. Even then I didn't want to be alive.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I already knew my life would never be anything but a struggle.

I guess, I'd like to really start by telling you a little about myself... I like to think I've always been kindhearted, a pure heart full of love and compassion for people and especially animals despite how much I've been kicked around. I've toughed it out for so long, I was always proud that no matter what life threw at me I kept fighting against all my odds, that I wouldn't give up, even though I constantly wished I'd just miraculously die. I've always thought I was a good person, it's all I ever wanted to be. So much that I put many others before myself because I know helping someone (person or animal) could mean the world to them, either for life or in that moment. Maybe I've always hoped someone would finally do that for me too.... but there hasn't been.

 I don't mean for this to sound like I'm putting myself on a pedestal... just I always thought I was doing some good. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I feel like I have no more hope. I have no more drive to keep going. I'm giving up.

(There is a TL;DR if you'd like to skip my family story)

My life hasn't been easy... by no means as hard as some others have it I know, but it still hurts me deeply nonetheless.  
I come from a broken family like many other kids, but I've never had anyone to have my back. Friends were just another toxic element in my life.

My dad: was a deadbeat good for nothing; I still can't help but chuckle dryly that I found out he moved out of state from a family friend I'd never even talked to before. This family friend was there for me more than my own family was when I had no food and I'd never spoken to them before. 

My stepmom: Literally insane I'm sure. She used me to get at my mother, brainwashed me, always made me feel like I'd never be good for anything whilst at the same time making me feel like she loved me more than my own mother. Which she probably wasn't wrong in the end. She's the most malicious and manipulative person I've ever had to know. 

My ex-stepdad: At the time my mother fell in love with a man who was half her age, maybe 10 years older than me. I never felt safe alone with this man, but my mother would often leave me to him on her weekends with me because she had to fly out for work (flight attendant) but still wanted me to be at her place? Confusing I know. I digress... this man, he always felt off to me. He'd always pressure me into saying "I love you". Another time we were all out at target and my mom was asking me if I wanted a one-piece suit or a bikini (I'm 13 at the time btw) and then he would chime in, in a weird demanding way that I get a bikini. We often went to his family's pool and I remember how he caressed my thigh asking if I shaved because my skin was soft. I remember feeling threatened when I made a lighthearted joke at his expense and he looked like he'd hit me...  and unfortunately the one night I'd let my guard down and fall asleep in my mom's bed while she was out on a flight he'd sneak in next to me. I went to therapy after I mentioned it to my stepmom. Long story short, my therapist called me a liar. 

And my. Mother. Dearest:  How I've tried my best to bond with this woman. It's all I wanted. But she is... a coldhearted bitch, just like her mom. I remember so many hurtful things. Almost too many for me to be bothered to list. But to sum it up, I remember this time I reached out to hug her and tell her I loved her... She didn't even lift a finger and her response was if I loved her I'd move with her and "ex-stepdad" and then she just walked away. It shattered me. I was 14. 10 years later she shatters me again to tell me it's my fault I didn't get to see my grandfather all the way in Japan before he passed away. And to top it off my now boyfriend agreed.

There's so much I could probably write a small novel based on my family, to be honest.

***TL;DR***

My family sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I've had to move back to my mother's because my then boyfriend left me alone to pay for a $1,500 apartment single-handedly. Which I tried my best to do for months. Eventually, I had to call it quits and come back. Eventually down the line she gets mad at me over something stupid and tells me I have to move out by March 1st. Fine. When she told me it was November and I was planning to move. That is until she starts bringing up that I pay bills. Okay, fine so I stopped looking thinking I'd be fine to live here a bit longer. Now... I want to say I've worked my ass off. Working to better my health, my body, my mental health, getting off Ambien (cold turkey after using it to OD with my anxiety medicine), getting better jobs for the past 5 months. It's been a struggle but I was doing it. I went from a coffee job to an office assistant job, while it's what I "wanted", it doesn't make me happy, most days I'm lonely because I sit alone at the front of the office and every day I'm piled with more to do than what I'm really hired for. It's not what I want to be doing in life but it pays better than anything I could get without having any college schooling under my belt. Then one day  (this February 4th) I decided I want to go to school. I want to study and get a degree to be a software engineer.  I needed a day for myself because I was just.. so unhappy and I wanted to turn my life around.  So I call off a day as a sick day just to take care of my mental health and I get excited to finally tell my mom what I want to do and hopefully, she'll let me stay longer to go to school and even offer to pay bills with a part-time job. 

I don't even get the chance to tell her before she's screaming at me for calling off work when I "wasn't sick" ( I dunno, to me they're the same thing if I'm not mentally well...). She calls me a cunt and all these other insults and reinstated I move out by March 1st... all this and she hinders me by cutting me off from the internet, that I paid for (that problem is fixed, I found a way to connect without the password hence how I'm writing this)..

Anyways... I'm coming closer to my deadline and I still haven't been able to find a place... I constantly feel like I might lose my job even if I do find a place. I'm afraid to end up on the streets... You might be wondering what about my now boyfriend if you did happen to read through everything. He lives all the way in England. I'm in America. "Well isn't he something to live for?" Yes and no... Though I know he tries his best ... he's not... always the best... I know that he does love me very much but most times if I tell anyone what he does or says when he's mad or losing his mind they say I need to leave because it's beyond abusive. But at the same time he's the only person I have that gives me affection... and I do love him very much, but I know he's tired of everything going wrong in my life and I know deep down he'd eventually be happier if he didn't have to help carry my emotional burden.

The only thing that's really keeping me alive is my dog. I love her to death and she's the best thing I've ever had in my life... but I know if I gave her to someone I trusted she'd adapt to her new owner. She wouldn't need me in the end. 

 every day I'm more and more exhausted and I don't have the strength to keep going... I don't know how to end this other than... I've always thought about death. I'd always say I want to die but I'd never actually go out of my way to do it... but... I'm very actively thinking about it now... I have it planned out once I give up completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of being miserable. I hope someone reads this... and... thank you if you did.
