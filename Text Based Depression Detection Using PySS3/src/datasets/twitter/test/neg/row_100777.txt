I don't deserve to liveNot an exaggeration. I'm a horrifying human being. I'm angry and I take it out on others (not physically). I'm just pure evil. I'm filth and vermin and every day I'm alive is food and water wasted.

I lash out and I hurt people and I regret it. Every day I know that my death would be a blessing for this world. 

I just wish that I wasn't such a monster, but I'm stuck on two settings: "Attack" and "Defend." I will hurt anyone who tries to get close, because I don't deserve to be happy or to be loved. I've driven away every person who's tried. I make them hate me, and thus see reason. 

And yet I'm too much of a coward to go, even though it's the one gift that I deserve. I don't want to be here anymore. I can't fucking take it. I hate every molecule of myself. 

I'm so fucking lonely, and it's all my fault. I pray every night that I won't wake up, and I always do. 

Most people on here don't deserve to feel this way, they're good people with wonky brains. I'm the one person who deserves depression, who deserves to hate himself, who deserves to be tortured and beaten and whipped and hurt in every way possible. I deserve it all. I deserve this. 

And it will never get better. I will be this miserable until I die. And I wish I was brave enough to end my own life the way everyone wants me to.
