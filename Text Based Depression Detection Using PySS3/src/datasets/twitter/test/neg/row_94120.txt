I Honestly donâ€™t see a point in living anymoreI donâ€™t see the point in living anymore like everything around me is falling apart like my girlfriend I thought I was going to marry Iâ€™d be forced to marry someone else by her parents because they do that a lot in their religion and thereâ€™s nothing I can do about it and sheâ€™s the only person that has ever considered going out with me because usually everyone rejects me because of my weight or my looks. 

I just finished high school recently and I have no clue what Iâ€™m going to do with my life. Iâ€™m super lonely because I donâ€™t have very many friends because Iâ€™m really introverted and itâ€™s hard for people to understand me.

 At home everyone just tries to fight with me all the time to I just spent all my time in my room and sleep or I go to work and have to act fine the whole day when Iâ€™m reality I wanna die 

I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore I just donâ€™t wanna I should die on a daily basis.
