I've failed everyone in lifeI left a good career to move in search of a dream that probably wouldn't be achieved. I have been failing at my dream for a year now. I found a girl that I loved with all my heart but I let her go because I was scared that I would fail her too. I had a stroke this year (age 23), and I wished more than anything that the stroke took me because at least people wouldn't blame themselves if I died that way. I want to now kill myself, but I know it would hurt people more than I've ever made them feel good.
