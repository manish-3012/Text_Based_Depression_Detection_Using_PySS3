.I was talking to my friend in ceramics class and told her I was probably not going to have kids because of the fact that our world is on the brink of being destroyed. She asked me, "wouldn't you be sad if you didn't exist because your parents decided it was too scary to have children?" and I was like "hell yeah it would be a relief if I didn't exist. Sure as hell beats suicide".
