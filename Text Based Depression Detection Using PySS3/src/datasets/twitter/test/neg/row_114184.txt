Just cant do it anymoreI am in uni in another country and i have alrdy failed one subject and need to resit in a couple of weeks. My other subjects i have done badly as well and am too afraid to even check the results. I dunno how to tell my parents and my friends. All of them have checked it and they have all passed. University is not cheap and i feel like a burden to my parents. I cant afford to fuck up as i alrdy did once when i was struck with an illness and i really thought i could come back from that, it has been an uphill battle for me and the illness is under control but uni has been another beast and i dunno why but i just couldnt concentrate and fucked up the exams really badly as i didn't even complete the papers. I just feel fatigued all the time and lost so much weight i am so.skinny even though i have been stress eating. I just dont have it in me anymore . Even the paper i have to resit i cant study i just have lost the will in me to keep fighting. I kept fighting but now the pressure to do well and to keep up with my peers has just gotten to me. I dont what to do and have had thoughts of ending it, i just feel like something in me died. I dunno how i am gonna face all the people and everyone around me is saying how i am doing a course that is not that hard and you can even pass without studying, all these judgement and expectations are really taking the toll on me. I just cant anymore mainly about how i am wasting my parents money and being a disappointment.
