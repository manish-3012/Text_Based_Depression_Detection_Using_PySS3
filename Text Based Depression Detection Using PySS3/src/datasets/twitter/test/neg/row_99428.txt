I thought things were going to get better.I had just been put on a new anti-depressant, and an anti-anxiety medicine, and I was planning on getting counselling. I genuinely believed this was going to change things, I haven't had this sort of help before. But now my best friend has stopped talking to me and I don't see the point in getting better when I'm so alone.
