Take my hand, someone, for a moment...I am alone. I have only touched another human being for three days in seven months. I don't know the next time when I will touch someone. It will be months yet. I am alone. I am reaching out, here, with my fingertips over this keyboard... Can someone reach back, let me know that I am alive, that I should stay alive... Thanks, kind strangers...
