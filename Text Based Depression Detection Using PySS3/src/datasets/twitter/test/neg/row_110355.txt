Friendless, Feeling Alone, Canâ€™t Make Recovery FriendsThrowaway for obvious reasons. Struggling to wonder if any my friends would miss me. Over the years, by my own fault Iâ€™ve pushed all my good friends away. There was drama between them and my S/O, and I wasnâ€™t managing my mental health. I suffer from depression and anxiety, Bipolar II, recovering alcoholic. Iâ€™ve flaked in plans so many times that my friends gave up on me. Again, itâ€™s my own fault for being unreliable and I own that. I guess I just needed to vent somewhere and talk about how much it sucks. Typing it out is helpful. It sucks to wake up one day and 6+ years of your life are lost to mental issues. Iâ€™ve tried mending bridges and patching up lost friendships, but the spark is gone. Not drinking makes it harder. I should go and make new friends that suit my current interests, but itâ€™s daunting to me. I canâ€™t relate to people or connect with them beyond a surface level. 

I feel like I fake human interactions. I never used to be this way. For example, Iâ€™ve made connections in recovery. But I canâ€™t make true, lasting friends. It feels like that trope in a movie where the characters are trying to teach feelings to a robot. I feel like Iâ€™m forcing it and my natural state is reclusive. I donâ€™t want to live that way anymore. I donâ€™t know that any of my acquaintances or friends would even care that I was gone. Maybe they would be sad for a few days? Then it would go back to being as if I never existed. Anyway, this is probably just the depression talking. Iâ€™m not going to take any actions, I just really needed to listen to myself typing these words to get them out there.
