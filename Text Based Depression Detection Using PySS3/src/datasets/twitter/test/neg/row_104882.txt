What is the point of life anywayWe wake we sleep we carry out our shit everyday and yet nothing ever seems finished. My family found out I was suicidal and talked to me for like 2 days and after that it just went back to normal for them but I was left behind as if my cryâ€™s for help were nothing and now over a year later they still donâ€™t talk to me and all I do is get hurt by my brother and screamed at by my mum. But not all is bad because I met a really nice person online who I talked to for about a year but my parents found out and made me never talk to them again but now I have nobody to talk to and I just want to curl up and die. My snake is missing. Life is shit. And the only things in life that helped me or cared for me and made me happy are gone.  I just want to die
