I guess I am a useless idiot after allI heard my boss talking bad about me with a coworker. I was always worried that he hated me, and this proves it. Who knows what other horrible things he says when Iâ€™m not around.

Iâ€™m worthless garbage. I got the easiest job in the world yet I still find ways to fuck it all up. Iâ€™m not cut out for real life. I just wanna give up. Barely anybody would miss me anyway, Iâ€™m just a worthless stain.

To everyone I annoyed and hurt: Iâ€™m so sorry
