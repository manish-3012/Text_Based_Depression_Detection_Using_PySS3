It's so peaceful, the tough of suicideHaving control of your life, i think i have reached a point where the only person i can dissapoint is myself, for a while the tough of dying scared me. In particular the way id do it and how my parents would see me, now i understood i can just do it in the woods and call the police to pick-up my body, i learned how to slit my wrist properly today. I guess that's an even more reassuring tough i will be gone. I also believe in reincarnation therefore i think i will walk on earth again and so will my family in another life. 

I am age 21 and have been trying to beat a heavy porn adiction for close to 3-4 years now. It makes me feel anxious, i don't want to eat, i just want to sleep, the anxiety and me feeling like a piece of shit has left me unable to hold down a job, i just want to sleep all day, go out with my friends from time to time... even tho i feel like i am very young and will have many happy memories, life just feels dull. A living hell. I don't wish addiction for anybody.

I don't know if i will ever be able to overcome this, i feel either very challenged or very cursed by god(even tho i am an Atheist).

Theraphists are not very known where i live, think of a place similar to Russia but not. I might visit one since i am moving soon to the capital city to be in the same dorms with my best friend. 

I might as well write a suicide note about my beliefs etc. tomorrow or this week and just keep it somewhere safe for when i feel my time has come.

This all feels very peaceful. Any PM's welcome.
