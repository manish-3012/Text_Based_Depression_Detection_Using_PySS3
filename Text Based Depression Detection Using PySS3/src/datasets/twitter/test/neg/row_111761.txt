Dissatisfied with my life. Help.I am 18 years old. I start community college tomorrow. I have suffered from depression for a while now and I have tried my absolute best to be positive about it. I have visited numerous psychiatrists, been on plenty of different pills, but I have only found just enough to make things numb. It just gets so hard to try and make yourself happy.

Anyway, I don't know which direction my life is going in. I am sure that is common for people my age, but I don't have much aspirations in life. I really just want to make enough money to live comfortable someday and focus on the social aspect of life because I feel like I have really missed out on that. I am sure that attending CC instead of a university isn't helping my chances either. Community College is free for me so I decided to just do that instead. I'm going to major in Business because I felt that wasn't too bad of a degree to go after. I just feel like I am stuck as far as my social situation goes. 
 I realize that I am young and have a whole life ahead of me, but I feel like shit when it comes to girls since I haven't had too much experience  in that area. And I can only imagine that part of my life will only get worse due to my depression only getting worse as well. I don't even consider myself a bad looking guy or socially awkward either. I just have a hard time meeting others or knowing where to look. I try to keep an open mind and hope that maybe I'll meet some people while at school or something but I just really am afraid of getting my hopes up. The idea of killing myself seems so relaxing to me. The only thing that has stopped me is the idea of failing and experiencing even more pain. I am a total wuss when it comes to dealing with pain. I might seem very melodramatic or have a "woe is me" attitude going on right now, but I have trouble putting this all into words. I guess I just want some advice, reassurance or even a plan that can get me going or keep me from wanting to just end my life.  

I am sorry that this post is so all over the place. I'm just a mess right now.
