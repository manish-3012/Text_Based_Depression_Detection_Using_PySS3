I wish I had the bravery to do it.The only thing that keeps me alive is fear. One day I hope I have the strength to take my own life. That's the truth. I hate myself and I don't deserve life, I'm tired I want to die. Nobody fucking cares I'm a joke my depression is their punchline. I just want to sleep. That's all I want. Death seems like an escape from this pathetic life I lead. I wish I were dead everyday nothing changes.
