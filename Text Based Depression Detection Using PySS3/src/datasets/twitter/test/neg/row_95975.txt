Done with itI will do it soon. Maybe not today. Not tomorrow. But some day. rent a hotel room. Take ALL my pills. Take lots of Alcohol. Lots of weed. Hopefully the obstructive sleep apnea will kick in and I will pass away in my sleep. Or my heart will stop. Something. Anything. 
I am too much of a coward to hang. 
Too much of a coward to do anything because of my wife and kid. I hope they understand.
