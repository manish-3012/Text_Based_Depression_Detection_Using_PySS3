I have no purpose in lifeI know life is what you make of it...but i just dont want to make anything out of it.
I am not motivated by my masters, i am not motivated to fight for the person i love, i am not motivated to get a job and truth be told i dont want to find a motive.
Im calm, i honestly am, and all i want to do is commit suicide peacefully, no drama no no nothing.
No one would notice today if i killed myself.
I really want to, im looking for my resources and options...and just vanish
