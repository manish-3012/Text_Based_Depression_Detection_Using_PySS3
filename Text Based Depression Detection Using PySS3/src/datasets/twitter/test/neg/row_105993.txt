I crave suicide, plagued by it, day, by day.Everyday now, feels like I am dragging it. Ever since I lost the fun of life, after I hit puberty for the last 6 years, on/off I had thoughts of suicide,
but very recently, I feel I lost all happiness of life, I just feel like a zombified state of content, every day I drag on 1 more useless day, rather then being dead.

I no longer feel I need to live, I lived enough, but here I am, slaving away day by day, always people telling me to go see a doctor, I reject, I tell no one but you anonymous people, hoping 1 of you can enlighten me somehow to say that I can find that so called happiness again so I have motivation to live.

The only reason I live now is I fear if I did do it, I'd be a mental and psychological burden on the people who "love" me, whoever these people may be, I don't want to live the world knowing I tortured them with my greedy selfish ways.

But once everyone forgotten about me, I can leave forever.

I guess you can call it [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melancholic_depression](Melancholic depression)

I hope this post, and people like so many I talked to online, I feel rejected by the lack of response, and I don't know how more years, before I finally snap, from the insanity of not feeling happy about anything or doing anything, and feeling empty my life.

Absolutely nothing so far in this world is good enough for me to stay, to motivate myself to continue the next day, I feel it's all useless, I am a nihilist and the only thing I see purpose in life for is happiness, and if I can't acquire happiness, then I should leave the world because I no longer feel the need to continue.
