I'm done with trying to save myselfI'm 23 years old and I truly don't see me making it to 24.  So far my life has been nothing but letdowns after letdowns. I've never had a job or a honestly a friend so I'm basically living like a 12 year old.  I live with my parents and they treat me like crap and call me a shithead every day. I almost positive I'm depressed because I'm never happy or sad I just feel nothing all the time and I've been like this for so long that I can't imagine life being any other way. Because I literally have zero people in my life I can vent to I decided to do it here. I really really don't want to kill myself but I also really want to just be dead. Every time I in the car I just wish I would get into an accident and die I know that's not normal but it's all I wish for. I spend about 14 hours a day in bed because I just don't have any motivation to do anything. I'm not looking for answers or advice I'm just curious if anyone else out there feels like I do.  Because I hate myself and I just want the mental pain to end.
