WhoopsFor a brief background, I've been suicidal as long as I can remember. I was suicidal as a child before I even understood the concept of death or methods beyond falling from a great height.

Anyway, fast forward through a lot of boring details. Last night I got absolutely wasted, had a horrible encounter with someone I care about, reacted strongly (and embarrassingly, honestly) and decided that it was time. My boyfriend was home with me. It's a blur. I was hyperventilating. I ran for my out and took it outside. I laid on the grass, ready. My boyfriend came and wrestled it away. He was furious. Really furious. I was screaming "let me die" as he dragged me in the house. What a shitshow.

We tried talking. I told him too much about my past, about my feelings. He vocalized that he knows I'm suicidal, which is the first time anyone has ever said those words clearly to me. He hid my out, and it was about 1 or 2 am. After he went to sleep, I got up about every hour to search, always returning empty handed to lay back down, dirty and muddy in bed. I sobered up, and kept searching. I still don't know where it is. I've always had it ready and now...not having it there, knowing that my out is gone...it's scary. The intoxication and hangover are gone now and ... well, I haven't changed my mind. I still want the same thing I've always wanted. And now more so because I have completely exposed myself to the one consistent person in my life and I don't think he'll ever see me the same again.
