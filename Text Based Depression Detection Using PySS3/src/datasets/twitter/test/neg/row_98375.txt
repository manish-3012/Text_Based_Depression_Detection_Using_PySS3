I think I'm going be finished soonJust to sum it all up, I'm tired of living as a black guy. I try to do everything right and the future just seems bleak for me, I don't know where to start. Just being black stinks in every way shape and form. Take a look at any statistics and you'll see what I mean. I've wrestled these thoughts for a while now, I'm honestly just done at this point though none of it seems fair.
