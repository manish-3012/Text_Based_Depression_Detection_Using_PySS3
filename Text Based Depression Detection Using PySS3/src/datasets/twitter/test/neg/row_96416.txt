Kinda want to end it all because i'm short.Hi reader. I recentley found out that I am 5'5. I'm 14 years and 5 months so that is fucking awful. I wear extra inch shoes when i'm in public to gain an extra inch and look tall. I'm in the 45th percentile of height and while I am taller than about 82% of my grade, that's only because I was held back, and if I wasn't, I would be taller than about 10% of the grade. (The grade above me is REALLY tall.) I am expected to be around 5'10/5'11 or 6ft if i'm lucky however. If that doesn't turn out correct I will be fucking miserable. It is stated that tall people earn more money, are happier, and girls like them more. I'm guessing you can see my point.

UPDATE: I talked with my parents about it and I remembered I have a delayed bone age and I will grow for longer than a regular person would and would most likely end up around 5'11 or 6ft.
