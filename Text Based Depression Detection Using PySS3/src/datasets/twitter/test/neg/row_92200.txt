I have a perfect opportunity to end it all next week.Ive posted here before many months ago, Ive gone and seeked out help. But even with all the help ive gotten I still wish I was dead. My life is still in shambles, I still want to take a razor blade to my flesh and just carve myself into an unrecognizable mass of wet flesh.

Im now 23, no schools wanted me / with a postal strike my marks and other important materials never reached some of the school on the deadline. Ive been on anti-anxiety medication for 8 months, went from 220lbs to 300, started working out to help with my depression and weight and Im back down to 260ish. To make matters even better with the anti-anxiety medication I have about every sexual side effect listed. The medication made me even more depressed, a girl is interested in me? too bad my dick doesnt work and who would want to be with someone who cant get it up? ive gained 80lbs and look like shit because of these drugs that were supposed to help. I still hate myself and cant stand looking at what a failure I am in the mirrior. I cant stand looking at my mom and dad, they pay and go out of thier way to provide me with everything to end this depression. I cant face them again and tell them that Im planning on killing myself again. I know they would never admit it, but me leaving would be a great boon to them, i wouldnt be the failure 23 year old with only 1.5 years of university done, they wouldnt be a laughing stock amongst thier friends / co-workers. Im sure im a constant joke, and i cant keep dragging my family down. Im sick of pretending to be happy, joking with people, and smiling. I just want to lay down and never wake up.

I now have a perfect chance to end everything, im so tired, ive wanted to kill myself for so long, i kept holding on trying to make things better, but nothing improved. My parents are away on vacation and I can call my aunt over to watch the house / dogs, telling her im going to a friends cottage for a party, then wander off find a nice quiet place, inject myself with some pain killers and then go to work on my body with a razor blade, and then finally end it with a massive dose of Propofol. I think this method would give me a 100% chance of success, im terrified of failing killing myself. Im terrified of screwing something up, or someone finding me while im doing this and attempting to save me, i dont want anyone to see me die, or try to save me and have me die, or have to face my parents from a hospital bed. I dont think i can stop myself this time, and im afraid.
