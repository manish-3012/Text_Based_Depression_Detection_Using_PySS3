When will I Learn?I am pathetic. No one wants me, everyone wants me for what I can provide for them. And i beg so many for their approval or their time, and no one wants me. I hate myself and how pathetic and needy I am. I am a waste of space. No one is going to want me around and no one cares about me, how many times do i have to keep learning this?... it's finally starting to sink in. Wondering what the point is to living right now....
