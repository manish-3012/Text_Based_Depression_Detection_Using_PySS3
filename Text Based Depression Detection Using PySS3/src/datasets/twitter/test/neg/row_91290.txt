I need to dieI need to. It's the only way to satisfy myself. I'm disgusting. I'm so fucking disgusting. Everybody looks down on me, I'm disgusting. I'm not right. I need to die. I need to die I need to die I need to die. I will never be happy, I will never be alright, I will never be normal. I don't want to be like this. But I will always be like this. And as such the only way to satisfy myself is death. Existence is pain. Death seems nice. I will finally be at peace then. I can finally be satisfied.
