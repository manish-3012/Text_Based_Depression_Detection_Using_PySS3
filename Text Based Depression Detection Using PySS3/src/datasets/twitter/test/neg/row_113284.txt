I am going to attempt suicide in the next weekFor a few months I have thoroughly researched and prepared to hang myself. Last week I checked out the spot that I had in mind and found a way to rig up the rope that I have.

I donâ€™t want to feel the way I do anymore. I feel like my life is going nowhere. If itâ€™s all going to end with suicide in a few years once Iâ€™ve officially failed at everything Iâ€™ve ever attempted, why not just do it now when I already know itâ€™s not going to get better. I have no financial resources no insurance I donâ€™t even have a drivers license and Iâ€™m 21 years old. I have nowhere to go, no way to escape from my life. I havenâ€™t signed up for classes next semester, I have a note written out and I feel like Iâ€™m actually about to kill myself after years of thinking about it. 

What can someone like me even do? Is there any alternative available for me?
