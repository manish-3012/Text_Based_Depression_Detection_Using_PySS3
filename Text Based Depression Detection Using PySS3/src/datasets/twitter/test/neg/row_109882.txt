Nobody cares.Nobody cares. Everyone is self serving. When I show weakness, I get brushed off. Shamed. The ole fable of a parent's love is a farce. I could ask my parents for help and they would just tell me some hyper-religious bullshit about satan controlling me. They would threaten abandonement. I would call suicide hotline but their callous apathy would shove me off. I can't show weakness. 
I can't ask for help. Everyone seeks to manipulate me. Everyone I know. I'm just a fucking tool to everyone. I'm sick of the manipulation. I could make an anonymous plea for help (like here) and all the codependents would come crawling. 
I have no trust in people. I could pop off the face of this earth and no one could care. (Except my parents; that would hurt their narcissistic egos. Oh how bad they would look in the community for having a son commit suicide. All the attention sympathetic attention they would get must be great though.) 
(Funny story, even when I was back in school before I was arrested, I talked to my school councelor about my family situation. This guy was convinced more than I was that my parents were using me lmao)
And get this. I know I have "value." Decent features, told I'm very intelligent. Yes, I'd be a great slave. No, I don't want to be one. I don't feel love. I don't love anyone. I have never experienced something such as that. I hate the fact I was born. I hate this world. I want it to end. If it helps you to understand, chances are a therapist would diagnose me with mental disorders. Narcissism, Antisocial personality disorder, hell maybe Borderline Personality Disorder just for fun. (if such stupid labels actually exist as a means other than to give stickers to snowflakes) People close to me say I'm probably psychotic. (In a joking way; you can insult or speak the truth as long as it's funny. Jesters were the only ones in midieval times who could call kings out on their bullshit without being decapitated, after all.) 
I'm tired of my life. I deserve better than this. I should have respect and power. No love; I want to be feared. But like a sick dog, unable to function properly, I think it's time to be put down. Look, these are my honest thoughts. I probably belong in a ward, but knowing either no one would give a shit or perceive me as dangerous enough to be locked up, I wear a mask and put up a charming facade, bottling everything up. I've tried letting go, "being myself" but I have violent fits of rage when this happens. I can't. No one can tolerate the real me. And that's what scares me, logistically. (Emotionally, I feel pure apathy.) I've been under so much stress and sleepless nights lately, my charming mask is starting to crumble. As soon as the real me comes out, things get ugly. No, FBI, I have no interest in killing people. But I can be a painful, toxic person to be around. I digress though. Life's a game and I'm on a fast track to losing it. All this potential to be great, and I'm too fucked in the head to use it. Fuck my life.


P.S. This is the hell storm going on my mind. Thoughts I just typed as I observed them. Take it as you wish. I called a hotline tonight, feeling as I was on my way to a mental breakdown, and it was hilarious; the lady was so cold and dissmissive. And these people supposedly want to save lives. It's just virtue signalling so they can brag about "saving lives."
By the way, if I sound like a cynical, shitty person, I'm probably machiavellian. "Can't bullshit a bullshitter." I can't see positives in people. Probably because even my own parents have caused so much shit in my life, but I don't want to just assume solid beliefs based on just self diagnostics. Imagine knowing your own mother and father never loved you, just subtley used you your entire life.
Anyway I'm going crazy. Thought posting about it would help. If we're lucky, I might reply to comments/make another post.
