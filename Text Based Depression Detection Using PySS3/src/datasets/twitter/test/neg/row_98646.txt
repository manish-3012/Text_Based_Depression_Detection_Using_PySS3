Why wont I just do it?I talk and think about killing my self every day, but I'm still here. 

Why?

If I was any of my friends, I would have just told me to do it. Even I'm sick of hearing myself complain about life. If I wanna die so bad why don't I just do it? Does part of me want to live? Apparently its deep fucking inside of me because I hate every second of my fucking existence.  Every day I pray for somebody to hit me with their car or just shoot me or something because I'm too much of a bitch to do it my self. 

I feel like I'm building up the nerve to do it. It's inevitable for somebody like me.
