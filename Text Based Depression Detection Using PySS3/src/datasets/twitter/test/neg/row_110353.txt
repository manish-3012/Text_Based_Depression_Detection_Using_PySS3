I have no control of my life anymore...Ever since I was young I feel like I've always been caught in the current of those around me, always pushed around by people who should love me, and always cast aside after the pushing subsides.

I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for 8 years now. When I was 18 I finally sought help from my doctor but the best he could do was tear a page from his trusty Rx notepad and send me off to my pharmacist to induce an artificial chemical euphoria that I knew wasn't real.

It's so easy to widdle your way down from these drugs. I've been on Pristiq and Wellbutrin and now I'm dabbling a bit with Paxil, but I've always had those moments of lucidness when I can tell this isn't reality.

I've always filled that painful void with things that were destructive -- yet good at that time. A pornography addiction that started at a very young age, an arousal addiction that accompanied it, compulsive lying, bouts with nicotine and alcohol, girls.

Whatever this horrible mental state is, it's destructive. It has pushed the girl I knew I was going to marry away from me, it has landed me in jail, it has made me lash out at family and friends and burn bridges like there is no tomorrow.

My days of exuberant and somewhat manic happiness are the days that pull me back from the cliff. I would like to say I have a strange sense of pride where I consider myself an attractive, successful person... but at the same time headed from lies and into loneliness, a bleak future where I cannot be strong enough to support even myself, let alone a family. I fear the consequences of actions not yet taken, I fear the realities of life. I constantly feel that "I didn't sign up for this life... I didn't agree to this."

My fear of ceasing to exist is the thin string keeping me from going forward with the thoughts I have had in my past. Some days I get obsessed with suicide, I seek out stories and videos of those who had gone forth. It's a strange and frightening feeling to see and hear the stories of those driven to the edge; but at the same time it can be one of the most exhilarating and exciting feelings.

The feeling of relief is something that is attractive to me... knowing that tomorrow isn't a worry because it will not exist for you.

As of right now I don't feel like I am at any risk... but I'm afraid that someday there will be that push over the line where I cannot stop myself.

How do I get myself back on track guys...
