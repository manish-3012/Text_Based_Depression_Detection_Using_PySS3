My heart feels broken every second of my waking life. ðŸ’”ðŸ˜ž I can't go on.Hey so I'm just typing all this on my phone in bed.

SoÂ I'm a junior (male) in college and basically, a few years ago it's really specific but I was watching the show The Good Place in an AP class in high school (I think it was after an AP test or something and we were just having a chill day) and I forget what episode it was, one of the earlier ones, but there's suddenly a sound clip that plays in the show of "the Bad Place" of people screaming and yelling and I never watched more of the show but I suppose that was something like hell?

Long story short I grew up Christian (Lutheran) in a great family with no relationship issues in my immediate family, I'm 20 now and my life growing up had nothing to complain about, I did well I'ma school and am and a great college now going for a major in film.

I mentioned the Good Place because that's where I really began to have issues. Literally when that sound clip played i had never in my life and never have since then just been frozen like I was. I just started sweating and I think I went to the bathroom, I didn't visibility panic or anything but I have never been that suddenly and mindlessly panicked.Â 

Basically, that's where I began to have issues with hell. Like, how can such a place exist, basically. How can there be a place where people are put to suffer for all eternity.

Â A few more key memories:

-freshman year of high school my sister-in-law (who was then my brother's fiancÃ©e) told me she didn't believe in hell (making me anxious about people even in my family maybe going to hell)

-one day when I was home from college I was talking with my dad (we don't have issues but we never really have serious conversations) about hell and he tried to comfort me by saying it's probably not real (again making me anxious)


It's not just hell but also romantic relationships. I never have been in one but have had many occasions where I thought girls were interested in me (even one asking me to dinner) but either they weren't and had a boyfriend, or weren't Christian. Thinking about girls has been a major plague on my daily thoughts, I've ever asked three out and all no, I know that's not a reason to stop but with that and my faith issues and my self-harming and depression, I just don't know anymore.


So regarding self-harm and depression, the reasons for it long story short are mainly for these reasons. Also, one of the reasons is my major: being a junior in the film program having had no internships and not even knowing if I'll like any job even though I went into film and not engineering or something because I really enjoy it and am simply quite good at editing and making videos on my own when I do summon the will to make anything (very infrequent).


So for self-harm and depression, I first sniffed rubbing alcohol in freshman year of college then before I could stop myself i started to drink it, I stopped myself quickly but I had to retch a bit. I dabbled in pretending to kill myself with a knife by making the motions without actually cutting since then, a few times I went in the bathroom and tried to cut myself but couldn't. I tend to go to sleep with a knife under my pillow or near me, sometimes going to sleep holding it for comfort or something, as if hopefully I'll cut myself when asleep or something.Â 

I'm in a Christian org on campus but have not been going to anything this school year, it feels like I just want to avoid it. I am in an apartment though with three other Christian guys also in the org, I'm friends with them but not nearly as much as the girlfriend of one of them and another girl who lives nearby who lives near us.

The second girl I had asked out in Feb of 2020, the girlfriend I was going to ask out and nearly did during the summer, but I didn't and a few days later I found out she had been dating the future apartment-mate for a few months, I didn't know.

Basically it turned out that we kinda all became a friend group (me, my apartment-mates, my one apartment-mate's girlfriend, and the other girl who I had asked out who is best friends with the girlfriend) and me and the girl I had asked out are friends now but I still can't hang out with her without having some kind of romantic and relationship and sexual desire, and also the apartment-mate's girlfriend I'm very attracted to her and she hangs out for at least a few hours at least every other day at our apartment, it's so hard to exist with them in the living room though because whenever she's here they're pretty much always physically close (they literally lay with each other for a few hours at least every other day on our couch) and I'm very attracted to her also and nearly always have sexual desire thoughts toward her.

But basically it turned out that it was these two girls I told about my issues with hell and wanting a girlfriend (not about being attracted to the girlfriend though) because they're Christian and very nice, and they were the first people I told my issues to. But it's so hard because they hang out here every day and they know I have severe depression so I can't avoid them or they'll think somethings wrong, if I stay in my room when they're at our apartment they think I'm hiding which I kinda am but I don't know.

A few months ago I started to self-harm by warming up kitchen knives on the stove and pressing them against my forearms. I've had a few cycles I don't know why I do it whether it's punishment or attention or idk. But I only a few days ago was the first time I actually cut myself, it wasn't barely any blood just a little on the upper side of my arms, I wear long sleeves now but both of the girls who are my friends know about this. Right now as I type it's been a few days but I still have very noticeable burn and cut marks on both my arms, enough to sting the first 24 hours or so and now more like a constant itch that hurts and feels weird if I touch it.

I dunno, both of the girls said they were seriously considering putting me in some place for a few days like a treatment center hospital or something? With covid online classes I've barely been able to do school at all, I skipped all this past week like I can do that I be ok but still I'm really behind and it gives me stress but my classes aren't too hard at all and I can still do quite well, As and Bs.

Also, I have been going to a therapist for 5 or 6 weeks but cancelled my last appointment and feel like I don't have plans to make another unless someone pressures me to. I told him everything I said here besides the actual cutting and blood which only just happened in the few days. I've been on sertraline 50 mg since mid-July, doesn't feel like it helped much and told my doctor this, but he just doubled the dose to 100 mg which I've been doing for 4-5 weeks now, doesn't feel like it's made any difference. But then again I don't really exercise like at all so I mean, pills ain't no wonder drug or anything.

I dunno. I feel like I'm using hell as an excuse to feel bad but it's causing me such terror and pain and anxiety right now, thinking about all those people who might be going to suffer for all eternity, it just sounds fucking stupid and impossible for God to allow the more I think about it. And the apartment-mate's girlfriend, a jealousy for their relationship and physical closeness is making my depression so much worse.

I dunno.

Even music has begun to be bland the past few days, and it's hard to eat more than the minimum each day.

I dunno.

I just don't want to live but I don't want to die.

I think I'm going to heaven but I don't know.

And even if I do, all those people in hell...

Like what the fuck.
