This YearHow one year can bring someone to ruin. I started this year the happiest I have ever been. Had my dream job and a relationship with my dream girl. We were together 6 years and while any relationship has some ups and downs we never really fought about anything. We both got frustrated with me is about the extent of it and she was the one who pointed out to me I was probably on the autism spectrum. We liked the same things and laughed at the same humor and shared everything and I miss her so much. I cant even watch movies or TV shows anymore because I just wish I could watch them with her. But alas she broke up with me because when we discovered I was autistic it was too much for her to process and she threw me in the trash. I guess that's where I belong. I had started therapy to learn skills to prevent meltdowns but it didnt matter. Her family hated me because I dont make eye contact and they had heavy influence.

Just a couple weeks later I got laid off from my dream job, I was there 5 years and I also miss that routine very much. For the first time in my life I had a few years where I was actually happy. I had even started keto and lost 150 pounds because I had an abundance of willpower because I didnt have to spend all my energy fighting depression.

Well all that is over.

I lost everything and in that chaos I tried to reconnect with my kids who live far away. I tried to take my savings and move to where they are, only their mother and her family are insane people and chased me away with crazy bullshit. I just can not live close to that woman, she was exrremely violent when we were married and even tried to murder me on more than one occasion. She got custody because her family is rich and she is a woman, that's all family courts care about. I have 50/50 but that's horseshit I wasnt able to see them for 10 years because of her games.

So I gave up on being part of my kids lives and had now nowhere to go but my parents house. They live in the middle of nowhere in a town I will only call Pigshit Springs, can you guess why? Yes it smells like pigshit. Everywhere you go here it smells like pigshit.

I have a job again it would be okay work if the company wasnt such a shitshow with turnover and I came in at a very chaotic time so lots of fallout is landing on my lap. It is a two hour drive each way to this job because I live in the absolute middle of nowhere. I have started gaining weight back because I have no willpower all my energy goes to driving, work, and fighting depression. All I truly have in life that is good is my dog.

I am writing this because all it will take is losing my keys one too many times, or my wallet, or some other small thing that sets off a meltdown and I wont have the spoons to recover. I have suicidal thoughts every minute of every day, I feel it may be around the corner. I lost everything and the only person I ever truly loved and that I thought ever truly loved me. My kids dont like me and I wasnt given a chance to even know them.

I have no reason to keep fighting and I pray for some accident to happen so I can die and not have a suicide funeral, but I think that may be how this ends.
