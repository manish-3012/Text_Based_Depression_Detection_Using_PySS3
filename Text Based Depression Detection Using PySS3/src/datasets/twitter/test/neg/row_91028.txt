I'm tiredHow do I talk to anyone about this?  I want to go to sleep and stay asleep.  Oh she died peacefully in her sleep a tragedy so young her poor family they're strong they'll survive she was always so happy and friendly generous and funny. ....no she fucking wasn't. On the inside she's numb but her nerve endings jangle with pain her ears buzz with a secret noise that keeps her from sleeping her chest is heavy with tears building building building into a tidal wave of crushing grief. That fucking noise is so loud in my ears like having my head filled with mosquitos.  I cover my ears and the noise drones on overlayed with the sound of my rushing blood and the throb of my heart. ...I want it all to stop. Why won't sleep take me and keep me
