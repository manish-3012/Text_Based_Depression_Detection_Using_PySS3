How do I stop?I want to take my life. I don't see much reason to go on, everyone I know just leaves me or doesn't give a shit. I don't want to die but it looks like the only way to get rid of a lot of the pain and torment stacking in my head from repressed memories of abuse to my rock leaving me and letting me feel alone. I want to make everyone hate me before I go so the 3 people who care won't care anymore. 
How do I keep going on?
I tried 2 weeks ago and wished it ended then. I just want it all to stop
