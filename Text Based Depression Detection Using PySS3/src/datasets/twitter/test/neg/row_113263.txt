How do I keep going when there's nothing left?I'm sorry this is so long. TLDR at bottom. 

Iâ€™m numb, I donâ€™t give a shit about anything anymore. I donâ€™t feel anger, or sadness, or happiness. Itâ€™s nothing. I donâ€™t want to keep going because I know things wonâ€™t change. My family isnâ€™t going to change. I canâ€™t make anyone give a shit about me. Everyone who I care about always leaves and leaves me empty. Iâ€™m perfectly functional, I try my best to think things through and rationally. I get up, I go to work, I go to the gym, I eat healthy. Iâ€™m not religious. I donâ€™t believe that God is going to save me, or that Iâ€™ m here for a reason, or have a purpose. But it doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m not a good person. I know that I have a huge heart, Iâ€™m honest, I enjoy helping others, Iâ€™m compassionate, I enjoy making friends with others. If you looked at me you would never ever guess that before I go to bed at night I think of ways I can kill myself.


Iâ€™ve been depressed for as long as I can remember. When I was little and I would cry I would dig my nails into myself, and I would try to suffocate myself using a pillow. When I was 13 I started to cut myself with a shaving razor. In high school I cut my hips so no one could see. After I turned 18, I would get tattoos to satisfy the â€œcravingâ€


My past: 

My dad left my mom when I was really little, she got married to my stepdad when I was 3. My momâ€™s side of the family lives in another country. I didnâ€™t meet my real dadâ€™s family until I was a teenager but they also live in another country. My step-dadâ€™s family has always treated me differently because they know Iâ€™m not my dadâ€™s real daughter. So I never grew up in a family setting. I have an older brother, heâ€™s only 5 years older than I am but he always treated me like a little kid. I tried to like what he liked, and befriend him as we got older but he never showed interest in me. I spent a lot of time alone in my room growing up, and I still do. 

Fast forward to a little over a year agoâ€¦My depression hit its ultimate low. I cried nearly every night, I wanted to kill myself, but I knew that I had to get help. So I reached out to my older brother, who told me he would help me pay to see a psych and therapist. So I made an appointment, I went and was put on prozac and welbutrin. Fuck that. They made me feel nothing. I mean at least when I wasnâ€™t on them I could still get excited about things but I just felt nothing. I didnâ€™t like it, and I didnâ€™t want to keep taking them so I went back and told my psych I wanted off. He just said okay so I stopped taking them. 


I decided that since I wasnâ€™t going to be on meds, I would take matters into my own hands. I set goals for myself to keep living. I got a job, and I saved up so I could plan a trip to visit a cousin up north. I actually got better. Some days I would realize â€œWow, I havenâ€™t thought about killing myself lately.â€ I was doing pretty well.


Over the summer I met who I truly believe is the person that Iâ€™m meant to be with. We can talk about all sorts of stuff, we have a lot of the same interests, we dislike the same things, I think he's the funniest person, he's handsome, I just absolutely adore him. Iâ€™ve been in relationships before, but when I look at him I have never felt more sure of anything my entire life. 6 months ago he deployed. The beginning was tough, but we were okay. But the last couple of months we couldn't really talk as much and I felt so disconnected from him. Last week he told me he couldnâ€™t be with me. He said itâ€™s because he has some anger issues that he needs to sort out before he can be with me. Which, I completely understand. I told him that Iâ€™m here for him, that I will support him when he needs it. 


Now, I would never kill myself over someone..if I did, that would of happened years ago after the worst abusive relationship Iâ€™ve been through. 


It just sucks that I thought that after years of misery, my life was finally going to fall into place. While heâ€™s gone I planned to work and save up money so we could move in together. We bought tickets to a festival this summer. We share many common interests so we talked about where we would travel and move to after he gets out.


I donâ€™t know what to do now. Iâ€™m stuck. If I stay here, Iâ€™ll just keep hating my life every day. I donâ€™t know how I would move away on my own. Itâ€™s so expensive to live here and I wouldnâ€™t know anyone. I donâ€™t really have a lot of friends. After high school everyone just kind of faded away. I do have a best friend from when I was younger though. I like to hangout with her but she has a boyfriend so Iâ€™m always the 3rd wheel and I try to not ask to hangout much because I donâ€™t want to intrude. I donâ€™t really have any family that worries/cares about me. 


My brother did pay for me to go see someone but he never asked how I was doing. He didnâ€™t follow up on me, and even after I called him out on it, he still didnâ€™t call or even send a text message to see how I was doing. I got so angry at him, for not giving a shit after I told him I wanted to kill myself. And no, we still donâ€™t talk. I have told my mom about how I feel, she didnâ€™t have much to say. She told me not to tell my dad because he wouldnâ€™t take me seriously. Then she never brought it up again. I don't think she thinks that depression is such a serious thing.


So here I am. Pretty fucking alone. And Iâ€™m scared for myself, for the uncertainty that my future holds. Iâ€™m tired of the hopelessness. I donâ€™t want to keep dragging on everyday pretending like everything is okay.


If I do kill myself, Iâ€™m going to do at the end of April. Iâ€™ll write out what I want to happen to me afterwards, and what to do with my money and belongings. Iâ€™m going to write letters, I want people to know that I didnâ€™t kill myself. I didnâ€™t want to commit suicide. I have a disease, a mental illness and Iâ€™ve simply lost the war. I didnâ€™t have enough support to go on. I know people say that suicide is selfish, but isnâ€™t making someone keep suffering in life selfish? After I die, people will get over it. We all die eventually. Why does it matter if I choose when that it is? I can die tomorrow while eating dinner, I can get hit by a bus next week. So why canâ€™t I choose how and when I go?

Iâ€™m going to be honest, hanging out with my friend and smoking weed helped a lot. I started to have more good days then bad. I donâ€™t crave it, I donâ€™t need to do it. Now, I just do it here and there. I donâ€™t drink, I never got into hard drugs. I don't consider myself to have an addictive personality and I tried my best not to try to fill the void with men or drugs. But I have been thinking about doing mushrooms or acid. Maybe I will see life differently, maybe it will help me realize something Iâ€™ve yet to realize. I donâ€™t know. But Iâ€™m so fucking desperate. 

I need someone to tell me what to do because I don't know anymore.

**tldr I'm depressed, I've tried different solutions, nothing is working out for me. I'm trying to figure out how to keep going and not kill myself but it's not looking so great right now**
