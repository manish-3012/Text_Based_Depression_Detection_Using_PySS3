I need a good reason not to do it...I feel like I'm indirectly responsible for my dad's passing.  This is partly because my cousins told me so, and I think my grandma believes it too, but doesn't want to admit it.  Before we found out that his cancer had come back, my dad and I did not have the best relationships.  In fact, we would fight all the time, and I'm an adhd asshole so I was just hard to deal with, and almost all the fights were my fault.  So around the time when he was stressing over work and me and a lot of other stuff, he suddenly started having these back pains.  After visiting the doctor, it was confirmed that the cancer had spread, and spread fast and far.  The doctor was confused how it could spread this so quick, and once the family heard about it, the first thing they blamed was me.  Of course at first I thought it was silly, why would I cause the spread of cancer?? Besides, I believed that he could beat it.  Fast forward 8 months and he's gone.  I have no one else, and there's this consistent voice behind my ear that says I killed my own father.  Stress causes cancer to spread, and spread fast, and I was the one who potentially caused it.  I thought I could ignore this, but I can't.  I'm 17 and I can't carry the thought that I could be responsible for his death with me my whole life, and the thoughts and feelings are getting worse and clouding my head.  I fucking hate myself.  I can't stand the sight of me, I'm a sick piece of shit that shouldn't have been born to begin with.  I can't even trust myself around others.  My poor grandma has taken me in and I fear that I might cause her harm the same way I did to my dad.  It's honestly best if I'm just not around.  I don't want to feel anything anymore because all of it is filled with self hatred, regret, guilt, and anger.  I don't know what death will bring, maybe nothingness, but I'll take that over being here and feeling all these horrible emotions inside me that's growing like a cancerous tumor.
