Prescription Drug QuestionWhat are the most lethal prescriptions I can get? I need to kill myself. I canâ€™t see to get it done any other way, though. Firearms arenâ€™t an option and I chicken out with hanging or jumping. Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was ten and Iâ€™m in my 30s so I know I can take pills. Hundreds of them. Problem is, itâ€™s never been effective so I need access to something stronger. Iâ€™m not opposed to getting drugs by illegal means but I have always been a pretty straight arrow in that regard so I wouldnâ€™t even know where to begin to find a dealer. So I need a prescription. I have no reason to be prescribed any narcotics but I have been diagnosed bipolar. I have bad anxiety too and could get diagnosis of PTSD if I ever told doctors more stuff about me. So what would be the best pills to ask for and how much do I need to stockpile to get the job done in one night. Please tell me if you know the answer. I donâ€™t need saving. I need help so I can escape.
