I think ill do it tomorrowI'm trans, in an abusive relationship,depressed, suicidal and I've tried everything. 16 different meds, hospital stays, exercise 5x a week, therapy for months on end, new city, new career, blablabla.

I've been feeling like shit for 26 years, I'm 33. I've heard it was supposed to get better for years and it's just not. My stomach hurts, my soul hurts, I'm tired and I don't give a fuck anymore. I've reached out so many times ppl are just ignoring me most of the time, or I get the same responses as usual. 

So...i think that's it. I'd like to get Some miracle here, but I don't think so.
