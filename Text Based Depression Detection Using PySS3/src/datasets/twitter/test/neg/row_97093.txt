Been at the depths. Like to support othersSomeone they can count on to be there and to give you unconditional support. A person who texts you first and wants to know how you day is going. But not just "how is work" or "what did you watch last night" but how you the person is doing. How was your anxiety today? Did you use any coping skills? What did you talk about with your therapist? How can I be a better friend for you? Those type of things.

That's the type of friend I am and would like to be for others. No strings attached, no hidden agendas.

Things we can talk about: mental illness (deal with that), relationship issues (check right there), worries about the future (all the time), the sauna that is the summer weather (my gosh Texas is hot right now), cooking (let's trade recipes or even video chat cook together), reading (mini book club anyone) or even just comparing our favorite songs and artists (+1 if you like Blues music) 

I don't offer any medical advice, expert knowledge or quick fixes. Just friendship
