Hello!You can call me Adam, that isn't my real name but it will suffice. I'm a man of 23 years old and living in somewhere in Europe. My life is actually pretty okay if you compare it to others. I have my own apartment, I have a job and a few siblings and friends which I meet once or twice a year. I don't have any kind of love life but that doesn't really bother me too much. I've gone through some hardships in my life, such as I was abused and neglected by one of my parents growing up, then being put into foster care and I moved around from different foster homes before becoming an adult. In addition to that I've had a couple of depressions and one psychosis in my life. But my life haven't been all that bad. My teenage years were hard in their own way but they were also great in so many other ways. I used to be a pretty good athlete and I was given a diploma in writing course after graduation. That and of course that I was the first in my family to actually graduate the equivalent to high school diploma in my country. After graduating I moved on to work as a salesman, and even though I am a bit shy as a person it went really well and I had a lot of amazing colleagues which helped me out and guided me in the processes of becoming a greater salesman. I lost my job indue to me having a psychosis, but I did have a good time working there, and now I work as janitor because it's less stressful and it doesn't cause me to have any symptoms. I would say I had a good life, don't you agree?  
I mean, the abuse was bad when I was a kid, but I've gone through a enormous amount of therapy to work that out. And the meetings with all the social workers eventually lead me to growing up and becoming a functional member of society. The psychosis I had was a real set back, but I am doing better now and having a stable job and somewhere to stay was more then I had a couple years back.
