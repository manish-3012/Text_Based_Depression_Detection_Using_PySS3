I am disposablePeople don't need me. People don't want me. People try to reach out sometimes, but they quickly lose interest once they realize I'm not worth it. I am replaceable with basically any other person on the planet, who would not only be an adequate replacement but better than I am. I should just kill myself because it's not worth it anymore. I just want one person to care about me. To pretend that I matter. Even my best friend has abandoned me because I'm too much of a bother. When that happens, why should I even bother with myself when other people don't? The only thing keeping me from a sound death is the lack of a means to swiftly and thoughtlessly end myself. I just want it to be over. I just want to be done with this. Everything sucks. No one cares. No therapist, no friend, no family, no teacher, no boss, no coworkers, anyone. They've all let me down and I don't think I can ever trust anyone ever again. I feel like it's time to stop being a pussy and just end it.
