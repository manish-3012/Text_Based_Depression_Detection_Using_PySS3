Constant failure; little hope of improvement. Suicide seems responsible and preferable to remaining. Please let me know if I am missing something.  

I am posting here because I want to end my life, and I have made preparations to do so. The reason is that I will soon become a burden and embarrassment to my family. My family is upper middle class and helped me through college, and otherwise has helped me financially throughout my life in the hopes of me becoming a happy, successful person.

The problem is that throughout my life I have experienced a form of anxiety which I can only describe as disabling. I have been fired from many jobs, and my work performance has always been poor due to inability to sleep and inability to interact in a normal way with coworkers and customers due to severe anxiety. I've tried all sorts of medications and therapy; I've really stuck it out as long as I could in every job I've had, and I've had jobs since I was 16 (about 10 years ago). Work is simply torture to me. I feel so guilty saying that, but I have no other way of putting it.

Anyways, despite my difficulty with work I did well at university and got accepted to a PhD program. But I got kicked out last year due to failing my qualifying examinations. I just felt incapable of studying. For the past year, I've tried to improve my situation but I seem to be incapable. I will lose my parents' health insurance next month when I turn 26; around that time, I will become a burden to them due to my declining savings and because of the fact that they will probably have to buy me healthcare or else I will go without.

Anyways, I'm a huge disappointment and I feel I've tried everything to improve myself but it just doesn't work. I feel like everyone concerned would be better off if I ended it. Death would seem to be both a responsible choice and a welcome respite. I can't see a reason to continue on but I feel like I should reach out to some people on the internet to see if I'm missing something.
