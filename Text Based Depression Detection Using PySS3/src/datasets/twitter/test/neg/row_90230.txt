I can't do this anymore.I'm having suicidal thoughts for the first time in about 3 years. I have no where else to turn and don't know what to do.  
I don't know what is wrong with me. My brain is stuck in these feedback loops. I lost the love of my life a year ago, and I can't stop thinking about him and our relationship. We were together at a young age (18 and 19 respectively) and we ended things due to our inability to communicate and grow well together when I was 23. I was a mess growing up then due to the lack of support from my abusive parents, and he was honestly not emotionally mature enough to handle a relationship at that age.

I got kicked out of my home at 19 due to them finding out I was in a relationship and seeing him. I immediately moved in with him and his family, and they took me in as their own. That was really the downfall of our relationship, as it was a lot to take on for 2 young people of this age, and my depression and anxiety really spearheaded. He was my absolute best friend before we together, so we were so sure it was going to work out, but instead, we ended up being really argumentative, aggressive, and he become shut off of being supportive due to my anxiety and depression constantly looming in the situation. 

We were on again/off again for years after this. At its worst, it did culminate in him becoming physically aggressive (but never hitting me) and I did attempt suicide by trying to take pills in my college dorm bathroom. He would get frustrated and put me down very harshly, and I couldn't take it. I developed almost a PTSD complex where I would relive the attempt, as well as self harm instances. I moved out of state, and away from him, for a while, but when I came back, we decided to try again. I was seeing a therapist and working at my mental health for the first time in my life and making progress.

At 23, when I was attempting a reconciliation, feeling like things had become stabilized between us and a lot of growth had gone down between us, and on his 25th birthday, he decided he didn't want to do this anymore. I spent my last 12 dollars on a gift for him (I'm a student living paycheck to paycheck) and brought it to his home, and tried to bake brownies to celebrate. He ignored me the entire night, and the next morning, decided to tell me that he wanted to end things again. I was distraught. I immediately enrolled in therapy and was prescribed antidepressants to deal with all that had happened. 3 weeks later, he decided he wanted to try again and take back what he said. I told him I couldn't do it, and that I needed to move on and date other people.  


Well, I did. And I ended up in a relationship with a 30M who is very inexperienced in the relationship department, but very kind hearted. This relationship I am in now is falling apart, as I am unable to teach a 30 y/o how to have a proper relationship (I am his first serious one), and I am fighting off these intrusive thoughts that I messed up the opportunity to make things right for the first time in my life with the one person I loved more than anything. I can't shake the thought of my ex. There was a lot of bad between us, but there was also so much good in between, and a strongly bonded friendship that I can't seem to ever replace. Everything reminds me of him. There are so many inside jokes and the ability to talk on a deeply personal, passionate level that I can't find in anyone else. I miss him so much.   


I know this sounds like an abusive situation. Even reading it, the relationship history is a mess and I shouldn't feel the way I do. But I do. I don't know how this is ever going to end, and I just want to stop hurting, but I can't. This is the loneliest I've felt in my life, and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm trapped. I can't make this one right.
