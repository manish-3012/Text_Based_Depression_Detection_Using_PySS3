I've been sitting here with no lights on, with no sounds, and I haven't eaten at all today...I've sat here for hours contemplating how I want to kill myself. Some ways more elaborate than others. Some of them just to end it and be done. I have so much going on inside of me I feel like i'm suffocating on thoughts and drowning on emotions. I can't think straight anymore. Nothing I once found interest in even sounds pleasing. I just spent almost 3,000$ to build a pair of gaming PC's and here I am trying to figure out a way to end it all....
