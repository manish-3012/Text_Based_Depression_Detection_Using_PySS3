NumbSitting here, going through the most traumatic time in my life and I can barely even cry. Maybe itâ€™s shock, maybe my mind and body know I canâ€™t handle the reality. All I know is that I feel numb and itâ€™s not right. 

There are so many people that say â€œlife is worth livingâ€ and â€œit takes time, but it gets betterâ€. Fuck time. All this has made me realize is that there is absolutely no point to anything. 

Iâ€™ve always had a reason to be here; thereâ€™s always been something or someone I felt guilty for leaving behind. Now, it doesnâ€™t matter what I say or who I talk to... I just genuinely donâ€™t care. There is no point, why stay when I am so unhappy? It may get better for you and I genuinely hope it does... Not for me, Iâ€™m done.
