Feel like giving upOkey so I'm an 22 yo guy who feel like there's no point in living anymore.

I have had periods throughout my life with depression but I have never felt this bad. I might do something stupid. 

I feel so goddamn useless I have no education, no friends, still a kissless virgin, still live with my parents and on top of that I've gotten acne all over my back and it starts bleeding evertime I sleep. 

My life is not worth much anyway, might as well die young.
