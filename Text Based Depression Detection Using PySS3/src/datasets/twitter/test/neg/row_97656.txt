Does anyone else love sleeping because you get either dreams or a sense of nothingness, both of which feel better than being awake?I sleep a lot. As much as I can.

Feels good to fade away and stop existing for a while.

When I have dreams I dream Iâ€™m a normal, happy person. I dreamed recently this girl I used to know was my girlfriend. She was having dinner at my place with my family. My parents looked so proud.

If I donâ€™t dream, the sense of oblivion is great too. 

Maybe thatâ€™s why I want to die so bad. Itâ€™s basically just sleeping forever.
