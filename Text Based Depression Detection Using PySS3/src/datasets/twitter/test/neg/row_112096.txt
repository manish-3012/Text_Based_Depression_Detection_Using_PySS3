PityFuck me. I'm the most useless piece of shit alive. No one cares. No one likes me. No one appreciates my company. It's never enough. I'm always just ruining everything I'm sorry. I just want a fucking friend and I cant have that. I'm so fucking lonely and I'm never going to not feel lonely because my fucked up head ruins everything i ever had or they hurt me. I swear there's something that makes me hurt me. Is it some conspiracy to get me abandoned. Something I fear so greatly. Are you all the same fucking group just looking to be my friend so you can leave I fucking hate how much I love people god
