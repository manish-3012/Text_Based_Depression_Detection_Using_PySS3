I just want to do drugs and be left alone til my body gives outI don't care ie I'm "capable of succeeding in any program or career path i chose". I know I can. I don't want to. It's too much effort and I'm tired. 

Please just leave me alone til my abused organs stop working. I won't stay a second longer, I won't take any recources from my community in a sad attempt at rehabilitation, I'll dispose of myself when the time comes. 

Please just leave me alone, I'm done.
