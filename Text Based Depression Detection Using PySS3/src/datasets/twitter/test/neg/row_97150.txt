Anyone feel completely alone? Feeling of hopelessness?Depression is nothing new to me, I lost my mother to cancer at age 15 and have been severely depressed ever since. I was to young back then to fully understand what I was feeling and believed that things will get better but they haven't. I'm now 23 and still feel dull towards life and people in general. I'm not close to any of my family. Not one. My mother was the only person that i've truly ever had. My social anxiety has killed any attempt at dating.. I try so hard to look good but the fear of rejection is overwhelming so its useless.  I care so much about what others think of me so I always have fear if I say or do something wrong.

With no future to look forward to and no past worth remembering, my life is essentially over. I don't believe there is anything someone can say to make me feel better but i'd welcome any attempt. 

 I'm just looking to see if anyone out there feels similar to me.
