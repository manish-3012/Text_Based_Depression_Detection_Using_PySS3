Waiting on HappinessAfter a particularly brutal winter, I realized I'm quite depressed. I'm a soon to be sophomore engineering student who just doesn't seem to understand why I should be alive. I'd certainly say I have a good life. I have parents who are generally good to me, kind friends, I'm attending a good private school, etc. Lately though, I'm just feeling worthless. I've been single for a while. I feel as unattractive as a person can feel. I feel like a worthless piece of shit for breaking my ex girlfriend's heart a few years prior. I don't like what I'm studying and feel like a sellout for pursuing a major that pays well. I play guitar and video games and an active in theater and radio, but none of these things give me joy any more. I'm sick of people telling me to go try something new, as I feel that if I was "just bored" I would actually have a desire to go do something. I haven't told anybody really what's going on because nothing they will say helps. My parents, as much as they generally are accepting of me, will just worry obsessively over me and my academic schedule doesn't afford me time to jump through all the hoops of depression treatment. I've been in therapy for a number of years for anxiety but even my therapist (who I respect and admire) has taken the stance of "oh you're just over stressing it'll all be fine." I'm not suicidal really, I don't think. I've certainly thought about how I might end my life but never actually wanted to go through with it. I'm just sick of people telling me that it gets better. I know it can get better. I've been extraordinarily happy at times in my life. I know it can happen. That doesn't make now any better. Telling a starving man "oh you'll get to eat eventually" doesn't help.
