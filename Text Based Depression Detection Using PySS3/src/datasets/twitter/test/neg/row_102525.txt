How do I ease the sadness or pain that my friends might (might not) feel when I'm gone?Recently a Japanese actor had recently passed due to suicide and some of my friends were big fans of him. They were devastated and I think they still feel pain and sadness until now. I don't know what will happen to them after I'm gone but I want to make sure they're happy after I'm gone. I've written my notes for them and I've made it light and funny. I don't know if I matter to them a lot but I just want to make sure!

(Edit) I forgot to mention my family does not matter much to me. I kinda understand that they are the root cause of my depression and they remind me of it every single day. I didn't leave a note for them and I don't intend to.
