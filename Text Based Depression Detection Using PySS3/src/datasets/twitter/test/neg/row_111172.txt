fuck all of thisI'm completely tired of my life and of my parents and want to fucking die, I'm just so tired of all of it, to the point where I take a bunch of drugs to forget how shitty I feel about myself. Everyone around me seems to be happy and I'm not at all. Every time I make progress I mess up and get shitted on for it, no matter how big or small. I want to move out but I'm still too young so theres no way. I don't want to fuck up my life. I just want to be happy again.
