My friend called me and told me he is committing suicide. I told him not to. What should i do.Basically he kept calling me giving me details of how close he was and why he is doing it.  Texted me pictures of him with part of his neck sliced.  I kept telling him dont do it shit will get better but he said no i am done!  Got off phone with him last night and this morning when i woke up i had text messages from him that he had a bunch of sleeping pills and relaxants and basically he said goodbye friend.  Tried calling and texting but he is not answering!
