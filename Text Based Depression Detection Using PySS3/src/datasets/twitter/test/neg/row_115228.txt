I have no reason.I have no reason to feel the way I do. 

I wasnâ€™t abused. I have no childhood trauma. I have a good life with good friends and family. I even have a future planned. 

But I cant help but think about myself dying. Myself not existing anymore. For me to take my last breath and not think about anything anymore. I fantasize different ways and different scenarios in my head on how Iâ€™m going to do it later on in the day, the week, the month.  I even feel like my death will be caused by my hands down the line. 

Sometimes I think that Iâ€™m still only here because of my lack of motivation and my guilt when I look back on how my family and friends will feel if I act on my impulse.
