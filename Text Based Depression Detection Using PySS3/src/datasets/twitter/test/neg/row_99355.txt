My entire life is fucked from every holeI can't even explain how bad my situation is right now. Things have taken a turn for the worse and I have no one to vent to. I have no one to talk to. I have never felt so alone as I do now.  
I can't believe this is my life and I can't change it. I can't do a goddamn thing. 
I'm worried sick day and night about my friend who is suicidal. 
She is all I have. The sad thing is I can't help her because the situation really is that bad. I can't even help myself. 
I have no direction, no support, no passion or purpose. I'm going to be poor for the rest of my life because I didn't go to college, and now I can't afford it. I don't even want to be anything. 
I've tried to get help, but I realize no one can solve my problems. No one can get me a job that pays livable wages. 
I really want to end it all tonight and not much is convincing me to stop myself.
