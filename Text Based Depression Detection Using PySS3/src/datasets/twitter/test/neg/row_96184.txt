This night just might take me with it...I'm unable to find work, I'm an outcast to my family, I have no friends, am a constant victim of bullying at school, and my girlfriend of 2 years just left me with no reasons given. I've attempted before and I'm trying my hardest not to hurt myself but what options do I have?... Please help...
