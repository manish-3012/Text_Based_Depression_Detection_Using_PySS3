Why canâ€™t suicide be easyI donâ€™t want to be here but idk how I would do it. Everything is complicated or painful but I guess death isnâ€™t necessarily supposed to be painless. And it would be such a burden on everyone having to find out and plan a funeral and all that stuff. That would really suck. And I might miss out on actually being happy some day. I guess itâ€™s good that thereâ€™s a lot of things keeping me from just killing myself. And my cat. No one would love my cat as much as I do. Idk why I typed this. Just need somewhere to spill my thoughts were maybe other people can relate I guess.
