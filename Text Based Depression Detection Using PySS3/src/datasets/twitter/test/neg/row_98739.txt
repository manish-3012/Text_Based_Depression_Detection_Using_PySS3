My family situation is making me suicidalI just don't know what to do anymore. So much is going on and I don't know if I can handle it anymore. My grandfather has dementia and severe health issues. I'm one of his caregivers. He's been getting worse and I don't know if I can handle watching him anymore. It hurts to see him like that. Then my sister and I found out that one of the others wasn't feeding or changing him. We told my mom, the person in charge, and she said she'd fire him. Then she decided not to because "he just made a mistake and deserves a second chance". He then started talking shit behind our back and got the other caregivers to turn against us because I almost called APS. He also went to my homophobic uncle and told him I was gay (I'm not) to turn him against me. Mom has been treating me and my sister like trash because of that stuff. She's accused us of trying to cause trouble and keeps berating us for trying to improve things. Also learned that my mom is racist, so my relationship with her is deteriorating. Also having issues with my dad and stepmom. They've been emotionally abusive and manipulative. All of this is making my mental health worse and I think about suicide every day. I don't know what to do anymore and I'm afraid to be alone because I've come close to self-harming again. I feel so alone and helpless.
