It's like I'm screaming but no one can hear me...I was dealing with depression since my mother died of cancer in 2014. No one in my family supported me during that time, neither did my school. They expected me to carry on with my life like nothing had happened. 


Since my mother passed away, I was dealing with emotional abuse from my grandmother, who was my legal guardian. I always hated her and always threatened to run away. But I was so scared of the consequences so I stayed trapped there. 


Over the years, I spent less and less time at home. I spent most of my time staying with friends at their homes. Eventually, it got to the point where I couldn't deal with living at home anymore. I was self harming most days and I would rarely eat or drink. 


Back in February, I finally plucked up the courage to leave. I just woke up one very early morning, packed up all my bags and left. 


Recently, I had been staying with my boyfriend (for just over a month) until randomly and completely unprovoked he said he didn't want me to stay there anymore. He knows I have no other place to live. 


In a few weeks time I'm going to be homeless. I've tried to seek help everywhere with housing and homeless services but they refused to help me. 


I only had 500 in my savings and I had to use all of that to rent a shared house for 4 weeks. This is my first week there and I'm so scared for the day I'm asked to leave. From 13th May I will be homeless, and see no reason to be alive at that point. 


I'm having suicidal thoughts everyday, I've been self harming and I stopped eating and drinking. I just don't want to exist anymore.
