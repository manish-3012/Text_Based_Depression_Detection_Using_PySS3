Vicious cycleA week and a half ago I was very close to suicide. Since then I've moved a bit further away from ending it but I am still unable to talk to or be around others. I just need to be alone and it seems so taxing on me to be in the presence of other people.  Even being in the same house as others is difficult. 

Because of all this I havent shared my close call with anybody in my life. 

What to do when it is so hard to interact/socialize with people but you experience loneliness.
