Feeling worse all the time. It's not that I want to die so much as I feel I have no relevance in the world and would prefer not to have to think or feel anymore. I don't want control over my life but I want independence. I just want someone to tell me what to do.The world feels indifferent to me. I feel I'm easily forgotten and dismissed, not out of disdain, just from lacking practical substance to offer anyone around me. Everyone's busy living their lives, I'm being left behind. I'm a curiosity at best and an annoyance at worst. I had a good conversation on here recently with a kind redditor, but like all good conversations, I feel it reached it's natural conclusion and I lament that it hasn't improved my state of mind or provided any insight into a meaningful direction I might take in my life. I crave stability and guidance that I don't think exists. I want to feel I belong somewhere or that I'm among people like me, or people who know how to mould me into a functional human being, but I can't say I've ever experienced something like that. I'll go to sleep tonight and have another bad dream, wake up tomorrow to face another meaningless day. I need to change but I fear the process. I don't want to be alone anymore but I don't want to impose myself on anyone. I feel no hope and my remaining dreams are too risky or unrealistic to consider. I hope for an unexpected death which is out of my control, so that no one can be upset with me or think me stupid for giving up on myself. Is it depression if you know why you feel the way you do?
