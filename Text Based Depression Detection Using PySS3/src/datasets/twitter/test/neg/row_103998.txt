I died and I'm living in hellDoes anybody else feel the same way? I feel like I died in 2017 because literally everything has been so fucking shit ever since. Shit just keeps happening and I (M,20) can't do this anymore, I've been dealing with depression, anxiety and panic attacks for almost 3 years now, I hate everything and I can't remember the last time I was happy, I dont even know if I've ever been happy. My parents are assholes who make me feel like shit everyday and the worse part is they don't even realize it, they think they are the perfect parents because they "gave me everything" fuck them, all they did was traumatize me for life.

My dad, who used to be my fucking hero is a fucking scumbag, who cheated for years, and now it's so hard for me to create a relationship with another person because I fear I will become like him. My mom its a fucking narcissistic b... who thinks she is absolutely perfect and what not, every fucking day she has to critizise me in some way and tell me how I do nothing, and how fucking useless I am. 

On top of my mental health problems I get terrible migraines every single day and I have terrible acne on my face to the point which I can't even look in the mirror. 

Killing myself have been something that's been in my mind for years, this time its different, it just feels like the rational thing to do.

I don't understand why I should keep living, I don't see the point, I honestly can't even imagine a future where I'm happy, and trust me that feeling it's fucking sad.

I try, trust me I do but its like I just can't have anything good, just one good thing, thats all I need.

I'm tired of this.

(This is messy as fuck and Im really sorry, I may or not have been crying before writing this, also english isn't my first language and I just needed to write something to release some of the anger and pain I have right now.)
