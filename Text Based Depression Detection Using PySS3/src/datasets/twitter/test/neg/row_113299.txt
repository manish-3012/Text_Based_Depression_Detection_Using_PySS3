What Should I Do?Last night, I had what most would call an existential crisis. Although, I do not think the term is used correctly, I think most of you know what I mean. I, admittedly, cried for a while due to the fact that I can get plunged into the afterlife, whatever it is. I want to use this knowledge as motivation to emerge myself into software development, more specifically game design. I do not know if I am afraid of failure or afraid that not being great at it will make me even more indecisive about my major. I guess what I am trying to say is that I might be more afraid of death and wasting my time but not enough to get me out of this cycle. I just need some time to work on this aspect of my life but it seems that school keeps throwing stuff at me. Seems like a pathetic excuse but it is true.
