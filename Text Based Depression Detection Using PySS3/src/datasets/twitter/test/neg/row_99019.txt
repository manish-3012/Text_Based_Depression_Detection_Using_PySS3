Why WOULDN'T I consider taking my own life when the rest of the world is going to sh*t?I can't hold down a job; can't go out for fun; can't travel; can't go see friends; the whole world is suffering, and thousands of people are dying. It really does feel like this is all there's left in life. Somebody please change my mind because death is starting to sound less painful than this...
