Being pushed to my limit.Im sick of waking up at 6AM to go to a school where i get punched, thrown in the head with stuff, isolated and fucking tortured by everybody i know there. Recently i had my 600 dollar phone stolen off of me that i worked my ass off for too. 

You may ask why i have to wake up at 6AM? Its mainly because i moved away from a school that i got dragged along the ground and belted till i was bleeding by a group of kids all a good portion older then me. 

I don't have any friends. And when i say that i mean it to the fullest extent. In the last 4 months I have had not one person come to my house to "hang out."

I try to socialise but everyone pushes me away and fucks around with me. I remember this one girl told me to come hang out with her and her mate so we met up and she started faking sick with her mate, i could see straight though how fake it was mainly because the fact they made me wait for them 30 minutes in their loungeroom til there brother tried to get them and there door was locked and light was off. 10 minutes she was on her story doing selfies and shit. 

Im getting driven to the limits. I love my life and i love going to do my hobbies but im not even able to enjoy them because work never gives me any shifts and im forced to make do with at the worst $40 every two weeks?

I dont think i can live like this much longer...
