I Have DecidedFor the next two weeks Iâ€™m on a trip with my husband and his family, but I have chosen to end my life as soon as we get back. I wanted to write this here because I donâ€™t want him, his family, or my family to know. Itâ€™s weird, but Iâ€™m more excited for when we get home than to actually continue the trip.
