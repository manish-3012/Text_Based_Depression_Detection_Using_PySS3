Getting fed upI fucking hate being alive. I hated my job so I decided to quit. Well I am about to start a different job and I am not looking forward to it. Also, now I am losing my health insurance. This was supposed to be for a positive mental change, but now I just feel like I self-sabotaged yet again. Four years out of college and I haven't made more than $20k in a single year (and won't again this year) and haven't used my degree to any effect, because I have a motivation problem and a people problem and I can't work around them. Now I can't even get therapy or medicine anymore. Drinking's the only thing I have left to keep me numb. I don't know what else to do anymore.
I'm going broke. If it gets to where I end up homeless I am just going to kill myself. I don't blame anyone else so, fuck me.
