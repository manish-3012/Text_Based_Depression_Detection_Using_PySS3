My friend told me â€œYouâ€™re making this about yourselfâ€ is that wrong?A couple of days ago, I had a friend of mine who was being sexually harassed. So ofc I told a teacher at my school to keep him safe and now he is safe. One of my good friends got so angry at me for telling that teacher bc I shouldnâ€™t have said nothing because he didnâ€™t want to have nothing said. However, if I didnâ€™t say nothing and he got rapped i would never forgive myself. So I had told this friend that was mad at me that i have been feeling very depressed and I wanna die and I feel like I mess up everything even when I try to do the right thing. I asked if i can talk to to him privately and he said â€œWell alongs if she is in the call then im not saying nothing ðŸ¤·ðŸ½â€â™‚ï¸â€ Basically saying our other friends need to be there or he not saying a damn thing. Naturally I was very very mad. To which i said â€œAre you seriousâ€ and he said â€œVery much ðŸ™‚â€ He then said i was making this about myself. By that point i broke down. The fact the somebody i knew since the 2nd grade could care less, it was so upsetting and made me at that moment really wanna do it.
