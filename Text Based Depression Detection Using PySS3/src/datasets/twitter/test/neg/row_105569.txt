helpI canâ€™t. I canâ€™t kill myself but I canâ€™t stay alive. I canâ€™t be happy every time I try. Every time I give my heart to someone they shatter it. I end up in my room hoping I find someone to love me. And all I ever hear is â€œ it gets betterâ€ but I donâ€™t live in your magical wonderland where I have a wife and kids. I live in this time, where I cry myself to sleep every night. I live in this time, where I am so unloved but if I die people will be crushed. I just... I need help. I canâ€™t keep going like this
