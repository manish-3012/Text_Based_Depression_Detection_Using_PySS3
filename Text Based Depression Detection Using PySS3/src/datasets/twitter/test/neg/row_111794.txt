Iâ€™m inches away.My anxiety and depression has be numb. I cry or feel nothing. Days are good for only a few hours and then itâ€™s ripped away. Iâ€™m failing at work. I cried in front of them and apologized for being such a burden. My boyfriend is wearing thin. He doesnâ€™t know how to handle this. I donâ€™t blame him. Iâ€™m so alone. I wish I knew a quick easy way to end it. Whatâ€™s the fucking point anymore.
