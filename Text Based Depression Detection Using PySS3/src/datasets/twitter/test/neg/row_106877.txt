Iâ€™ve made up my mind to commit suicide sometime around this month, but Iâ€™m scaredHonestly, Iâ€™m just tired of trying. 

For the past year, all Iâ€™ve been able to think about is killing myself. Before I know it, Iâ€™d be looking up painless ways to die and places where I can kill myself. Heck, Iâ€™ve even found myself crossing a red light on purpose.

I have no one to talk to about this. I guess itâ€™s obvious, since else, I wouldnâ€™t be writing here. I just smile all the fucking time, saying â€œIâ€™m fine.â€ But smiling all the time is really hard, and all Iâ€™d be able to do alone is to cry. 

Iâ€™ve already written a letter for those who are dear to me. All thatâ€™s left to do is to do it, but there is a part of me thatâ€™s scared to die. I donâ€™t even know why, since living is so hard already. 

I hope that when I kill myself, it wonâ€™t hurt as much as living does.
