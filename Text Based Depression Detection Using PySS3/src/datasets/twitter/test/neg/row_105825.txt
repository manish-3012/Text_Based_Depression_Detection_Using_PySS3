I feel like my life is never going to get betterI guess I mean that it won't \*stay\* better. I am bipolar and my meds have been working well for so long but they completely failed recently. I had a horrible months long depression. I think I'm still in it, but I have more energy now. I will never get over this disease. It's only a matter of time until my meds fail again and I can barely get out of bed. I HATE looking over my shoulder all the time waiting for the other shoe to drop. How am I supposed to have a life when I know everything will be destroyed by this? What is the point? The highs are not worth the lows. They're aren't. And my family.. fuck my family. They don't love me. They never have. It sounds like classic suicidal thoughts that no one loves or cares, but they have told me that they don't care. My mother called me a selfish monster. My dad told me that he gave up on me. 

I was doing so well for so long. I was dumb enough to think that I was better, that things would be better now. But here I am again. So low, so alone. Why bother
