Do you think there's life after death?I just want to die. Talking won't improve my situation so please recommend me a really good way to die. A peaceful and not so dull way. If I don't die soon I'll be suffering greatly. 

I think drowning is the best way. Jump from a small cliff to the water below. Then drown. Swim deep into the water body. It'll be beautiful. The only thing I'm scared of us afterlife. What of I go to hell? I prefer nothingness after death.
