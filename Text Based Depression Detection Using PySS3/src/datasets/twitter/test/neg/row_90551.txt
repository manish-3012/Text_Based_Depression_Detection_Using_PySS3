Canâ€™t talk about suicide irlHi. 

Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for a long time. Theyâ€™ve been very bad recently. I reckon Iâ€™m fairly close to booking my ticket to hell and taking a few deserving people with me. 

I have a â€œsupport workerâ€ (Ive been in a bad place for a while). We had a chat tonight while I was kinda drunk. I think she knew what was coming as she told me that if I told her anything that was â€œa concernâ€ sheâ€™d have to report it to The Man. Fuck this. Just listen to me ffs. 

Whole system is fucked. If I told anyone what I really thought theyâ€™d lock me up and throw away the key. So I just need to pretend things are ok and never really get help until I go completely mental? Brilliant system. 

Brb. Gonna go get drunk as fuck and pass out. Peace.
