Dreamt I was being huggedJust woke up and I remembered, the dream I had. Someone was hugging me. Ugh, this painful lonlines I have created myself, I have literalry no one in my life. Its like I don't even exist. I feel like end of the line is real close, I hope it is so I won't be able to feel any of this anymore.
