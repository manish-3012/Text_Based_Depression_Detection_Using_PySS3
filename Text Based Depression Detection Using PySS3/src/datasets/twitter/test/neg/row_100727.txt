ComplicationsI'm hit with depression every once in a while. I'll be fine for a week, two or maybe even more in a row, then just get hit with a huge wave of depression. Usually I end up crying with anger, and have suicidal thoughts, I'm sick of dealing with this because I know there are people who would hate to see me this way.

I'm looking for ways to combat this, however I refuse to use medication, and therapists just tell you to exercise and take prescribed meds, then steal your money. Any tips on how to make life better? More enjoyable?
