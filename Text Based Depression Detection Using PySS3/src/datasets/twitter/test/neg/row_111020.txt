I just want to feel okay with wanting to commit suicideI don't want to have that nagging voice that says "don't do it". It's always wrong. I genuinely feel like I would be happier dying and not having to deal with the bullshit of the world, but I can't just 'try' to commit suicide. I either need to be successful or not try at all. I couldn't handle living with serious damage from an unsuccessful attempt. How can I make myself okay with going through with it?
