being alone makes me wanna diei'm 19,  never been in a relationship, never held hands with anyone. never had physical contact with anyone. 
all i do is work and then sit in my room alone. no one even bothers.
i just want to find my other half...or at least find someone who actually wants to stick around and understand me.
i don't understand why i'm so alone. i'm not that terrible of a person. everyday i ask myself why things are like this and i still haven't found an answer.
i'm tired of this crippling loneliness and i'm tired of being overlooked, outcasted, ignored.....if someone doesn't come around by the end of the summer then i'm killing myself. i'm tired of waiting. i don't care anymore
