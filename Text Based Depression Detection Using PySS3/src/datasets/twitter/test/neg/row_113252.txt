My life is hopelessI don't see the point anymore. 
After things looked like they were going a little bit uphill everything is now way worse than before. 
The girl I love is slowly cutting contact with me and it tears me up inside. 
I wake up everyday wishing it was already night so I could go to sleep again. Eternal sleep would be the best.
Sleeping isn't easy either. I can fall asleep quite fast, but always wake up around 5:30 AM, sweat-drenched with an anxiety attack. The same happens about 4 hours later, but after that I'm not able to go to sleep again. After waking up I have no motivation to actually do anything.
I should be doing stuff for school (currently on holidays) but that's not possible because I can't focus and feel too stressed. But when I do stuff I tend to enjoy I just feel empty. I just sit around doing nothing for 12 hours a day. It gets to the point where it's starting to drive me crazy. 
And when I'm meeting with friends I'm not feeling any different, except for the fact that keeping this mask of well being drains my non-existing energy even quicker.

I have no goals or hopes for the future. Right now my life is an endless cycle of despair that I can't escape. Alcohol, cigarrettes and coffee help me a bit but I don't want to create another problem so I stay kinda distanced from the first two.
