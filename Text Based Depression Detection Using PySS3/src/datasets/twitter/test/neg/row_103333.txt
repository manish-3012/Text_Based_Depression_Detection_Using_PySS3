Undead.I died a long time ago if I really think about it, my mind was just late to its appointment with the afterlife. Life is passion. It's laughter and crying, happiness and sadness. It's love, it's hate, it's joy, fun, pain, despair... Friends, family. I only experience half of it.

I exist, not live, an undead stuck walking between paths in a place no one belongs. No one ever meets you in the in-between place, every day you leave the dead behind and the living overtake you. Occassionally a kind soul will slow down and hold your hand, they try to pull you along but you're too heavy so you let them go before you drag them down. Then you get to watch them run, their faded silhouette in the distance joined by other faded silhouettes, smiling and laughing as they dissappear into the fog together.

I'm tired. Too tired to run, too tired for a light jog or a brisk stride, too tired for doctors appointments and messages to friends. Too tired for paracetamol, too tired to pick up a knife, too tired to hang from the ceiling or find a bridge to jump from. 

A merciful God would let me join the dead, sparing me the pain of observing the living, of watching their beautiful laughter as I rot alone on my path.
