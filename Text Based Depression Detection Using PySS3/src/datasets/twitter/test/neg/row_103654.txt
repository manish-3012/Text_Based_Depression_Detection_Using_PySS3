Ending it right after christmasI have suffered from acne and rosacea and Seb derm for 10 years. Tried everything and it has destroyed my face.. of course. Two rounds of accutane, numerous antibiotics, IPL, birth contol.. I'm an idiot.


All the stress from my appearance has now caused hypothyroidism. My body couldn't handle the pain I was in.. no one in my family have it and one year ago my thyroid levels were normal.. it's been the most stressful year.. it's all my own fault.

The hypothyroidism has made me gain 7 kg and lose all my hair. Now I can't even reminder why I was so upset about my skin.. this is much worse.

I can't stand to live another day. Had to quit school and job because of my appearance..

I'm isolating myself..

I have tried all antidepressants.. doesn't help.. inside I'm a happy girl but I can't look past this

I Blame myself for everything. So many stupid doctors and so many stupid desicions..

My body is ruined and my face is ruined

My friends are getting degrees and having babies. And im just their depressed, awkvard friend getting no where.. 

Goodbye

25/F
