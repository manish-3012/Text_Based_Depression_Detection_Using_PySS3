Iâ€™m so doneIâ€™m so done with everything Iâ€™m so tired of living and earlier I was thinking oh I said goodbye to my uncle and my family so I could just do it and they wouldnâ€™t care and then I talked to my brother and told him everything about how I hate myself and he was supportive and talked to me while I was crying I love him so much he is the best brother out there when we were little he would help me when I was crying while my parents were yelling at each other he has been with me every step of the way I probably wouldnâ€™t be here if I hadnâ€™t talked to him
