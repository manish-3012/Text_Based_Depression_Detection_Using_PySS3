I don't want to live anymore. It's all I can think of and I don't know how to make it stop.It's a thought that is constantly in my mind. It's always present. All I feel is sadness and emptiness. I want it all to end and also not. The strange thing is even though all I can think about is that I don't want to live anymore, there's nothing I fear more than death. It's been like this for all my life. I am terribly afraid of dying yet I don't want to live either. Sometimes I think my mind confuses living and suffering. I think maybe I don't really want to die, maybe I just don't want to suffer anymore and since my whole life was nothing but suffering... to end my life seems to be the only option to end the suffering. Even though I actually don't want to die. It's unbearable.
