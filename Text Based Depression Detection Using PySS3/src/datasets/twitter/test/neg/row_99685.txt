I just want to hit the reset button on life.Today I looked at my brother's Wii, and saw a reset button. I didn't think anymore about it until like 15 minutes ago and realized I would fucking love to just hit the reset button on life like my brother will do on his animal crossing game. IDK, I'm  high rn, and just kinda wanna die, thinking about starving myself to death. Also thank God for autocorrect. Life saver. Not literally or any thing. Am I the only one who gets depressed as shit at night. I can distract my self during the day, but at night I can't cause sleep disorder. Fucking sucks. Anyways, this is just a shit post cause I'm trying to put my thought in order. Bye
