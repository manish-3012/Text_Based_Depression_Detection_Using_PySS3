No Motivation and Dark ThoughtsFor the past year I've had nothing but thoughts of I dont belong in this world. I recently got out of the military after 6 years and was barely a cop for a year but quit due to conflicts with my schedule with my education. I used to be full of energy, I used to love working out and lifting weights, now im just plagued with injuries and dealing with chronic depression from college and looking for a job in this pandemic. I feel like a failure, I feel like a burden to everyone around me. All I do now is lay down in my bed on my phone or do school work. I have 2 and a half years before I complete my degree to become a physical therapist assistant and im losing my drive to just even exist on this planet. Every day is a struggle to accomplish something, I am to the point where I feel I'll take that step and eat a bullet but im afraid of the end result for my family.
