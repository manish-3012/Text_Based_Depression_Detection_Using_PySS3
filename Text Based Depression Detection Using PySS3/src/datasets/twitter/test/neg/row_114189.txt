Does anyone else get tired of pretending?Does anyone else get tired of pretending that they are ok?

I feel like my depression is like lava in a volcano that bubbles up each day, but will then simmer back down. But it's starting point is a little higher everyday and one day I won't be able to make it simmer back down.

Yesterday I woke up, and thought through some plans about how to end things. Where I would go, what time, what it would be like. Then I sobbed on the bathroom floor for a while about how my life had come to this.

Then I did a workout, showered, and my partner came home and I carried on as normal. He has no idea about any of this, no one does. He mentioned my eyes looked puffy but I said it was allergies.

My feelings bubble up everyday until they're at the surface, and then I will reset and start again the next day. I feel like I could explode and I'm leading a double life.

It seems like a lot of these posts go unanswered, but I'd love to know if anyone can relate to pretending and how exhausting it is.

And the feeling of resetting everyday, but also feeling like the reset button gets weaker each time.

And the worry of what people would think if they found out that you felt like this and what you planned to do.
