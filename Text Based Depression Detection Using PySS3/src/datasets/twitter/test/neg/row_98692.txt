I'm so lonelyI've had suicidal thoughts ever single day since me and my SO "broke up" or just stopped being a couple, we weren't even a "real" couple to begin with. we just really loved each other. i still do and he doesn't. it's not his fault. i think it's mine, but he said it's because of his BPD. 

we are still best friends and we see/text/talk nearly every day. but i just can't stop thinking about the time we had a year ago, i just can't accept that it's never coming back. i crave the physical attention so much, i feel so fucking lonely and miserable and it gets worse every. single. day. 

he is the first person i think of when i wake up and the last one when i fall asleep. i keep dreaming about the time we spent together and waking up crying me eyes out. i can't take this anymore. 

he was the first person in my life who showed me genuine love and who genuinely liked me for who i am. nothing is his fault, I'm trying to convince myself that it's not my fault either, it's our mental illnesses that make both our lifes hell. i just want to be with him again, physically and emotionally. please. 

I'm so lonely.
