Ignore this it's just me venting for a long time don't waste your time reading this !I think I'm about to go over the edge , I've finally got away from my dad , not before he called me a not very nice word for a gay person a lot of times and then I found out I may need to take legal action (this is all happening a month after I stopped self harming myself) and in the middle of all this my bf dumped me I know it isn't that bad but I just felt really down and I needed to get it all out there... I've been through this type of thing before and it nearly wine the really bad last time
