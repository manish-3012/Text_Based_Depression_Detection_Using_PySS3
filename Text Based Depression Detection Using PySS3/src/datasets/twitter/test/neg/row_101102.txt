SuicideBasically Iâ€™m having a lot of problems and Iâ€™ve been suicidal Iâ€™ve been admitted to a hospital twice already but my mom still thinks Iâ€™m â€œplaying a gameâ€ which Iâ€™m not and the fact that sheâ€™s not supporting me through this is literally hurting me. Every time I try to explain she just gets mad and says stop with the stupid bs etc.. I just donâ€™t think she can support me.  I just wanna die and I have been trying for the last couple of days drinking poisonous items I hope it works
