Intolerable anxiety and self criticismI'm a self destructive person. I "don't love myself" and I have experienced dysthymia for 15 years which has worn me down day after day. Sometimes I think everything is going good, but often I'm just distracting myself from something I'm stressed or sad about. In this way I experience alternating times of either crippling anxiety, where the full weight of existence bears down on me and I struggle to accept the reality of transient animal existence (nihilism), or I dissociate and get lost in all of the distractions other people do in society. Unfortunately I never fully click with the distractions, I'm always slightly removed. The fact that I think of social interactions and society in general as a "distraction" speaks volumes to the level of depression I consider normal. 

Anyway, I was just divorced after years of marriage. Turns out my wife had undiagnosed borderline pd and I was too naive and self absorbed to realize it. Even though I was caring af (codependent) she discarded me like trash in the end and now I'm all alone again having to face the emptiness and terror of being by myself. Not that I didn't have it coming, but it was still so cruel the way she left, and hard to understand. It's much harder to numb the pain and anxiety now. Social situations go okay because I get drunk, but then I'll spend the next week recoiling in horror at things I did or said that I think were embarrassing or insensitive/douchey and make me look bad. It's like a movie reel of my biggest fuckups constantly going in my head. I have seriously awful social anxiety which is compounded by what I suspect to be a mild case of aspergers or just plain social retardation idk. I have extremely negative self talk, calling myself a loser or a piece of shit or even saying I should kill myself (not voices, mind you, but rather thoughts). This didn't used to be much of a problem but it's gotten much worse since my wife left. My two friends are ok but they don't really get it and aren't much support. It doesn't help that I'm so fucking emotionally distant. I feel like I'm trapped in my isolated subjective experience of life (my brain), everyone else is too, and we're all so self involved that we really never can know what each other is going through. It's lonely as fuck and scary realizing *I'm* the only intimate contact I will ever truly have. Being stuck with myself is a nightmare at the moment because I'm so cruel to myself and anxious.

I have thought in great detail about ways to kill myself, and I think I will try and make it look like an accident to spare my family some pain. Maybe go "swimming" at the beach at night drunk, or something similar. On the other hand, I'm so afraid of death that I worry I'll never go through with it, and I will be stuck in this waking nightmare of anxiety, loneliness, and self critique for the rest of my life. All I can really do is numb the pain of my losses with alcohol and other drugs, but they just make it worse once they wear off. I'm left wondering wtf I've done and why I'm so self destructive and braindead, which in turn causes even worse self criticism and negative self talk. So likely what will happen is that some night I'll be pretty high on opiates and/or alcohol and I'll lose these fears and will feel like why the fuck care? And I'll take some more opiates and xanax and then that will be it. I'm not planning this, I just completely see it happening sometime in the next couple of months because that's where I am right now and I don't see anything changing it. 

I've thought of cashing in my savings and flying out to Cambodia, buying a motorcycle and just going around not really giving much of a fuck about anything; getting drunk, having prostitutes, eating a bunch of curry and fresh fruit, having philosophical conversations with traveling swedes and australians. That sounds like fun, but it also sounds stupid as fuck. I could do a bunch of activities to feel better, but I'd just be running away from my problems (myself) again and it won't make anything better. I'm just stuck and it feels like there's no way out.
