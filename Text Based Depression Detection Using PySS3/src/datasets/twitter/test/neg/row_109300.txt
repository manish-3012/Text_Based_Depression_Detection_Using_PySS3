It's my birthday and I'm alone and heartbrokenI'm 30 today. And I'm completely alone in the dark right now. I have cried so much that I can't breathe. My boyfriend has cheated on me for the last year and a half and I always believed he would change and things would be different like he promised but I'm just so stupid. It's my birthday and he's not here. Phone is off. No word in two days. I feel so stupid and hopeless and broken. I'm in so much unbelievable pain and I'm so completely crushed and humiliated and heartbroken. I just can't handle it anymore.
