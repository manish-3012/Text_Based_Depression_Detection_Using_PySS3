I am done with life.Sorry if i have bad english.

I am 15 years old and i just can't take it anymore, school is just fucking it up for me, i have no motivation to do anything, i don't care about my future, i just want to end it.

My parents are also very annoying if i do something wrong they get really mad and take all my stuff and say i need to be "normal" and they want me to do good at school but i just don't want to because what is the point of life, at the end we just die so why can't i just speed it up so i don't feel the pain anymore.
