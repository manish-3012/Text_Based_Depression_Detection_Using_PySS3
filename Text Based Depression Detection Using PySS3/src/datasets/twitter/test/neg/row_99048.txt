I didnâ€™t know where else to go for advice...There is an online friend (we donâ€™t talk much but I consider her my friend) who is planning on committing suicide. Sheâ€™s been counting down the days and right now there is only 11 more days until she does it. From the information that I have she doesnâ€™t seem to have a good home life. Her mother being one of the main reasons I believe. 

 She said, â€œEveryone who has tried to help me has wasted their time and failed. One by one. And Iâ€™m not bothered to watch people try.â€ ,And â€œNo point in reconsidering anything. Someone told me to do it. People have tempted me to do it. And my best friend broke me.â€

I donâ€™t know what to do... she wonâ€™t listen to me or anyone. I really do want to help her.
