I feel torn between killing myself and staying alive for my familytrigger warning? I guess?? Iâ€™m not sure how it works here.

I donâ€™t really know what to say. I just need to rant and type something. My mental health has been on a decline for years and life just feels so painful that it feels intolerable. I dread every new day that comes. I think about death constantly, and I have spent a huge amount of my days â€œresearchingâ€ my own death, thinking up the most ideal methods, what would be the least painful and most effective, easiest and most convenient, easier on my family when they find me.. and the thing is I know that I want to die, that my life is not worth living and that I feel so much pain that only gets worse and worse and worse. Medication and therapy has never helped, in fact it just makes me feel more hopeless knowing that even when I try to do the right things that they donâ€™t work. 

The hard part is, and basically the sole reason why I havenâ€™t killed myself yet, is that I know that my mother would be devastated. She is the only person in my family I speak to. I know my other family would likely be somewhat upset, because death in general is hard to deal with, but I canâ€™t imagine that when I die my mother wonâ€™t be utterly heartbroken, and I truly canâ€™t deal with the guilt of knowing that. I know that if I were never born she would likely be a happier and better person. But I canâ€™t reconcile the fact in my own head that she will feel guilty when I die. I am almost angry at her at this point. I know itâ€™s unjust, and stupid, but I resent that I love her and that she cares about me so much. I know itâ€™s fucked up. I hate that I feel obligated to her. Maybe if she knew how I felt she wouldnâ€™t be so upset when it happens. Iâ€™ve debated recently whether I should change plans and make it look like an accidental drug overdose. I think it is easier on people to see it as an accident, hopefully. 

Iâ€™m not really sure if what I said is coherent, it is really just what runs through my head constantly on a daily basis. I feel torn between every part of me convincing myself that I have to kill myself, and the extreme guilt and shame I feel for my mother and leaving her to deal with the aftermath of it. I argue to myself that I wonâ€™t know it, I wonâ€™t know anything anymore, i will feel nothing whatsoever and I will not be, but the part of me that is stuck in the present feels that guilt and shame so heavily. I feel safe, I guess, I feel that this one reason holds me back. But it is actually the only reason I can come up with so it feels so significant but also too flimsy to be enough.
