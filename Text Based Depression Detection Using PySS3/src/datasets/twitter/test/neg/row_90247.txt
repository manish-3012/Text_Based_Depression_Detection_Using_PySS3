I come here because I need someone who understands to listen to me.My life was great, I never had friends, I had games and family.
Then I gained friends, had relationships and every bad aspect that's ever come from sticks with me, yet I forget the good stuff.

I just smile everyday and push everything away like I'm totally fine, and I believe that I am.
But then, I feel like somethings holding me down, constricting me telling me the more I'm constricted the happier I get. Then its gets tighter and tighter everytime just so I can stay happy. But (Excuse the metaphors) but I think the straps are finally coming lose.
And now, the real part of me is showing. 
All I do is wonder the streets looking for prosperity. I search through the internet to find a video I can laugh at, and I talk to people I believe can help.
But its prolonging the inevitable. It just feels like there's a clock somewhere, and the times almost up.
