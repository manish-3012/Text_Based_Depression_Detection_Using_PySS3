I'm scared my OCD is back again and won't go awayI have depression and anxiety and that already makes me have suicidal thoughts. I used to have OCD as well but I stopped getting obsessions a year ago. And today I'm starting to show traits again and they are also different intrusive thoughts. I know it's not me who's thinking this but I can't help to still feel like I'm an awful person. I know me panicking like this won't help. I don't want OCD. I'm terrified and I feel so trapped
