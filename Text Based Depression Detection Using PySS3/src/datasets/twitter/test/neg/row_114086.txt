I'm so tiredI'm exhausted, gents. It's the kind of tired sleep won't fix, but you all know that. Everyday is a burden and everyone is a millstone around my neck. I think a lot of people post here because they're confused and upset. I'm neither. I've done unforgivable things during my time in this mortal coil. Most soldiers do. 

I don't think I'll be checking out tonight. But I've already come to terms with it for when I do. Sort of like when you have a 1/2 tank of gas: "I'll get it taken care of tomorrow!"

I guess that's where I'm at. I'm a man nestled into a guillotine waiting for the blade to fall, and I'm holding the string.

What kind of foul society do we live in that creates such people?
