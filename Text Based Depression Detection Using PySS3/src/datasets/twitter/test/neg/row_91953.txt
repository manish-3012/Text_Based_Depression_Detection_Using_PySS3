I must dieI have come to the realization that there is nothing left for me in this life. I had always hated school, dropped out of college as a result. All I'm qualified to do is shitty, low paying work. Even if I graduated college, all I have to look forward to is a shitty job for a higher salary, for the next 40 years. I'm 25 and still living with my parents because I will never be able to afford to move out. I know I'm a disappointment to my parents, though they won't admit it. All I do in my spare time is watch TV or play video games. They actually help distract me from my dark thoughts, but they've rendered me useless at the same time. I have been negligent with my physical health, and it shows, as I've developed diabetes and other issues over the years. I always told myself that I would never live with the consequences of my lifestyle choices, and that I would kill myself when it got to that point. Obviously I'm too much of a coward, as I sit here writing this. I've tried many different medications and therapists, to no avail. I believe I can't be helped anymore. My psychiatrist told me I could just collect welfare and watch TV all day. This just confirms in my mind that I'm at the end of the road. I've hated myself and my life for years, tried to change things, but still stuck in this rut. I have reached that point in my life where I'm very fed up and I'm done trying. They say never give up, but I say fuck that bullshit. Some people are never meant to live a happy life. It's finally time to start preparing for my death. Nobody will miss me, and nobody is probably reading this useless rant.
