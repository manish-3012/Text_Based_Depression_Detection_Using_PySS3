Actively suicidal, but worried I am going to do something stupid and fail. How to prevent doing something impulsive? Can someone talk to me pleaseI've had a mental health relapse. On top of all my other problems and illnesses I cannot cope. I think about suicide for most of the day. 
Recently I have been making excuses to go out in my car, and have been looking for places to do it.  I have a couple of spots. Not going to discuss methods, but I something that should do the job very effectively, or get me in a shit load of trouble if I fail. I cannot tell my family about what I am planning.

My state of mind is not good and I am concerned I am going to do something that may land me in the mental hospital if I mess it up. I will die before being locked up.

I'm not asking for reasons to live or anything like that, but I'd really like some advice on how to avoid doing something impulsive.
Thanks.
