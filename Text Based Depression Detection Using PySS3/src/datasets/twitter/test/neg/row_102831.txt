maybe i'm going to always be this wayrecently i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and i'm honestly just at a loss. the diagnosis seems to fit my symptoms (repeated suicidal ideation, alternating moods, not a lot of medications work, chaotic relationships, etc), however, the therapy required to treat borderline (DBT) hasn't really helped a lot either (i tried it for about 3 months while in residential) and only seems to have minor short term effects and is frustrating for me to continue doing because i feel that it only has a small impact in my recovery. the only thing i find helpful for me is using marijuana, however it is not legal in my state or for my age. with marijuana i often find a balance of mind and i just don't get high, i actually feel pretty average and i have the ability to feel a larger variety of emotions than i normally do. i haven't smoked in months though. 

i normally feel suicidal and i'm tired of it. however, my life just isn't getting any better. i just feel like death is the solution and if i live, i'm never gonna get better. no matter what road i take, i'm never gonna make it to 21.
