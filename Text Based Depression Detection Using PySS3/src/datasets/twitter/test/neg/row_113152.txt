Why I attempted: guilt after ex attempted suicideI posted on here before about my recent attempt and dealing with the shame and aftermath, and Iâ€™m ready to share with you guys my reasons because one of them is something I feel like isnâ€™t talked about.



I have bipolar disorder and ADHD, and struggle with RSD (rejection sensitivity disorder) due to the ADHD. Over the years medication and therapy got me to a somewhat stable place but I think I mostly felt numb.



I was in a toxic relationship for 3 years with someone who abuses drugs. All kinds - coke, Xanax, heroin, literally anything and I love this man so much, but on drugs heâ€™s a different person. The constant high and lows took a toll on me. I felt isolated and I couldnâ€™t even bring him around my friends or family without worrying about him getting high and embarrassing me. He smoked meth in front of my younger sister so I eventually cracked. I broke up with him and told him I would be moving out. Later that night he attempted to overdose on Xanax and heroin and was sent to a psychiatric hospital and then to rehab, havenâ€™t been able to talk to him.



I feel like the guilt was eating at me. He blamed me, his family blamed me, I felt like a terrible person. My best friend of 10 years who was my major support system dropped me a few days later because her boyfriend admitted an attraction to me and she resents me now. So she unfriended me and he blocked me. It was just so sudden and I was so confused why she would act this way. She knew I was going through a lot with my ex just attempting suicide, and thought this petty issue was worth dropping me for. It was just so insensitive.



I reached out to another friend who I admittedly have an attraction to but it was long distance and we couldnâ€™t ever make it work. So we agreed on staying friends. He actually convinced me to break up with my boyfriend and leave my toxic relationship but now I donâ€™t even know if it was for the right reasons or he just wanted something from me. Either way, he was super affectionate with me telling me I was beautiful and it wasnâ€™t my fault and that he would come see me to keep me company. I was in a fragile state after losing the 2 closest people in my life. I reached out for help when I lost my best friend and he didnâ€™t answer. I waited 2 days and then asked why he was leaving me on seen and then he told me he was just trying to live his life and blocked me on everything. So now another person had cut me off and made me feel like I was a huge annoying inconvenience. 


I felt like everyone hated me. I posted something on social media and people were coming at me and leaving me hate comments. I normally wouldnâ€™t let something like this get to me but it came from the heart and I was feeling very sensitive and hate was the last thing I needed in that moment.


I tried to overdose. I posted on my social media it would be my last, and that it was always my intention to love these people and not hurt them but I felt like I was just tossed away like trash by the people I cared about the most. Someone left comments making fun of me for attention seeking or killing myself over a Facebook post. But someone called for me. Actually, multiple people did. I had over 200 messages from people concerned about me. When I saw this after my ER discharge I felt stupid that I let 3 people in my life get to me when there were so many people who cared.


Losing people you care about is hard, especially if theyâ€™re your closest support system. But the guilt of someone trying to kill themselves because of you, whether they succeed or not is overwhelming. I didnâ€™t get the help I needed because I gave up after reaching out to 2 people. Please donâ€™t give up. Someone will listen. Iâ€™ll listen. I canâ€™t say itâ€™s easy when a partner is this unstable and will threaten or actually commit suicide over you. Iâ€™m still learning how to cope with it.
