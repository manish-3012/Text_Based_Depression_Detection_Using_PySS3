Too scared to dieI want to kill myself but Iâ€™m too scared. I wish I had a button I could press that would instantly take me out of this world. Iâ€™ve done so much research on ways to die but even the less painless methods scare me. I tell myself Iâ€™ll do it but the moment I have the pills in my hand or the noose around my neck I. Just. Canâ€™t. Do. It. Iâ€™m not scared of death Iâ€™m scared of being in pain or failing.
