Update: Today is the dayYesterday I made a [post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/7pezw1/ive_failed_my_exams/) about failing my exams, today I had a meeting with the board of the medical school and was told I had the worst performance in the whole cohort, I was told I failed a few other things and that I'm on the verge of getting kicked out. I still haven't told my parents and I've been ignoring their calls, I'm officially ending it tonight, I'm beyond getting any help, I've been depressed for years and living is a struggle, I'm done, I'm drained, it's time for this to come to an end. Thanks for your help SW community over the past year.
