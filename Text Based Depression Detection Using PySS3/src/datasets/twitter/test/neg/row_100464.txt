Should I break up with my gf over political differences? She's the only thing keeping me alive but...It's getting really annoying and I'm starting to see that any Democrat is truly the enemy. I've been harassed by liberals on campus about my point of view and I'm starting to despise them all. It just sucks that I'm fucking suicidal and can't defeat these scumbags.
