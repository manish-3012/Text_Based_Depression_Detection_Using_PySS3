At the end of my witsI don't want to carry on anymore. I have found myself with a bottle of pills several times the last couple of days, but I haven't done anything. Yet. I'm afraid though that I'll find myself again with the pills and actually do something. I don't know what to do. I've told a friend, and called a hotline but I didn't find either one to be helpful. I don't want to go to the hospital because I was just there a few weeks ago and was admitted. I don't know what to do. Any suggestions would be helpful.
