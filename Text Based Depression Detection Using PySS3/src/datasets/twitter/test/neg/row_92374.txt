The urge to jumpI donâ€™t think i am in extreme emotional pain right now but the urge to just climb out the window is looming. It wonâ€™t leave. I feel like i am dreaming and jumping seems to be one way to wake up. To wake up from this... life. I am going to graduate college despite all those shit i have been through, they still let me to attend the final presentation, guess that and the idea of approaching the end of college has its toll on me. I am scared. I canâ€™t breathe. Just ranting. I am sure if i should post here. Not an emergency. I have been suicidal for a good while. Have to fight with the urges and hope i get through this, but still canâ€™t shake the idea of me just giving up and do it, deep down i feel like that is how i must end.
