I'm doneTried to kill myself last year ended up in ICU for my trouble (thank God for Canadian health care). Had foot surgery a month ago. Still can't walk well off work for 3 months. Broke and can barely afford rent. Gotta wait on EI to MAYBE com through. Gotta sign up for student loan assistance again. Gotta do my taxes so I can pay rent with refund. 

All that shit and I just don't care. Hooked on Percocet have a problem with them and they are making my life hell but gotta take them for the pain for the fucking foot still. Was doing really well and weened down to like 2 a day and was so much happier before surgery before I got thrown on a high dose again. Now I gotta go through withdrawal again... I can't do it.

I can't do any of it. I'm done. I regret failing in Aug to kill myself. Sure I did see some improvement but now it's all gone. I have enough pills to just end it now and I just... I don't care anymore. It's to hard life keeps shitting on me and I'm tired. So fucking tired.
