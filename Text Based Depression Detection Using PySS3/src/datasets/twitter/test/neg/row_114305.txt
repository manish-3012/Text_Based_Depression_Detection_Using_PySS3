I'm so afraid of death, but it's all I ever think about.People say hang on, cheer up, but I feel like such a screw up. I'm trapped in a job I hate in an industry that I hate, and I'm all alone in a city of type A go getters who've all got it figured out and I cant stop thinking about how I should just kill myself because it would all stop.
