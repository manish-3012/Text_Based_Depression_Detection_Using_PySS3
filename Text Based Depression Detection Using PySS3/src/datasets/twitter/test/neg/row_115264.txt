all i can think abouti live a great life surrounded by a lot of people who genuinely care for me. but all i can think about is cracking my neck and finally ridding this world of myself. anytime iâ€™m alone all i can think about is dying. my life has been falling apart around me for the last couple weeks and it feels like everything i do is meaningless. i have nowhere to turn so i wanted to post this, in case i donâ€™t wake up in the morning.
