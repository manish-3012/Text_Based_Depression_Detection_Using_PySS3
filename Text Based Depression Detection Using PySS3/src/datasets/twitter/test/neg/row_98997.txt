Why doesn't he love me?(I'm not suicidal but I really don't know who else to turn to)

I can't please my father. I never have been able to. Out of my two sisters and I, I have been the disappointment in his eyes. And I did it again. He screamed and yelled at me in the car because he was late to picking me up and I was talking to my mom about the heat and so she called him (which I didn't ask her to) and he got mad at me for talking to her. And he screamed and cursed and said I was a child.

For nineteen years, almost twenty, I have been trying to make him happy with me. Why me? Why does he love my sisters but hates me? I always disappoint him. I have never had high enough grades, never went after the right kind of classes in school, never had good enough boyfriends. But my sister's always have. He used to hate my older sister but once she got with her fiance and started working on computers (mathematical things), he has adored her. She still doesn't like him. Actually she hates him but puts up with him. 

My little sister has been the star child. I love my little sister and my father thinks she is the best thing to exist on this earth. But why doesn't he love me? I didn't have the best of grades and have always been a bit more creative than logical but nothing I have ever done has been good. I'd show him some art I made and he would glance but my little sister would show him some art she made and he would Oh and Ah over it. 

I feel like such a young child, trying to make her father proud but I have never done it. To this day I still have yet to make him as proud as my sister's have. And it hurts so goddamn much. It breaks my heart every time I try but I don't know how to stop trying. I want to see him proud of me, if only for a minute.
