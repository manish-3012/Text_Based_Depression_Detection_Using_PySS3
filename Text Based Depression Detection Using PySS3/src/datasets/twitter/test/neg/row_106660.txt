I have decided, at the end of next year I'll kill myselfI know it sounds like a unusually long time, but I want to at least just finish my high school years before I end it. I can't deal with living anymore tbh, everyday is physically tiring and just so mentally exhausting. I'm tired of constantly living with fear and anxiety every day. The constant feeling like I'm suffocating or that I'm gonna die. I'm tired of the constant war in my head and the arguments. I'm tired of it all, I don't even know why I started hurting myself. I already started planning things out. 

I think this post will just be my thoughts, kinda like a suicide note. Stuff that I'm thinking of putting into it. I might make a part 2 if more thoughts come to mind, or edit this post if I don't exceed the letter limit

I feel like I want to go off with a bang, idk how I'll kill myself. But I have several ideas in mind, I'm just scared of surviving and having to face the consequences afterwards. Or that when the time comes and I don't kill myself, then I'd be a coward for building it up and not going through.

I always regret not apologizing for the hurt that caused my friends, it seems they have moved on from it but the guilt still weighs on me. I wish I wasn't so hard on my friend when she asked for art advice. I  wish I had more self control and it feels like there's this barrier between me and my group of friends.

For the past few years, I have gone more quiet. I wish I wasn't, but for some reason it's just so hard to physically talk. Like trying to get the words out but i can't. Now it feels like i can't really talk to anyone anymore.

I wish i wasn't so broken and could be in a "normal" relationship. But it always ended the same because i was always so hesitant and deathly afraid when it came to intimate or physical contact, I always hated myself afterward cause of it. It always gave the impression that I didn't love them and they always wanted more. Trying to force me into things I didn't like and I gave into it. 

There were many times were I couldn't differentiate love from obsession, and because of that it have caused problems.

I absolutely hate were I live now, I hate this house. I hate this town and the people in this town. I don't even want to associate with anyone here at all. My old town was my life, it was a big part of me. Also not only that, but ever since we moved here I've become more paranoid. I refused to change schools, just so I could hold onto what little I had left. However sometimes I feel it's not worth it, waking up 5 am every morning and getting very little sleep just to go to school. But I don't want to give up and go to the school here, for god sakes I'm already gonna die in this awful town, that's the most they'll get from me.  

Every day is a nightmare, and I feel the only way to escape it is by sleeping. I dream pretty often and most of it's pretty fucked dreams, but I'd prefer that over real life. I'd rather be chased by monsters or trying to survive a apocalypse than wake up. My sleep schedule is really fucked and I tried getting help but my mom believes I'm faking it or like it's all in my head. 

I don't even know why I started self harm. I always found it intriguing because when I was younger in middle school, it was the popular topic in my group. They bragged about it and talked about it like it was cool. Showing off their scars. I never understood it at the time because I never did it, I remember the time I was forced to watch a friend cut herself. It was until a few months ago I decided to try it, I wish I didn't cause it's really addicting. Now I'm struggling to keep it under control, I wish my best friend would notice and say something. Sometimes I purposely try to subtly show it. I realized that people may notice but won't say anything. 

There's something about being depressed or just hurting that's addicting, idk how to explain it. Like I don't want to get better? There's this side of me that wants to see how far I'll fall in this deep pit. It was always so strange, I would complain to my friend about it constantly and when she offered advice I refused. After awhile it made her angry and arguments broke out between us. It was then I realized that I was only causing problem for my friends talking about my problems and not getting help, so I just turned to talking to myself online.

I had this strange thing growing up, like there were two different people in my head and I would always struggle choosing between the other. Hell, when I was younger I used to call them "Angel" and "Demon" since then I gotten out of that phase but I still have that war in my head. One side of me, wanting to be displayed as this "innocent angel" and wanting to be perfect. Then there this other side of me who just wants to do whatever they want, to be bold and straight forward, this sarcastic rude wild side. It sounds ridiculous, but I always struggled between the two identities and at most times I feel like I don't know myself because of it.
