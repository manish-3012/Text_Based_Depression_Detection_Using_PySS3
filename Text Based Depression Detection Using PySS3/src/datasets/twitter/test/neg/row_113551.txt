Suicidal thoughtsI tried posting this in another subreddit geared towards depression and was told I couldn't post this there. Because in this post I mention cutting, and suicidal thoughts....so I thought I would try here. I'm just severely depressed with no intention of actually following through with these thoughts. I just needed a place to vent, so hopefully this is the right place. 




I keep having these thoughts of ways to kill myself pop into my head. The logical side of me knows I will never do that, because I have two kids and a husband to live for. But just once, I'd love to be able to say that I'm living for myself. 

My husband travels alot. To different countries, or different states in the U.S. So, I'm alone and left to take care of our two kids. I love being a mom, dont get me wrong, but it is an exhausting job. I've lost my sense of self and feel that I'm starting to slack on my duties as a mother. 

It makes me feel like shit to only be able to scratch the surface of what I COULD be doing for/with my kids. But I'm doing the bare minimum. I lay down on the couch most if the day and try not to cry or cut myself. I'm 28 years old and I relapsed on cutting last weekend. I was strong for 2 years, and last weekend everything came crashing down. 

My sister was murdered 4 months ago, and because of my husbands traveling.....I feel I havent grieved the way I should. I have so many responsibilities. Grocery shopping, cleaning the house, taking care of our cats, the kids, school functions, answering any and all questions my kids have, making sure they're ready for bed and get a good nights sleep. 

Im fucking failing at all of it. I've been feeding them Happy meals for dinner, the house is a shit pit, the cats are taken care of but I dont pay attention to them anymore, my kids are alive and well but I cant get my ass off the couch to be fun, i dont go to school functions anymore bc I'm never showered or i feel like people are staring and it freaks me out...like everyone knows I'm being a shit mom. When my kids ask questions, I say "I dont know" and I'm pretty sure most of these nights I'm asleep before they are. 

These suicidal thoughts are getting more and more intense. It makes it to where I can barely breath. I cant get a good breath and my chest is just so tight. I cant stress enough, that I would never act on these thoughts. But just having them is enough to make me feel guilty, and feel like a failure. 

I just hate the loneliness of it. I've had depression for sooooo long now, I can function with it when I'm surrounded by friends and family. But trying to function with it when I talk and see other adults (minus my kids) once or twice a month, it starts to get to me. 

I've had 3 different friends since I've moved here, two of them turned out to be awful people, and the last one just moved away. The last friend started to ditch me towards the end of her stay here in this state. And coincidentally this was around the same time my sister was murdered. After coming back home from the funeral (spending a week away in Maine to prepare for the funeral) things between me and her werent the same. It was as if my emotions were too much for her to handle. She expressed to me it was because her and her husband were having issues and she didnt know if she wanted to move away with him. 

I gave her space to deal with that and eventually things were fine between them. But I was still over here one sister short. After the first two friends turning out to be awful people, and then my closest friend ditching me towards the end....it started to transform in my mind that maybe I'm the problem. 

Cue the heavy depression.

Since then, I've had no one here. Just me and my kids and talking to my husband through a screen. 
Eventually, the thoughts of "maybe I'm the problem" started to trickle into other aspects of my life. Now I feel like its consuming me. I hate what I see in the mirror. I hate who I've become. I hate that I want to love life, but I cant. 

It's just so draining, and I cant see a light anywhere. I'm just supposed to be a strong woman, holding down the fort until my husband gets home again. And I wonder how the other spouses do this. I wonder if maybe I'm just weak. Again, I'm the problem. 

I've become so accustomed to my negative feelings that I cant find joy in the things that made me feel happy. No matter how hard I try, the spark is just gone. I realized yesterday that I had been sitting and silently crying (you know the tears that fall when you arent even making a crying face) and staring at the wall for half an hour. The only thing that broke the trance was my son asking me what I was doing. Which made me cry more. 

My kids deserve a present mother. They deserve a fruitful life, and I feel like I'm stifling them sometimes with my sadness and negativity. I try so hard to hide it but I know I'm not doing a good job of that either. 

That's mostly everything going on in my head. I just felt the urge to get it out there somewhere. Maybe someone else will feel the same as me and know they arent alone? Idk. It just feels good to be heard, and these arent things I want to talk about with to my family. Idk why but it feels like a shameful thing, to have these thoughts when I'm blessed with such an amazing family. I just hope one day I dont have to feel like this all the time.
