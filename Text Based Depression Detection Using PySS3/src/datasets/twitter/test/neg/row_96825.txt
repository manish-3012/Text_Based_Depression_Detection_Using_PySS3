Amid the COVID crisis, life-saving ventilators are scarce. I'm making an advance directive to forgo ventilator treatment if I become sick. Let them save a life of someone who has more interest in living. It feels a bit comforting that if I get sick with the virus, I could just die, even if my family commits me.  I may sound like a coward not actively killing myself, but there's so much strain on people who are trying to save lives right now, I don't want to further burden them.
