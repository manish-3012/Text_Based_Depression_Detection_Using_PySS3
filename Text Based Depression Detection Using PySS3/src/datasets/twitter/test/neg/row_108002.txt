I really hate everythingI hate my life.
I hate myself.
I hate the world.
I hate everybody living in this world.
I hate my friends.
I hate my dog.
I just hate life so much.
I really don't care about how my family and friends will react to my suicide because when you're dead, you don't give any fucks.

I didn't use to be this way. It may be just my hormones being imbalanced because I just got on birth control. *sigh*
