death welcoming meIt's kind of strange lately,  every time I think about suicide, every time I see something sharp, I feel as if someone's drawing lines on my wrist (Even though I don't cut) and on my throat, as if that's where a noose is supposed to be. I'm partially worried because

a) I honestly don't give 2 shits about anything anymore, I lost my ability to feel things long ago 

b) I'm not afraid. 

It's strange. I used to think about how sad some people would be if I killed myself, but now that no one cares about me, It's actually kind of welcoming

what do you guys think? I'm setting a goal of living to january 2019, although that goal is seeming less and less likely these days. I'll honestly be surprised if I live past september.  
I don't know guys. It's really tempting to answer those calls, but something is holding me back.   
Who knows, maybe this post will get lost in the sea of other posts, but thanks if anyone reads this  
feels nice to get that off me
