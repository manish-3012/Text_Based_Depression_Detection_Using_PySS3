endin my shitall my life iâ€™ve been guilt tripped by both parents and i didnâ€™t even know. itâ€™s super draining waking up in the morning and getting shit because iâ€™m not smart like my brothers are or being told to leave everyone alone because iâ€™m annoying. i was constantly told i was the reason why they fight and they would somehow they would always get my other siblings to add onto giving me shit with them. and now iâ€™ve had enough. iâ€™m tired of them controlling how i feel and how i live but thereâ€™s really nothing else i can do. iâ€™m not legally able to leave my parents and live by myself cuz iâ€™m not old enough. and so iâ€™m just gonna take some of those sleeping pills and wish for the best. no more getting told that iâ€™m an idiot. no more of hearing them argue about stupid bullshit that only inflate their egos. no more fucking stress. âœŒï¸
