The pain has gone away... and I am happy for it.I ain't got family. My friends are all settling down and moving past that part of their life. I found a best friend, and fell in love with her while she was married. 

We had a relationship during her marriage, and for a year or so afterwards. But now she feels the guilt of what she did is too much. She broke up with me. But wanted to stay friends. I love her, and I want to support her. I thought we had this plan of maybe, when the stars aligned, that we could be together again. But I'm realizing that she just needs me as a friend right now. So I'm trying my best. 

She has a history with exes killing themselves. So I dont want to be another of those stories. I want her to move on and slowly stop needing the comfort I provide her. So tonight i wrote myself a letter. 

I'm gonna stick around and be her friend while she needs it. I'm gonna slowly sell all my stuff and just wait until that moment comes that our connection isnt there anymore. Then I'll say I'm gonna move away or whatever and just kill myself. 

I know itll be tough for my friends and her, but I am hoping to disappear first. Slowly push them away so that lost isnt as hurtful when it comes. I hope they never find out and I am just someone they...she lost touch with. 

It's so fucking comforting. I can breathe. I can cry and not feel helpless. 

I write this because I need it for myself. I want to put it out in the universe because... otherwise I'm afraid I'll back down when the time comes. 

My life has been mediocre. My life has been one fight and struggle after another. My life has been lonely, and I just ain't got in me to do this for another 30 years.
