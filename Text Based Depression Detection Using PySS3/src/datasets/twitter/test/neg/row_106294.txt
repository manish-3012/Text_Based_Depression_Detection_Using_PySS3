Iâ€™m going to bed &amp; killing myself first thing in the morningIâ€™d be lucky if I donâ€™t wake up at all, but Iâ€™m sure I will. And when I do, that will be ok because Iâ€™m ending my life in the morning. I can sleep soundly knowing that all of the pain Iâ€™m feeling will be over after tonight. I donâ€™t care who thinks Iâ€™m selfish, who tries to guilt trip me, or who tries to tell me â€œit gets betterâ€ because I already know that I need to take this into my own hands and do what is best for me for once. Bye everyone.
