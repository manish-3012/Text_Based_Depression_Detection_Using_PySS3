It really bothers me when people try to push me to do something or tell me what to do.I don't want people donig that. It makes me really angry. I want to prove that I don't need them to do that. I just find it really offensive. My friends really piss me off sometimes. There not my fucking parents. I just want to live my life the way I want to live it. I'm not stupid. I don't need their help. I just don't like the idea of someone pushing me. People should just give suggestions and if it doesn't work for me then that's too bad. Just leave me alone and don't tell me what to do. It makes me feel like a piece of shit when they do that. They have no idea how bad it makes me feel. I try to avoid people who do that and I will make sure I avoid them at all costs if I have to. I just want people to support what I want to do. I feel like people don't support me.
