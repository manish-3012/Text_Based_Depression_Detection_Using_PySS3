No matter what I just want to dieMy mind is fixated on it, convinced the only way out of this trauma is to die. I put on this mask, I dissociate all day long and pretend that's me.

Pretending to recover, pretending to be normal is hard. Especially when you've already got commitments to exit soon, for good.

I'm exhausted. it's only day 4 of my "intervention" or whatever you want to call it, but it's just made me worse. Having my basic human rights stripped away and being monitored 24/7. This is just more shit on top of the shit pile.

One day, one of these days, I'll get the balls. I've felt this way since childhood and finally now I can do it I pussy out. What a fucking loser. I want out.
