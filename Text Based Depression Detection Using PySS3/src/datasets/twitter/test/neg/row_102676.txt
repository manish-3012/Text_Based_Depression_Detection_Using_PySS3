I'm not getting anywhere, don't know what to doI posted in SW a few weeks back. I'm going through stress with exams and trying to cope with depression. Since I last posted I got back to University and I've tried to get help. I saw a psychiatrist and was prescribed 15mg Mirtazapine, i've been taking the pills for about a week now. I thought things were on the way to improvement, that was until the last few days. I've isolated myself since Saturday evening and wrote a suicide note.

Even though I didn't want my parents worrying about me I decided to tell them what I was going through, mainly about me failing the year and being depressed. I don't understand why things were going great then suddenly last night I'm thinking of killing myself again. I don't feel stable and I don't feel like I've improved; just been distracted from what is actually going on in my head.

I don't know what to do, I don't feel like talking to anyone. People just judge and tell me what they think is the 'right' thing to do.

(PS. throwaway account)

**Edit:** Just updating. Had a visit from a councilor today because I wasn't answering my phone. I'm being seen tonight again to see if i'm safe. I've started to eat food again but still feeling like crap. I feel like I'm just distracting myself though as time passes by.
