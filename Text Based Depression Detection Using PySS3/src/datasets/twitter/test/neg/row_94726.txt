Im not even sad.Im just tired of living. Im a community college student who got rejected by target. Fucking target. Im tired of going through the motions. I just really dont have any feelings left for anyone. Maybe im young (19), but I see no reason I dont even feel aroused anymore, I just dont care. My childhood is over and everthing is just so annoying.

Sorry for the grammar. Im typing this on my phone without autocorrect.
