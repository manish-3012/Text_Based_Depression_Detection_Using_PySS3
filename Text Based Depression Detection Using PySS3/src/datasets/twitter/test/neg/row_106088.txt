How do you live for yourself?Sometimes when I imagine dying, I stop thinking logically, and I hallucinate someone looking down at me or touching my shoulder who doesn't want me to go to bring me out of the ideation. I doubt I'm normally psychotic; it's probably what a lot of people believe to be God. The only problem for me is it's never God. It always looks like someone who, in the real world, doesn't want to be that close to me. I could say I don't love them, but the mind doesn't lie about that stuff in those moments. How do I learn to live for myself and not some fantasy, or even just not for other people?
