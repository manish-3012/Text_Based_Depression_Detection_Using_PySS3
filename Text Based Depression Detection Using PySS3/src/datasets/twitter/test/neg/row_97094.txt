Is it worth going on?The only thing that is soothing to me is the idea of killing myself. Not dying randomly, but by my own hand.

There is little that gets me excited, everything is useless anyway, I am useless, I don't even have power to support others anymore. My friends are forgetting that I exist. I have no one to talk to. I am nothing but a burden, something that makes others waste their time. I am not good enough as a girlfriend. Nor as a friend. Nor as a human.

Everyone wants to get rid of me. And they are right. They would be better off without me. And they will forget I ever existed. Sooner before my body goes cold. Even my boyfriend. How terrible of a girlfriend do I have to be so that he treats me like this? He deserves better. He deserves the best. Everyone does. But not me. Not even the simplest things.
