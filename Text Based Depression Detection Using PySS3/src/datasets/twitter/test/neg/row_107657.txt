ByeI think this decision comes more from my logic than my depression (not that I know whether I'm actually clinically depressed or just totally aware of my fucked-up loser-ness). I've had suicidal thoughts since about fifteen or sixteen. I acted on them a few times (half-heartedly), and made one serious attempt last year but failed (I was drinking to build up the courage and fucked up and got found and taken to the hospital). I went to a counselling session, saw how much the lady didn't give a shit and never went back. I'm not going to leave a note for my friends or family. I've hid my depression well but it won't be a shock to them. My family knows I'm messed up in the head. With my friends I've tried to be more careful, but there's been plenty of times I let something slip out about wanting to kill myself when I've been wasted (I drink way too much (usually getting angry and emotional and pissing everyone off)). They've never really confronted me about it in a serious way, I'm guessing they're all just so stable they can't really get their heads around such pain and what a fucked-up mind actually is, either that or they don't really give a shit. I like the idea of saying goodbye here, to people who have some idea what its like, making this final stamp on the world that I did exist. I don't hate the world, I think its kind of cool. But you know how it is and I actually think I've done pretty well to make it this far. Half of me is sad and blubbering like a baby but the other half feels like air or something. This is gonna be really lame and clichÃ©d but I don't care, I really like it, so if you've read this far, deal with it. "For who would lose, though full of pain, this intellectual being, those thoughts that wander through eternity, to perish rather, swallowed up and lost in the wide womb of uncreative night.' (hope that's right. I did it from memory). Good luck with it all :)
