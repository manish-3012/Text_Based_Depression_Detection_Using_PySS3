Canâ€™t man upIâ€™ve been having dark thoughts since my wife left with our 3 kids about 6 months ago. I quit my job as I couldnâ€™t cope now I canâ€™t get another one. Iâ€™m living with my mother she is useless, friends have abandoned me as I did to them whilst in the relationship. Iâ€™ve got no money left. I fantasise about running my car into a tree or off a bridge constantly. I also have these thoughts about doing a gesture for society before ending my life, like killing pedophiles/rapists ect. She got a new guy within 4 fucking weeks after a 13yr relationship. Iâ€™ve had a couple of attempts at new girls but both have dropped me within a week or two with no explanation. It only confirms my thoughts of worthlessness and having nothing to offer. My kids are the only reason that I havenâ€™t ended it before now but I now feel like thatâ€™s not going to work anymore. I got detained by police the other night trying to jump of a cliff and had to convince several psychologists that I was ok to be released, I did but Iâ€™m really not...  I fail at everything. 
sorry should have been in point form.
