Sexually assaulted by guy friend. I feel all alone. Please help.I was sexually assaulted by my male friend on Friday night. I told my boyfriend yesterday (Saturday). My boyfriend told me he needed time to think on Saturday but we ended up talking today (Sunday). I thought things were ok with my boyfriend and me after talking and that he would support me as I was going through this. But after we spent a couple of hours studying at the library, he told me he wasn't ready to spend time together, that he needed more time to think and that he wasn't strong enough to support me right now. 

I was already going through a lot as I recovered from being hospitalized a couple months ago for pulmonary embolism (multiple blood clots in my lungs). I'm in my third year in a PhD program and just recently found out that I lost a year of funding, and will have to finish in 5 years instead of 6 years. I had been feeling overwhelmed and turned to my friend for support since he is in my same department. But instead he took advantage of me when I was vulnerable.

I feel like my assailant took so much from me. He took away my dignity and my trust in him. He destroyed my relationship with my boyfriend. He took away my confidence in my work as a scholar. He took away the confidence that I had with my body. He took away all of my hard work recovering from depression. 

I realized today that I would have to cope with this experience for the rest of my life and I just don't think I can handle it at this point. 

Update: My boyfriend reached out to me late last night and told me he was there to support me. He finally understood that I just needed him to be there for me while I go through this. I had gone in to the sexual assault resources office on my campus. The dvocate was very helpful and understanding of my situation. I filed a report and have a restraining order against my assailant. Thank you all for your kind words in my time of need.
