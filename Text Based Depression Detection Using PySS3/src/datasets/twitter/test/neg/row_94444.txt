beatdownMy hands hurt, my head hurts, my back and body aches. My soul is broken.

I was in hypomania mid-week and crashed **hard** into a depressive episode last night. I spent about 4.5 hours driving 200 miles to nowhere in particular while listening to sad songs and crying today.

I want to be with my sister or my dad without having to talk and just knowing they are present. Instead I'm alone on my couch trying to make it to bedtime.
