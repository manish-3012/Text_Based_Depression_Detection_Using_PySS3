I'm so tiredI keep disappointing myself

College is going down the drain

My parents couldn't care less about me and treat me like I'm a waste of money

I have no friends

My boyfriend is growing each day more distant and I believe he'll leave me soon.

I feel terrified, paralysed. Constantly.

Tired of the "you are valuable", "I'll be ok" talk...

I tried to kill myself in January... Been considering a second attempt lately...
