Death keeps beckoning me and I'm getting less able to resistI'm a 33f and I have severe depression and BPD. I've had multiple attempts in the last five years, one a success for a few minutes. I cut myself profusely and recently I haven't been able to stop. My birthday was two days ago (the 16th) and since then I've wanted nothing more than to kill myself. I've been hanging on for so long since my last attempt and my grip is slipping. I'm in therapy and on meds and keeping busy, but the thoughts never leave. I tried to plunge a knife into my throat an hour ago but ended up just bloodying up my arm ðŸ˜ž I'm so tired. And so exhausted. I have only one friend and no support from family. My father is emotionally abusive in the highest. My mom killed herself ten years ago. I just want to see her again ðŸ˜¢ Please help me ðŸ˜–
