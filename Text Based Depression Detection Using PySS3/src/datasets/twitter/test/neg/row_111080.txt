Tomorrow, I get to decide whether or not to go into an inpatient program.I cannot cope with work. I canâ€™t even cope with getting up and taking a shower. Or getting up to eat. Sometimes I chose starving over buying/making food because it takes energy I donâ€™t have. *Vitality* I donâ€™t have. 

My job is soul-sucking and my manager is so skeptical and passive aggressive towards my building anxiety at work. Which just makes a cycle. However, she (very reluctantly) gave me tomorrow off to â€œseek helpâ€. I have some â€œmental health resourcesâ€ through my work, but I donâ€™t know how good it is. 

Maybe I should skip the whole ordeal and just self-admit myself? My bipolar swings are out of control and go from fine to manically overspending to quietly contemplating suicide. I vomited this morning minutes before having to leave for work. The entire morning was a blur. I felt so alone and helpless. Like, *how could no one else notice that I can hardly breathe? Or how I look like a dead shell?* I fell into a psychosis-like daze at my dear in front of all my coworkers and it was like everyone ignored it. 

Iâ€™m so confused and donâ€™t know what to do. I wish I was dead. But st the same time, o feel like Iâ€™m â€œnot bad enoughâ€ for a hospitalâ€¦ But the option of suicide blindsides me so often I live in panic. And if I go on leave and admit myself, what happens to my apartment? Do I lose everything? 

If I admit myself into a psychiatric hospital, will I lose *everything?*
