I'm giving myself 3 months until I do it and I've accepted itI have no future. No reason to be in college. All of my friendships are dissipated at this point. No girlfriend but that's the least of it. I can't stay awake for longer than 5 hours and I have a neverending cloud of chest pain from my miserable existence. On the bright side, I plan to be the best I can for the people who do care about me. I'm gonna stick it out for my sister's high school graduation and just be a good person for everyone. No more tearing people down. I have plenty of time to ensure that what I do leave those I care about the most letters and memorabilia so that the loss isn't too tragic and nobody blames themselves because it isn't that at all. There have been a few suicides in my family and while it does leave a hole in lives' of the families people move on. At this point it's my fate and I've accepted that I'm not strong enough to stay alive and that's okay. I feel much better in any given moment knowing that it will be over in 3 months.
