I'm terrified of myself, Reddit.I know I have people that love me. I know that I have people who will miss me. I know that there are people who care. But these thoughts just won't leave me alone. They've been coming in and out of my head for years. I've come so close several times. Usually I just cut my arms and the thoughts go away. But it's not helping anymore. A lot of times the only thing stopping me is I don't know where to find a gun. I woke up so depressed this morning. I went for a walk, but had to rush back before I broke down in tears in public. Once I got back to my room I shut the door and had a meltdown. I took a handful of pills and passed out for 4 hours. I'm terrified of myself right now. I have no good reason to want to die, but I can't stop myself from thinking about it. I've never told anyone about these thoughts, but it's starting to get the best of me. 

Like I said, I know that there are people who love me, will miss me, and care about me deeply but when I die those people will mean nothing. I'll be dead. I don't believe in an afterlife, so that kind of helps me with the whole death thought. I won't have to worry about hurting anyone, because a dead body has no thoughts or feelings. I know it sounds awful but I've been thinking about it so much that I guess I've become insensitive to it. I'm so young. I have such a great life ahead of me. I know these things. But sometimes I just can't handle this silly game anymore. It makes me wonder if these years of struggling will really be worth it in the end. The thoughts overwhelmed me more than they ever have today. It's getting worse. I'm becoming someone I promised myself I'd never be. I'm losing control. I'm so scared.
