I can't handle living in this sick worldI really can't deal with it anymore. I see no point to living whatsoever, I know we are all going to die sometime so why not just cut to the chase? I believe I will never find a partner and I don't want kids. I have no interest in any hobbies or activities anymore. I'm only 18. Every day and every night I just find myself trying to find a reason why I'm even here to begin with. I lost my job 2 weeks ago, I've been rejected for 20 jobs since that time and I'm down to my last $15. My parents (who I live with) are struggling financially and I can't live with the guilt of not being able to help and the failure of losing my job at this difficult time.

I also can't ever stop thinking about how disgusting and cruel this world is. So many people are out there suffering while people who have the ability to help are too fucking selfish and blind to the pain of anyone who isn't them to help. Why are human beings like this? Why does the world work the way it does? How can millions of people be starving and nobody cares enough to help them? I'm baffled and I can't imagine having millions of dollars and being so greedy I'd rather let people die than lose any.. 

I just can't do it anymore. I have really tried to find some other way of thinking but I can't. I'm sorry.
