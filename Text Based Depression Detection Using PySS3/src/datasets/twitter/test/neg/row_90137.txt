My ex completely destroyed my mental health. I was so ready to end my life last night. Now I'm just stuck in a constant state of panic and sorrow. I have never been so hurt in my life(8-month relationship) I let him take my virginity (**AFTER I WAITED FOR YEARS FOR THE RIGHT PERSON**), he lied to me on Halloween night and slept at a guy's house while making me think he was home safe. We even talked on the phone. Two days later he left me because I have too many issues (was anxiety, mostly), and he did not see it working out long term. Two weeks later, he is dating the guy.

And the fact I told you I was crying and depressed and you told me to fucking try harder to stop. And the fact you said, "Sheesh, it's been a month and you're still crying?" Fuck you. I was nothing but loving and loyal. You have mental health issues. You have lied to me countless times. You lied about your degree. You put my life in danger more than once with your immature road rage. And what do I get in return? A full fucking mental breakdown, that is what. You have issues. SO SO many issues.

Let us not forget the time you went out for "alcohol" when I know the places were closed. I saw your Snapchat map. You were on a hookup. I know you were cheating throughout our relationship. But I'm a weak fuck, so I stayed.

I opened up to you, you said you would never hurt me after I told you what happened in my last relationship. I EVEN TOLD YOU I WAS RAPED. I don't share that with anyone! I was already on edge. **You clearly targeted me.** I fucking hate you so much. You know what this has done to me, and all you can do is say, "oh well." I have since blocked you from everything, but the pain I suffer every day, and in my sleep has not gone away. I'm on antidepressants, and it's not helping.

I feel so hopeless. I want to give up. **Fuck you.** I hope your rebound hurts you just as you hurt me. Maybe it'll be a fucking teaching lesson for you.
