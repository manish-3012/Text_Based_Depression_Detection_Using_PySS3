I'm definitely jumping off the bridge tomorrowThere's no turning back. As soon as the bus comes tomorrow, I'm going to ride it to the bridge and jump. I just posted this to say goodbye. Goodbye my life. You tried so hard. You did the best you could. But now is the time to be realistic and to just let you go.
