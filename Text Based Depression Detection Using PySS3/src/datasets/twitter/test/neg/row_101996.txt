I am done!I am fucking done..

Lost my job, canâ€™t find new job (I applied so many places) FiancÃ©e left me.. my dream job is taking long time to accept me (been in process 2yrs gov job) I am tired of being a failure I am tired of always trusting people and giving love to someone who will just break my heart again... I have been crying to sleep, only sleeping for 2hrs eat when I feel it.. I am just so tired and want to die.. I had 5 break downs since waking up 3hrs ago. I canâ€™t even reach for help cause if I do any dream job in Law Enforcement is our the window for me!

I am just burned out.. I am useless and a failure what is the point living when I have no one or anything but debt to live for...
