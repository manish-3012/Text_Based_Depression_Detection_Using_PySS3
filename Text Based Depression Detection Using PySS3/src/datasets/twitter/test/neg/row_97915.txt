Sucking sucker sucks the big one, wants to stop sucking but can'tMy life was bad before I even was an alcoholic, now it's just another problem for me to worry about. I spend my work days shaking and feeling like shit, and just waiting for my shift to end so I can go home and drink.

I've been feeling really suicidal lately, ever since I saw this picture of myself. I was out socializing for once, and someone posted this picture on facebook in which I was in the background.

I fucking hate the way I look, I am so alien-looking and overweight. I never want anyone to take my picture, because I always look terrible. I wish I was an entity, and no one would ever look at me. I feel this way often, I just don't want anyone to see me. Just really hate being a human.

I spend my days off locked away, drinking. Whenever I consider going out it's always a huge deal, I just picture people seeing me and don't want to go. The paranoia of people seeing me just kills me, and it's been like that for most of my life. Now that the weather has improved, it's even worse as I am more exposed.

It's a wonder I am still even employed, but somehow I have maintained it for almost a year now. The truth is though, that every day is a huge fucking hassle for me to leave my disgusting apartment. The paranoia has been getting worse lately too, and I fear I am going to lose yet another job and be homeless again.

I attract the worst kinds of people, but I also seek them out. All of my closest relationships have started online, and lately all my friends are online. This makes me feel like utter garbage as well, because my life is basically a fantasy world filled with losers. I really fucking hate being a human, and I hate that for some fucking reason I still want to connect with people. Really wish I could settle on being completely alone, relationships are so goddamn taxing.

I honestly can't see myself harbouring the energy to change, or seeking out the right resources, let alone following through with some sort of plan. Also I really believe not all of us are meant to have great lives, that some of us just fall between the cracks of this miserable society like we should.

So why can't I kill myself? I am in pain every day, and people like to think I am "not that bad". But if they had to listen to my inner monologue for a few minutes, I bet they'd probably want to off themselves too.

TL;DR: I suck.
