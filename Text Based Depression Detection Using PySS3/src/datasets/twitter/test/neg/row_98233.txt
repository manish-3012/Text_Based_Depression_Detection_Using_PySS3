We were innocentIs it just me or does anybody feel that our parents generation, the people who were supposed to look out for us, they fucked with us? Not as a personal opinion but all the war, the environment, the dying children and humanity to be quite honest is their fault. Theirs and the ones before them. And WE have to suffer for it. They were told to shy away from mental illnesses and many times even from physical ones, and that made them unable to advise US on how to deal with this kind of stuff. And because of that shyness, mental illness became a disappointment to them and when their child kills themselves, others and child itself is blamed. Nothing can be done about it till the next generation takes place, I know that....
But WHAT THE FUCK am I supposed to do until then, how the hell am I supposed to survive on the basis of things might get better maybe when I'm about to die, do I want to die knowing that I died everyday by living, just in hopes of getting better, and when they finally actually do... My time has come?
Governments say they know what they're doing, well they know fuckall cause everyone knows how bad things are just, everyone is scared....
