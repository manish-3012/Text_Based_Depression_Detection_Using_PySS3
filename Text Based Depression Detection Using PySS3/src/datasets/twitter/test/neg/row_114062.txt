Been battling depression for 6 years, I think this might be my final week on this earthI'm tired, everytime I get a glimpse of hope and come back to normal, the next downfall is even worse. 

It's been 12 days since the beginning of the Last one, and it's taking control. My body and mind are refusing to keep going.

I deeply would have wanted to live, Just not like this.
