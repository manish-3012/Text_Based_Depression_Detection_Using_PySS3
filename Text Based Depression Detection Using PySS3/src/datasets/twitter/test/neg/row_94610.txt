It started 9 years ago9 years ago I was 7, and my teacher told a classmate that if you suck on pencil lead you'll die, simply because she was too lazy to explain why you shouldn't. Teachers often used scare tactics like this. I guess it's a simple way to get what you want.
I knew I didn't want to be here at that age. My family was very religious, so I would pray to God to please kill me, I didn't want to be here. And yup, I spent all that night sucking on pencil lead.
4 years later and I was in middle school with the same class of 25 kids. They said I was goth and left it at that. I mostly was alone. At age 11, I threatened suicide to my school's untrained guidance counselor, who told me to not do that and sent me on my merry way. Grand. My mom screamed at me on the way home.
Anyways, now we're here, present day. 
This is my 3rd post on this subreddit ever, and my 3rd post within a week.
My boyfriend doesnt love me anymore, after a year and a half and planning colleges around this. Cool. I sent my friend a care sheet for all my fish. I've put weeks of thought into this. I just want someone to tell me they love me and that they're ok with letting me go because they know I'll be happier. I'm tired of arguing with people. I've been to therapists, they cant help me in the fact that I legitimately do not want to be here. Can someone please tell me it's ok? I cant stand this much longer.
And jesus christ, I know this formatting is about to be as ass as I think it is. Good luck
