Too many times I have posted here and this will be my last.I finally decided that I will soon be ending my life. I finally quit my job that made my depression 100x worse. I know that won't help my mental health but now I know I have nothing else to lose. Soon I will be homeless and my son will have to live with his father because he is better off with him. I have no family or friends and most the time just want to sleep all day. It's not healthy for my son to be around me. I have recently put on a mask and tried really hard to hide my depression because it was starting to effect my son. He was gloomy and picking up on my negative vibes but recently he has been very happy. I don't want him to see me like this and my only option to get help is to commit myself. There is no point in that because once I leave the hospital I will have nowhere to go and no money to pay for meds if that's what I need. I have tried dozens of times to get government help but all my applications get denied. I don't know really maybe I am doing something wrong, like always. There are a lot of other things going on in my life but when I open up to people that say they care, they don't believe me. I knew when I was a child I wouldn't have a long life and figured I would commit suicide one day. I guess that day will be soon. I've been planning this for awhile but always thought I should wait and things would get better. I try and stay positive but the world is a fucked place. Sure random people are kind and give me a little bit of hope that this world isn't all shit but It's the people that are close that keep me down. Something must be wrong with me if that's what keeps happening. I know I am not a bad person it's just that I don't fit in with this world. Never have and never will.
