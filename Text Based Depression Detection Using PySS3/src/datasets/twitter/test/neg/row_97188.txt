Guy bought a gun today so we can kill ourselves together when he picks me up on SaturdayIâ€™m scared but I said yes. I told one person that Iâ€™m really close to impulsively, and they think I should tell the authorities. I kind of agree, but I donâ€™t want to get anyone in trouble and I donâ€™t want to end up in a mental hospital. Getting the police involved just seems like a terrible idea. But if I donâ€™t then I have to go through with it? Like I said, Iâ€™m admittedly kind of scared, especially after he said he wanted to go first which just leaves a lot of room for imagination about how exactly this will play out and I canâ€™t be sure about how Iâ€™ll actually respond in a moment like that. If I canâ€™t go through with the plan then Iâ€™ll be associated with someoneâ€™s death and that canâ€™t bode well for me in a legal sense. But also what if Iâ€™m mistaking nervous excitement for fear? I mean I still very much want to do it and enthusiastically agreed despite these â€œscaredâ€ feelings. If I back out now Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll disappoint him and heâ€™s already in a low emotional state obviously and I just donâ€™t know how I could let him down. I donâ€™t know. I think the best option is just to do it because I said I would, but I donâ€™t know. Thanks for reading.
