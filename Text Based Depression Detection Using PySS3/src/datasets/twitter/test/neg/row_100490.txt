Iâ€™m a pathetic teen who canâ€™t do anything rightHey. First post here. So Iâ€™ve contemplated suicide for a while now and I think itâ€™s almost time. TBH things have just gotten progressively worse, Iâ€™m a fucking failure to everything, and everything I do is wrong. I donâ€™t think I can live like this anymore and I donâ€™t know how long I can do this. I just donâ€™t see a future.
