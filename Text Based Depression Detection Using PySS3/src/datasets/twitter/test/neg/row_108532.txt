My life has been getting better, but I'm hurting myself and I still want to dieI'll be moving into a nice big house, starting HRT, and actually remembering to wear my contacts. Even though my life has been moving up and improving slowly, I still feel highly suicidal. I've started to cut myself again, they are deeper and bloodier than my first time which was barely two months ago. Is something wrong with me? Why do I still want to die? I thought it was getting better, but here I am feeling terrible and like none of this real.
