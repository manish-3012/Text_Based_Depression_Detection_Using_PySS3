Fallen too farUsed to have a great job making 30 dollars an hour that I can't get back. I'm 34 always have been a heavy drinker.  Quit to start my own business and failed. Now I'm 25k in debt. Started smoking weed all the time and knocked a girl up from tinder that I don't even like. Unemployed and I have no work ethic. No savings. Can only make one more month of rent. I know the rest of my life is going to be shit don't won't to stick around for it.
