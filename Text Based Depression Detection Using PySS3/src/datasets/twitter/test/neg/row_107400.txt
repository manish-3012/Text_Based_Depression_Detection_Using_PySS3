It's just about the only thing I think about anymoreI posted here a while back, but the past couple of days have been 100x worse. I have a hard time thinking of anything other than killing myself.   

Long story short, we have been dealing with cps almost since my daughter was born. When she was 6 months old, she was removed from my house because of issues of cleanliness (she lives with my boyfriend, who is her father, right now). Since then (shell be a year old later this month), I have spent as much of my time as possible fighting to get my house to where they want it to be. And every time they come back, there's some new problem so she still can't be here. Two days ago I found out why. They have apparently been told that I neglect my daughter, so she isn't supposed to come back to me anyway.   

I have never neglected my daughter. She is happy, healthy, and smart. There is no reason at all for them to suspect something like that, except that someone has told them so. 

So I've realized now that its never going to end. If they can keep my daughter out of my house for 6 months due to completely baseless claims, there is nothing to stop them from continuing this forever. The only way to get them to leave my boyfriend and daughter alone would be for me to be out of the picture completely. 

I know that I'm depressed, and have been for a long time, but I also know that if I seek help for it, it's only going to make things with cps worse. I can only think of one way to end this.
