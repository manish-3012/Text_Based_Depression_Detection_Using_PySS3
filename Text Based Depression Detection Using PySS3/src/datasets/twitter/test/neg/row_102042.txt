Text start to 741741Iâ€™ve seen some posts about people calling national hotlines and being hung up on and that breaks my heart. Thatâ€™s fucking ridiculous. 

I recently started volunteering for the crisis text line and I recommend it to anyone here. Iâ€™ve struggled myself for many years and came to know the Crisis Text Line because my therapist recommended I text in to it when I was struggling last year. 

Weâ€™re real people who really want to help you. It also takes some of the anxiety away from actually talking on the phone if thatâ€™s not your thing. 
Disclaimers:
-Our messages can only be 160 characters back to you so if they seem shortâ€”thatâ€™s why. But, you can send as many long messages as you need to!
-We do follow a certain timeframeâ€”we want to talk to you and divert you from your crisis so weâ€™re going to talk to you about coping skills and try to help you find ways to manage the way youâ€™re feeling when youâ€™re not talking to us. Weâ€™re not doing this to be dismissive or anything. We want to find out what can help you when we canâ€™t be around to help, you know? 

I truly wish you all the best and want you to get the help that youâ€™re looking for. Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s legal or whatever for me to post this but I recommend you try it. If itâ€™s not working or something, you can always text â€œstopâ€ at any time and weâ€™re legally not allowed to text back. Good luck everyone!!
