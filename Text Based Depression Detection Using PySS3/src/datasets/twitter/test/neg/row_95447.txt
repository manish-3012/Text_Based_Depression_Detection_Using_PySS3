Honestly, I could have easily killed myself already. The only real reason I haven't done so is mostly due to the fact that I'm a lazy piece of shit who is afraid of failing.I've never been able to do a single damn thing right throughout my entire life. I'm a complete disappointment to my single mother who raised me by herself for 20+ years, I've caused nothing but misery for her. I'd always think of offing myself everyday, but only to be held back by how much of a pain in the ass attempting suicide is. Finding the way to do it, finding the best time, and mostly finding the confidence in doing it flawlessly. Confidence doesn't exist within me. What is I tried hanging myself but didn't tie the noose tight enough? What if I fall off a building but survive with a coma? What if I stab myself but miss my vital points completely. It was then when I realized that suicide was hard work, and that I wouldn't even be able to succeed. I'd be even more of a failure than I already am. Anyone else riding the same boat?
