Suffering at this point is greater than love for my parents.I'm 18 yr old, 6'3 white male and I live in Poland central europe. I have two loving parents, roof over my head and a "girlfriend"(well probably not anymore xd).
The point is that on paper I don't have any reasons to feel the way I feel, but I suffer 24/7.
I did some fucked up shit 2 years ago and even though in the end nothing really happened, I still have nightmares about it and I can cry and have a mental breakdown in the middle of a class. I also live with an abusive grandfather who used to hit my granma and mom a lot when she was young, and even though I'm not skinny and I can probably take him down easly, when he shouts I freeze from fear.
Idk if these are real problems, but the thing with depression is that it's an illness like cancer but nobody expect's u to have reasons for having cancer xd
What I wrote today is just a tip of the iceberg the point is that I'm suffering a lot and I think I might kill myself at the end of 2020. Sory for my english xd(not my native language)
