There is no reason I should feel this way. On the outside, everything is fine.People, especially my many friends, describe me as energetic, talkative, and happy. I do my best to comfort those in need and share the good times with my close friends. They don't know that for 4 years I've woken up almost every day debating whether it was worth it. I put too much pressure on myself. I want to achieve everything I can but have no means of doing so. My talent lies in language and history, yet my passion is in all things technology. English or history will not fetch a job. I am not talented at programming or possess the mathematical or science skills to do decently in computer science. The future terrifies me. I'm in high school, specifically one full of extremely talented and high-achieving kids. *I'm just a jack of all trades.* Just a bit above average at everything, exceptional in English and historical studies. Still, nothing compared to them. I'm not artistic. I wish I was. I wish I had the talent, the time, and motivation necessary to be in every single organization I can possibly be in. *I want to be the best. I just can't.*This crushes me. It's frustrating I can't achieve the grades I want. I have a solid 3 A's and one C. Good enough, right? No, because it means a 3.4 GPA. I am always with the kids with the 4.3's, the show choir kids who are always winning the top awards in everything, and I compare myself to them.* I compare myself to the very best because that's what is expected of me. *I feel like I'm not there. I feel like I'm not worth it. I have a nice family and no serious problems like drugs, deaths, or anything along those lines. There is no reason for me to feel this way. Yet, I do. I wake up and feel terrible without knowing why. I'm constantly exhausted and run down, unable to properly concentrate. I feel as though I'm running on empty. I feel so alone and isolated. Setback after setback, repeated failures to meet my expectations are driving me mad. I feel this deep hollowness, this lack of personality and character that I used to own. This doesn't feel real to me. It feels like I'm not supposed to be here. So, I've thought about a solution quite frequently. I construct scenarios of ways I would do it. I just don't want to hurt my family. I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't want to hurt myself. All I want is to make it stop. The only reason I want to die is because I see it as the way to make it stop. Thank you for taking your time to read this.
