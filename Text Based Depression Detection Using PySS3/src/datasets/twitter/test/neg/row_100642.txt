I have no hopeMy ex boyfriend cheated on me and gave me genital herpes. Itâ€™s hard to want to live knowing that no one will ever truly love me. I canâ€™t even turn on the tv without someone calling people like me disgusting. I absolutely despise myself and I just want to end it all. I donâ€™t want to live a long life because now I know it will only be lonely and miserable.
