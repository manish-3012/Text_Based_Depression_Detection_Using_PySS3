[F18] Feeling the urge to attempt for a 4th time after 5ish years without feeling so lowFor context: Iâ€™m 18F, I have a 19F girlfriend, my biological mother 39, step dad 42, half sister 8, not step dadâ€™s kid, and step siblings F22, M14, M11. 

Iâ€™ve made several attempts in the past, ever since I was 12. Telling my mom I was suicidal years ago was answered with â€œthen go kill yourself, see if I care.â€

My stress levels are at an all time high between college, threats of being kicked out, threats of rent, my relationship, my crazy step dad and sister, of being ghosted by potential employers, traveling, etc. Iâ€™m on Zoloft for anxiety and depression, lost my father at age 2, my half sisterâ€™s father tried to rape me on multiple accounts and my mother refused to call the cops on him bc of my sister. My step father, who came into my life around age 15, frequently calls me a monster and accuses me of trying to tear my family apart. My step sister constantly instigates fights and talks crap, then turns around and treats me like her best friend so she can use my art supplies and my car. 

I feel like my mother doesnâ€™t want or love me and like the world will be a better place without me in it. The only people who would care are my gf, my little sister, and my M11 step sib, and these three people are the only reason i havenâ€™t attempted these past years. Perhaps my one other friend, but no one else, really. I refuse to go back to therapy bc my mother will make my life hell again. 

Iâ€™m currently alone at Epcot on vacation with the family (they guilted me into going), after my mother told me to go away because I was ruining everyoneâ€™s appetite during lunch, after my step sis instigated another fight that only i got yelled at for. Calling my gf ended with lots of â€œYouâ€™re stronger than this,â€ and â€œyou need to calm downâ€ and â€œstop talking about what happened.â€ So I figured Iâ€™d post here for the first time.
