Should I seek help because of my thoughtsShould I get help?

Itâ€™s Christmas Eve and I thought being around family would help get me out of this rut Iâ€™ve been in for the last 5-6 months. 

Instead, I donâ€™t want to be around any of these people, I want to be alone even though I know I will just get depressed and smoke weed. I get very easily annoyed with them and hate them with everything in me but then I get sad that I feel this way. Fast forward about 20-30 mins and Iâ€™m back to a normal, neutral feeling. Or the complete opposite - I just love the person/People instead. (If that makes sense) 

Iâ€™ve been feeling the same way towards friends too, pushing away everyone and being distant. Iâ€™ve even told some friends that I hate them, but they usually take it as a joke and I just play it off.

Hobbies like music and the gym have become a chore. I have thoughts that my family and friends donâ€™t like me/trust me. I have suicidal thoughts throughout most days - popping up at random moments without any forethought (not all thoughts are like this). 

Is this in my head? Or am I just being a dick? Or should I actually seek help?
