People tell you that you're an attention seeker if you speak out because "a real suicidal person would just do it without saying anything" - and then after you die they ask themselves "why did they never say anything they seemed so happy"No one genuinely gives a fuck until youre dead and then they still only care for selfish reasons, so they can make themselves look empathetic and act like you were best friends while you were alive. But before you pull that trigger, jump off the bridge or in front of a train no one could give less fucks about you. The only reason Im still alive is pure spite.
