Iâ€™m worthless.Iâ€™m a husk of a person. I have nothing to offer. Iâ€™m uninteresting. Iâ€™m fat, ugly, and balding. Iâ€™m 25 and still a virgin. I donâ€™t even have the motivation to pursue a relationship. Iâ€™m in debt to a useless degree. I was stuck in a dead-end job before I got laid off. I see no future. Every aspect of my life is shit. All I do is smoke weed and sit on my computer to escape. If my mom wasnâ€™t still alive Iâ€™d hang myself right now. I know I need to stop getting high but I wonâ€™t. I know I need to eat well and exercise but I wonâ€™t. I know I need help but I just donâ€™t have the will.

Thanks for reading.
