Extremely toxic homophobic family really testing my limits. I thought I could handle anything. But I canâ€™t.Iâ€™ve been finding myself recently thinking about killing myself every single day all day. Thereâ€™s a strong voice in the back of my head constantly telling me it needs to happen. Iâ€™ve gone crazy. Iâ€™m the only child to controlling parents who are actually THE most homophobic people on this planet. I told my mom a month ago I wasnâ€™t interested in men and it was the last day I felt a single second of happiness in my body. Ever since then, sheâ€™s been threatening to kill her self if I continue down this path, making sure Iâ€™m aware Iâ€™ve caused her heart problems as proven by doctors, all the while threatening to tell my father about me if I continue. If he were to find out, either he would die first of a stroke or heâ€™d see red and kill me. I wish I could say Iâ€™m being dramatic or over exaggerating, but Iâ€™m not. Sheâ€™s been playing mind games on top of that, telling me Iâ€™m disgusting and dirty and need to go back to being the old, â€œpureâ€ me, and the next day cooking my favorite dish and pretending like nothing ever went wrong. When I naively think sheâ€™s taking steps to show me sheâ€™s slowly accepting, she literally just explains she has no idea what Iâ€™m talking about and everything is fine and Iâ€™m the same daughter sheâ€™s always known and Iâ€™ll find a man and sheâ€™s sure of it. When I tell her sheâ€™s driving me crazy and that thatâ€™s not how it works and Iâ€™m still not interested in men, the whole blood curdling screams @ me begin again and this cycle has happened every. single. day. I canâ€™t even begin to explain how insane this can make a person feel. Sheâ€™s also threatened to come to where I live at random times and just check on me and make sure Iâ€™m â€œmaking right choicesâ€, as in not having girls over or sheâ€™d most likely hurt us or herself in the process. Besides my mom and dad, I just have my aunt and uncle, and theyâ€™re homophobic as fuck too. Our dinner table conversations at times wrapped around how itâ€™s a shame how this country has even allowed gays to EXIST. I have no support system. These people love the fuck out of me and Iâ€™m their life, but only because they donâ€™t know who I really am. I look at them now as strangers and itâ€™s torn away every last piece of humanity in me. To see those closest to you as strangers, your mother who was your whole life and best friend before coming out as someone who sees you as her enemy, I have no hope in life. Iâ€™m dissociated at this point 24/7 and have no will to do anything but sleep. Iâ€™ll never get to rest. Theyâ€™ll follow me everywhere I go until the day they die, Iâ€™m the only one they have. Iâ€™ll never be able to be who I am and love who I love. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m going to hide my girlfriend any longer. I donâ€™t want to anymore. Iâ€™m expected to live a life of secrets and itâ€™s only going to get worse as theyâ€™ll push their agenda on me to get married sooner or later. Itâ€™s my birthday of 23 years and I honestly have no faith Iâ€™ll see 24 the way itâ€™s going. I donâ€™t see the point of living when Iâ€™m basically dead already. I know youâ€™ll all read this and want to give me hope and tell me it gets better and that theyâ€™ll cry when Iâ€™m gone, I get that. But I canâ€™t live like this knowing my family adores me and would literally lay their lives down for me but only because they love me conditionally, and once they find out about the true me theyâ€™ll want to rip me to shreds. Itâ€™s never going to end. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s worth it. I really donâ€™t.
