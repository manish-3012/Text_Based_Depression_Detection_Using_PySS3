Everythings goodI went through a really tough, depressing and fucked up 6 months. To keep it short and simple, im a straight guy who had a gay experience. I was weirded out by it and i hated it. Realising what i did that day put me through a lot of depression as i wasnt and still ament gay. I made it out to be the biggest deal and i felt like suicide was the only option to put me out of my misery. In my own time i come to the fact that everyone makes mistakes and this is one. Ive labelled the moment simply as a learning experience and moved on. I just laugh about it to myself now as i still wont tell anyone about it. I hope this can inspire people to pull through there hard times and to defeat whatever they are going through.
