Summary of my last post which I realized was too long. Help me! What the fuck do I do? Death seems like the most viable option :-(1. I lack some key social and practical skills.
2. I wasted my teen years.
3. I have a genetic condition that my 2 siblings don't which causes brain damage as I eat some things.
4. I get mocked for my lack of these skills in the family, and my little brother always comes off as more "big-brotherly" than me.
5. I am super weak and skinny because I eat too little to avoid brain damage. My little brother again has an upper hand there.
6. I have exactly 0 friends. Perfectly precise number.
7. I noticed that my IQ scores are getting lower.
8. I noticed that, when seen from outside, I appear almost drunk, shy, quiet, reserced.
8. I noticed that my brain functions very differently in these ways.
9. I'm super inconfident and can't defend myself. I usually stutter when I oppose something, and really can't get myself heard anyway. When we first meet, people think that I'm amazing, but then I act so nice that they start using me. I also automatically make a spectacle of myself in the process (especially in large groups). Then I try to defend myself, come off as rude and antagonistic, and push them away as a result.
10. My girlfriend is both using me for being such a pleaser and the relationship is kinda sufferring too because I don't know how to voice my concerns (calling her and not being able to say shit definitely doesn't help).
11. I found my girlfriend on Tinder on an account she accidentally kept running because she had opened it to find friends in a vacation spot.
12. I opened the Tinder account because I was too shy to meet girls in real life and I'm 17. Also, I spent like 400 Turkish liras on it, just to get a few matches. My first match, who was my GF, turned out to be the only one who would stick around.
13. My girlfriend and my brother are living the life with their friend groups while I'm here sitting at home crying (ever since I was a teenager).
14. I want to die.
