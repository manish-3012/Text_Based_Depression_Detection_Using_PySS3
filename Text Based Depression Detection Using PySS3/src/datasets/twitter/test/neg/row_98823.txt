All this indifference is getting to my nerves and it is making me want to fucking relapse.I feel the rage adding up inside me. At this point is a cruel joke that keeps repeating itself enough tines until i can resist it. Thats what my life is: an eternal cycle between feeling like a brick and like a flame out of control that consumes itself everytimw, each time more painful than the last.
