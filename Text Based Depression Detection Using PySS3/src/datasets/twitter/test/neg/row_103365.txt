I'll be alone forever and i dont want to be like this for another ~50 yearsWhat should i do when the only friend i've ever had, someone who i called a sister, someone who was the only person i've ever loved and cared about, someone who i shared my closest secrets and dreams with, just left me. With simple "i'm sorry anon, we cant talk anymore" and fucking bloked me in every socialmedia, just like this. Dude... All i ever wanted is to feel loved and needed and this is what i get? She was the only one who were holding me from ending this all, the time has come i guess...
