Is a person worth killing yourself over?I was with someone I thought was perfect, we fit together so well, but stress and resistance happened and she left...

I honestly feel this was the person for me in this world, everything clicked so well.

I just don't see why I shouldn't do it, I feel like I have lost the greatest gift I could have been given.
