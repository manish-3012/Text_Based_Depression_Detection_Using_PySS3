I canâ€™t forgive myselfIve had Inconsistent  suicide ideation since I was like 13/14 n Iâ€™m now 20. I feel so overwhelmed by life n so unaccomplished. Any small set back was the end of the world n I could not cope. Iâ€™ve also been on n off selfish n have defo made morally questionable choices. But two days ago I did something so vile n hurt someone I care about greatly. They said it was okay but it rlly was not. I canâ€™t forgive myself for hurting this person n contributing to their trauma. N they have even been trying to comfort me which makes it so much worse. I just donâ€™t know if I can live w myself or how to come back from this ? Im also failing uni. And I donâ€™t see a future for myself. Last night I took too many paracetamol n drank heavily n then called the ambulance who said Iâ€™d Be fine. N they asked me if I meant to hurt myself or if I was going to harm myself further. N I said no so they said Iâ€™d Be fine. But I feel like maybe I was ? And Iâ€™d written out a note just in case but I got scared. Idk I just rlly feel that I canâ€™t come back from this n I canâ€™t live w the guilt. And I just care so much for this person n I have become someone I hate and detest.
