I don't know anymoreDisclaimer: I'm drunk right now.

I really wish I could be my drunk self all the time, the life of the party, fun, friendly, approachable, everything.

I most likely need therapy but I literally can't explain my problems without my anxiety getting in the way and making it hard for me to be honest. Plus the process is too much work, I don't know. I have a good idea of what goes on therapy, they give you "homework", but I'm very aware of my exact problems and how to fix them, I'm just too far into my anxiety to actually do anything.

I went to this initial therapy meeting where they get a feel for what type of counseling you need, then after that they scheduled me for an appointment but I canceled it. I can't do this.

I've been shy my entire life and I don't feel like i can change. Everyone asks why I'm so quiet and I desperately wish I could be more fun.

All of my best memories take place when I'm drunk, and I feel like I'm half a step away from being an 18 year old alcoholic. For now I only drink on the weekends, but if I could be the person I was while drunk constantly then I would.

I'm so fucking tired of hearing corny bullshit advice like "fake it till you make it" I fucking can't. I can't. I can't. Every fiber of my being wants to be confident BUT I FUCKING CAN'T. I have no confidence, I have acquaintances but can never make real friends so...

Whether I die tonight or 70 years from now I'll be alone, so what's the difference?
