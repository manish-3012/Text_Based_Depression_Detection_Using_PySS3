Suicidal thoughts are backI tried to commit suicide 2,5 years ago by mixing large amounts of bromazepam  Spent a month in a hospital.
My life hasnt magically got better, if not, after first suicide attempt, im more emotional and vulnerable. Even the smallest stress has a huge impact on me. I have crisis. Ive been a patient of 5 different shrinks.
Nothing works. Meds dont work, im still a mess and ive come to the point of thinking that its no use to live if im going to spend it like this. Im 25 and still live with parents.
This time im really going to do it, waiting for dad to come home and take his medications for blood pressure and diabetes. I have a decent supply of risperdal, dormicum, prozac and xanax.It should work this time.
