I'm hoping the muscle relaxers will kill me.I haven't taken them yet. Currently sitting in my room with a bottle of water and a bottle of muscle relaxers. 

I'm just done with life. I don't have any value, and I'm just going to keep being in pain my entire life. Not being able to be who I truly am fucking sucks. I'm a trans man and I can't come out. I'll be kicked out and shunned by my family, so who cares if I'm dead? I'm a burden to people anyways. 

I'm holding the bottle in my hand right now. All it takes is ten seconds.
