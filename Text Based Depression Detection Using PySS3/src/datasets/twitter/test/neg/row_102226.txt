I cant take more painMy life has been pain for so long. everyone ive trusted has (in some combination) hurt me, raped me, abused me and eventually left me. Ive had depression since I was 13, and between that and other mental disorders i cant keep friendships going. i have no one. I have nothing. Ive tried to end it twice and hesitated but I can't take any more. I'm soon to be alone again, I'm fairly sure, and that means the end of the one reason I had to stick around. I dont know what to do I just want the pain to stop. I dont want to die but I dont know what will happen. please help me. please. the pain and sadness are so intense I keep wavering between getting sick and sobbing and I just want it all to stop. Im sory for asking here, Im not actively attempting this or anything I just dont knoiw where else to go
