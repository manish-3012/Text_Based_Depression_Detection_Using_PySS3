It'll Be On A Lonely Night16 m, I've decided I'll finally do it. I'm planning on doing it either Saturday or next week. I've lost all will to live and I'm only digging my hole deeper. Every day I make a new mistake that handicaps my future. I feel so dead inside. What's worse is I know I deserve this. I know it's my fault that I'm like this, it just sucks being so self conscience. I'm always thinking about how when people talk to me and smile at me I'm always just a blank face that blends in with the background. I feel like I was an error and I'm not meant to be here. Nothing interests me anymore and I don't have anyone to talk to IRL. My friends and family wouldn't understand or be able to help because I always pretend to be a different person in public. I smile when I need to smile and speak when spoken to. I just don't fit in this world. The only reason I made it this far is because of the drug abuse (THC, Xanax, Addy, Vyvanse, Vicodin, Oxy, Acid tabs, soon to be heroin)    and someone I still care about. I've come to love being high and I'm always looking for ways to get higher than I've ever been before. That someone and I don't talk anymore but to me it seems like we both want to. It sounds really pathetic and clichÃ© but it's honestly true. I've known her since 5th grade and we've both become completely different people, or fakes. I remember I used to be the happy one and she was hurting, but now it's reversed. I can't look at her without wanting to cry. She seems happy now but I can see she's still hurting a bit.  I can't bring myself to confront her and she can't either. We always just meet each other's eyes and I remember the way things used to be. No matter what happens it's too late for me. I just feel like someone should know how I truly felt before I'm gone.
