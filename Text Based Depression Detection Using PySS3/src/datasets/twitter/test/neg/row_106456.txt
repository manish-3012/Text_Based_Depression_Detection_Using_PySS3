My parents are embarrassed by my diagnosis (PTSD/Major depressive disorder)It occurred to me last night when they both told me not to say a word to anyone (not even family) about my diagnosis or that iâ€™m taking meds, because they will start to look at me negatively. It honestly makes me feel worse knowing that my own parents are ashamed of me, even though it isnâ€™t my fault. Kind of makes me want to stop taking meds.
