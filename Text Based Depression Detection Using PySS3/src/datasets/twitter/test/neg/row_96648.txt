How should I go about actually offing myself?Life is SHIT. I've spent the last ten years regretting my failure to off myself, and what better way to fix that than never ringing in another shitty, terrible decade ever again?

The sad thing is I'm not sure how to go about it.  I don't have anything out of the ordinary, and I have no celing hanging options to opt for a belt-noose.  Ideas?
