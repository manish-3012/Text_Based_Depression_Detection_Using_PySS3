Note.Adding more and more things as the days go by to the note thatâ€™s to be read after Iâ€™m gone. Itâ€™s tough but itâ€™s what I have to do. Iâ€™m alone. 

On another note, dreams can be so cruel. They can give you such joy in the forms of things or people you desire or love, and then everything is completely taken from you once you wake and you just have to sit there realizing that life is still painful and youâ€™ll never be happy again.
