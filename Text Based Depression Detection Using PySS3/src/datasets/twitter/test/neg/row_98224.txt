Alcoholic depressed uncle on the verge, advice?Throwaway. I don't know if this is the right subreddit so feel free to point me elsewhere.

My uncle has been an alcoholic pretty much all his life. At this point though, he can't eat or even really interact with people without picking a fight and getting his ass beat. He sleeps in his car most nights not because he has no choice, but because he just doesn't bother to go to a friend's or just get a hotel. Hasn't had a job in maybe a year, been in and out of rehab but always checks himself out and goes back to drinking. Family has all tried to take him in but he eventually overstays his welcome by drinking and picking fights with neighbors, yelling at all hours and generally being a giant asshole.

After his dad died 2 years ago he's talked often about suicide and attempted once but was talked down by neighbors/cops.

I just heard that he's saying goodbye to his relatives and passed a message along to me. I've slowly realized that he was an all around shitty guy and was always mean to everyone, including me although maybe less so because I was a kid at the time. That makes me want to ignore the whole situation because I've never really known him well and I don't think he knows me really either. In fact, I'd say he's been nothing but a bad influence, although funny at times. In a dark, assholish way.
I guess I'm asking for advice - I feel like I should do something... I can't give him purpose in life or stop him from drinking or anything, but I also find it hard to just sit around waiting for him to kill himself or die of liver failure.

I know it's not really my responsibility nor my decision, but... I guess I just want to hear what people here have to say. If there's anything that could be done or said to help... whatever that even means.

Anyways, thanks for reading.
