I've got a dilemmaI have been suffering alot lately. With breathing, anxiety and depression. Its way worse than before. I get so exhausted that I can't move. I feel like I am unable to breathe. I am so tired of feeling this way. Being anxious 24/7 and feeling depressed. I've decided that I don't want to continue to suffer anymore and end my pain. This is what I've been wanting for the longest time. Ever since I was 14. I was never successful at this because I was unsure, I guess. I am more tired then ever now and I have pictured my death more then 10 times a day. 

But this is my dilemma. I met someone a few weeks ago and he says that he likes me alot. I ask him what's there to like about me and he says that it's because I'm gentle and nice. I don't see it but those few words made me feel nice. But I'm going to hurt him, that's for sure. I'm evil and not nice. I'm definitely not going to be worth anyone's time.

I also got closer to my friends. We became closer through clubbing. We planned other stuff to do like discovering new bars in the future. I was actually really looking forward to that. I discovered that I loved drinking and feeling high and partying wth my friends. It made me happy for that short period of time. I want our plans to happen. But, I somehow feel like it won't matter. I feel like I'm doing all of this to forget the pain. And this will all be temporary. 

In my mind im thinking that this life is definitely not worth it. And to end the pain forever is to end my life. I am packing my things because I dont want any of my stuff to be kept. I want to be forgotten. This is what I want. Theres still time to change my mind, but I'm scared. I'm scared of prolonging the pain and feeling worse. I don't know what to do.
