I was hereI messed everything up with my best friend of 17 years and they're the only one I have. Or had.  My dog is dead and he's the one I really lived for because I had to be there for him.  I'm just done.  I want my friend to know I love them and that I'm sorry and none of this is on them.  I didn't expect it to make it past 25, so this has all been extra.  I've done my good in the world and I feel ok with that.

I came.  I saw.  I will be back.
