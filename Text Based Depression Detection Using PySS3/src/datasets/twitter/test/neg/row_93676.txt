Really tired everybody included reddit users don't pay me attention.Like is not enough my parents dont pay me attention i have to deal with reddit and every online person nobody wants to talk with me, i don't talk nothing interesting. I'm so annoying, I want to over with this so badly. I can't fucking believe i'm too bad communicating with everybody. I Feel like that ebony girl from american horror story s1, i'm fucking boring not for one or two person, i'm boring for EVERYBODY. 

I just want to be the attention whore for a minute, for a second i want to be popular and loved by a lot of people. That's my only wish
