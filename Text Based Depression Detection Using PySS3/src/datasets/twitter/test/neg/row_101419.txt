My five month old suicide noteIâ€™m 18 and not once have I felt fucking normal on this earth. Never fitted in, always left out. My friends arenâ€™t my friends. All I am is a punching bag to them. I have no friends, no relationships besides my nanny. All I think about is not being here. What if I wasnâ€™t? All I am is a burden to everyone.

My exam results have only gone down over the years and Iâ€™ve failed this years without even getting the results. Iâ€™m already repeating a year. A repeat fucking dropout? Would you be proud of me if I was your son ? Iâ€™m not an academic person and Iâ€™ve explained this to my parents but they donâ€™t listen, both graduates from university, sister currently at uni. All they know is education education education. ITS NOT ME 

My dad hounds me and hounds me. Iâ€™ve stopped playing sports and he fucking hates me for
It. I can tell heâ€™s disappointed, I can see it. All I do is fucking work. Shop 4 times a week and working in the bar till 2 am on minimum wage. I canâ€™t take it anymore, I canâ€™t. I lie in bed constantly exhausted. No more gym, nothing. I hate myself for forgetting about the gym. I have the body of a 14 year old girl as Iâ€™ve been told by my â€˜friendsâ€™.

Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts since I was 14. Fantasying about Cutting myself and ending it. These were just thoughts. But around October 2018 I met a girl while working in the bar. I hadnâ€™t seen her in around a year and she transformed into the most beautiful girl I had ever seen, perfection. I got that special feeling as soon as I saw her at the bar. Her eyes were so big , so pure and so blue with her shoulder cut hair and edgy/unique style. I used to work with her best friend so she got me talking to her. I donâ€™t if itâ€™s possible to fall In love with someone after meeting once one on one, or if itâ€™s just obsession. For the first time ever I got that feeling and I still have it months after weâ€™ve stopped talking. She was just out of a relationship of two years and wasnâ€™t ready for anything. I hid my feelings for too long and fell in love with her. We were exclusive but she would go out and get with someone; actually the same person multiple times + her ex boyfriend at the same time , and me. I couldnâ€™t let go of her. She was and still is  my everything. Constant fall outs and fights and not being â€˜ready for a relationship â€˜ led to her going  on a date with her ex ex boyfriend and didnâ€™t tell me. I couldnâ€™t take the up and down swings of us anymore. 1 month later theyâ€™re in a relationship. Iâ€™ve never gotten over you E, I would do anything to hold you in my arms again, to have a cigarette, to hear your laugh , your voice; you. The things you say and the way you say them but why ? Why would u do that to me ? I wouldâ€™ve done anything for you, I gave my everything but it still wasnâ€™t enough. Thanks for the good memories that we had, Iâ€™ll take them with me wherever I go.

This is fully my decision. Mum  you did try. You tried to understand what was going on and Iâ€™ll always be thankful for that. Dad thereâ€™s a lot more to life than money. Happiness or being content is all I ever wanted. H you were a good sister, you always looked out for me, in your own bitchy way but you can achieve anything you can put your mind to. Iâ€™ve never belonged anywhere. Iâ€™m not suppose to be here and Iâ€™ve reliased that and accepting it. The only person I genuinely like is my nanny but she has heavy dementia and a severe heart problem. I hope your number of days left greatly exceed mine. You are an amazing woman and that will never been forgotten. 

Iâ€™m sorry. 

Iâ€™m sorry. 

Iâ€™m sorry.

ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜€: I planned to end everything on the 1st of June after my exams had finished. On the 30th of May my mum told me I had a doctors appointment that day. I decided why not? I was put on 30 mg mitrazaphine for around 5 months. I reconnected with an old friend over the summer and have been best friends since. His best friends become my best friends. I finally felt like I belonged in a group a people. We all liked rap, fashion and being weird + ourselves; stuff people where Iâ€™m from arenâ€™t into. That summer has been the best of my life.  I went to concerts +raves and starting smoking weed and took mdma a few times  and some of my best memories are due to drugs. If used properly they really can be life changing. Without school I couldnâ€™t become a nurse, my dream job. I quit both of my terrible jobs and went for a job that will lead me to nursing within two years. And I got it, first time being fully independent and I couldnâ€™t be in a better position if I planned. I have MY friends, MY career and my own control of my Happiness. Iâ€™ve stopped my medication with the doctors approval and Iâ€™ve never felt better. 

Give life that chance. Please,
Thanks for reading
