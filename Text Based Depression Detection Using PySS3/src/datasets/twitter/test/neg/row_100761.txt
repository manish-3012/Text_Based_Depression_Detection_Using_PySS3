How to have a conversation about my suicide attempt with a family member?About 13months ago I attempted suicide. I have mild PTSD from the experience, and often have panic attacks that SEEM to be brought on by triggers of some kind. The issue is that I can't recognize my panic "triggers" because I'm missing 5 days of memory. It's this weird fog where I get a tiny glimpse of a memory but I can't really place anything about it. I remember taking like 300 pills, and waking up in the hospital 5 days later full of IV's and with an intibation tube down my throat. 

My therapist thinks that the only way I'll be able to fully move on and heal from the experience is if I get an idea of what exactly happened. She thinks hearing about the event might jog my memory in a way that would help me piece together these tiny snippets of memory. I currently have no idea who found me, how long it took them to find me, whether or not I was conscious, ect. I know that I was vomitting everywhere, and that I had to be flown via helicopter to the nearest large city for medical assistance because my city's hospital wasn't equiped. That's the extent of what I know. 

My triggers seem random and sporadic, the only things I can clearly recognize as triggers are seeing people foaming at the mouth, and the idea/mental image of swallowing poison. The only person who knows what happened fully is my mom, but I have no idea how to ask her about it. We haven't talked about it at all since it happened. I don't wanna just ambush her in the car or something, but I also don't want it to get too serious. I just need simple answers.

TLDR; Does anyone have any advice on bringing up a conversation about my suicide attempt with a family member?
