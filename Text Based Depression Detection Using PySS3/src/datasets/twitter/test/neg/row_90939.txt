I'm so afraid of the future, I don't want to see itI'm on a lot of support forums throughout the internet. I'm 23, F, and live in the USA. As a lot of you may know, our country is pretty damn shitty right now. I have no idea how or when my life could be affected by political change, or the crashing economy. I had dreams (keyword: had) that feel more and more crushed every day.

I can't find a job, and there seem to be no opportunities for me after I finish school either. I'm so stressed out that I've started cutting myself again. If I can't handle my stress now, then I know I'll never be able to handle the WORSE stress that will come as I get older.

A growing part of me is wanting to just stop. My country's future looks bleak and I don't want to see it. Even if it does improve, it probably won't be until I'm old.
