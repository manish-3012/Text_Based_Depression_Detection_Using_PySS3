Dont know what to do (confused)I'm very depressed and have suicidal thoughts. The tricky part is that I dont feel like capable of committing to it, but I wish I could. So in a weird and dumb way I wish i was suicidal enough to be able to kill myself.
Now here's my problem, every single source I research states that one of the most important steps in dealing with those thoughts it's to share then with someone. However, not only I dont feel comfortable talking to anyone about it, the fact that I'm not really that close to killing myself makes me feel really silly (how can I say to someone I want to kill myself if deep down I know i won't)
Also I do have a therapist but I only have an appointment later this week, I would also feel bad texting him or calling since is late.
To finish this badly written rant, I don't even know what's the purpose this post, it's not like I can have a conversation about private matters with random people online (not because it's impossible, but I just again feel very uncomfortable).
Maybe just typing some stuff will help an little bit, or not. I'm so lost, never felt worse and can't even cry about it.
Apologies for any mistakes, english is not my first language and it's a difficult topic.
