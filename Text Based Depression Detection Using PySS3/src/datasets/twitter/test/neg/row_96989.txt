dude, help medude, right in the morning i was like thinking about this two girls i was talking to. so i fuckin opened the stories of one of them, and i saw how she's happy about a guy that is treating her so well (i don't actually treat her like the princess she is). ok: so i started thinking like "at least i have the other girl". in the evening, after my job, i asked this other girl if we were going to see each other at saturday. AND SHE SAID SHE IS FUCKIN DATING NOW. like dude, i lost two girls in one day???? im freaking out now!! im not fine...
