Trying to give my daughter a better future by taking myself out of itIâ€™m almost 24, and Iâ€™m at the crossroads in time where if I take my self out now, my daughter wonâ€™t have any memories of me being an utterly Shitty mom. 

Iâ€™ve struggled with depression most of my life..somehow managed to have a relationship I got way too invested in over several years.. of course that didnâ€™t work out. Iâ€™m drowning in debt, I work as a nurse so I give and give and give just to be shit on by patients and coworkers only to come home and be completely overwhelmed as a mom. Iâ€™m short tempered, impatient and I know my child deserves a better parent. 

Iâ€™m at the point now where Iâ€™m okay with killing myself for the sake of my daughter.. I know her dad will be able to find someone else because heâ€™s fairly normal.. I know I will only get worse.. Iâ€™ve tried medications, Iâ€™ve tried therapy but I feel like I just talk about nothing at this point. 
Financially I canâ€™t make any moves, and emotionally I have absolutely nothing left to give. I donâ€™t want a life where I am only alive because others donâ€™t want me to die.. I donâ€™t feel like I am wrong for wanting to rid myself before I Fuck up my kid.. if an appliance is broken and youâ€™ve done everything to troubleshoot it and itâ€™s still fucked you just toss it... right? 

I donâ€™t think there is any happy light in tunnel and I will only bring my episodes that will fuck up my kid in the future.
