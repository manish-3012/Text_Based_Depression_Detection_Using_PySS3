Had some days off from work to realize something...The last years have been tough. I worked pretty much all year but decided to get 3 days off for when itâ€™s my birthday. At first my boss told me I couldnâ€™t take days off at that time but surprisingly their view changed and I got to be at home for a long weekend basically. I didnâ€™t do anything, just played video games, was alone and enjoyed it. I actually didnâ€™t want to die after waking up (which I normally always feel, even on the weekend). After there were only 2 more days till monday everything went back to normal and everything turned grey again. I really donâ€™t think itâ€™s my job that trying to kill me but rather the disability to just be and surround myself with thinks I like while also having enough time to manage my depression/anxiety and OCD. I really canâ€™t think about any future where my life basically consists of me having some days off from work to feel alive 20/365 days. It sucks... sorry for the rant. Just felt like getting that of my chest. If thatâ€™s really all which is waiting for me thereâ€™s no hope...

Throwaway cause I am too insecure.
Thanks for reading.
