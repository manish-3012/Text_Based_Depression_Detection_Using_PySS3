everything hurtsi don't know what to do to fix how i feel besides getting away from my transphobic parents (since i'm non-binary) and i don't have enough money and i hate having to go to community college because i kind of tried to kill myself last year and i hate feeling like every day is exactly the same and i hate that i'm eating healthy and working out and taking antidepressants and everything and it still hurts every day and i don't want to live like this anymore please what do i do to make it stop hurting i don't know what i did to deserve this i want things to get better and i'm trying really, really hard but it hasn't gotten better and i think maybe it's because i'm bad and evil and i deserve it. i just want to be happy and i'm tired of waking up to every day being exactly like the last and i know i keep repeating myself but i don't know what to do anymore and i'm so tired of being so sad all the time
