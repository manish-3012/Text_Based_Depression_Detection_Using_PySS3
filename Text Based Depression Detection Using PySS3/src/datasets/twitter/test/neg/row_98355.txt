I think this is a cry for helpI sat in the bathroom last night with the blade between my fingers. I told myself he would burst through the doors any second now, grab onto me and force the terrible tool out of my grasp. He'd hug me and stroke my hair all while whispering how much he loves me, how much he cares. I'm so important to him, he can't live without me.

I forgot that he lives 5,676.94 miles away from me and that he's probably at work or walking the dog. And then I just wanted to die more. Because he is so far away and I don't even love him I think. Because I can't feel love anymore. And he suffers when I yell about the girls who blocked me on instagram. I've broken up with him more times than I can count and we are always back together. We want to get married someday. He bought me a ring when we were 17. The last time we were together I yelled at him because he couldn't open a can. Because I'm such a monster. The last time we were together we laughed so hard I cried, and then I cried for real in the snow. He told me he would never leave me. I made him promise he would if I ever went too far. I always go too far.

I thought about all of that while I tried to bleed out last night. No one ever came to save me. The last time he would have ever kissed me would have been in an airport. I was shaking into his arms. I had a panic attack in the airport and he got mad. I wanted him to hold me but he thought it was his fault. I just didn't want to leave! I thought about will tell him when I die. How long it would take for someone to call him, to even realize he mattered. 

Before I called an uber to the ER (yeah I did I can't afford an ambulance!), I lost a lot of blood. I was drunk and high and I can't remember which pills I took, maybe aspirin...but I swear I felt him holding me. And I could almost see him. like he existed between something invisible. I get that sometimes when I wake up still half asleep. We say thats when our souls go to visit each other in our dreams. Sometimes I talk to him when he's not there. 

They didn't commit me and maybe I wish they had, but I'm home now with stitches that cost more than I can afford. I called in sick for work. 

How long will it take for my work to notice I'm dead? 

I'm gonna call him and pretend I just couldn't sleep. I need to hear his voice one last time before I go. I'll talk to my parents too, and my brother, but really I only miss him. And I'll miss him forever, or, hopefully, when I die I won't feel like this anymore. Hopefully I will just disappear.
