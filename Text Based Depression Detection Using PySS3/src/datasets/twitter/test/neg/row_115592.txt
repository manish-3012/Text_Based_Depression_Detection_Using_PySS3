Why live?I'm a 25 year old male, working a dead end job. I've had it good in life, but I've also had it bad. More so bad than good.

In the end, my life is meaningless. The universe is so big and im so small. So why do people push this idea that life has some meaning? If I was to not exist, within 5 years most people would forget I ever existed. Within 40 years, id be totally forgotten. So why should I go on living?

But life has its good moments! Sure, about 20% of the time. Why go on with 20-60 years of 80% of the time being shit? That 20% is not worth it in my opinion.

Life is suffering with brief but fleeting moments of happiness. So why can't I just end it? Why do people react so negative to someone not wanting to exist?
