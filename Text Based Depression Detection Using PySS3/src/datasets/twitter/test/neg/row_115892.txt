If a person have no idea what suicide is, can that person commit suicide?I was wondering why do i feel suicidal everyday. When i first came across the term suicide in my childhood, i never cared about it. But when i had failures in my life, i kept thinking suicide as an option. I then started to have repeated thoughts of suicide, whenever i fail or felt humiliated. Why?

My brain would have created a new neural connection for suicide when i heard it the first time. Over time whenever i failed in important things in my life, the neural connection for suicide might been activated every time. My brain could have then made that neural connection stronger and stronger making it an easily accessible option whenever i failed in something. (Cognitive ease could be the culprit).

May the right answer would be think rationally and not emotionally whenever someone feels suicidal.

**I don't know, may be i am getting mentally sick as day progresses (or) may be i am going through five stages of death. I keep having these weird thoughts.**
