I'm being accused of something that I never did and I don't want to exist anymore because people think I did it.I am not ready to say what it is but it eats at me everyday and I really just do not want to be here anymore.  I don't like being accused of things, I don't like rumors, I don't like any of this. It feels like it's not worth it to keep living life. I try to ignore it but I can't, life is so hard, it's exhausting.  Imagine being accused of one of the worst things possible and knowing that you are a good person on the inside but you still feel like somewhere down the line you went wrong and deserve it for some reason.  I have anxiety and depression so this situation does not help at all.  I don't know what to do anymore but I do not want to be here.  I wish things got better, I don't think they will ever. It's been almost a year and things have been so shit everyday, I'm about to graduate university and that doesn't even excite me.  I don't want to leave my family behind and feel selfish but I feel like this pain is just so unbearable.  Life sucks
