The time will comeI'm going to do it.  Not this year, probably, but eventually.  I am making the choice to chose to exit on my own.  It feels empowering to know it is in my hands.  I don't want to spend another 40 or 50 years like this.

So hurrah for me, I can chose to not deal with all the stupid shit.  I'm pretty much over living I guess.  Feels good to know how its gonna end.
