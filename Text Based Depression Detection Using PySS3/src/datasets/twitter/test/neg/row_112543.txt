I'm stuck and I don't see another way out.The things I am...
A mom to three beautiful kids who deserve a mom so much better than me
A wife to a man who is always hopeless but refuses to get help, who makes my pain about him because he has to try so hard to accomplish small things in life and it devastates him
A daughter to a woman who thinks of me as an overdramatic boat anchor (who only keeps connection to me for a connection to my kids) and a man who ruthlessly abused me for years and then used questionable medical treatments to erase his memories of what he did
A daughter in law to a man and a woman who have treated me very poorly, used me to get to my husband after he went NC with them (for how they treated me) and scare me (FIL screams at me and slams doors)

I'm so damaged there's nothing worthwhile about me.  I can't make friends because most people think me too intense.  I'm 60% disabled by fibromyalgia, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety and PTSD so I can't collect disability but I can't work because of my crippling anxiety in workplaces.  I'm agoraphobic but SO LONELY.  

And now I can't finish my degree because I'm too stupid to understand a low level math class.  My family would be better off without me.
