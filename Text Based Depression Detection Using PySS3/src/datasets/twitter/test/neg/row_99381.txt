Ö¹I hate this shit of a life, i hate how i feel, who the fuck programmed me like this???. And the worst parts is, you when the protagonist in a movie/video is forced to watch someone they love die and not being able to do anything. Well i feel the exact opposite, i want to hug my loved ones and tell them everything, but thers a glass wall thats stopping me. It feels like a cage i built around me that i cant brake no matter what.
