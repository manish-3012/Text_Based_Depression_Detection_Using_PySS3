GoalYesterday was the worst day of my life. As you can tell by my last post I was very upset. I like to post my emotions here where no one can hurt me. As someone who has been overweight their whole life, I'm getting ripped just to prove to the girl who broke my heart that I could do it. Even tho thats probably not even why she didn't give me a chance. I'm just a "best friend". I am going to go nuts in the gym now before I commit. One last goal. And then it's over. Thank you all
