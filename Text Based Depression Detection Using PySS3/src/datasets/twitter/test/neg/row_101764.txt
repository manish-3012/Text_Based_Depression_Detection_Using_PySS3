just another postjust another human being who feels worthless. im just your typical worthless loser with no job, pan handles to feed an addiction, living at home now mooching off of a sick parent who has spent more time in a hospital now than a doctor himself. lately i am just counting down the minutes til i get the balls to kill myself.
