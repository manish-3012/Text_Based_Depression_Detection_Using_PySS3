itâ€™s getting harder to hold onitâ€™s getting harder to want to live. normally i still want to live, i just want the pain to stop. but recently, when i thought things were okay, theyâ€™ve come crashing down and now i donâ€™t wanna keep getting hurt. i donâ€™t want to be hurt anymore. i just want to be free of pain. i donâ€™t know if itâ€™s going to get better. i think itâ€™s approaching time and iâ€™m scared.
