22m, very lost at the moment.My girlfriend and I have been together for four years, we're both 22, and recently we've taken a break away from each other. Not seeing other people or anything, but just getting some time apart. We've been a bit distant from each other before the break, but we're both studying and are fairly stressed with that, so I just put it down to that. 
I've always had depression symptoms, and never really went and saw anyone about them, but about a month ago (a week after the break started) I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and now I can't stop thinking about ending my life. I've been struggling with being separated my partner, and she's told me the other day that she's not sure she want's us to be together anymore. 
My life just doesn't feel worth it at the moment, and I don't know what to do. The more I try and take my mind off it, the more I think about it and I get into these places where I just can't control my emotions at all and nothing at all can cheer me up. 
I want to sort myself out before I get back with her, but at the moment I feel like if I take the time to do that, she won't be there at the other end, and I'm not sure that's something that I can handle. 
I'm not sure what I'm really asking here, but I just needed somewhere to write this because I feel like I have no outlet at the moment.
