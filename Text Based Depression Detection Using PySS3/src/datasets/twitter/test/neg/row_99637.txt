I think I might kill myself.I've been thinking about it a lot recently. Something big and negative happened in my life recently and it's rocked my life. My only way of coping has been self harming, and more recently it hasn't been doing the job as well as it had been. I feel so alone. I don't really have anything in my life worth mentioning. I don't have a job, and anxiety and low mood prevents me even considering getting one. I don't have any friends. I don't socialise. I just stay in my house with my two dogs. I know I should be grateful for what I have, but I'm not. I cry all the time. I self harm more but even that doesn't seem to be working any more. I know how I would do it, and I know it would be successful. I live alone so no one would be able to stop me or save me. It would be quite quick. It would hurt, but not for long. I've been self harming for 13 years. I've been "mentally ill" for more than half of my life, and I'm really not that old. No amount of tablets, therapy, hospital treatment etc has ever helped. I am one of those lost causes people talk about. I've been told by professionals that I'm a waste of time and resources. I'm just so tired and lonely. I don't think there is another way out of this for me. I feel ready for this to end.
