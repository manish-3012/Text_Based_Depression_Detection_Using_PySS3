I can't do thisYesterday the thought of my failed suicide attempt appeared again in my head and I just can't remove it. 
I've cut myself hoping that doing so was going somehow to help me but now I only feel worse, I just want everything to stop.
I'll try to get some sleep now, it's almost 4 am and I have to go to work at 8
