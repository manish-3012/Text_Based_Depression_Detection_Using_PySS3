I am on an islandI feel really alone. I am finishing out grad school right now and I feel like I have been left on an island. I am the first person in my family to go to college and I finished. No one prepares you for the fact that doing this is uncomfortable. I feel like I grew up too poor and around uneducated people to relate to my peers and now I feel like I don't relate to my dad and my old friends anymore nearly as much so here I am. I feel like I screwed myself by pursuing all this and I hate it like I just want to press the reset button.
