the user in charge of this account is currently in a coma after an attempt.my husband stayed logged in and i figured i would let you all know and ask for some emotional support. My husband had attempted earlier tonight, and i walked in on him going down. i called the emergency services, and they took him in. he was critical when he arrived. i am currently unable to keep him around due to lack of funding. after about a month they will have to pull the plug if he doesn't wake up. i was wondering if there was any way to find a capable hospital to cover him through his insurance. it's not looking good for him and i am gonna be holding out, as he's quite resilient and has survived worse attempts. i am sorry if this does not follow the guidelines, and if the mods would prefer i can put it on r/SuicideBereavement if needed.
