Everybody at new school tells me to kill myself. I'm starting to believe them.I never thought I would be posting here 2 months ago. 
First, a little background. Part of my dad's job is moving overseas frequently. As a result, I've switched schools more than 9 times in the past nine years, and very infrequently live anywhere longer than a year. 
He retired recently, and now we are living in a slow town where we won't have to move for the forseeable future. Because of this, I don't have to switch schools for the rest of my high school career (I'm a sophomore). 

Now keep in mind that because I have moved so often, I am *extremely* adept to figuring out how to fit in and make friends quickly. Nearly every single time I've moved I have a small group of friends by the end of a few months.

This time, however, I thought everything would be just as it was in the past. Unfortunately, this is not the case. 

Everyday, I am incessantly mocked and scrutinized. I don't know whether or not I should call it bullying because I actually feel threatened by everybody. People everyday tell me to kill myself. Drink bleach. I'm *autistic*. **AUTISTIC?** People are willing to stoop this low?

At first I just brushed it off. The first step to acceptance is denial, right? Then, someone new showed up.

This person is the worst of them all. He takes pictures of me. He'll come up to me with the picture up on his phone and say "Look how autistic you are jppdan". He somehow got my number and sends me pictures of myself doing ordinary things saying "Kill yourself". He is very influential in the school, and people seem to really respect him. 

What should I do? I have a few people who are actually nice to me, but it seems like almost everybody unanimously agrees that I need to drink bleach.
