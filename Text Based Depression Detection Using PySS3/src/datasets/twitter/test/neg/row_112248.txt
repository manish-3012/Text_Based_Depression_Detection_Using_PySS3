Canâ€™t sleep anymore, I have constant thoughts of killing myself.I donâ€™t know how to start this, I guess Iâ€™ll start from my childhood (I am 30 now). My life has pretty much been shit since I was born. My mother was a prostitute and I donâ€™t know my father. As a kid weâ€™d move around a lot, chasing men in prison, my mom would steal and take from her kids to support these pieces of shit. My sister and I raised ourselves from as early as I can remember. My mom would go to the jail, steal, and do drugs before coming home late at night, this left me at home, usually alone. I guess this is where my mental issues began, I never really developed social skills or had friends. If I was lucky Iâ€™d have a friend, maybe 2 in each city we moved to. My mom would also beat us and abuse us verbally. She would call me a faggot and a piece of shit. She would tell me I was never going to be anything, this would continue into high school. Being treated this way really fucks with you. Your parent should never treat you this way. I feel the way I was treated led to my depression and anxiety problems.

Now to the more recent issues. I grew up never feeling loved, so when I found a girl I fell in love and we had 2 kids. I love them with all my heart and thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve ever wanted.... was to be loved and love someone. I have been in a relationship for nearly 10 years... but I have been cheated on twice and have trust issues and feel like I canâ€™t ever trust anyone now. Both times I was cheated on with one of her coworkers and found out on my own, I was never told until later by her. The fact is that Iâ€™ve had a shitty life and this shit just piles on. I donâ€™t have friends or family to talk to, so I sit with my thoughts all day everyday which drives me insane. I have got about 5 hours of sleep in 72 hours so I donâ€™t know if any of this shit makes sense. Iâ€™ve been researching ways to kill myself the past few hours and have thought about suicide frequently since I was 12. I love my children and definitely think about them, but at this point theyâ€™re the only good things in my life. I donâ€™t have friends, I donâ€™t have a family, and my girlfriend or whatever she is is a piece of shit. I have no where else to go so Iâ€™m stuck living with her. Iâ€™m just tired and stressed out, I just want this to all be over with... I love my kids but Iâ€™m sure if they were older they might understand why I hate my life.
