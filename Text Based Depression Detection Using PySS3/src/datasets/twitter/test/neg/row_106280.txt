I want to take all of my xanax and cetalopram at once.I have nothing left to live for. My boyfriend of 10 years told me he doesn't love me anymore and even said that I'm too heavy to be with him (I'm 15 lbs over weight and am working on it).

I feel like my whole life is crumbling. My friends and family would never believe it. I am just sitting here awake at night thinking about what's keeping me from swallowing it all at once. 

I never thought I'd have the courage to do it, but tonight might be the night.
