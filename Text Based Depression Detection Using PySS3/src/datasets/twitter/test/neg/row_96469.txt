Five reasonsSomeone give me five reasons not to do it. I have no futer. I have almost no friends. My family is disfunctional and prettymuch hates me. Ive been having these thoughts for years and if anything theyve gotten worse. I try to distract myself from them with video games and shit, but that doesnt always work and is making the situation with the parentals worse. And a final note, i am not accepting chliche as fuck stuff like "things will get better" or "youre stronger than this" or "God loves you" (atheist btw)
