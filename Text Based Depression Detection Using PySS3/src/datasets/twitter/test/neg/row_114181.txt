Fairly certain suicide is how I will die.I'm generally happy, but I still want to kill myself. 

I guess I do have a lot of worries about my future. I have a pretty good social life, and a great girlfriend, but soon I will have to go to college and start all over and leave all of those people behind. I'm so attached to them I honestly don't know how I'm going to handle saying goodbye. 

I wish that I could just die now. I see no reason to keep living. I don't think I have a bad life ahead of me, or currently. I just don't want to be alive. 

My mom recently told me that if anything fatal happened to me, her life would be over. So I guess I'll have to wait a very long time until my parents are dead. So as of now, my plan is to kill myself once they die. Hopefully I will distance myself far enough from anyone else at that point so nobody misses me. 

Or maybe by then I'll change my mind. Who knows. But as of now, I am quite certain that I will die by suicide.
