I canâ€™t sleep anymoreIâ€™m pretty exhausted but I physically canâ€™t fall asleep. I highly doubt Iâ€™ll make it to Christmas even though I planned for after it. So many people have made empty promises to me to the point where I donâ€™t give a fuck about anything that comes out of anyoneâ€™s mouth. Iâ€™m ready for this man. The only reason Iâ€™m still keeping a job is to build up some savings to pass down to the only person deserving of it. I just hope they are able to enjoy life the way I couldnâ€™t.
