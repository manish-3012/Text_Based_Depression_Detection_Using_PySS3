After a short life full of death, deception and misery, I give up.Iâ€™m 23 but I feel like Iâ€™m a 63 year old man with PTSD. I donâ€™t typically believe in woe is me but today I nearly destroyed my table because Iâ€™m just so unbelievably frustrated and mentally exhausted. I wrote this today..

â€œHonestly, I am a worldwind of emotions right now. A pending matter, an injury that has left me unable to work daily at the moment, leaving me broke. I feel alone and honestly the only thing stopping me from suicide is the fact that my mother has already had to bury a son. Itâ€™s one thing to be out of place somewhat mentally, but to be physically unable to provide for myself has pushed me to the edge. I was already mentally coping with the death of my father and murder of my brother but today is the day. I want to just give up, but Iâ€™m so frustrated with life. Iâ€™m tired of feeling isolated in love and in life. I just may do it because whatâ€™s the  point in watching others enjoy life and beauty, significant others, kids, normal thinking and my life has been nothing but mishap after mishap, darkness after darkness with no real end in sight. Iâ€™m tired and Iâ€™m tired of being strong and being a rock, and Iâ€™m tired of being patient when I havent received a single thing that I want. Fuck it. I have no reason to live as of this moment and if I do, It hasnâ€™t been revealed and Iâ€™m tired of searching for meaning. I no longer care. I give up.â€

Peace
