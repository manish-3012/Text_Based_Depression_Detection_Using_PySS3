I just sent my fiancee away to stay with her parents as the coronavirus gets much worse in my region. I have never felt so empty, hopeless and afraid.I am 30 and female and I have been together with my fiancee for almost 8 years. Today, after much heartache and debate I sent her away to stay with her parents as this terrible virus gets worse in my region. We are both well, however she has pre-existing health conditions including asthma and falls into an at risk category so I was not willing to let her stay with me and risk her catching. She would not make the final decision to leave as she want very much to stay with me, and so I made it for her and told her she had to leave for her safety.

We both sobbed and cried for hours as we do not know when we will see each other face to face again as we do not know what the government will do next and which areas will be safe. I packed her things with her, gave her useful things from the house and she left for her parents house just over an hour ago. I have to stay to make sure my father has everything he needs, but I could not risk allowing her to stay with me as it will be far more serious if she catches than if I do.

I am so distraught and I cannot speak as the tears will not stop. I know I have made the best decision for her but I feel dead and hopeless inside without her. I have suffered from serious depression throughout life and she is the only reason I am manage to overcome these feelings...without her I am lost. I fear she may think I am heartless for sending her away and that I am tired of her, but I swear before God this is not so. I did this because I am afraid and want her to be safe and it is safer where her parents are.

I made an account just to vent because I cannot stop crying because now I am alone and very afraid. I never expected this sort of thing to happen like this - I thought it was just like this in movies. I keep asking aloud, "How did this thing happen?", but there is nobody here to answer me and the silence is overwhelming. I just try to console myself by thinking I have put my fiancee before myself and tried to do the best things for her. Still, I do not know if I can make it without her. I am so afraid.
