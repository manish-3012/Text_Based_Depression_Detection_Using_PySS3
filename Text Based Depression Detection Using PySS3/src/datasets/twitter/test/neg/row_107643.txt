A suicidal attempt that failedI just wanted to write a short story about what happened 6 years ago when I attempted suicide on SSRIâ€™s . I was prescribed with 100mg of Zoloft or sertraline once daily. When night after working and smoking weed, I came home and while my parents were asleep I decided I didnâ€™t wanna live anymore because I was constantly being emotionally abused and felt like shit constantly. I had tried twice previously to overdose and both were minuscule amounts compared to what I was gonna try. I emptied what was left of a bottle, about 2500mg, and downed all in one gulp.. 15 minutes went by and I had mild stomach pain but I became extremely tired And soon I past out in my bedroom. What happened next has changed me completely to this today. I remember this big figure in my vision and then I woke up vomiting all over my floor. My mom ran down and asked if I was okay and I said I was and that I mustâ€™ve ate something wrong. She went up stairs and I went back to sleep. I then woke up in the morning, roughly 8 hours after overdosing and I thought I was dead. I saw writing everywhere. On my arms, on the walls, on the ceilings. They were all notes from everyone I knew saying they were sorry I had committed suicide and that they wish I was still there. Everyone ended with love and their name. I immediately got up, my mom was doing laundry and I asked her if I was dead and if she could see me. She knew immediately something was wrong and my grandma who lived next door came up and sat down with me and I admitted to overdosing. I saw her bawling next to me as I began to cry too, still seeing these writings on everything. We went to the hospital, as I waited to be checked in I continued to see these writings, from friends, family, and loved ones . Shortly I went back , they attempted to pump my stomach, however due to me vomiting earlier I had nothing to get pumped out. They asked if I wanted to admit myself to the psychiatric hospital or they were going to force me to go and I said I will go. During my time at the hospital I continued to see these visions. Eventually the notes that I saw from friends and family stopped showing and instead it appeared as though someone was communicating with me. He said he was from the future. He was me and the world was a disaster. Half of the world was flooded and we were doing terrible. To this day I still see words appear if I focus, however I often forget and do not focus on anything long enough for it to appear. I now know I had to have experienced seratonin syndrome to a certain degree. The experience changed me. It began the change that allowed me to go from major depressed to having no depression at all after years of rewiring my brain. I do not advocate anyone commit suicide. And the experience I had was awful. What I got out of it was that there are so many people who love you and it is not worth taking your life. I know we all feel low and sometimes lower than we should, but we all are here for a reason. Remember: Everybody Love Everybody. I hope this helps someone who is thinking about suicide to not go through with it. I love you all, and the universe loves you as well.
