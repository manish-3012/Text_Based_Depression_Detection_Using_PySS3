UpdateA few days ago I posted that I would end my life. But I couldn't do it. The thought of my family and friends being sad that I'm gone made me feel horrible. I sat there with a blade to wrist just contemplating life, in the end I just couldn't do it. But I feel worse. Idk. I've learned methods to control my OCD. But my Anxiety is killing me. My heart is racing, my body is twitching and I can't leave my house. I haven't left my house for  5 days. I also haven't showered for 5 days( I know it's nasty). I just can't leave my bed. I hate myself. I want to end it. I've read that cutting your wrists isn't that effective. But I don't have a choice, it's the only thing I can do. I don't want jump infront of a train, I don't want to inconvinience anyone with my suicide. Sadly there's no high building in my erea or one that I could get access to. Does anyone have tips on effecrive suicide methods??( and yes I see the irony of ny statement). Existing is the most painful thing I ever had to go through. I don't like living. I really don't.
