Not sure if I belong here, but things are just so hardI'm too tired to explain all if my problems. I'm just tired of being alone. I'm so alone all the time, I don't want to be alone anymore. I'm so tired of trying. Everyone always says things will get better, but things never get better. They never do. I am always there for everyone, but noone is ever there for me.
