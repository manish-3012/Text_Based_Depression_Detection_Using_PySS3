I feel like it could happen any minute nowMy mind is constantly thinking of ways out, a lot of times without a reason. So much has happened, and so many people are out of my life forever. No matter how bright a future I keep earning, all I want to do is escape pain. Iâ€™ve overdosed on Tylenol before, and I learned pills are to slow. I already own a shotgun and the thought of not having to put on a fake smile and force feed myself every few days feels good
