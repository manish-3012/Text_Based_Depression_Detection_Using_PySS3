Writing my suicide noteI have a plan. I'm going to wake up in the morning like usual. Take a shower, get dressed, pet my dogs, give my roommate/best friend an extra long hug and "love you" before I "leave for work", call my mom and b.s. on my way to "work", tell her I love and appreciate her.    
But as we all know, I'm not going to work. I'm stopping at Home Depot for rope and a ladder, tying a noose in my car, and taking myself into the woods in my hometown. I plan to call the cops right before I jump so no innocent bystander has to find me.    
I read if you just from 5ft that your neck will break right away. I'm too chicken to think about the struggle.    
   
My mom and my best friend are the only ones worth explaining myself to. It breaks my heart writing this note. I only hope I'm articulate enough for them to find some peace in my last words.
