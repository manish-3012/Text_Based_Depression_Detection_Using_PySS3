I need help (long)Hi, i have a problem that has become the main source of my depression and nihilistic beliefs. For the past 2 years i have been living with my sisters who although have been supporting me, are very hard to live with, all this is because my mom has been staying with my grandpa who already has 2 caretakers, and is doing fine however my mom refuses to get a job and find us a place to live because we had to move out the last one. I tell her and tell her to get a job but she keeps on saying to have faith in god and that â€œhe has a plan for us allâ€ but no matter how much i pray nothing has changed, i have begun to become very frustrated with this because every night i go to sleep and wake up knowing that i cant leave the hell that i am living in, i dont know what to do anymore and am contemplating suicide. Someone please help me please
