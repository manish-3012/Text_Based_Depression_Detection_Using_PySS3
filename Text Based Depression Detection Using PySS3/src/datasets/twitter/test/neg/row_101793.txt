Idk what to do.Just got this random onset of intense suicidal thoughts and Iâ€™m really fucking scared. I need to do something but I have no family or close friends nearby to help and a hotline wonâ€™t help because it doesnâ€™t even help when I have milder thoughts. How would I go about admitting myself and what would happen?? Or any other ideas are appreciated
