What would you do instead of commit suicide, in this situation?Very severe insomnia. Staying up 3-5 days in a row, sleeping 2 hours in between, staying up 3-5 days in a row, sleeping 2 hours in between, and so on. If you regularly stayed up 120 hours at a time, and lived that sleep cycle for over 5 years, what is left, if not suicide? The insomnia has led to living with constant hallucinations, and various full blown psychotic episodes, and of course inability to function at all.

This is after trying every natural remedy, sleep hygiene/therapy stuff, and every over the counter and prescription sleeping pill on and off label on the market. Even tried roofies and didn't fall asleep. What would you do? I have one thing left to try, xyrem/ghb, and if that doesn't work then the only option is death.
