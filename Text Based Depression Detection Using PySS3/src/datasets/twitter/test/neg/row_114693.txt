I'm having problemsEver since i graduated from school, i tried finding a job but no success on it. One time i got accepted but got terminated a month after because of one mistake which I admit i did. And now covid happened, that made job hunting much harder.

Problem is all these years I'm feeling shit about myself, I'm having confidence problem and every time my mom talks shit about me I feel like killing myself. I don't know what to do. I'm really on the edge right now. No one can help me. It's really suffocating that my heart wrenches in pain that i just wanna die. I just wrote this to at least ease the pain I'm holding in.

I need advice in what to do
