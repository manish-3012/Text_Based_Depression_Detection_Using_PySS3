Feeling Suicidal Over False Sexual Accusation about me being posted on InstagramHey everyone, newly joined here.

2 days ago, someone who I had a thing with way back in the day came out and did an Instagram post on me. She didnâ€™t publicly say my name, nor mentioned me but she described the story and changed a bunch of things to make it sound like I sexually assaulted her. Iâ€™m not going to go into details with it. But I will say I know I didnâ€™t sexually assault her and I have evidence to back that claim.

But Iâ€™ve literally been feeling super suicidal ever since, not because Iâ€™m worried about people sending me hate messages but the fact that what had been said is nothing like my character. A few friends i know liked the post and i messaged them saying that itâ€™s about me and they truly didnâ€™t believe me and said thereâ€™s no way. Iâ€™m happy that thereâ€™s a strong movement for women to come out and tell there stories but I feel like if I came out, Iâ€™d get slandered and no one would see my point of view. 

I canâ€™t describe this feeling but I havenâ€™t ate, slept or anything and Iâ€™m just scared what people are going to think of me just because of this accusation. I donâ€™t want to wake up in the mornings anymore, I just wanna give up and people have been saying to keep my head high but I donâ€™t think I have it in me anymore.

Side note, she wants me to publicly apologize to her, and I said Iâ€™d be happy to talk to her about this whole misunderstanding but sheâ€™s blocked me on everything. I even suggest to her friend that she can have a witness present and so can I.

I donâ€™t know anymore. I really donâ€™t
