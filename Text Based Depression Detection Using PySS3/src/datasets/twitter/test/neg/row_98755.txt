it's hard to even put into words why i want to kill myselfit doesn't matter how far i've gone,  how hard i've fought...  i never wanted to make it this far... and i've been wishing i could kill myself for years...    i've made dozens of excuses not to... but...  it's what i truly want... it's the only real dream... only real goal...  i'm tired of lying to myself to keep living..
