Suicide note.Today I found my suicide note that I wrote 15 months back, it was to my husband who I'm divorcing now. Telling him how much I struggled with my depression and mental illness and how he was better off without me. 

Part of that was because I was living a lie, was acting out and not living life with honesty or integrity and it was killing me. Pretending that I was happy was killing me. Sacrificing my identity and myself for others was killing me. But I've changed. I held on. 

I also found the note that I started to write to my son and didn't finish because I didn't have the heart to at the time. It was too painful. As much as I hated who and where I was in life at the time I absolutely couldn't imagine leaving my kids like that. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that if I had let myself go through with it, I would have missed seeing my kids learn new things, I would have missed my son having his first crush or my daughter teaching me how to do tic toc dances. I would have missed doing crossfit competitions and working at a job where I get to share a passion for fitness. I would have missed meeting a really incredible man and his hobo music. I would have missed seeing myself stand up for what I want and I would have missed meeting some really amazing people and seeing some beautiful places.

It hasn't been all roses and sunshine, in fact somedays I still struggle and I get anxious for what's to come but I just keep telling myself..  'One. More. Day.' Just keep going because you never know what you will miss.
