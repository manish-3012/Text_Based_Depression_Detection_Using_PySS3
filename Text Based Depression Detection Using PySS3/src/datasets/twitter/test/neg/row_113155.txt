Just give me a good reason not to do it.I'm just tired. Tired of my life, of people that doesn't care a little bit about me, of my disgraceful job, of everything. I want a way out.

I still didn't do it because I'm afraid to fail. And also because I'm afraid I'll end up killing my father - he's old, frail, not the best health.

But each passing day is more difficult. I can't stand this life anymore. This emptiness. This sensation of never doing anything meaningful, the certainty that I'll just die alone and forgotten because of my horrible personality.

Please, just say something. Or, I swear, I'll do it. Sooner or later.
