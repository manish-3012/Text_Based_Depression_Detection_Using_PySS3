I will finally be able to sleepInstead of waking up with theoat pain unable to breath

My mind will be at rest

No more stomach pain

No more pain

No more physical pain

No more painful urination

No more painful shitting

No more mind unraveling itself

No more pain no more pain

No more stuck in the bed all day and night

No more suffering

I hope I can write a novel in the afterlife.
