Why reach out? It doesnâ€™t work.Iâ€™ve told two different people today that Iâ€™m not okay. 
My roommate just basically said â€œyeah Iâ€™ve noticed youâ€™re depressed but I have a problem where I donâ€™t feel normal people feelingsâ€ 
How is me reaching out for help send you the message that I want to hear about you canâ€™t feel anything? All I do is feel sad, alone and like I canâ€™t do anything. 
My boyfriend didnâ€™t really say anything at all and after talking with him about how I donâ€™t feel like I matter somehow I ended up apologizing. 
Why am I even alive? 
The two people I see the most are indifferent to me. Iâ€™m so small in their world to matter, how could I ever matter to anyone else? All I can think about is disintegrating into the darkness. I wish my body would slowly fade away into the dark like my mind already has.
