It gets better. It will be ok.Here's a post from me, 2 months after strong waves of suicidal thoughts and inconsistent depression since December 2018. 
I survived. You can too. 

It may seem as if it's impossible, or that there's no way to get out, and even that it won't get better. 

It will. 
I know it's hard to believe, but it will get better - I don't just say it. I know it. 
Whatever you're facing right now is temporary. Life will make up for the depression you feel right now with happiness. 

So please. 
Place one foot in front of the other. Live one minute or second at a time, if you have to. 

Just don't give up. 
If you had been searching for a sign not to end it, to not give up.. this is it. 
This is your sign to keep fighting. 

And remember that I believe in you, regardless of anything.
