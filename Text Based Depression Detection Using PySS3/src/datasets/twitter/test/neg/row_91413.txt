Iâ€™m scared, I donâ€™t think anyone understands me, I have no friends. I used to, now Iâ€™m just an introverted workaholic. I have a girlfriend but I canâ€™t open up because I donâ€™t want to ruin the only good thing in my life. I think I just need to talk to someone. Maybe make a friend.I went from being a mommyâ€™s boy, to being a drug addict, to dropping out of school, to having a kid, to getting married, then divorced. In and out if the judicial system. Now I have my life together, but it seems like i should have never gotten it together. I have never been this sad and lonely when I was a homeless drunk. I just turned 27, and I donâ€™t think I can take another year. In the outside Iâ€™m a out together normal guy, but on the inside Iâ€™m contemplating  suicide. I am so alone. Even when Iâ€™m with people, I donâ€™t think I ever connect.
