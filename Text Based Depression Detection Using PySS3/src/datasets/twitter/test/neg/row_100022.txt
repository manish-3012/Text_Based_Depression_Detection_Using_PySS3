I hate myselfThis is what I wake up every morning saying to myself. What I whisper to my self at least 10 times a day. I hate it and I hate life. I hate having to say that to myself. I'm Bipolar and being perfectly honest tablets help a lot, but tbf having someone to talk to makes a huge difference . I just want someone that talks to me to give a shit tbh
