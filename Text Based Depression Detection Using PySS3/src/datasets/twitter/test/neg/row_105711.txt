I don't have control over myself and am considering suicide. Can anyone help me?It feels as if I don't have control over my life. I am going to give a life-changing exam in a few days but all I do is procrastinate.

I "study" at my computer desk but actually I just browse the Internet, wasting my time. Whenever any of my family members enter my room I just switch off the monitor and when they leave I switch it on back again. I never study, I waste the whole day, fooling my family.

The thing is, this has been going on for almost a month now. I am 15 and considering that this exam will surely decide the rest of my life (I am not American) I am ashamed of myself. Please help me get control over myself back.

Edit- Thanks you guys!!! I don't feel like suiciding anymore. As for my problem, I filled the power socket of CPU with small pieces of paper.
