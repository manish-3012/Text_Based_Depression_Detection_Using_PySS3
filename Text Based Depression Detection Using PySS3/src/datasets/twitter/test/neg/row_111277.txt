I donâ€™t get any privacyIâ€™m posting this to suicide watch because this, over time, is what caused my depression, and Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts many times because of it.

Iâ€™m a 15 yr old about to be 16, and my parents, especially my dad, refuse to give me any privacy outside of the bathroom. Heâ€™s emotionally abusive and wants to control my life. He chooses what clothes I wear, and goes through them every little while and takes away anything he doesnâ€™t want me to wear. He took away my wifi months ago in an attempt to control me. He constantly goes through my things and takes things from me any chance he gets, saying that itâ€™s his stuff because he bought it. Itâ€™s gotten to the point that I keep my phone, charger and anything else that he might take on me at all times. He doesnâ€™t let me go out anywhere unless he or my mom are with me. Iâ€™ve endured so far, but recently he took the door to my bedroom. Literally took the door, off itâ€™s hinges, and hid the hinges all while i was at school, even though Iâ€™m not allowed to have a lock on it anyway. Iâ€™m not sure what to do anymore, and I canâ€™t stand the lack of privacy at this point... Iâ€™ve been going to the bathroom every time I want to be alone, or i need to change my clothes etc., but I just canâ€™t take it any longer..

What should I do?
