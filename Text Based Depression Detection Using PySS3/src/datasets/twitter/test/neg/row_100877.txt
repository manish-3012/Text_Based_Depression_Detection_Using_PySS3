TLDR; I'm so tired of not having any friends. I'm so tired of being so lonely.Before you say â€œIâ€™ll be your friend!â€ I have heard it before. Digital friends cannot replace flesh and blood. But even the digital ones donâ€™t stick around. I love my husband dearly, but getting married turned my social life to shit. I have NO friends. Not a single friend. I've been trying. Dear god have I been trying. I am friendly to people in public. I find people online and we talk and talk and then just out of nowhere they always disappear. I am an atheist and I even started going to a unitarian congregation just to meet and be around other people.

I used to have friends. I used to have lots of friends. Friends I thought would be around forever, friends that had my back for over a decade. Then they just disappeared and have no interest in ever talking to or hanging out with me. Fuck... I need to be around other people that share my interests. I need human connection. I have been craving it, yearning for it, looking for it and trying for it. It just never happens. I may be quiet but I participate in conversations. I swear though people think I'm invisible. Everybody else around me is always more interesting.

I am so fucking lonely. I'm just so lonely. I just want a friend, just one friend that will come and actually spend time with me. But I guess that's just too much to ask. It's just not happening. I'm doing something wrong. I canâ€™t breathe.

---my midnight ramblings---

I listen to time. I sit alone, I am quiet, and I listen to time pass. The hum of the computer, the buzzing of the lights, the clock. Tick tick tick. The silence. Silence is so loud in my head, itâ€™s deafening. Scream in silence. Can anybody hear me? I hate being alone in this, when the world sleeps and I am left in an unsettling solitude. Isnâ€™t it enough to feel alone every time I walk? Every time I talk? Every time I breathe? No, I do not like being alone.

I do not like being alone. Ironically, when given the choice sometimes I unintentionally isolate myself to prevent the inevitably painful feeling of wanting an emotional connection but being turned away. I look at the vast black night sky and canâ€™t help but wonder, am I the only one here? Our planet is but a speck in the universe. What does that make me? I am disconnected. Line terminated.

People run around seeking connections. Donâ€™t care who they connect with so long as they donâ€™t have to face loneliness. I am lonely unless that connection means something. I worry I may never find the friendship I am looking for. It isnâ€™t in the cards. Hiding Ace. Your imaginary face plays over and over in my head like a moving picture and its beautiful and its hurt and its painful, seeking comfort and connection and it smiles and it hides behind a curtain of doubt and loneliness, sad small scared and alone, and I hear it screaming and crying out and I need you and I want you, to be near you, but I can't because I love you and its beautiful.

Your imaginary face makes me love myself when youâ€™re around. I donâ€™t need to run away from me. I feel like a failure though. Not entirely accepted at face value. Wrong price tag with no exchange. This realization tears me up inside, and I have a difficult time discussing it. Iâ€™d rather bleed. Let the negative emotions run freely from my skin. Calming memories. I donâ€™t do it as a cry for attention, and I donâ€™t appreciate misguided concern. Would be a lie to the world.

I do not feel I make a difference in anybodyâ€™s day. The world is absorbed with themselves, why bother remembering a flicker in the static? I want somebody to remember before they go to sleep that I smiled at them. I told them a joke. I gave them a hug. I sent them a text. I gave them a dollar. I told them I cared about them. I donâ€™t want those moments to be so forgotten like they are, because I remember.

I remember the stranger that told me as I cried one day that I am beautiful and that I have a beautiful smile. That was ten years ago. I remember that man. I remember what he looked like, where I was walking, why I was crying. I remember those moments. I feel I am not remembered. Not worthy of it. Remember me. Thatâ€™s all I want. Remember me. And talk to me. Like me. Care about me. Love me.

I am broken, dead inside. Hurt. But by what? I often donâ€™t know why I feel so sad. I usually try not to tell people and I put on a happy face until Iâ€™m so depressed I donâ€™t feel like living. Only then does sadness show, yet nobody knows the extent of it. So I close my eyes and breathe in and out and sit in the dark listening to time pass.

I hear the buzzing of my computer fans and the growling of my empty stomach. Silence and darkness outside, and yet I remain awake. Sleep is calling my name yet I feel discontent.

I feel discontent.

I want to become a part of the silence and darkness I see out my window. Calming, mysterious, beautiful. Still.

Scream in silence.

A car passes.
