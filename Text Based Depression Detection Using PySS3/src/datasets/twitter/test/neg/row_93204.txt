Decided 100%Yeah things arenâ€™t improving and itâ€™s not fair to carry on suffering like this Iâ€™m out. Iâ€™ve carefully thought everything through to try and get out of this physical pain but there seems to be no way out. I just wanted to get it off my chest as I donâ€™t wanna bother the people around me. This is a last resort for me,  i never wanted it to end like this but I cannot carry on. Please donâ€™t try to convince me out of it.
