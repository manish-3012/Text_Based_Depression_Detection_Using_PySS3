even if i make it pass this year, i know i won't last long.i can't bare to get out of my bed in the morning. i can't look at myself in the mirror without feeling like i am about to throw up. i have no long term plans and even though there is a couple things i don't wanna miss out i know i won't last enough. the wait won't be worth it.
