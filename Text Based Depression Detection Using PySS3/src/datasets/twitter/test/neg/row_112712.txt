My last friend died today...... and I feel an emptness that could eat the whole world.

I had a lot of friends during my life. But I'm a very problematic human being - harsh, liar, even traitor, and it's all out of my control, as I try to be empathic and trustworthy - and they all eventually left. I loved a few but started to learn how to live with those losses. I lost my GF/wife as well. It became to a point where human lives only mattered for a concept; like "I respect being alive for what it means, not that those lives personally mean anything". Nothing meant anything, I did not went searching for new friends anymore. I just had my cat and tried to keep existing. Mechanically. Depression came and went out; suicide attempts came and went out. Drugs came and went out. Every moment I tried to do my best to leave something behind me; a trace, something that I could be glad about. I'm couldn't. 

But since my GF departed, I adopted a cat who was ALWAYS by my side. They're sensitive animals and they feel your sorrow, your angryness, even your delicate pat moments. He stood with me every day until I moved out and bought a new apartment. While I was moving, he had to stay within my mother's house, because it would be troublesome to have him whilist I reformed the new place.

He ran away and got murdered. By what, or who, I don't know yet. I only saw his blood and fur. When my mother called me saying "he's not here", I stopped anything and rushed over there. My neighbourhood hates me - I'm harsh. I searched and yelled for him the whole day, but only by night some of my neighbours said "to look at the tree" at his house. I did. There was blood, fur, and a trace of blood that went below the construction, making it inacessible. 

There aren't much more things to say. There isn't anything that binds me to this world. I don't want to adopt another cat; I don't know if I want to die, but it makes no difference. I wish that I could save him even if it costed my life. His life means so much more than mine. I don't feel specially sad, or angry - I just feel empty. Like I know my life is not ever gonna be back on track. I won't love anything anymore, thats how I work, thats how my brain works. 

Sorry for the wall of text, the meaningless post and the rusty English.
