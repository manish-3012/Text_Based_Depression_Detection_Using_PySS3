The worst part is having people care about youPeople who just want you to be happy.. How can you tell them that you can't be happy? That all the little rainbows and unicorns couldn't make you happy.

How do you normal people stand it? At best, I am neutral to the world. At worst, I am hoping for cancer.

It is time to put myself to rest. Sweet oblivion, without if's or what's, or love or pain.
