I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMOREI hope I die, I really hope something hit me or I take too much medicines and I just die 
I donâ€™t wanna live, the more time pass the more I think about dying 
First it was an occasional thought, maybe after a fight or something bad, but now itâ€™s a current thing
I think about it everyday, when I see the subway I think how it would be if I jump in front of it, when I see a car I wonder if the speed would be enough to kill me or if I am in a high place I think how it would feel to jump down 
I am scared to do it but I am less scared than before, itâ€™s a constant thing I think about and I think itâ€™s a sign, maybe I need to do it 
I think about my family, how they would be after but it donâ€™t make me stop think about it 
I am so scared of myself cause if I had courage I would be dead already probably 
I donâ€™t know what to do or who talk with, they would think I am crazy or something but I only want help 
I want to stop thinking about killing myself and feeling needy to do it, I wanna get better but I am afraid to ask help and I donâ€™t know how
