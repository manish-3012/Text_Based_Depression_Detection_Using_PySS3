Does no one give a fuck anymore?!?!?So we are currently living in a crazy ass time...a time where we should be coming together to support and help our fellow people. Instead, I get a fucking letter from my landlord telling me he doesn't want to be a landlord anymore and that I have two weeks to get out cuz he is selling house. I mean REALLY?...now is when you do this....not only is there a pandemic but I live on Cape Cod and its about to be summer...the rental costs triple during the summer months as the monthly rentals are turned into weekly rentals. I understand that my landlord owes me nothing but at least a bit of fucking compassion. I begged and pleaded with him letting him know that I have no place to go...his response "Good luck" what kind of fucked up answer is that???
