I am planning to commiting suicideI was successful at studying but worst in anything else. 
I had no luck about human relations or living a cool life with unforgetable memories. Now i am a 23 yo master's student who has nothing else than some academic successes and suicidal thoughts. I am possibly gonna kill myself soon, if i can find enough courage. 
Anyway, just writing here to feel a little more relaxed.
