VeinsI've struggled with depression and anxiety the majority of my adolescent life. That being said, I'm no stranger to the temptations of suicide. I attempted suicide once, back in highschool, but I have always had an issue with self-harm. I gave my life to God after my suicide attempt, and that seemed to alleviate the pain for a season, and I sobered up (in reference to cutting) for nearly three years afterwards. Now, I'm nearly 21 and almost a divorcee. Some days I'm fine. Other days, I struggle to get out of bed in the morning. The love of my life, my best friend of six years who helped me through my depression and brought me to God, decided that I wasn't good enough for him anymore. He cheated on me, God only knows how many times with different people, and is now happy in a new relationship. I feel like I'm starting the grieving process all over again. I was happy with starting anew, in acceptance that my marriage was over. Now I alternate between the stages: Some days I'm angry and bitter and seek revenge. Some days I come home from work and just go straight to bed because if one more person asks me if I'm ok, I'm just going to lose it. And some days (I prefer these days), I get all glammed up and uphold a "too hot for you" attitude. Sadly, those days are few and far between. I've become increasingly aware of how prominent the veins in my arm are. They are tiny, but the blue/purple tinge provides a nice contrast to my porcelain "Casper The Friendly Ghost" arms. I often fantasize about coming home from a long, hard day at work, running a nice, warm bathtub of water, and slitting them open, leaving my roommates to find me. I know that sounds disturbing, and probably selfish, but all I've done is act selflessly only to be screwed over and abandoned. Sometimes, the only thing stopping me is knowing that my husky relies on me and that if I died, he'd be sent to live with my ex where he'd be neglected.
