I will do it.I have made my choice. Of course I will settle person affairs. I'v chosen hypothermia as my way to die. Nothing painful only unpleasant. I will drink a bottle of booze and accidentally fall into cold pond. Alochol will make my veins larger thus body heat will escape quicker and I will be numb thus perish faster.

Are there any lose ends to this plan?
