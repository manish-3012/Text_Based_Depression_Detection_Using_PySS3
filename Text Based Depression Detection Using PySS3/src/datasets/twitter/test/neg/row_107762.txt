I need help. I need a reason to live.I'm really not in a good place.

I'm unemployed, all but given up on finding work that will pay well. No one in my field wants me.

I'm in debt. Credit card, personal loan, student loans, car loans. Almost $70,000 in total. All taken out before I was fired (but of course not eligible for unemployment, because I was working through a staffing agency). I cannot pay my bills. I will likely have to go through a bankruptcy very soon.

I live with my parent's again. My landlord is fucking me over on breaking the lease I cannot pay, also. I sleep on a couch. My mother is psychologically abusive and makes it clear every waking moment that I have failed and I'm a burden. My father tries to help but he's basically unemployed too. 

I have no friends. I have no social life. We live out in the country so it's not even like I can go to a bar to meet people. I haven't been on a date in over two years. I haven't had a girlfriend in over six years. It's been so long since I've had sex that I don't even remember what it's like. I can't even bring myself to watch porn because it's honestly so depressing that people regularly have what I can't. I'm miserable. 

I'm almost 29 years old and my life has devolved into a complete failure. They say to focus on tiny, little things you can accomplish today, or in a week. But honestly, i can't think of anything. I feel worthless. I feel like society, life, jobs, women, friends, have all completely thrown me away. 

I feel like the only next logical option is suicide. I need hope. I need one little ray of hope that maybe, MAYBE someday someone will want me. Want me to work for them, to love them, to provide for them. I don't know. I just... I feel so alone. I need someone to tell me I matter.
