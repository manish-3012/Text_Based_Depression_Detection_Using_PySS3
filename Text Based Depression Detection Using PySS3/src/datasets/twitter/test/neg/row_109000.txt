I really need someone. I donâ€™t know if I can make it through tonightI just came back from an amazing trip with friends and it made me realize how unhappy I am at home. And to top that I had an ex-sibling destroy $500 worth of my things and everyone is blaming me for even being mad about it. I canâ€™t talk to anyone about this because they blame me or tell me Iâ€™m being too difficult over nothing. Iâ€™m fighting so hard to not go get a knife from the kitchen but I feel like I canâ€™t fight it much longer
