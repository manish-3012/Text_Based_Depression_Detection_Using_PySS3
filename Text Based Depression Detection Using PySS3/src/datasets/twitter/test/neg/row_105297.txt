Hey, this is my first postLast Saturday I tried to commit suicide (again), it failed obv and i'm alright. I went to the hospital by myself and everything is good, i've been a bit dizzy but thats it.

Nobody knows about it except for my bf but he's no help, he even guilt tripped me in buying him some drugs because he knows I have a hard time saying no, that was after I told him about the suicide attempt..

Really feels like he doesn't give a shit.

I've just been so lonely, I don't really have friends, or the people who I would call my friends never want to meet up and they barely reply to me on fb. I've never posted on here before, my life seems so much more depressing when I think back.
