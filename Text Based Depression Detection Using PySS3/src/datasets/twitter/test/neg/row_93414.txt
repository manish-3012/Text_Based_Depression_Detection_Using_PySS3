Feeling happy with overdosing.The other night I had a really horrible experience. I've attempted suicide before and have had occasions where I've broke down and had to tell members of the family to hide anything that can cause me harm. But the other night was completely different. I was sitting there with my girlfriend (who has been so supportive and so fundamental in my recovery) and I just felt suddenly happy and okay about killing myself. It was so scary for me because I've been through the whole "nobody cares so fuck it" but it just felt so scary to be so comfortable with it and i dont really know what to do other than speak to samaritans and my counsellor. Has anyone else ever felt like this?
