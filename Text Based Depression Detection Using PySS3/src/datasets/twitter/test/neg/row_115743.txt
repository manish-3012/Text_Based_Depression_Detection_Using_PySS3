The worst Iâ€™ve felt in foreverLaying on my couch, I wish I had dope. I have a ton of pills, but the LD50 would likely not suffice. Not trying to survive into a worse situation. Honestly donâ€™t know I would even be able to get up to do anything. Iâ€™m bipolar. I fucked up a little bit. I have no one to talk to about what happened. I took a few Ativan. Iâ€™m just depressed now. Thinking about taking another one (not trying to OD). I want to feel happy. 

Iâ€™m a 28 y/o veteran, ans I have a lot of trauma in my life thatâ€™s been twisted in my mind. The sexual trauma effects my memories and my sexual orientation. Other trauma affects my ability to make eye contact with people and have intimacy with others. I push attractive women away from me inadvertently because Iâ€™m scared. 

My plan is to get hotel room in a month or so, maybe sooner and take my pills. Iâ€™m tired or hurting, cycling, perceived isolation. My
Friends are great, but they couldnâ€™t possibly understand.
