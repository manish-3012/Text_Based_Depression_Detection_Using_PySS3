Not sure what to doI tried self harming last night, but didn't go through with it as the knife was too blunt.  I have currently been seeing a psych since the start of the year but I feel it isn't helping too much.  It's probably too late to switch psychs because Medicare only subsidises a number of consultations per year.

A lot of it is my lack of self confidence and self worth.  I feel like I am useless.

A bit of background about myself: 24. Hold numerous university degrees (psych, education, criminology) and I am struggling to find employment.  I work a dead end job at a supermarket and hate the place and how I am treated. I have a very supportive girlfriend who asks me what she can do to help, but honestly I don't know how she can help.  I feel so useless and that I am only dragging her down.  My family only make token efforts towards me and it's usually monetary support I receive from them, which I don't really want in comparison to hearing they actually like me or love me or something, anything positive about myself.

Currently I have given up all hope in life and finding meaningful employment and don't know what I should do.
