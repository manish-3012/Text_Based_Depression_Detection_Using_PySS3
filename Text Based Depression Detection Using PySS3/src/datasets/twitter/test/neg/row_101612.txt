I didn't kill myself and it feels like a big mistakeI am a very weak human. I dont care about my own well being and future. I failed two studies because of this. And I'm very late for application for the next one. Only 10-15 days to go. 

Nothing interests me. I wanted to kill myself because I knew I have no future. But I got family. And that sucks. I don't want to exist. I'm 21 and not grown up at all. What should I do?
