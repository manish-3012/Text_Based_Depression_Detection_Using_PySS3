Wow you're so smartHahaha nothing fuels my suicidal thoughts more than someone complimenting me on my "potential" and how "smart" I am without knowing how utterly shitty and stupid I am. Hahaha holy shit do I want to die when I help people with their homework and I end up with a worse grade because I'm fucking worthless and worry about other people more than my own shitty life. Holy fuck is it hilarious when you're not able to write the midterm because of a time conflict and the professor ignores your email. Now my A's on the assignments will mean nothing and all those people I helped will get way better grades than me, while I get a D+ AT BEST.

Haha use me as a grade booster while you can bitches. Before I flunk out, or better yet, fucking die.
