Am I suicidal or a spoiled brat?The title isn't a real question because I know I'm both. Been suffering with depression and other mental illness for years (since as early as I can remember I've planned on not living past 25 and I'm 24 currently) and things have taken a turn for the worse in the past 2 years blah blah and lately I've had to move back home with my mom. It's been a year since then and the rate of my mental health decline has been steadily accelerating. After being led on by an internship that kept telling me I "would be getting a real position soon" every other month, I'm now jobless with what seems like no real prospects and no hope whatsoever for being able to move out and support myself independently. I have a BFA but the program I was in didn't place an emphasis on giving vocational qualifications and I've overall had a horrible experience seeking work my entire life mostly because I'm a weirdo and I'm awkward and funny looking (I think my major baby face also makes it hard for people to trust me with adult responsibilities). I just don't get hired, ever. Nor do I feel like I deserve the position in most instances especially considering how competitive my city and field is and the fact that I haven't worked nearly hard enough the past few years to secure an edge over the millions of people that want the same jobs I do.

ANYWAY sorry for the long exposition but my main issue is this:

I have a nice place to live (with my mom) in one of the most desired neighborhoods, and if I really wanted to grind, I could probably get a job at duane reade or starbucks (even though I've gotten none of the countless barista/chain store jobs I've applied for over the past few years) or even get an entry level corporate position somewhere or something and really work hard to get myself on my feet and living on my own. But how and when I'm going to end my life and my mom's reaction to it is pretty much what occupy all of my thoughts every day and have for an extremely long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no goals in life, no desire to have a family or children, and my mental issues don't allow me to enjoy the following: food, sex, socializing, or romance. Just existing feels like a full time job. I've never wanted to be an "adult" and I can't handle watching myself get uglier every day. And so whenever I think about working a miserable job just to get by and support myself on top of all of this, my mind just goes to how much more I'd rather be dead, and how it's not fair (life's not fair iknow) that I should have to work that hard and do all of that when I don't even want to be alive in the first place and I feel that I'm just prolonging my existence for my mom's sake. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's really not much I can think of that would make me not mind staying alive, but living on my own again and not having to work a job that makes me miserable would definitely keep me going for at least a little while longer. And then I think about the fact that my parents could afford to pay my rent and that my mom would probably much rather do that then find me dead, but then I of course immediately feel like the manipulative spoiled brat that I am. I wish I could suck it up and get whatever job I can and get over myself and everything I feel entitled to, but it never works. But having my parents pay my rent would just make me feel like more of a burden than I already feel like I am, but sometimes I feel like I need to be honest with my mom that I'm thinking about suicide (and I thikn she already has a feeling) but doing that just feels so emotionally manipulative. So what am I? Depressed? Spoiled? Manipulative? All of the above I suppose? I don't know what to do I'm sorry this post has no direction just like me.

In closing, does anyone feel like they haven't hit rock bottom, they aren't alone in the world, but life just isn't cutting it? I don't know why I feel I should have a higher standard of life than anyone else, but it just really doesn't feel worth it to me otherwise. I really don't know how to snap out of it and I started seeing my fourth therapist recently which I'm mostly doing to humor my mom and really don't see that doing much. I read this post back and I hate how it sounds and I really genuinely do not like myself or the things that I say and do such as make this post, but I'm at a loss right now and don't want to depress any of my friends with more suicidal rambling so I'm posting here to get it off my chest. Maybe someone will relate to it and if so I would love to give you a really sad virtual high five. Hope that's okay much love to everyone here.
