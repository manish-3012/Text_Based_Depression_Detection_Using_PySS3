Planning to Jump off my school's balconyI feel so tired. I am such a failure in life, I feel like I can't do anything right. I failed first year trying to get into pharmacy and now I'm barely passing engineering. I'm a failure for my parents and I'm the failure of my parents...

I always manage to hurt my girlfriend and I feel like a piece of shit. I don't deserve to live. My girlfriend deserves someone better than me but I don't want to hurt her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I always am the guy that says "dont kill yourself your life is invaluable" but now here I am. How pathethic right?

I bought some rope and I'm learned how to tie a noose. I intend to go to my university to the 6th floor, tie my neck and then jump.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I'm gonna donate all of my organs so that I can be at least some use to this world.

This is the plan... but the only thing stopping me is that Im in so much student debt... and my parents will have to pay for it... I wish I had no student debt and I wish my parents wouldn't be hurt when i die.
