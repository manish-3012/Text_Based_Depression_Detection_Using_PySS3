Its all over.I'm tired of living and i'm planning suicide... I've been suicidal for 4 years now and i'm actually thinking about doing it before the year ends. I don't have many friends i talk to my self a lot, i'm bullied most of the times, All the people i know including my older brother are more liked then me and have more friends. I'm skinny to the bones but i'm not anorexic (But i eat a lot actually)
My self-confidence was killed by my older brother. 
And i'm only 16 years old.
People keep telling me that life is gonna get better but its been 4 years and i don't expect it to become any better. Give me a good reason NOT to kill myself.
Pro tip: You can't
