Is it normal that just the word "suicide" triggers a heavy reaction in me?Whether it's the social worker saying it, it being on a meme, someone jokingly saying they're going to commit suicide over dumb shit, anytime where I'm not actively thinking about it but only passively... I kind of seize up, hoke up, or feel like vomiting depending on what's in me at the moment. 

It's kind of like that dumb feeling when you're thinking something about someone in the same room and they look at you and you kind of feel like they heard your thought? \(Anyone? Just me? Okay, then...\) It's like I'm thinking about dying so often that when I hear/see the word, I feel... figured out? Unmasked. Then I spiral into the "why" and the "why not" and the "why haven't you done it yet" and "why do you still not have have what you need for that?" And I just end up crying, or falling entirely silent for a while, or both, or right now I just feel very cold because I did both and maybe I'm out of energy too.

Eh, maybe my dad's right and I am a fucking snowflake after all.
