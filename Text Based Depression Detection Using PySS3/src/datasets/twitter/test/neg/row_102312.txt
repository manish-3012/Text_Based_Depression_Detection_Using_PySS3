I feel so alone. And I want to be deadI have posted here before and on some other subreddit. It helped me sometimes. But sometimes not..  I can't stop hurting myself when I get upset with something and someone. I'm not good at controlling my feelings. Because I'm an immature. 
I'm a mother actually. But I'm a bad mother. And I'm going to get a divorce soon. I always feel sorry for my son that I'm his mother. 
I have so many scars on my legs. I can't show anyone my legs ... And today I hurt myself again. 
I want to be dead but I have a son . It's really hard to leave him alone in this world.  This world is awful..
