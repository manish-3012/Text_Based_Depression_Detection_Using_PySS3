I hate everyone when Iâ€™m depressedI was recently diagnosed bipolar II after years and years or undiagnosed depression, anxiety and many suicide attempts. I go through waves of anger to numbness to long periods of depression. Iâ€™ve been at my worst during this pandemic, living alone and being home all the time and what little progress I had made to build myself back up has been completely undone. I can barely get out of bed now. Iâ€™m in a near constant state of depersonalization. When my periods of intense anger start, I suddenly hate everyone for seemingly no reason. I just want to cut off anyone I have in my life for good. Itâ€™s like an uncontrollable urge. Every suicide attempt has failed, but my misery increases, and itâ€™s like I am trying to force things to get worse. I canâ€™t even stop myself anymore. I donâ€™t now if itâ€™s the old saying â€œhurt people hurt peopleâ€ or â€œmisery loves companyâ€ or if Iâ€™m trying to make things so unbearable that I have no choice but to find the inner strength to finally get it done successfully, but Iâ€™m helpless to stop it and I donâ€™t even care to most of the time. And now Iâ€™m here, drinking my morning whiskey and coffee, missing another holiday because of my fucked up broken mind. Nothing even feels real. I donâ€™t even know if I really exist or if this is some kind of Jacobs Ladder situation but it needs to end one way or another. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I hate everything.
