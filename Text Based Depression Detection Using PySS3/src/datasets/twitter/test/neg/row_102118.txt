I'm so tired of having hope that things will get better.I really don't know what else to say. I'm tired of flirting with the idea that life gets better. I've ruined my career, I attract mentally abusive women, I'm an only child to a single parent that I've never felt close to, I'm afraid what'll happen if I come out as bisexual because of where I live, 2 out of the 3 people I've truly felt close to committed suicide. The 3rd is rich now and just contacts me for cheap labor. I've successfully isolated myself for a week now, and in feeling nothing, I almost feel complete. I just wish my boss would stop fucking calling.
