MarriageMy marriage of only 3 years has failed and it's 100% my fault. When I was 20 I married the single most amazing woman I've ever met. She was a solid 11/10 for me but I haven't treated her right since the day we got married. I've been so cold and distant to her. On the days I'm drowning in depression and anger I treat her like shit even though she does everything right for me. On the days I'm bearable she's upset that I treated her like shit for the past few days so I'm just trying to do damage control to make our marriage last for me, because I can't stand to lose her. We have a son together and I'm a sub-par father to him. I work such a crazy schedule that I sacrifice so much sleep to spend time with them but I'm so grumpy that my wife said she'd rather me be asleep then be like this. She recently said she didn't love me any more, but she's pregnant with our daughter so she feels trapped with me. She moved across the country twice and dealt with a deployment but I can't even show her love because I'm so selfish and miserable. My life insurance covers suicide so I've been thinking really hard about offing myself and saving her and my two kids the trouble of dealing with me. She would get enough money so she would be able to live comfortably for 5 or so years until she would have everything under control and be able to raise our kids and hopefully find a better father for them. They would all be so much better off without me that it makes me almost happy to think of them without me there. I love them all with everything in me, and I am so sorry to them . Thanks.
