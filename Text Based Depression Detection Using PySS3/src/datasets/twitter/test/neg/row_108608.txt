The love of my life died at 33 three years ago then a man comes into my life giving me faith only to be slaughtered after years of so many deaths and utter hell!Iâ€™m dying I canâ€™t eat I canâ€™t sleep I knew this new man had the power to either make me or break me. 

My boyfriend was a saintly man but lies and drugs and probably cheating lead him to his death 3 years ago June 16 2016. 

This new man came into my life in May/June and he was so kind in the beginning but then he started ripping apart every little thing about me. Then I started to cry. He was brutal. Then he told me,â€Iâ€™m not in love with you, I donâ€™t want you, itâ€™s over, itâ€™s old, youâ€™re too emotional (I had been told I had cancer not long ago when he initially said itâ€™s not going to work) that he does not find me attractive, that I need a therapist (no shit) that he does not feel the same way and couldnâ€™t wait until I left where he was.â€ Straw that broke camels back especially because the past three four years I havenâ€™t had a moments peace, itâ€™s been several deaths including my father, former friends turning on me, and every single day I want to die. I told this man in tears that heâ€™s the best thing thatâ€™s happened to me in 3 years and he laughed telling me the waterworks didnâ€™t help â€œare you gunna be fucking crying all night? fucking donâ€™t come near me.â€ Those tears were real and I couldnâ€™t help it. 

I have no strength in me anymore. None. I am through with love I feel it in my bones.
