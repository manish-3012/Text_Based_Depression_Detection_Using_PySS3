I was going to tell my family we were engaged, until...I was engaged for two years, to an amazing woman I met in a small town. We lived there, both working at the nursing home full time and living with a great roommate. Then, the roommate had her boyfriend come over. He turned out to be a meth head. He convinced my Bailee to try some, and she left me for him. She quit her job and he was homeless, so she told him to move in. She descended and descended, slowly ripping out my heart. Eventually I moved hours away to go college. I've known other meth heads. There's always that "last message" you get from them where they're begging for your help. Thing is, she knows I know people, and she begged me to help her by putting a hit out on her. Of course I said no and begged her to let me help her. I haven't heard from her since, but after some searching I found out her ex boyfriend (the meth head) is in rehab. She just kinda dropped off the map. I've seen it before, and I'll see it again. She's dead, and she's not coming back. She was my one true love, I used to call her Babu. She would call me Bebo. She would ruin the day of anyone who hated on us for being together, or on me for being trans. She was so beautiful. My Bailee was so fucking beautiful. I'll never fucking forget her as long as I live. I'll never forget you. Please, come home. I love you. Come home!
