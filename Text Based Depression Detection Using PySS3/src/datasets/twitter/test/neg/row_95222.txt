I HATE BEING 16I HATE MY LIFE I HATE MY PARENTS I HATE MY FRIENDS AND I HATE MY SCHOOL. EVERYONE THINKS THEY'RE SO MUCH BETTER THAN ME AND EVERYONE IN MY SCHOOL ACTS LIKE THEY'RE ALL THAT WHEN IN REALITY THEY AIN'T SHIT. IT MAKES ME SO MAD WHY DO ALL THE BITCHES AND DOUCHEBAGS GET TO BE POPULAR AND I DON'T? WHY DO ALL OF MY FRIENDS ALWAYS END UP TREATING ME LIKE SHIT? IT'S NOT FAIR ITS NOT FAIR ITS NOT FUCKING FAIR.

EVERYONE IN MY LIFE IS AGAINST ME, MY FRIENDS, MY TEACHERS, MY SCHOOL, EVEN MY PARENTS. THE FUCKING SCHOOL CALLS HOME EVERY WEEK BECAUSE OF MY AT RISK BEHAVIOR OR WHATEVER. THEY EVEN CALLED HOME WHEN I ASKED IF I COULD DROP OUT. i don't wanna fucking be there. it's not fair it's so fucking annoying.

my parents are just looking for an excuse to lock me up in juvie or the fucking psych ward because i make them look bad or whatever, but you know what fuck them. I never asked to be here I never asked for any of this to happen. I just want to go anywhere else in the world, but running away is fucking illegal and I'll get fucking arrested if i try. I'm literally stuck here, I'm literally a prisoner in this hellhole town where everyone acts the same, looks the same, and wears the same clothes and I don't fit in.

I'm so angry and frustrated I don't know what to do. I can't take it anymore. Is this what life is like??? Is this all there is??? I don't want to die but if I have to stay here any longer I'm probably gonna end up addicted to drugs just because I can't handle this each and every day. Please help, i don't know what to do.
