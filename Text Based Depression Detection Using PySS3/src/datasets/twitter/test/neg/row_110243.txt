Iâ€™m completely drained and over everythingIâ€™m absolutely drained and Iâ€™m on the edge. Tired of being used and lied, Affection from family makes me uneasy now and it feels fake. Alcohol and drugs are the only things that gives me that brief feeling of happiness or not feeling completely useless. I want everything to end just want to close my eyes and not wake up, and if someone saids you should just talk to someone the last time I did that and told them how I was feeling dosent want to hang out anymore and thinks people who commit suicide are weak and selfish.
