Will I die if I take a lot of random medications?I have 3000 mg of zoloft, some random amount of Risperdal,   some thousand of prozac, abilify, and now wellbutrin. These are all of the medications I have tried so far to fix my painful existence. I can also throw in some things like advil, Tylenol, and other various things from my cupboard. Will I die? Or will I wake up in excrucuating pain like last time?
