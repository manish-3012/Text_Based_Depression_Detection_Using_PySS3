Why i do not ask for helpI on a weekly occasion contemplate killing myself. I realize this probably isn't normal and I should get help, the only issue is it would ruin my career, probably making me want to kill myself even more. In my profession any kind of paperwork on mental disorders which suicide is considered to be one. Is an automatic separation and if you don't get separated. It will guarantee you cannot move forward in your career or do certain jobs maybe you've dreamed of. I want help, but if I seek help it means my dream jobs will be denied to me.
