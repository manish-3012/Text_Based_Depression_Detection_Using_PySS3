The evolution of relationship with thoughts of killing myselfHey all, never posted here before but felt I needed to do something about this.

Off the bat I know all that "get help" stuff and I have tried but mental health care is shit so let's just skip that for now.

the reason I'm writing this is because I've realized the emotions attached to my considerations of suicide have been changing into something scarier and scarier with time.

First they would only arrive duing moments of extreme "passion," you could call it? Very angry or very sad. Not too uncommon for me, but nothing disabling (besides the suicidal thoughts lol??). I lived with those for years.

However, as of 8 months ago the thoughts have become... calm. They are rational. Like it would make sense. BUT I would also think things like "oh but there's a wedding soon it would ruin it" or "but my sisters birthday is around this time of year, I would hate to have the anniversary of my killing myself potentially overshadow her special day."

It's absurd, I know, to try and make my own death convenient when it's pretty much impossible not to hurt if not devastate my loved ones.

and yet here I am

I don't care anymore. It's almost a "welp. shit happens" and it is selfish, I know... but I don't care.

I just don't care.

I don't know when or how, but this is the closest I'm probably going to get to a note.

I guess I do care a little.

I don't want to die, I just don't want to live. I don't feel I deserve it. I always feel alone. 

I just don't know
