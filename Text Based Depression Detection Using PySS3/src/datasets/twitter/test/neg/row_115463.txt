Everyone want me deadI made tens of posts on my different accounts, I talked to many friends (which are now gone because they don't care about me), but now I have no friends and also my parents stopped really caring, nobody cares anymore. People only judge me now. I've only been attacked for acting miserable, misunderstood or completely ignored. I fucking hate having to post here because no one else cares. Reddit doesn't even care either. Every post I make gets either ignored as well, down voted to the oblivion or I get people who tell me the same cheezy "it gets better" shit. Every fucking month it gets worse. People told me that I'll get better but it's the opposite. Now I'm at the stage of contemplating and planning suicide. Is this "getting better"? 
It's just a matter of time when I will finally take my life. And thanks to all the people that only contribute to my reasons to finally end it. 
Everyone just really wants me dead. And my luck makes it look like I'm really not wanted here and that I'm clearly wasting oxygen on this damn planet
