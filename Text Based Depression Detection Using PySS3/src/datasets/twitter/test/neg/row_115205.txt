Another postWhy am I still alive, I am a fucking useless piece of shit that has no fucking future and nothing to live for. People always say since I'm 14 that I shouldn't kill myself since I have so much to live for. I know I don't have anything to live for. Why does everyone say I do have something to live for when I have been waiting and nothing has happened? So many people my age have accomplished things and yet I am here with nothing under my belt.  


I know I won't ever get to accomplish what I had planned to do. I know some people would be saddened to hear I won't get to be what they thought I would be, but that's ok. I stopped caring about myself and my future anyway. I stopped giving a fuck about my looks, yes I'm an ugly asshole, but at this point I really wouldn't care. I've started self harming, and at some point I will kill myself, I won't live long.
