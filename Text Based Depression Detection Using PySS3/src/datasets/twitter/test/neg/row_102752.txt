I've just lost the only person I could count on, and I'd rather die than admit that to others.I have no one left. My family are on the other side of the country, and my mentally ill husband is leaving me because he believes his delusions about my infidelity are true, when they're not. At this point, I can either move back home and admit that I am an unlivable sack of shit... Or I can just kill myself. No one at home ever initiates conversation with me anyway, they'd probably never even know or care. I have never felt so alone or hated. I have never felt more worthless then I do right now.
