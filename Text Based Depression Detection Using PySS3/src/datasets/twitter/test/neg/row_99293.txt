Am I a failure?So this will be somewhat long. I apoligize for that. My story isn't much different than yours.

At the age of 9 I decided I wanted to be a cook. At 19 I was in college for Carpentry becauae I didn't know what to do since the men in my family are all 'useful'.
Me, I'm a nerd. I'm a gamer. I'm only enthusaiastic about those types of things. I play acoustic guitar fairly well. I have 2 friends I can rely on for everything. I have a mother and a step-father and 4 cats.

At age 24 I reevaulated my life as I never had 1 carpentry job and had been working at KFC and a coffee shop and EB Games for 2 years.

I did Marine Cooking. To work as a cook at sea. My first real job was with the Canadian Coast Gaurd.

They have a hazing ritual that they refuse to acknowledge is hazing. I was bullied and taunted up til the point of the hazing and then I walked away from it. I had so much anxiety built up to that point from people saying the hazing ia this or that. Sexual things, dropping us overboard into arctic water in a sling or to lock my door and put something against it so people can't pour water on you at night. These typea of taunts.
When i walked aeay my coworkers chased me into a cooler in my workspace, they cornered me demanding I go saying everyone elae ia doing it ur a pussy if u dont go. They physically handled me trying to make me go until i yelled with tears in my eyes to fuck off. Telling them im here to do a job not put up with this bullshit.

The next day Captain ushered mw to come to the mess hall where the officers were to humiliate me. Present me with half a document which he ripped in front of me and said for not compltleting the ritual. They took a picture, forced me to shake his hand and all laughed at me.

At this point im a mockery to the 80odd crew. A laughing stock. A pussy. They told me i had a bad attitude. An attitude i developed after all this happened. Of courwe i had an attitude im being bullied and humiliated. I was stuck there almost 50 days.

I never got justice. I am in the process of trying to get a settlement or sue them. They've ignored me for 2 years. This fucked me up so bad i gained a ton of weight after this i was 230lbs....

5 years later and surprisingly i atill work at sea on ships. I hate it. But i have nothing else, no skills.

I live with my mom who has arthritus and my step dad. Basically cuz of my failure to launch n they know if i was by myself id be dead by now or broke and wasting my time. So im there alleviating their bills and biding my time...

I moved away for a few months with a friend i met in cooking school who i knew for 5 yeara. Turna out he was a big narcassist. We all drank and amoked dope in the house and did whatever always had a friend over 9r 0laying board games. One day he feela the need to quit drinking and smoking. But now he is holier than thou for doing ao
 So he tella me im not allowed to have a beer or a joint even outside because ita disrespectful to him who was trying to 'get better' he turned thia on me and loat hjs mind and got us all evicted by the landlord because i said what he was telling us was bullshit and he was a hypocrit aince it was fine one day and then not the next. Also, he had his gf over all the time and they fought. 

When he brought this ahit up, hr was celebrating her birthday. Except its 2 weeks after the fact and he had already done that. We all did. Now im not allowed upstairs in the house. To make noise have a friend over or smoke or drink 
... he betrayed me. He went batshit crazy on all of us. After i got home he messaged me saying he wanted to kill me. Ao i told his girlfriend he was cheating on her like a good ex best friend would. She hates him and he hates her. She tried to fuck me one night but i was too honorable. In hindsight i wish i did because she was really nice albeit broken mentally and extremly hot out of my league.

Anyway. That ended, i moved home, bringing 2 new kittena with me so now i have 4 cats. I love my cats.
Ash, Baby, Jax, and Ollie.

Was bullied in high school. The usual. Only had a mom til i was 16. My pop was a drunk who hated me and my mom. My uncle made fun of me as far back aa i can remember as a child. Were essentially eatranged from my moms family since they hate us. They hate mom for being broke and having a gambling problem a few yeara while i was in high school. We dont get invited to family things....

Back to the work thing. Ive dealt with good and bad people at this. And becauae of my first work experience i have no enthusiasm toward going to work. I dont talk about my personal life i dont add people to facebook. Im only there to do a job. I dont want friends who are these gruff and tough type people who dont understand emotion. Hardened by life at sea, they generally talk pretty lewd or angryily.

Last year i got stuck with a 25year excon-sexual assault, robbery, forgery, fraud, domestic violence, assault with a deadly weapon.  Had ties to hells angels blah blah blah the usual. He told me atories of how he held ppl at gunpoint. Robbed a young guy at a gas station and split his head open with a bat and got away with it. How he and some frienda abslducted a guy in his own house put a bag over his head and held a gun to his head beating him up for something that wasnt their business. I started getting scared of the guy. He was doing drugs at work. Coke, percocets, smoking weed, and drinking heavily. And messaging me until 4am when he passed out to go drugs with him.i got uncomfortable around him then he started messaging me and calling me everyday on our time off. Hes 30 years older than me... he didn't like me making up excuses not to hang. 

We go back for a 2nd trip. And hes showing a lot of aggressiona and anger toward the crwq. I left 3 days in becauae of it...fastforward 6 months to a new ship new company better job better pay...harassed and bullied relentleasly by a 35 year old who thought he was the best there was. Putting me do taunting me, throwing me under the buss qnd humiliating me verbally in front of the entire crew who all noticed. They told me to put in a complaint. I did. It backfired.

I am no longer able to work with him or on that boat since he has senority.  A month later he got fucking promoted and i have only 2 boats left in the company and way less chance for employment now...

Now im on the 3rd ship.... ive been battling since the harassment this xmas from this crap and have been thinking about suicide daily for 5 or 6 months. Even saying out loud. My life has spiraled out of control i dont tolerate anger, arguing, loud voices, taunting, bullying of any kind now. I cannot. 12 hours of being on the boat the cook ia yelling at me and arguing with me. Since apparently this boat is special and doesnt follow the sqme guidelines as the other 2. I cannot know to do something the right way unless i am told.
I did something wrong. Instead of telling me in a respectful manner. He yelled at me asking me retorical questions to make me feel stupid.  I kept liatening saying ok ok ok. He goes atop saying ok and staring like an idiot. Use your fucking head. 3 hours later i return from break 10 mins early. Except to him its 20 mins late. I tell him i know my job drscription and break times. He tella me im full of ahit im wrong, he says i domt give a fuck about the other 2 boata im the fucking boss. I say just becauae youre the boss doeant mean your right. He says were gonna have a problem arent we? I respond with yeah it started this morning. He had alao blamed me for a mess he made i had to play stupid to get him off my back. He yelled at me for a while over the brek thing also
 He said tomorrow youll be here at 2. I chimed in with '30'
He goes what did you say. WHAT DID YOU SAY?! I said 230. Thats when my break ends. He goes ballistic and i walk away with tears in my eyes. 

I then confirm with the captain and hr my job duties and break times. I was right. Fuck this guy. Except now i have knots in my stomach and im crying in front of the captain. 29 years old....the pattern of disrespect and bullying has led me to feel like everything is my fault. Like im to blame for everything...
Now im leaving on day 3 here of 35 turning down 10 thousand dollars because my options are put up with the bullshit and get fired for losing it at him. Or go home and lose out on money because of my intolerance for bullshit.

I know my chances will be gone then for fullyime which wouldve came around another 6-8months and id be making 114k before taxes a year with insane bonuses and benefits..

I have to go home to my parents whove grown used to me being a failure. Im making them miserable becauae im miserable. I cant get out of bed. I shower once a week maybe. Im having performance issues with the last 2 ladies i was lucky enough to drag off from the bar...

And now i might not get unemployment cuz im leaving. Though im trying to since i got the union involved over it because when i put in the formal complaint on the first ship with thia company the union rep saod contact me anytime if you get any bad feelinga or theres an emotional fallout or mental issues from the harassment. There was ever since i was home til now and now more crap...im praying i can get a layoff and not fired or quit on my ROE. I cant afford to be broke and itll take a while til i find a suitable job(less time, easier workload, hopefully solo, or in charge)....

When my mom dies ill be alone. If i kill myself i know she will too....

Tomorrow i go home. Im going straight to bed in the dark. I know i cant face them. Even if they know i left to prit3ct my mental health. But ill still be a failure.
