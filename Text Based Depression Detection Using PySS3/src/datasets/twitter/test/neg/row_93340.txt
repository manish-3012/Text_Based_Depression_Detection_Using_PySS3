I don't care how much of a future I have. I can't take anymore nights like this.My roommates are gone. I can do it. I've got the means and now, I'm drunk enough to actually go through with it. I'm a selfish waste of a human being. I push everyone who cares about me away. I broke my sweet girlfriend's heart because of the shallow, pessimistic piece of shit that I am.


And the thing is, I literally have no reason to kill myself. Yet I still want to. Ain't that something?
