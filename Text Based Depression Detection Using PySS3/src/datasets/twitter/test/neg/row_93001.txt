I donâ€™t think iâ€™m a very good personI always screw up. And I try to be better but I donâ€™t seem to be improving. This is dumb but I just donâ€™t like my personality. But at the same time, I donâ€™t know how to be any different. I just feel stuck. And I have no faith in myself. I just want to be wanted. I donâ€™t even know where this post is going tbh. Iâ€™ve almost given up for being a better student and person. Itâ€™s easier to just act dumb than try and fail.
