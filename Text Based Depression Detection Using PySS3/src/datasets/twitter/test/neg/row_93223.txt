Iâ€™ve fought so hard but Iâ€™m slowly losing the battleThis past year has been absolutely horrific. Lost a friend to cancer at the start of the year and since then everything that i have struggled with has become 10x worse. Iâ€™ve already survived one suicide attempt and had to fight myself to not go through with many other attempts. It feels like everyday Iâ€™m doing so much to keep me afloat but I know this canâ€™t be sustainable Iâ€™m just so tired . I really donâ€™t know what to do anymore Iâ€™ve fought so fkn hard this year but for all that work I find myself still in this same position. I think I may be done for good
