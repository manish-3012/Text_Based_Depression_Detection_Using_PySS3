I WANT TO DIE LIFE IS JUST SO POINTLESS ADVICE NEEDEDI'm tired. Tired of breathing every single day and knowing that I'm just a stupid and worthless failure that was only born by accident and of the fact that I'm still fucking alive. It is truly mind-blowing if you think about it. I always have an extremely low self esteem, and was neglected and bullied all my school life  (dropped out of school few months ago cuz I got tired of dealing with people and everything just feels pointless to me...and um it might be illegal here but I obviously don't care and thought I've always have the rights to drop out if I want to. I didn't have friends at school I could relate to and I wish to become a freelancer artist later in my life anyways if I survive). Deep down I know that I prolly deserve to be mistreated but I can't help but to pity myself and cry at all time like an idiot normally would (this isn't directed to anyone except myself pls dont get offended). I think I  might have mental issues but what if I'm just faking all of this? I dont know who to trust right now, and I need advice :,D I've tried talking to my mom before she just seems to think that it's all because of me overthinking all the time and she clearly has no idea what I'm going through and I have trouble expressing my thoughts cuz I dont know how she might react and I stutter a lot and often talk too softly when I'm anxious... she did tried to reassure me by telling me that I'm normal just like others (what does she even mean by "normal'?) and was only bullied &amp; neglected because I'm an introvert and also, for some reason whenever we get into some sorta conflict she always thinks that I'm faking all my emotions because they're so intense they almost seem fake (?) (I don't know it just doesn't make much sense to me (maybe I'm just too dumb I'm sorry :,D) If I were to be honest I just wish I was never born so I dont have to feel and to deal with these stupid feelings at the first place and my conclusion is that I'm better off dead even though I've zero clue about what's going to happen after I died. Sorry if my words confuse you cuz English isn't my first language.
