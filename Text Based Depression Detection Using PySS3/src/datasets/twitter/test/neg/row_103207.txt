I feel like I'm already deadI feel drained all the time. I've always had a hard time sleeping. The anti-depressants make me feel like Im a zombie with no emotions. I feel like I'm just riding around in my own head, watching everything that's happening but not really being there. Its so hard to just keep doing it day after day, week after week. I never thought this would happen to me and I'm not sure if I want to, or even if I'm strong enough to continue.
