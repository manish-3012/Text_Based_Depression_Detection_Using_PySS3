If I don't manage to pass this semester my last day will be May 15thI'm not even going to bother using a throwaway. This semester has been a rollercoaster, I was doing great in the beginning, missed a lot of class due to being sick but thought nothing of it if I were able to replace missed exam grades. I calculated my grade in lab today and I seem to have read the syllabus wrong, if I didn't submit a note 24 hours before an exam I get a zero for missing. I emailed my professor in a panic explaining I can have my doctor provide proof of doctors appointments and a letter explaining my situation around that time and that day. I hope emailing my professor will get me to pass the class. If I don't pass this semester, I'll have no choice but to kill myself. My mom and grandmother worked so hard to get me here and I blew it off being irresponsible with my condition. I'm hoping I pass because I don't want my life to end but there's no way I can be successful if my grades are this pitiful. I'm already on probation and the next step is getting kicked out if I don't raise my GPA. I hate myself and I hate that this week has come to this. I'm hoping my professors have a little heart and understand my situation. I don't want to die but I'll have no choice. I hate that I'll leave my friends behind but I've already been feeling so alone without having a special someone for me. I'll be sure to leave a note behind in my room including my internet friends so they don't think I totally abandoned them but there's no way I can continue life like this.
