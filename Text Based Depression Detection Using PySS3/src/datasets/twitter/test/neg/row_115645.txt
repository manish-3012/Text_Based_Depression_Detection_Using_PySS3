Heart palpitations. Can't cope.I don't know where to go or what to do. I've been having heart palpitations for years now but they're so bad now that I feel like killing myself is the only way out. I've been to several doctors and every one says it's completely fine and that I just need to learnt to live with them, but my anxiety is through the roof and I don't know where to turn.
