Sooner or later, I'm sure I'll do itThe world is an ugly place, and I certainly don't help. I am an ugly soul undeserving of life here.

I know, deep down, that I am gay. I hate myself for it and am in constant denial.  I am in a relationship with a beautiful, kind, and perfect woman who does not deserve this deception and ugliness. She is truly someone who deserves everything, and I am someone who deserves nothing.

I am a liar.

I have been abusing amphetamines, but have told no one of my drug use. I lie to my friends and family on a daily basis about this. I am a bad, bad person.

In the grand scheme of things, I am worthless. There is no meaning, there is no God, there is no purpose for my existence. The world would truly benefit if I was gone. So that's what I intend to do.

I know this may sound irrational, which is why I am posting it here. However, please understand I truly believe the things I am saying to be true.
