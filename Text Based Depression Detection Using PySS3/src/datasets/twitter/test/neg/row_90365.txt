Once more into the frayNot sure if this is the right place but here I go...

Iâ€™ve struggled with depression and suicidal ideation as long as I can remember, and I do mean as a kid all I can remember is how badly I wanted this to all end. My life has been rough and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever been â€œhappyâ€ my life consists of severe lows and just idle I guess. Iâ€™m a shitty son, I failed at being a brother and did a piss poor job as a boyfriend pushing away the only women that have ever cared about me. The only thing Iâ€™ve ever really been good at is failing. The guy who does everything twice or even three times because he just canâ€™t stop fuckin up. 

With all that being said Iâ€™ve managed to walk away with something that I hope will help someone/ anyone.

Itâ€™s about the fight everyday is a fight and as tired as I am I will continue to fight only because at some point the shit has to stop. I will see that day because Iâ€™ve earned it. 

The quote from The Grey it helps me when Iâ€™m drowning and I feel like thereâ€™s no way I can make it.
