Possibly going to make attempt #1727272 soonI don't know what to do. I don't want to go to a hospital, my whole life since the age of 14 has been nothing but fucking hospitals. Literally all I want in life anymore is to move to Rhode Island. That's it. But I doubt I can get another job because I've fucked up my resume really badly from constantly leaving jobs, and I'm only getting about $300 from SSI. I can't fucking take living with my dad anymore. Every single one of my days is the fucking same: Alternate between being in bed on Facebook and riding my bike. Maybe walking around that same damn mall sometimes. I have no hobbies, because I'm not good at anything. I don't even have the attention span to watch shows. This is my entire existence. My girlfriend is pissed at me because she's not making me feel better. I don't know what to fucking do anymore, and dying would be so nice compared to this hellish monotony. I could finally end this lifetime of endless suffering. I don't see amother way out.
