Told myself I wouldnt post, but fuck it...Man I dont know where to start, I just feel suffocated by my own life. Like I have all the things that I told myself I wanted: nice house, a wife, kids, family, dogs, a decent paying career, but I'm miserable as shit. Being a father was super important to me because my father was absent my whole life. I used to blame him, now I understand him. I love my kids but they annoy the shit out of me, which then makes me feel guilty because I can see in their eyes when I've disappointed them. My wife, I love her, but she completely ignores me sexually, and has become boring as hell. I've communicated specific things, she says she'll work on it, but ultimately never does. Again I feel shame and guilt about wanting to leave, because I'd never want my kids to feel abandoned like I did, but at the same time my family is the biggest source of my frustration. I'm unhappy with the way i look and feel.. i feel trapped. Last July I put the kids to bed, and sat locked in my room with a loaded shotgun and a bottle of opioids debating how to do it. I feel alone and ashamed for even thinking this way. I dont know if any of this has a point. But I'm just tired of holding it all in.
