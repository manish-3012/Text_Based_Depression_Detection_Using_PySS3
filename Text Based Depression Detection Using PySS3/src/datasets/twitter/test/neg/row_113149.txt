Every time I fight with my boyfriendI end up wanting to end my own life. I know itâ€™s me, my problem, not him. I feel that way because iâ€™ve failed and iâ€™m not loveable, I think. I call the hotline, they are really great. I talk to my dad now, but itâ€™s really hard on the relationship. 

Also, as iâ€™ve never been in such a serious relationship before, I do wonder how much of it is him. Does anybody else get this way? This is my number one trigger.
