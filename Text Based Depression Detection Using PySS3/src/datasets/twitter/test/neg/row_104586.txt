I just want to overdose but I'm too afraid of failing.I want to fucking die. I don't get it. I hate everything. I'm tired of being so unpredictable. I don't want to live. I'm going to do something bad soon if no one kills me. No I'm not, I'm too much of a bitch to do anything that will have any outcome. It's just me trying to make myself feel better and giving myself empty promises in the future.
