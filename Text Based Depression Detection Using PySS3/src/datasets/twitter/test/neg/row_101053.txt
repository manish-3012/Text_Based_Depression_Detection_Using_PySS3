No Reasons to LiveIâ€™ve realized I have no real reasons to live
No friends
No loved ones

I have a career plan, but what good will it do if I still have no social life

Iâ€™ve never really had reasons to live, I just became more and more self aware of what people got to do if they had friends 

I to live in a pretty rural countryside, and would travel one out to school each day. Pretty sure that kept me from devolving socially.

I didnâ€™t even know people would text each other and go to each others houses until freshman year of high school.



What reasons do you have to live? I donâ€™t want to die, I want reasons to live. But every day it seems harder to find any. Any response is appreciated
