It's funny how tiny things can make an entire life worthlessMy whole life seems OK, for the most part.

Normal family, good friends, hobbies that I was pretty good at (math, music, programming and IT), nice opportunities for education. I looked good, had no trouble finding a partner. Etc, etc.

But because I'm trans, it's all for nothing. I can't live as a guy, and I won't be a woman. I'm huge, deformed by male puberty, my bones are and will always be bones of a man. There are no women with shoulders this broad, ribcage this huge and hips this narrow. 

I've been on hormones for a long time and they haven't changed a thing. 

I just can't describe how much pain seeing my body and my face brings me. At this point, suicide seems like a reasonable option if it makes the pain go away.
