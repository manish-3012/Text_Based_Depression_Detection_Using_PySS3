(Unrequited love) I feel like such a fucked creature\*\*venting\*\*

Any attempt I have made towards finding a relationship has lead to nothing. I can recall three girls I really cared about and all three was a simple rejection and a constant feeling of not being worth love. This last one I had in particular really fucked me up, I made my attempt to try to stay in contact with and realized that even as a person I was worth nothing to her. I stopped trying to be in touch, I got excited when having the opportunity and it became clear to me that it just seemed to annoy her. The annoyance hurt the most, it just made me feel like I'm the typical 'nice guy / incel' that just needs to fuck off, sub-human. It's been about 2 years since then and it still hurts today. I'm stuck in time, unable to move on. She's someone I still care about and think about a lot, and she's forgotten I exist.

I don't know how to handle it other than feel ashamed for what I am. I'm alone and probably deserve to be.
