I need some advice.I've been friends with this person online for years. We were close friends, but around 2016 things went downhill. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and my relationships with my friends (online and in real life) were shaky.

But yeah. That online friend has depression and anxiety as well. Since the beginning of this year we've drifted apart. At first I was faintly alarmed but before I knew it I was feeling depressed over it. I was scared they were going to leave me and eventually, we stopped chatting. I'll admit, I grew angry at points and jealous. When I saw them talking to other people online I wondered if I was just a bad friend or I wasn't good enough. I felt extremely guilty for being jealous. It was selfish of me.

My friend has grown more suicidal and is self-harming. They won't reply to me anymore. (They say they feel too guilty to talk to me.) I've had breakdowns over it because I am so worried about them. I've tried everything I've could but nothing is happening. I feel like I've failed them. I'm so worried they're going to take their life and I will have failed them. I don't know what to do anymore.
