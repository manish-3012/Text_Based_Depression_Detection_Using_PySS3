Almost OverEarly Monday is the end. I'm sorry I have to do it while you're at work Jamie. You work so hard and your work is so challenging. I can't keep living. At this point there isn't any choice. I've lost my dream job, we lost that apartment, we've been struggling. I hope we meet in another life and that our relationship is easier. I know you will struggle. If you see this I always loved you. I didnt want to hurt you, it was just too hard to think of any kind of a future. I wish I would have been better for you. I hope your life can get back on the right path. I dont want you to hurt but I know I've caused most your pain. I'll always love you.
