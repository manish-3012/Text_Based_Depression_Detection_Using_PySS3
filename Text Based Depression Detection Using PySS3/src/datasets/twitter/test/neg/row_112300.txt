Thinking about ending it, need someone to talk toHi, I'm a younug guy. 21 years old and in school. I'm alone right now. 

I need help. I'm bulimic and have a lot of issues about my weight. It started when I was young. I was 13 when I started to get chubby. I wanted a girlfriend so bad and both of my brothers had girlfriends as well. I was sure it was because of my weight, but I was young and didn't know I just needed to wait till I got older.

Then it happened, I was 15 and I met a girl. No big deal, I eventually got over her. I screwed around a bit after that. Then I met her.

I was 17 and she was too. She seemed to like me a lot but I wasn't too sure. We got physical too quick and I only stayed because I felt bad about that. Over time we started to get along great. Then one day, I broke up with her and went to my ex. I was young and dumb, and after 2 days I realized what I had done was stupid. I asked for her back and she said yes. We were together after that for a long time. I fell in love with her and she looked me in the eye and told me I was the man she wanted to marry. I felt so understood. Then college came, it was rough. My dog died, my mom was involved in an affair and it tore my family apart and I turned to smoking and bulimia. During this time, my fellow classmates in a certain branch of ROTC began bullying me. They made fun of me for all sorts of reasons and at one point it turned to physical abuse. I switched colleges at the end of the year to be with her. I realize I drained her in the process of all of the stuff going on in my life. Then at the end of the year, she called me and said she cheated on me. I didn't want her to go but she did. The following summer she got with her coworker immediately after we broke up, and called me drunk at night a few times. Then we would meet and talk. We sat in my car and kissed and cried. She came over and we had sex once, I'd see her at school a few times but I felt like a crazy man trying to get her back. At this point I began smoking cigarettes a lot, smoking weed and overall just trying to escape. I'm overwhelmed with my degree and I can't change out of it. I deleted my facebook and I don't talk to her anymore. For some reason I  got on craigslist and saw a woman4woman post that described her perfectly. I'm freaking out that she might be a lesbian now, I know it's paranoia. 

Please, I need help
