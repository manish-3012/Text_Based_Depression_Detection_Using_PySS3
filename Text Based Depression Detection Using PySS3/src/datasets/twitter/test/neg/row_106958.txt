I just need someone to talk to....I've been depressed for 2years and a half. I haven't been genuinely happy in over 3 years. 
This started when my grandfather died 3 years and 2 months ago. Since then I haven't been able to feel completely good about myself. 
The depression became twice as worse over Christmas when I found out the one I love hates me. I tried to find someone to talk to and they turned against me. They sent out screenshots of messages between me and them. They sent out the messages I sent to the one I love to people and laughed at me. This has happened recently.
I've been a victim to bullying for the past 3-4 years. 
My father is an alcoholic who is also divorced from my mother due to his drinking problem.
My mother is impossible to live with. She has noticed my depression and only seems to make it worse.
My grades in school have dropped really low and I have no real friends.
Suicide seems to be the only way out. 
The thoughts of suicide began 2 months ago and everyday I only get pushed closer to the edge.
