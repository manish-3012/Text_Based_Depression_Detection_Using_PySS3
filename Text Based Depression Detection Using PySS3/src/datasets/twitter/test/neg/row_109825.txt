Now she's blackmailing me with food. Can't do this anymore.My mother's latest plan of getting me out of her life, and the house, is by insisting that I'm going to this women's college in September where you live Monday-Friday. I'm not. And no, this is not because she 'cares'. She literally just wants me gone. I have been waiting 6 months for my disability benefit to get sorted and have had no money since. I've been helped by the wonderful people at /r/assistance a few times and they have enabled me to eat. But I don't want to ask again. I know how it must look, me asking for handouts yet again. So I had no option this morning but to leave a note asking my mother if I could borrow some money to get groceries since I have to feed myself. She left me a note with about 10 conditions on it, including that I have to go and look at the college I AM going to in September. I'd rather starve. I have mental health issues that are mostly caused by her. Borderline Personality Disorder, Anxiety Disorder and chronic depression. Oh, and I'm slipping further and further into dissociation. I'm now blacking out and losing chunks of time. I want to die so much. But I have this beautiful almost 6-year-old niece whom I am very, very close with. I know that killing myself would mess her up. I can't do it to her. But I can't go on either. I barely leave the house due to anxiety. Weeks go by in which I don't leave the house or see anyone. My family treat me like a piece of shit. I'm being blackmailed just to be able to eat. My entire day revolves around trying not to slip into dysphoria. Nobody will help me because I have a prescription painkiller addiction. My psychiatrist literally discharged me from the NHS service because of it. He won't let me have therapy until I quit the painkillers. But I can't quit the painkillers until I have a reason to not need them. Right now they are the ONLY thing that makes the pain stop, and that's only the case for maybe a half hour. I just can't do this anymore. I'm worthless and there is nothing I can offer to this world. I think my niece would be better off without me, but I can't get around the fact that it would screw her up. She is my world and I don't want to do that to her. But I don't want to do this either. I feel like I'm being suffocated and punched in the face over and over. My anger is out of control and I worry that as my mental health declines, I'm going to do something to my mother. I hate her so much. No, there is nothing good that can come out of going to this college. It's not even real college. It's pointless. I just want to slit my own throat.
