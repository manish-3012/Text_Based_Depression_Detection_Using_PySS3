the beginning of the endI guess I should start working on a suicide note... would one page be enough to fit everything thatâ€™s going through my mind?  Is it worth it to leave something behind, who knows how my words will be interpreted. I wanted to kill myself before my birthday but Iâ€™ve failed again. Iâ€™ll be 20 on Thursday and that marks the beginning of my last year alive. I just want to be alone on that day and everyday after it. I donâ€™t want to see anyone I know anymore, itâ€™s become so difficult to mask my pain.
