I need help. (wall of text incoming)All i do all day is sit on my ass eating, gaming, and watching tv. i was forced to quit my job last month, which was great and terrifying. I was becoming so stressed from the work that i had transformed my life around recovery from work. My GF said that i had nightmares where i shook her awake saying "you need to take care of the customer (i was a McDonalds manager)."

only a few days after i quit, i got into a fight with my girlfriend over something that was stupid, i dont remember anymore. all i remember is i got so angry i assaulted her, pushed her around and nearly choked her. she left our apartment, and 2 weeks ago she officially dumped me.

last time i weighed myself was 6 months ago, and i weighed in close to 175 pounds, and that was when i fit into my pants. i cant even squeeze into them anymore.

I cant go back to any sort of Fast Food business, not with my mental state, and i havent had any other sort of job experience.

I've got no job prospects, I've lost GF, im going to lose the apartment no matter what i do, I've lost all motivation to be something of myself. i dont know what to do or where to go.

My parents a year ago said that if i moved in with my GF, that i couldnt come back to them if something happened, since this happened once before.

worst part is i've rewritten this twice, trying to justify myself to get help. i feel like a nobody whose never going to amount to anything and ive reached the logical conclusion of my life, because theres nothing for me to accomplish.
