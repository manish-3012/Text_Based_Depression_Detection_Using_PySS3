I'm 20, but I lost it allThese 2 months have been a disaster for me. I lost 2k on gambling , went in debt ( I barelly make 400 monthly ), I'm losing my friends and I lost my girlfriend 2 days ago. I love her with all my heart, I can't live without her, but i lost her because of my jealously and stupidity. I don't know what to do. I'm sitting, crying, wishing I could be with her and I can't stop thinkiing about all my debts now
