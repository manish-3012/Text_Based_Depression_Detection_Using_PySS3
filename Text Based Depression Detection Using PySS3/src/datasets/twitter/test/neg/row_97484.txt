I feel like I'm drifting awayI'm drifting away from myself. My friends, my interests, everything. All I do now is grovel in self pity and sleep whenever I can find it. I'm so exhausted and I don't want to be a burden on anyone but I'm not trying to jump back into my life, I'm only slipping away more.
I know where this path of alienation lead and I don't know if I'll be able to get off in time.
