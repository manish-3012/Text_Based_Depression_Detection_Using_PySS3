I will be done soon.It doesn't matter who I try to talk to, or where I go to talk, no one ever listens, and no one ever cares. Another friend abandoned me without saying as much as a word. I lose friends all the time, so this shouldn't come as a big surprise. I was starting to make a new friend, and we were connecting well. Now people are telling lies about me, that I lie and use people and hurt them, but none of it is true!! Now he acts like he hates me. Everyone ends up hating me, and now that I am completely alone, I know it is almost time to go. Nothing I do ever works out right. I fail at everything I try. I am just so done with it all.
