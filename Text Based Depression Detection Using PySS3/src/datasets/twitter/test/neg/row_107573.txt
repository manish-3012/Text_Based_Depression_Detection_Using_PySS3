PainlessMy life sucks. I have had a lot of failures in my life and just this year I decided to change everything. Everything went well. I was so happy and things got better for a while. Things went downhill just last week. I need to make a life changing decision, but either will lead to failure. I'm not just saying that cause I'm negative right now. It's the truth. I'm not sure if I can finish college, I'm not rich, I'm not smart, my situation with my family sucks, and seeing everyone around me move forward just makes me feel more worthless. My life will not get better. Seriously. If only suicide wasn't so painful, I'd do it within a minute.
