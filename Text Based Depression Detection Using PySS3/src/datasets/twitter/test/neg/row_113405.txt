Asking for help was the hardest thing I've ever done. Psych ward questions.Basically,  I'm Chronically ill, my life hasn't gone as planned,  and my meds aren't right. I've tried them all except MAOI which I cannot at this time afford to be on because I have EDNOS. 

I've had 2 nervous breakdowns in the past two weeks.  

Today shit hit the fan after being told over and over to kill myself on social media,  and it doesn't bother me,  what other people think,  because that's asinine to tell anybody,  but it reinforced that I have a problem that I've been too afraid to address. 

I talked to my best friend,  who,  I've saved his life.  I love him so much, but only in a platonic way,  which is the most painful type of love for both parties.  

He's my brother from another mother, and as much as I love him,  it's too odd to think about being with him,  because I'm not sexually attracted to him,  anyway this is off topic.  

So I spoke to him,  and he urged me to seek help.  

So I told my boyfriend,  who I was desparately afraid to tell. 

This Monday,  I'm calling my doctor,  and I will be in the psych ward if things go okay money wise. 

I'm glad I tasked to my bff, and that my bf is going to talk with my dad.

I love you Alex,  you are my brother. You are my best friend.  You are the reason I'm alive today,  just as I'm the reason you're alI've today. 

I'm afraid beyond my wildest dreams to go,  but I had to take an extra klonopin because I needed to be able to talk .

I'm really unable to concentrate,  but I'm not suicidal as of right now.

What are psych wards like.

I'm pasing out now.  Goodnught.
