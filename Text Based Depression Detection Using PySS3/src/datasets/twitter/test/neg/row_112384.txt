I am qualified for awesome jobs, but am unemployable because of a felony 5 years ago.  My life was not supposed to be this way.  I don't know what to do.Help.  

I'm an engineering student in a PhD program.  I am a certified commercial airplane pilot.  I am qualified for amazing jobs that pay well.  When I interview I impress people and am the first candidate they choose.  Everything is always great up until the background check.  It never fails

I'm up front about it and let them know that I have a felony on my record, but every time, HR turns me down or says the company has a policy against hiring felons, especially because it involved a gun and the police, (I didn't shoot anyone or try to).  I don't know what to do.  I feel trapped.  I don't want to try killing myself again.  I cut the veins in my arms when this all happened and had to get about 375 stitches.  

I don't want to live like this. This is going to be on my record and searchable for the rest of my life.  Until the day I die.  It doesn't go away.  I can run a small business but don't know of anything that would pay more than a few thousand dollars a year. 

My life wasn't supposed to turn out like this.  I know I sound like a weirdo, but I'm seriously not.  My life has been normal and good for everything but 6 weeks out of my life, and now it's going to haunt me till my death.  I just don't know what to do and want to vent.  This isn't justice.  This isn't right. 

Pics of the stitches or anything else if you don't believe me.
