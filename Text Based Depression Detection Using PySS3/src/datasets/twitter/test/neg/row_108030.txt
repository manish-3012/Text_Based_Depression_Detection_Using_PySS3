I've had enough with life.I honestly don't see the point in life anymore. I got out of the military last year after four years and a deployment to Afghanistan. I kept thinking life would be so much better once I was out, but the truth was far worse. My friends don't hang out with me anymore, I'm fucking up in school, I'm tired and frustrated all the time, and I think my friendship with the woman I truly care about and love to death is over after a night of drunken sex. I honestly think that was the straw that broke the camel's back. She was the only person who would hang out with me and I love her so fucking much, but I know she doesn't see me the same way. We got drunk Friday evening and while I was asleep she started fondling me which initiated the sex. I know it's basically sexual assault but I love her too much and I know her intents weren't malicious. Now she's guilt-tripping me and she won't even speak to me anymore. I just want to know she's okay. I'm afraid of what'll happen if our friendship is really over. If she leaves, that's it. I've got no one. I'm not close to my family at all and I'm not even sure if I actually love them anymore. My crippling depression keeps me up at night and tired throughout the day. If my depression doesn't let me sleep, then it's my ptsd. I attempted suicide three times while I was in the military, the first time in Afghanistan. I had a nightmare about it again last night and it's just crushing me on top of everything else. I woke up covered in sweat and I kept feeling the back of my head for an exit wound. I couldn't stand it so I just laid in my bed, crying until my alarm went off for class. I seriously can't take much more of this. My loneliness is killing me faster than I can do anything about it. I'm resorting to alcohol again as an escape but I fear becoming an alcoholic again. I just want this pain and despair to go away so badly. I'm not sure how long I can last this time, since it's so severe. More and more I feel like buying a gun and finishing what I started in Afghanistan.
