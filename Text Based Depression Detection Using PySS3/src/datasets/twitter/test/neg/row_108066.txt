Iâ€™m loosing the fightI have made mistakes that I cannot seem to move past. they are always with me, I made them, I cannot unmake them, I cannot forget them, I cannot make them right. I just want to start again, I feel like I could salvage this life if I could go back and avoid those mistakes. How can I feel bad for myself if I hurt others? I didnâ€™t mean to I swear, did I really hurt them? I donâ€™t know. I wish I could forgive myself. I donâ€™t want kill myself, I just feel like I have to. Its so persistent, it calls me all the time, and itâ€™s getting louder. I feel almost sure that Iâ€™ll be gone by the end of the decade. Iâ€™ll probably just look at this in a couple days and cringe, not feeling the same way anymore, but a little bit of that future me will no Iâ€™ll be back here again. I always come back. Iâ€™m tired, goodnight.
