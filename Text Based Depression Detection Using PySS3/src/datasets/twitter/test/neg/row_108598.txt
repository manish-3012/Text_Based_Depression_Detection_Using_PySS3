I can't live in this world, ok? It's too much. It's too bad and too evil and I can't handle it anymore.There's so, *so* much more evil in the world than good. Almost everyone is just apathetic about all the suffering in the world, or people actively contribute to it. People harass, hate and kill each other for no reason. People get killed by natural disasters and most people don't give a shit at all. They just think "whatever, better them than me" and move on with their lives. Homeless people die in the streets and people think they're asleep and step over them after they were already ignored their whole lives. 


People out there do good but they could never keep up with the evil and suffering that goes on. Destroying things is way easier than fixing them, so the people killing and destroying will always be ahead. And as the world population grows this will only get worse and worse.



People are evil or apathetic and they don't care that people around them are dying and suffering as long as it isn't them. People only care about their own money, feelings, goals etc. The minority of people who dedicate their time to helping people can never do enough no matter how great they are. 


I went to the 9/11 memorial about a year ago and it just shocked me how little people were affected. They just nonchalantly walked through like it was an art gallery. No emotion. We're numb to pain, we're numb to suffering, death, whatever. It's completely normal and I can't live in that anymore.
