Hating my family members eventually leading to suicidal thoughtsI'll start by saying this, that my family hates me and isolates me from them, they only talk to me when its necessary, or sometimes even not at all. I really hate them till the point where once I almost wanted to kill them, except it was all a thought in my head. I thought if I killed myself at least they would suffer the pain of losing a child, i keep thinking it every night, every time I close my eyes. Suicide is the only option for me.
