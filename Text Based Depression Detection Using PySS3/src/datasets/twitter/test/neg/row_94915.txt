I like to prepare myself for the futureRight now I have had no serious thoughts about suicide. I doubt I will have serious thoughts in the close future either. But I have the fear of aging and death almost every day. I am scared of the day when I am beyond any chances to make my life or myself better, best and good days all behind. Living in a regret and 'what if' thoughts till fading away in some hospital bed, pissing and shitting in my pants.  
Fuck no, I do not want to live that long. I want to prepare myself with the thoughts of myself ending my life on my terms, the way I want to go, in the place that I want to be in. I am so incredibly afraid of that life and the end that I cannot live today. Is it so fucking wrong to have these thoughts? It gives me actual comfort to know that I have a way out, if everything turns out to be worse.
