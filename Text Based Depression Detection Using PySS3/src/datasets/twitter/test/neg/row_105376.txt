i need somebody.Iâ€™m just tired of being alone. everybody says things get better... but do they really think so? Or is that just a common lie told by people so it looks like they tried to help you? reality sets in often. nothing ever really gets better. things get worse. you become even more alone, people stop checking on you, stop hanging out with you. i find peace and comfort within these dark walls.
