I can't fucking believe I pussied outAfter about 40 days of pure pain I decided I was going to kill myself. This was about two weeks ago. I can't believe I pussied out. I want to die so bad. Why couldn't I fucking do it? I don't have anything or anyone to live for. I just drift threw life. Nothing interests me. I get maybe half an hour of sleep a night from the pain. I just honestly can't fucking believe myself. I think I actually will this weekend. I just can't believe I didn't earlier.
